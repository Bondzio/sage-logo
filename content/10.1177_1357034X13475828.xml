<abstract>
<p>This article investigates the place that habit occupies in different ‘architectures of the person’, focusing particularly on constructions of the relations between habit and other components of personhood that are marked by time. Three such positions are examined: first, the relations between thought, will, memory, habit and instinct proposed by post-Darwinian accounts of ‘organic memory’; second, Henri Bergson’s account of the relations between habit, memory and becoming; and, third, the temporal aspects of Pierre Bourdieu’s concept of habitus understood as a set of hereditable dispositions. These different ‘architectures of the person’ are considered with regard to the role they accord habit in trans-generational mechanisms of inheritance; the historicised forms of embodied personhood that they propose; and the manner in which they account for the emergence of a capacity for freedom that can (partially) offset the weight of the inherited past. It is argued that the imputation of such a capacity to some forms of personhood, but not others, is both shaped by and provides the conditions for the operation of liberal forms of government. The manner in which the conduct of those who exhibit such a capacity for freedom is brought under the direction of varied ‘authorities of freedom’ is given particular consideration.</p>

<body>
<p>In his <italic>Human Nature and Conduct</italic>, John Dewey takes issue with earlier liberal accounts of habit for treating habit as essentially conservative rather than seeing it as so only when it is subjected to custom. The conception of habit as ‘merely the power to repeat acts without thought’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1357034X13475828">Dewey, 2002[1922]</xref>: 66) means that where habit is accorded an undue sway over conduct there is no space within the person in which thought can be exercised. This gives rise to a distinction within the body politic between those who combine thought and habit and are therefore able to reflexively monitor their own conduct, and those who, subject entirely to the regimes of habit, are to be governed through mechanisms which reinforce its rigours of unreflective repetition. Those who practise ‘thought for their own special ends’, Dewey concludes, ‘deprecate it for the untrained and unstable masses for whom “habits,” that is unthinking routines, are necessities’ thus ‘converting an original docility into a docility to repeat and conform’ (2002[1922]: 69–70).</p>
<p>The questions Dewey opens up here concern the role that accounts of habit have played in differentiating populations according to the degree to which their capacities qualify them for inclusion in liberal forms of governance.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1357034X13475828">1</xref>
</sup> The dividing lines such accounts have produced have been variably organised in terms of occupation, class, gender, age and race, as well as running through the relations between coloniser and colonised. Whatever its social articulations, however, the degree to which conduct is governed by automatic forms of repetition or, to the contrary, is brought under the control of self-reflexive forms of thought, marks a division within the body politic. It distinguishes those who are able to govern others because they are able to govern themselves. And it distinguishes those who are able to take part in the deliberative processes of liberal polities free from any compulsion – including that exerted by the force of habit – from those who, lacking these capacities, are disqualified from full political participation until such time as they acquire them.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1357034X13475828">2</xref>
</sup> The issues that are flagged by Dewey’s concern with these aspects of the relations between habit and liberalism have recently become a focus for pointed attention in the post-Foucauldian literature on liberal forms of government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1357034X13475828">Joyce, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1357034X13475828">Mehta, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1357034X13475828">Valverde, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1357034X13475828">White, 2005</xref>). Perhaps the most distinctive feature of Foucault’s account of liberalism is his contention that it constitutes a form of government which, far from taking freedom as a given or as government’s opposite, has constantly to make up freedoms of various kinds to provide the capacities and mechanisms which liberal forms of rule depend on for their exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1357034X13475828">Foucault, 2008</xref>: 62–70). In perpetually making up and consuming freedoms – freedoms of thought, action and movement – liberal government simultaneously distributes such freedoms unequally. Their denial to some sections of the population constitutes the condition for their exercise by others. Habit has thus provided a productive point of entry into the ways in which a capacity for freedom has been differentially distributed, not just at the level of political thought but in the operations of practical technologies of government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1357034X13475828">Valverde, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>While taking these concerns as my point of departure, my purpose is to refine and qualify them by examining a more variable set of relations between habit and liberal government than is allowed for by a good deal of the post-Foucauldian literature on habit. What I take from Dewey is the significance he attributes to the relative weight that is accorded habit in the make-up of persons in affording, or denying, a space within which a capacity for (relatively) free forms of self-shaping can emerge and be developed. I shall, though, argue that the role that habit plays in these regards varies in accordance with the position it occupies within different ‘architectures of the person’: that is, the division of the person into varied parts, the manner in which the relations between these are conceived, and the forms of action they are said to exert on one another.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1357034X13475828">3</xref>
</sup> How habit operates within such architectures of the person depends crucially on how it is aligned with, or differentiated from, other forces shaping conduct within embodied conceptions of personhood: reflex, instinct, custom, tradition, memory and will, for example. The manner in which these different components of personhood are said to interact with one another also determines where the kind of space that Dewey refers to as the space between thought and action is located, and how it is organised in terms of the capacity for different kinds and degrees of freedom that it produces. This in turn determines how such a locus within the person is constituted as a point of intervention into the conduct of conduct; a point, that is, to which the techniques and technologies of liberal government are to be applied in supporting autonomous forms of self-governance or withheld in favour of more coercive forms of rule which merely reinforce mechanical forms of repetition.</p>
<p>I pursue these questions by considering the relations between habit, time, freedom and governance in three accounts which, albeit in different ways, are concerned with the relations between different inheritances in the embodied dynamics of personhood. I look first at the relations between habit, memory and repetition associated with evolutionary architectures of personhood developed in the slipstream of Herbert Spencer’s concept of ‘organic memory’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1357034X13475828">Otis, 1994</xref>). In doing so I show how these contributed to an interpretation of ‘the primitive’ which rested on a distinctive articulation of the relations between habit and instinct that had significant consequences for changing conceptions of colonial government. I focus key aspects of my account here on the work of Théodole <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1357034X13475828">Ribot (1891</xref>, 1997 [1882]). Although now a relatively obscure figure, Ribot occupied a pivotal position in bringing the organic memory tradition, as well as contemporary findings in the fields of experimental neurophysiology and clinical neurology, to bear on the manner in which the relations between the physical and natural sciences and social and political questions were posed during the Third Republic.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1357034X13475828">4</xref>
</sup> My interest in Ribot focuses on his account of the will as an ‘inhibitive power’ which, by virtue of its ability to stall the operation of purely neurophysiological processes, produced that delay in action which, in allowing freedom and consciousness a role in the shaping of conduct, was the hallmark of the rational man.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1357034X13475828">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>I look next at Henri Bergson’s account of the relations between habit and memory as components of an open-ended, non-teleological and limitless process of becoming. Bergson’s work has enjoyed a considerable revival of interest in the wake of Gilles Deleuze’s account of the role of different forms of memory in the relations between repetition and difference which inform processes of becoming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1357034X13475828">Deleuze, 2004</xref>). My primary concern, however, will be to identify the respects in which his work drew on, while also taking issue with, the evolutionary conceptions of the person proposed within the organic memory tradition. I look here at the respects in which Bergson’s construal of the relations between habit-memory and memory proper was shaped in critical dialogue with Ribot’s work, resulting in a similar differentiation of the primitive from rational man in terms of the former’s lack of the inhibitive power of delay.</p>
<p>My third point of engagement will concern the distinctive form of the temporalisation of the person that informs Pierre Bourdieu’s account of the relations between history and habitus, and the articulation of the relations between time, freedom and governance that this effects. Bourdieu’s concept of habitus has now been critically probed from so many quarters that it looks likely to prove the least enduring aspect of his legacy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1357034X13475828">6</xref>
</sup> My concern here, however, is not to assess its utility from the perspective of a dispositional sociology. I want rather to tilt the angle from which it is most usually viewed by considering how Bourdieu’s interpretation of the habitus as the site of a socio-somatic inheritance, and his account of the conditions under which a degree of freedom can be exercised in relation to such an inheritance, constituted the route through which the sociologist acts as an agent of liberal government in the direction he seeks to give to the conduct of conduct.</p>
<sec id="section1-1357034X13475828">
<title>Habit and the Interval</title>
<p>Let me go back to Dewey for a moment. His criticisms are directed mainly against the opposition between habit, interpreted as unthinking repetition, and the exercise of the will when brought under the direction of reason. It is the implication that habit can only be changed when brought under the control of the will as a force that is entirely opposed to and independent of it that most exercises his attention.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1357034X13475828">7</xref>
</sup> Dewey’s implicit target here is Mill, whose concept of character, as the mechanism through which habit is brought under the direction of the will, played a crucial role in late 19th-century Anglophone political thought. Looking beyond Mill, though, it is Kant who provides the deep backdrop to the dualisms Dewey opposes. Towards the end of <italic>Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View</italic>, Kant summarises his conception of the distinctiveness of human agency as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>The human being is destined by his reason to live in a society with human beings and in it to <italic>cultivate</italic> himself, to <italic>civilise</italic> himself, and to <italic>moralise</italic> himself by means of the arts and sciences. No matter how great his animal tendency may be to give himself over <italic>passively</italic> to the impulses of comfort and good living, which he calls happiness, he is still destined to make himself worthy of humanity by <italic>actively</italic> struggling with the obstacles that cling to him because of the crudity of his nature. (Kant, 2006 [1798]: 229–30)</p>
</disp-quote> Chief among these obstacles, Kant argues, is the force of habit which Kant interprets as an instinctive inclination to repetition which, as something man shares with animals, represents the nature within that he must overcome.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1357034X13475828">8</xref>
</sup> Habit/thought, the animal/the human, nature/culture – these are the operative dualities within which Kant’s concept of habit is located and with which Dewey takes issue.</p>
<p>Yet such conceptions of habit had been significantly challenged by the time Dewey was writing (1922) in the light of subsequent developments in the biological and life sciences. These Kantian dualities were called into question by Darwin’s careful observations of the habits of worms which, he argued, far from being purely reflex, instinctual or innate showed signs of intelligence, taste and sexual preferences, as well as the ability to learn from experience and to modify behaviour accordingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1357034X13475828">Darwin, 1881</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1357034X13475828">9</xref>
</sup> The post-Darwinian development of evolutionary thought also led to a significant reconceptualisation of the relations between the body, culture and society in liberal social and political theory. Plunged into and marked by the newly discovered pasts of evolutionary deep time, the body was constituted as the locus through which biological, social and cultural mechanisms of inheritance interacted, with habit cast in the role of a ‘hinge’ connecting past and present, animal and human, nature and culture, instinct and volition. Habit thus played a key role in what Stefan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1357034X13475828">Collini (1979</xref>) calls the ‘historicisation of character’ through which Mill’s concept of character was revised in the light of the new historical horizons opened up by evolutionary geology and biology. As a consequence, questions of evolutionary time became central to the place that habit occupied relative to instinct, memory, consciousness and volition, and central too to the role that habit played in the differential social distribution of the capacity for freedom: that is, for volitional action shaped by reflection.</p>
<p>The impress of this legacy is, indeed, clear in Dewey’s own conception of the dialectical relations between habit and will in which, disputing the equation of habit with routine, Dewey interprets habits as positive, organising capacities that are themselves the expression – or, better, the performance – of will. ‘In any intelligible sense of the word will,’ he says, ‘they [habits] <italic>are</italic> will’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1357034X13475828">Dewey, 2002</xref> [1922]: 25). Shaped by this dialectic, Dewey argues, ‘habits are links in forming the endless chain of humanity’ (2002 [1922]: 21). These formulations drew on the conception of habit that had earlier been developed in the ‘organic memory’ tradition, so named after Herbert Spencer’s conception of memory as part of a process of inheritance that was inscribed in the body. Pitched explicitly against Kant’s transcendental account of the faculties, Spencer’s <italic>Principles of Psychology</italic> (1996 [1855]) interprets their differentiation as the outcome of an evolutionary process, grounded in the relations between the body and its environment, in which habit mediates the relations between inherited and acquired competences. It is the mechanism through which the latter are coded into the body as hereditable instincts transmitted to the next generation as part of a historically accumulating set of aptitudes. The will is the final outcome of this process – a process which operates across the relations between natural, social and cultural evolution – emerging at a point when the complexity that results from the accumulation of inheritances stalls the force of the automatic mechanisms of habitual repetition. This produces an indeterminacy of action within an architecture of the person governed by the relations between inherited motor mechanisms and the will, interpreted as an ideal motor mechanism which, if exerted at such moments of stalled action, becomes actual:
<disp-quote>
<p>When, as a result of the organisation of accumulating experiences, the automatic actions become so involved, so varied in kind, and severally so infrequent, as no longer to be performed with unhesitating precision – when, after the reception of one of the more complex impressions, the appropriate motor changes become nascent, but are prevented from passing into immediate action by the antagonism of certain other nascent motor changes appropriate to some nearly allied impression; there is constituted a state of consciousness which, when it finally issues in action, exhibits what we term volition. Under such conditions, there occurs a conflict between two sets of nascent motor changes; one of which ultimately prevails and passes into a set of actual motor changes…. [A]nd this passing of an ideal motor change into a real one, is that which we distinguish as Will. (Spencer, 1996 [1855]: 613)</p>
</disp-quote> What is key here, Roger Smith argues (1992: 149), is that such antagonistic relations between different sources of action are only possible once a certain level of complexity within the inner architecture of the person has been attained. It is only this accumulating complexity which makes possible that delay of action through which the force of purely instinctual nervous motor mechanisms is brought under the regulative direction of reason. Ribot draws on these aspects of Spencer’s work in interpreting habit as a key mechanism in the evolution of the will. Ribot presents this account as a corrective to the science of character – or ethology – that Mill had proposed in his <italic>System of Logic</italic>. Mill argues that the key to the formation of a man’s character depends on the degree to which habits are his masters or he a master of his habits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1357034X13475828">Mill, 1967[1843]</xref>: 550–1). The possession of character implies a set of dispositions that has been brought under the control of the will as the mechanism that both breaks old habits and installs new ones in their place, and which is itself interpreted as a habit – the habit of willing – that needs to be cultivated through repeated exercise.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1357034X13475828">10</xref>
</sup> Ribot’s contribution to this project of a science of character is to bring it under the influence of the biological sciences and, thereby, to subject it to a distinctive form of historicisation by interpreting the will as, like Spencer, ‘the crown, the last term of an evolution’ (Ribot, 1997: 54). It is ‘an edifice constructed slowly, piece by piece’ as past cycles of conscious innovation produced by motive activity under the direction of the will are perfected by habit to build, through the mechanisms of use inheritance, new layers of coordinated activity and capacity on top of a base level of primitive automatic activity. The will thus ‘plunges its roots into the profoundest depths of the individual and, beyond the individual, into the species, and into all species. It does not come from above, but from below; it is a sublimation of inferior elements’ (1997: 114).</p>
<p>We can see more clearly the architecture of the person that this conception of the will is party to, and its implications for practices of governance, in Ribot’s application of these relations between will, habit and instinct to the make-up of the individual. Here, these processes take as their raw material the child understood as ‘a mere spinal being’, a profusion of purely reflex movements which ‘express only the activity of the species, what has been acquired, organised and fixed by heredity’ (1997: 4). This stock of reflexes constitutes ‘the materials out of which the will is to be built up’ (1997: 4). But this is only possible provided that a space is opened up within the person in which this set of automated responses is brought under the influence of an alternative force, which loosens the hold of the instincts to initiate a process of free self-formation. Ribot accounts for the emergence of such a space within the person as a result of the interval produced by the two routes through which external excitations affect the organism. Such excitations divide themselves on arrival in the spinal cord, travelling to the reflex centre by the traverse route (the longer way) and to the brain via the shorter longitudinal and ascending route. The interval this produces means that the ‘suspensive action of the brain has time to take place and to moderate the reflexes’ (1997: 57). Ribot inserts into the interval produced by this delay all of those mechanisms which intervene between the reflexes and the development of the will and the intellect – the mechanisms of ‘education, habit, and reflexion’ (1997: 4) – to inhibit and modify the immediacy of action that would result if the inherited repertoire of reflexes had undisputed sway. By inhibiting the mechanisms of reflex, habit is thus crucial to the educability of the individual. ‘In those who are masters of themselves,’ Ribot writes, ‘the restraint takes place with that certainty which is the mark of every perfect habit’ (1997: 17).</p>
<p>The mechanism of inhibition, while differently figured in being anchored in an evolutionary account of increasing neurophysiological complexity, thus still plays its traditional role of bringing the body under the mind’s dominion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1357034X13475828">Smith, 1992</xref>: 10). Nonetheless, the roles that reflex, instinct and habit play in the development of humans and animals alike produces a different account of the relations between animal and human, nature and culture, from the Kantian one. It is through habit, not against it, that the evolutionary and physiological history of the body is connected to the social and cultural institutions through which will and consciousness are given a specific form and enacted. And it is the delay caused by the different routes through which external stimuli reach the body’s neural and reflex centres that produces the interval within which these forces can enter into and become consequential parts of the physiological processes through which ‘character’ is progressively shaped and formed. The architecture of the person that is involved here thus differs significantly from Mill’s account of character and its Kantian underpinnings. Nonetheless, a similar space for volitional practices of the self is produced, one that is reconciled with the biological mechanisms of evolution.</p>
<p>Where, however, the delay that is produced by this temporal interval is lacking – Ribot argues that this is true of children, women, savages and ‘unpolished men’ – behaviour falls under the immediate compulsion of reflex and the development of the will is impeded. Where this is so, conduct must be brought under sterner and more directive forms of authority. In the case of ‘savages’ this is because their inheritance is racially constituted in such a way as to deny any space in which a cumulative will–habit–instinct cycle might develop. This shift of emphasis displaced the locus of the concern with repetition from the position it had occupied in Mill’s thought, where it is the weight of custom that accounts for the undue influence of repetitive forms of thought and behaviour, to focus instead on the relations between habit and instinct.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1357034X13475828">11</xref>
</sup> This inscribed the will in a new architecture of the person made up of the relations between habit, memory and instinct in which the will was translated, via habit, into a hereditable stock of instincts that accumulated across generations. No longer regarded as a natural given but as a historical product, instinct comprised a set of competences that had been deposited in the nervous system as a progressively accumulating ‘second nature’. George Henry Lewes, drawing on Spencer, thus asserted that, over time, ‘the voluntary actions become involuntary, the involuntary become automatic, the intelligent become habitual, and the habitual become instinctive’ (Lewes cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1357034X13475828">Otis, 1994</xref>: 24). But this is only so because habit constantly renovates inherited instincts by mediating the relations between those instincts and the will. Without this active mediating role of habit, the mechanisms of inheritance would produce an endless repetition of the same. This was the new problem represented by the primitive:
<disp-quote>
<p>Like produces like: the progenitor is repeated in the descendant. Thus the primitive types would remain, being continually reproduced, and the world of life would present the spectacle of perfect regularity and supreme monotony. (Ribot, 1997: 145–6)</p>
</disp-quote> Such conceptions were widely shared in the organic memory tradition. In his 1873 text <italic>Physics and Politics</italic>, for example, Walter Bagehot accounts for the stasis of ‘savage nations’ in terms of the breakdown of what he calls the ‘connective tissue of civilisation’. This is a mechanism, derived principally from Thomas Huxley, which, like Ribot, Bagehot lodges in the spinal cord. It constitutes the route through which the ‘artificial reflex actions’ that are culture’s schooling come to be performed ‘without volition, or even consciousness’ (Huxley, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1357034X13475828">Bagehot, 1873</xref>: 5) as they are transmitted via the nervous system from one generation to the next as an accumulating inheritance. Strictly speaking, however, it is less the breakdown of this mechanism than its failure ever to get properly started that accounts for the zero level of development of the primitive. Bagehot attributes the responsibility for this to the fact that, with the primitive as with the child, ‘there is nothing in their minds to resist the propensity to copy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1357034X13475828">Bagehot, 1873</xref>: 101). The force of imitation is so strong that there never opens up any gap or delay, no mechanism of inhibition, between external stimulus and action, which allows consciousness and volition to develop and become an effective force in the progressive transformation of aptitudes and dispositions through the operation of the will–habit–instinct cycle which is the engine of civilisation. The lack of complexity in the inner constitution of the primitive affords no space for that delay that is the hallmark of rational man. Whereas the ‘educated man has a large inward supply of ideas to which he can retire’ to escape the urge to imitation, the savage has no such resource. ‘The external movements before it are its very life’, Bagehot writes, ‘it lives by what it sees and hears’ (1873: 101). The absence of any cognitive mediation of the external world means that the aptitude for mimicry is unrestrained:
<disp-quote>
<p>There is a strong tendency to copy the most common thing, and that common thing is the old habit. Daily imitation is far oftenest a conservative force, for the most frequent models are ancient. (1873: 104)</p>
</disp-quote> The constitution of the primitive is thus attributable to the fact that it is the survival of an original copying–habit–instinct cycle that has got locked in on itself. It is consequently a cycle that has never generated an accumulating set of capacities derived from the intervention of inhibition, consciousness and the will. The primitive, the survival of prehistory in the present,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1357034X13475828">12</xref>
</sup> is constituted differently not just from his civilised contemporaries but also from prehistoric man simply by virtue of being the trace of a self-enclosing cycle of repetition that has been performed, without variation, across millennia. Prehistoric man differs from modern-day savages chiefly in that ‘he had not had time to ingrain his nature so deeply with bad habits, and to impress bad beliefs so unalterably on his mind as they have’ (1873: 143); they were ‘savages without the fixed habits of savages’ (1873: 113). Similar conceptions abound in the late 19th-century anthropological literature. They are evident, for example, in Alfred Court Haddon’s account of the evolution of art among savage races as being the result of entirely mechanical processes of copying, without any intervention of consciousness or of artistic intent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1357034X13475828">Haddon, 1895</xref>). They are evident, too, in Henry Pitt Rivers’ (1875) account of the failure, on the part of Australian Aborigines, of the relations between the ‘intellectual mind’ and the ‘automaton mind’ to give rise to an enhanced instinctual inheritance. And they are evident in the role that Edward Burnett <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1357034X13475828">Tylor (1893</xref>) accords habit in accounting for the persistence of stone tools among Tasmanian Aborigines.</p>
<p>The problem presented by ‘the primitive’ was not that of an excess of habit but its failure to generate an accumulating set of instincts. This had profound consequences for late 19th-century conceptions of the ends to be pursued in colonial governance. Earlier programmes that had aimed to equip the colonised with the attributes of character gave way before the notion that the primitive was the historical product of traits that were too deeply engrained in his racial constitution to be improvable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1357034X13475828">Anderson, 2007</xref>). This somatisation of an incapacity for improvement lent a new dimension to the denial of coevalness to the Other which Johannes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1357034X13475828">Fabian (1983</xref>) has defined as a constitutive feature of anthropological discourse. For this denial of coevalness was now inscribed racially in the very body of the colonised. But this was, all the same, a historical body. It was by dint of what had <italic>become</italic>their racial make-up through the unremitting repetition of an earlier, primordial set of instincts that primitives were said to be separated from the dynamics of modern civilisation by an unbridgeable gap.</p>

<title>Habit, Memory, Becoming: The Space of Freedom</title>
<p>Ribot’s work and the organic memory tradition in general had a significant influence on late 19th- and early 20th-century French social thought. Emile Durkheim, who published work on Spencer in Ribot’s <italic>Revue Philosophique</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1357034X13475828">Durkheim, 1974</xref>), also drew on Ribot’s work in his account of the role of the neurophysiological mechanisms of inheritance through which the unconscious is constituted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1357034X13475828">Durkheim, 1964[1893]</xref>: 304). Spencer’s account of the primitive also formed a part of the intellectual backdrop for Durkheim’s account of the elementary forms of religious life exemplified by the belief systems of Aborigines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1357034X13475828">Durkheim, 1968[1912]</xref>). Ribot and Spencer were also significant points of reference for Bergson, whose account of the relations between habit and memory works both with and against late 19th-century evolutionary accounts of the socio-somatic processes of inheritance: with in terms of their naturalism and materialism, against in terms of their denial of any autonomous force to life. He draws for this purpose on Félix Ravaisson’s <italic>Of Habit</italic> in view of the prospect it opened up for thinking about habit not just externally, as mere mechanism – that is, as a ‘series of movements which determine one another’ and, as such, ‘that part of us which is inserted into nature and which coincides with nature’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1357034X13475828">Bergson, 1946</xref>: 275) – but from within where ‘our inner experience shows us in habit an activity which has passed, by imperceptible degrees, from consciousness to unconsciousness and from will to automatism’ (1946: 275).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1357034X13475828">13</xref>
</sup> Bergson builds on Ravaisson’s understanding of habit as the lynch-pin of a mechanism of change which, by consolidating through repetition behaviours that are contracted via contact with the environment, prepares the organism for future change. Habit thus equips the body for a ‘change which either is no longer or is not yet; it remains for a possible change’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1357034X13475828">Ravaisson, 2008[1838]</xref>: 25). The habitual repetition of changes originally induced by responses to an external environment becomes, simply by virtue of repetition, a change that the living being brings on itself, a capacity that comes to be proper to and constitutive of it. Habit thus generates a capacity for a certain degree of self-directed freedom. No longer the purely mechanical effect of an external impulse, habit is a capacity that inclines the body to the end the will proposes. It is ‘a <italic>law of the limbs</italic>’ which is, at the same time, ‘a <italic>law of grace</italic>’ (2008[1838]: 57) in which the exercise of desire predominates over efficient causality and integrates the latter into itself.</p>
<p>By thus reworking the Thomist interpretation of the Aristotelian concept of <italic>hexis</italic> as habitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1357034X13475828">Héran, 1987</xref>), Ravaisson breaks with Cartesian condemnations of habit as mere mechanical repetition and with its Kantian construction as the residue of nature in man that he must strive to overcome. He interprets it instead as a virtuous practice whose productivity both reaches back into the nature from which it originally derives while also reaching into the limitless future it generates. Habit thus leads to a change in the natural constitution of the person by producing a new and accumulating set of instincts in place of an original or primitive stock. ‘Habit’, as Ravaisson puts it, ‘transforms voluntary movements into instinctive movements.’ It is a mechanism that transforms instincts into a set of acquired competences deposited in the body. In thus historicising instincts, Ravaisson also allowed for their progressive accumulation across the development of forms of life:
<disp-quote>
<p>In the end, not only does the most elevated form of life in humanity – motive activity – contain in an abbreviated form all the inferior forms that develop in the subordinate functions; but also the series of these functions is itself only the summary of the general development of life in the world, from kingdom to kingdom, from genus to genus, from species to species, right down to the most imperfect rudiments and the simplest elements of existence. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1357034X13475828">Ravaisson, 2008[1838]</xref>: 65)</p>
</disp-quote> This formulation resonates with those of the organic memory tradition in the respect that the ‘second nature’ that results from the operation of the habit-into-instinct cycle is the locus for the exercise of capacities that are brought under the direction of a will that is understood as itself a historical outcome of the processes it acts back upon. There is, however, a significant difference. In the ‘organic memory’ tradition, the will is given a neurophysiological location, whereas Ravaisson’s perspective of the vitality of life interprets the mediating role of habit as part of inherently directionless processes of change in which freedom is derived out of and imported back into nature. It is this aspect of Ravaisson’s discussion that Bergson refashions in his account of the relations between habit-memory and memory proper: between, that is, the memory stored up in the mechanical routines that are coded into the body through repetition, and the memory that works through the mechanism of consciousness and representation, and thus is singular to the particular moment in which it is enacted. ‘Habit, rather than memory,’ he says of the first, ‘it acts our past experience but does not call up its image’. The other, he continues, ‘is the true memory’:
<disp-quote>
<p>Co-extensive with consciousness, it retains and ranges alongside of each other all our states in the order in which they occur, leaving to each fact its place and consequently marking its date, truly moving in the past and not, like the first, in an ever renewed present. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1357034X13475828">Bergson, 2004 [1912]</xref>: 195)</p>
</disp-quote> Bergson clarifies the difference between this position and the logic of ‘organic memory’ – the view, as he puts it, that ‘the body preserves memories in the mechanical form of cerebral deposits’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1357034X13475828">2004 [1912]</xref>: 231) – by insisting that the only past that is real for us is that which is selectively illuminated by ‘the universal law of life, which is a law of action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1357034X13475828">2004 [1912]</xref>: 194). The function of the body ‘is not to store up recollections, but simply to choose, in order to bring back to distinct consciousness, by the real efficacy thus conferred on it, the useful memory, that which may complete and illuminate the present situation with a view to ultimate action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1357034X13475828">2004 [1912]</xref>: 233–4).</p>
<p>Deleuze develops this perspective further in the distinction he proposes between the two syntheses in which time occurs: the first a passive synthesis proceeding through the mechanism of habit as one that takes place <italic>in</italic> the mind but is not carried out <italic>by</italic> it, and the second an active synthesis proceeding through the mechanism of memory and establishing a reflexive relationship to time. Habit comprises not only the sensory-motor habits but also ‘before these, the primary habits that we are; the thousands of passive syntheses of which we are organically composed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1357034X13475828">Deleuze, 2004</xref>: 95). Memory differs from habit by reconstituting particular instances of repetition as distinct, ‘conserving them in its own “temporal space”’, producing the past no longer as the immediate past of retention but as ‘the reflexive past of representation, of reflected and reproduced particularity’, and the future no longer as the immediate future of expectation but as ‘the reflexive future of prediction’ (2004: 92). Elizabeth Grosz has argued that the qualities Bergson and Deleuze attribute to ‘memory proper’ – its unrepeatable singularity, tied to a particular time, place, and situation – casts the present in an unexpected light so that it is ‘fractured or nicked’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1357034X13475828">Grosz, 2004</xref>: 169) by the past that memory evokes. This ‘nick of time’ opens the present to forms of action that are capable of freeing it from the chain of causal determinations. Grosz’s discussion of Bergson, read alongside her discussions of Darwin and Nietzsche, is directed against teleological interpretations of evolution as a process of lineal descent from primordial ancestors following an uninterrupted path of progressive development. She stresses instead those aspects of Darwin’s work which interpret evolution as a directionless process arising out of the relations between random variation and natural selection, thus opening up the history of life to the effects of time understood not as a sequence but as an unpredictable and mobile force: time as the locus of events whose consequences and interconnections generate unpredictability and uncertainty.</p>
<p>The significance of Bergson’s construal of the relations between habit-memory and memory proper within this broader canvas is that of proposing an architecture of the person that is both grounded in matter and the chains of chemical, physiological and neurophysiological causation and, at the same time, freed from such chains of causation by virtue of the ways in which memory produces a ‘nick in time’ through which singular forms of free and conscious agency can be exerted. The distinction between the past as ‘<italic>acted</italic> by matter, <italic>imagined</italic> by mind’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1357034X13475828">Bergson, 2004 [1912]</xref>: 298) open up a space within the person in which a capacity for freedom can be developed and exercised. ‘Spirit borrows from matter the perceptions on which it feeds,’ he says in concluding <italic>Matter and Memory</italic>, ‘and restores them to matter in the form of movements which it has shaped with its own freedom’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1357034X13475828">2004 [1912]</xref>: 332). This is not, however, an unlicensed freedom that all can exercise. It is rather, just as much as with Ribot, a freedom which has its authorities who define and delimit what freedom is, where it is to be found, the conditions that are necessary for it to flourish, and the distribution of the capacities that are required for its exercise. If the action of memory proper is lacking, Bergson argues, a man would fall short of his capacity for freedom. Such a person ‘would be continually acting his life instead of truly representing it to himself: a conscious automaton, he would follow the lead of useful habits which prolong into an appropriate reaction the stimulation received’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1357034X13475828">2004 [1912]</xref>: 201). Bergson had given an example of just such a man a couple of pages earlier in his account of an African savage who, limited to the spontaneous memory that characterises the childhood stage of intellectual development, repeated the sermon of a missionary exactly – word for word, gesture for gesture – but without, he says, understanding any of it. In thus transforming what might otherwise have presented itself as a rare talent for mimicry into a deficit, Bergson places the savage outside the fold of liberal humanity. Repeating acts without thought, lacking that crucial moment of delay, the inner constitution of the savage provides no point of purchase that might be latched onto by interventions into conduct which work through the capacity of individuals to reflexively monitor, and freely change, their behaviour.</p>

<title>The Inherited Inheritor: Habitus and History</title>
<p>My purpose to this point has been to explore some aspects of the variable career that has been accorded the concept of habit in producing a ‘second nature’. Its operations in this regard have depended on its functioning as part of a set of mechanisms which open up a space within which persons are able to react back on the accumulated inheritances – biological, social and cultural – of which they are the embodied product to provide for certain kinds of freedom and self-determination in relation to these. This is not, though, a neutral, purely descriptive space but an actionable one which opens up the conduct of some social agents to varied forms of intervention on the part of authorities of varied kinds. These are, in the instance of those cases in which the force of the past is stalled, those ‘authorities of freedom’ which seek to guide how individuals will freely reshape their own conduct. In other cases, such liberal forms of direction give way to more coercive ones. The ‘diseases of the will’ that Ribot identifies and imputes to the lack of any interval within which volition can be formed, as in cases of abulia, can only be repaired via the installation of authoritarian regimes of conduct. Within the organic memory tradition more generally, the accumulated weight of the past affords no space within the architecture of the primitive for its force to be countered. In the case of Bergson, the relations between habit-memory and memory proper produce a space in which freedoms can be delimited and distributed so as to empower a certain kind of emancipatory practice of the self on the part of those who possess the inner partitioning of the person required for this purpose, and to deny it where such a partitioning is absent.</p>
<p>In addressing these concerns, I have covered some of the same ground that Charles Camic treads in his discussion of the interpretations of habit in the post-Darwinian life sciences, early behaviourist psychology and classical sociology. Camic’s (1986) account, though, is differently accented from mine, reflecting his concern to identify moments of convergence between the programmes of sociology and psychology with regard to their understandings of habit, and their eventual separation as habit, defined in increasingly behaviourist terms in the institutionally more powerful discipline of psychology, came to be shunned by the sociology of action developed in mid-20th-century America. He therefore focuses a good deal of his discussion on Durkheim and Weber, noting the significance that both accorded habit in accounting for the regularities of conduct and the importance they attach to the concept of habitus in providing a space within the person for a dynamic, transformative capacity to reshape the force of habit. It is to this tradition that he refers when noting Bourdieu’s revival of the distinction between habitus and habit, and the affiliations of this distinction to both classical sociology and earlier traditions of European thought. While this is perfectly in order, it misses the significance of the temporal aspects which characterise Bourdieu’s concept of the habitus as a set of embodied dispositions which he constantly referred to as a ‘second nature’ or as ‘history made nature’ (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1357034X13475828">Bourdieu, 1977</xref>: 78–87, 1980, 2005). Yet the forms of historicisation that are involved in Bourdieu’s account of the habitus, understood as a generative capacity to act rather than as mere mechanical repetition, closely inform how Bourdieu seeks to overcome the dualities (between freedom and determinism, habit and will, thought and action, mind and body, biology and society, past and present, freedom and necessity) that he attributes to both Cartesian and Kantian philosophy and their sociological successors.</p>
<p>I will not rehearse at length here Bourdieu’s varied formulations of the relations between history and habitus.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1357034X13475828">14</xref>
</sup> Rather, I shall focus on the ways in which he poses these questions in <italic>Pascalian Meditations</italic>, where, in defining the body as a ‘memory pad’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1357034X13475828">Bourdieu, 2000</xref>: 141), he presents the relations between habitus and history as ones concerning the manner in which the inheritor is equipped to inherit his/her inheritance. Drawing on phenomenology in its rebuttal of behaviourist stimulus-response models of conduct, Bourdieu fashions the relations between habitus and history on the model of Merleau-Ponty’s (2008[1942]) account of the relationships between organisms and milieus. For Merleau-Ponty, the manner in which a milieu affects an organism is not given by the properties of that milieu. It rather derives from the way in which the organism organises the action of the milieu: ‘the organism itself measures the action of things upon itself and delimits its milieu by a circular process which is without analogy in the physical world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1357034X13475828">Merleau-Ponty, 2008[1942]</xref>: 148). In the same way, if the habitus is the site of an ‘encounter of two histories’ – ‘between history in bodies and history in things, or, more precisely, between the history objectified in the form of structures and mechanisms (those of the social space or of fields) and the history incarnated in bodies in the form of habitus’ – then, Bourdieu argues, a historical event is able to affect a habitus only ‘because a habitus capable of being affected by that event conferred that power upon it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1357034X13475828">Bourdieu, 2000</xref>: 149). Or, a couple of pages later: ‘Habitus, the product of historical acquisition, is what enables the legacy of history to be appropriated’ (2000: 151). This is not, of course, a ‘conscious’ appropriation but more that of a practical capacity, an appropriation that takes place more or less without thought but which, nonetheless, constitutes an active relationship between agent and field.</p>
<p>Bourdieu interprets this as a capacity of all habitus, individual or collective, and of the relations between such habitus and the histories – whether intra- or trans-generational – that are pertinent to them. The logic is the same, Bourdieu argues, with regard to the transformation of habitus. The habitus, he argues, ‘helps to determine what transforms it’ where the ‘principle of the transformation of habitus lies … in the gap, experienced as a positive or negative surprise, between expectations and experience’ (2000: 149). He returns to this formulation a little later when arguing that ‘habitus has its “blips”, critical moments when it misfires or is put out of phase’ (2000: 162). These are moments when:
<disp-quote>
<p>the relationship of immediate adaptation is suspended, in an instant of hesitation into which there may slip a form of reflection which has nothing in common with that of the scholastic thinker and which, through the sketched movements of the body … remains turned towards practice and not towards the agent who performs it. (2000: 162)</p>
</disp-quote> This is not, then, a matter of an abstract transcendental consciousness asserting itself against the world through an act of disembodied will. All the same, it is a moment in which the more regular flow of relations between history and habitus, between past and present, between inheritor and inheritance, is stalled, thereby affording the opportunity for new forms of practice to be improvised.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1357034X13475828">15</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>However, the problem space that informs these concerns is clearly not without precedent. Ribot’s interval; the tension between different motor changes in Spencer; Ravaisson’s ‘law of grace’; the ‘nick in time’ of Bergson’s account of memory; Bourdieu’s ‘gaps’ and ‘blips’: these differ significantly in terms of the theoretical coordinates governing the historical architectures of the person that they propose, and in their social and political implications. But they all depend on the regular mechanisms through which the historical accumulation of competences that are sedimented in the body habitually work being delayed or halted to provide for the possibility that those mechanisms might be brought under the redirection of a moment of reflective determination that is itself a historically engendered and embodied capacity. These gaps, intervals and blips are also all actionable spaces: that is, spaces which can be acted upon by ‘authorities of freedom’ to enhance and direct the capacities for freedom that they evince. But this is only possible where habitus are so configured as to provide the complex and antagonistic coordinates that such authorities of freedom need to latch on to if they are to find a point of purchase within the architecture of the person where they can locate, act upon and direct a capacity for freedom.</p>
<p>Bourdieu, like Spencer, Ribot and Bergson, identifies a number of social positions which lack such a space: the working-class habitus which, in his portrayal in <italic>Distinction</italic>(1984), is hemmed in by the constraint of necessity; the ‘archaic habitus’ of the Kabyle who, in <italic>Masculine Domination</italic>, he interprets as survivals of an archaic moment in the shaping of gendered habitus which still constitute a part of our historical unconscious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1357034X13475828">Bourdieu, 2001</xref>: 54); and the ‘empeasanted peasants’ – the men who remain chained to an outmoded inheritance – of <italic>The Bachelors’ Ball</italic>(2008).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1357034X13475828">16</xref>
</sup> In all these cases, the habitus is one-dimensional, lacking any source of internal complexity and antagonism. It is, by contrast, those who are on the move across or between fields – those who are somehow out of place:
<disp-quote>
<p>such as <italic>parvenus</italic> and the <italic>declassés</italic> [who] … are more likely to bring to consciousness that which, for others, is taken for granted, because they are forced to keep watch on themselves and consciously correct the ‘first movements’ of a habitus that generates inappropriate and misplaced behaviours. (2000: 163)</p>
</disp-quote> Bourdieu does not, of course, echo his 19th-century forebears in recommending that those whose habitus affords little opportunity for the reflective redirection of their historical inheritance should be subjected to the rigours of discipline. However, his differentiation of habitus does have a significant bearing on the manner in which he constructs the authority of intellectuals and their role in a politics of freedom. Like Ribot’s and Spencer’s conception of the will, this is a politics in which freedom is not interpreted as a given that might be opposed to the history of determination; it is rather an outcome of that history, something that is produced through it as a set of capacities which count as an historical achievement.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1357034X13475828">17</xref>
</sup> This is not, though, a freedom that is the outcome of an evolutionary dynamic inscribed in the relations between habit, instinct and memory; it is rather a product of the relations between habitus and fields, and particularly the habitus of artists and intellectuals as shaped by the historical dynamics of the artistic, intellectual and scientific fields, and the regulated forms of discussion and critique that these provide.</p>
<p>If, Bourdieu argues, the task of the intellectual is to intervene in the political universe in the name of a freedom that is to be made, s/he derives the ‘authority and competence’ to do so from the ‘autonomous universes of art, philosophy or science’ (Bourdieu, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1357034X13475828">Schinkel, 2003</xref>: 73). There are two aspects to Bourdieu’s argument here. The first operates at the biographical level and consists in the tension between ‘primary’ habitus, shaped in the relations between home and school, and a later ‘secondary’ habitus associated with specific artistic or intellectual vocations whose acquisition sparks off those mismatches between experience and expectations which typify those who move across different fields or are socially mobile. The second operates more at the corporate level of artistic, intellectual and scientific practice, which generate what Bourdieu describes as a corporate or collective interest in the universal or in freedom which, rather than deriving from a purely volitional commitment to such values, derives from the conditions of such fields and the constraints they impose. These enjoin an obligatory commitment to institutionally sanctioned forms of reflexivity derived from the corporate ‘<italic>interest in the universal</italic>’ – an ‘<italic>interest in disinterestedness</italic>’ – which such fields impose on their participants. This, Bourdieu proposes, affords a way of thinking about ‘the social conditions of thought which offers thought the possibility of a genuine <italic>freedom</italic> with respect to those conditions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1357034X13475828">Bourdieu, 2000</xref>: 118). The difficulties of substitutionism that this presents have often been commented on: if Bourdieu’s collective intellectuals speak for the values of freedom and universality in the making, they must speak to and for those for whom such forms of reflexiveness are not mandatory, to whom such capacities must therefore be brought in an act of historical delivery but who, in the meantime, are hemmed in by a more enclosed and enclosing relation between habitus and history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1357034X13475828">Singer, 1999</xref>). These difficulties derive from Bourdieu’s endeavour to overcome the antinomies of liberal social and political thought by latching his account of the relations between history and habitus, as processes inscribed in the body, onto an account of the histories of freedom and of reason, as processes concerning the relations between fields. In doing so, he distributes the capacity for freedom unequally in the very process of establishing the authority of those intellectuals whose role, as freedom’s midwives, is to prepare for its more even distribution.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>My purpose in this article has been to explore the relations between questions of time, freedom and governance that are associated with different accounts of the place that habit occupies relative to thought, will, instinct and memory within different architectures of the person. I have not, though, sought to adjudicate between or to assess the accuracy of such accounts. Rather, I have sought to throw light on the respects in which habit, as a key term in modern liberal social and political thought, operates as a part of variable architectures of the person which lay out the coordinates of personhood in ways that are calculated to provide an actionable route into the direction of conduct. How that route is organised, to whom it might be applied, and those whom it excludes: these are considerations which depend on whether or where, within different socio-somatic inheritances, a space is produced which might serve as a fulcrum for levering persons into freedom through the application of liberal technologies of the self.</p>
<p>I have, it need hardly be said, barely scratched the surface of these larger questions. I have, though, sought to map out the territory that needs to be explored in furthering their development. This consists in the direction that Foucault gives to our understanding of liberal government in his contention, first, that it comprises a set of practices which make up and distribute the freedoms it requires for its exercise and, second, that this work is performed through the operation of varied knowledge practices. If Foucault’s own work on liberal government has focused primarily on the role of economics in producing the freedoms through which markets operate, I have directed attention to the ways in which sociological and philosophical knowledge practices centred on the constituents of personhood have given a distinctive shape to the forms of freedom they have sought to produce and to direct.<sup>

<p>This is arguably a constant aspect of the role played by habit in western political thought from classical Greece through Christian theology and early modern political thought to the present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1357034X13475828">Heiner, 2009</xref>). However, my concerns here are limited to 19th- and 20th-century conceptions of habit.</p>

<p>The aesthetic discourse of civic humanism provided one of the earliest templates for such a conception of liberal government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1357034X13475828">Barrell, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1357034X13475828">Poovey, 1994</xref>).</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn3-1357034X13475828">
<label>3.</label>
<p>There are many ways of thinking about such internal partitionings of the person: see, for example, Deleuze’s concept of the fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1357034X13475828">Deleuze, 1988</xref>: 94–125) and Hadot’s conception of the divisions of the person within and upon which the practice of philosophy is performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1357034X13475828">Hadot, 1995</xref>). However, neither of these quite captures the relations between the bodily and mental components of personhood that I try to capture here. For an earlier elaboration of ‘architecture of the person’, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1357034X13475828">Bennett (2010</xref>).</p>

<p>I draw here on Roger Smith’s discussion of Ribot (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1357034X13475828">Smith, 1992</xref>: 149–52).</p>

<p>The key secondary literatures that bear on my concerns in this article relate to the manner in which Bourdieu seeks to account for the introduction of a capacity for self-reflection into the habitus. This is, in the Anglophone literature, often brought into contact with the post-Giddens sociological accounts of reflexivity. Paul <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1357034X13475828">Sweetman (2003</xref>) offers a comprehensive review of this literature. The debates in the French literature have been somewhat differently cast, with a marked focus on the difficulties presented by Bourdieu’s assumptions regarding the singularity of habitus. This has been especially true of Bernard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1357034X13475828">Lahire (2011</xref>: 11–18), who identifies the roots of this conception in the individualist subjectivism of Husserl’s phenomenology.</p>

<p>Dewey brings these questions into a more direct, full-frontal dispute with the earlier dualistic formulations of liberalism and their implications for governing through freedom in his later <italic>Freedom and Culture</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1357034X13475828">Dewey, 1939</xref>).</p>

<p>Mill’s interests focus on the role of custom in accounting for the stasis of societies that had once been dynamic but have subsequently ceased to be so. He makes a passing reference to the case of societies which have never entered history in the first place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1357034X13475828">Mill, 1969[1859]</xref>: 16) but does not develop this any further.</p>

<p>The concept of the primitive as survival is most closely associated with the work of Edward Burnett <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1357034X13475828">Tylor (1871</xref>); see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1357034X13475828">Didi-Huberman (2002</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1357034X13475828">Ratnapalan (2008</xref>).</p>

<p>I am indebted here to Mark Sinclair’s paper ‘Raivaisson and phenomenology’, presented at the conference ‘Habit and Second Nature’ organised by the British Phenomenological Society at Oxford University in April 2011.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn14-1357034X13475828">
<label>14.</label>
<p>I have addressed these issues elsewhere: see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1357034X13475828">Bennett (2013</xref>: ch. 9).</p>

<p>It is not my purpose to assess the adequacy of Bourdieu’s account here. It should be noted, though, that however much he stresses the embodied nature of habit, his approach to the question of reflexivity is caught in the slipstream of phenomenological thought in assuming that such reflexivity must be the product of a moment in which an individual consciousness swivels on itself to produce a distance in relation to its determinations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1357034X13475828">Lahire (2011</xref>: 147–53) convincingly argues that this simply ignores the vast repertoire of material devices and regimes of conduct through which reflexive capacities are regularly and routinely produced without the need for any self-wrought internal acrobatics on the part of individuals.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn16-1357034X13475828">
<label>16.</label>
<p>These points have been argued at greater length by myself and others elsewhere. For further elaborations of the respects in which Bourdieu’s concept of the working-class culture of the necessary involves a form of substitutionism which brings working-class people under the direction of intellectuals, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1357034X13475828">Singer (1999</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1357034X13475828">Schinkel (2003</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1357034X13475828">Bennett (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1357034X13475828">2011a</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1357034X13475828">Steinmetz (2011</xref>), who is more alert than most to the deeply historical structure of Bourdieu’s categories, also draws attention to his failure to disentangle himself from the denial of coevalness to the colonised that was the hallmark of the late 19th-century doctrine of survivals (a term Bourdieu uses from time to time), as do <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1357034X13475828">Goodman and Silverstein (2009</xref>).</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn17-1357034X13475828">
<label>17.</label>
<p>See, for example, Bourdieu’s discussion with Loïc Wacquant on this matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1357034X13475828">Bourdieu and Wacquant, 1992</xref>: 190).</p>
</fn>

<p>I have discussed the role of aesthetics in such processes elsewhere (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1357034X13475828">Bennett, 2011b</xref>).</p>
