<sec id="sec1-0265691411428783al"><title>Francisca Loetz,<italic> Dealings with God: From Blasphemers in Early Modern Zurich to a Cultural History of Religiousness</italic>, trans. Rosemary Selle, Ashgate: Aldershot, 2009; viii + 326 pp.; 9780754668831, £70.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>Francisca Loetz’s study of blasphemy in Zurich makes a valuable contribution to the field of early modern history, but it is somewhat of a chore to read. As the author explains in the foreword, the book is a ‘radically shortened’ and translated version of a German <italic>Habilitationsschrift</italic>, but one that still bears ‘all the hallmarks of Teutonic scholarship’. This is unfortunate, for while Loetz’s research is in many ways fascinating, the long, dense explanations of theoretical models and the sometimes nearly impenetrable prose weaken the book’s overall impact.</p>
<p>The book is divided into four parts. Part I is a lengthy theoretical and historiographical introduction. Part II forms the heart of the book, and describes hundreds of cases of blasphemy that the author found in the records of the morals courts of the city and territory of Zurich. Loetz adopts the historical definition of blasphemy as cursing, swearing, or abusing God and shows how these ‘speech acts’ – a term borrowed from modern communication and linguistic theory – related to the social, political and cultural contexts of the time. For example, she describes how some cases of blasphemy reveal how early modern people struggled with the ‘paradoxes’ inherent in the Christian religion, such as divine omnipotence and the trinity. In Part III, Loetz analyses historical trends in blasphemy in Zurich over time and provides a comparative chapter on the Catholic city of Lucerne. In Part IV, Loetz summarizes her evidence and offers conclusions. Her main argument is that the study of blasphemy points towards a ‘new cultural history of religiousness’. By revealing how people attempted to ‘deal’ with God in their everyday lives, she argues, the study of blasphemy makes religion ‘visible beyond church religiosity and theology’.</p>
<p>One could argue about precisely how ‘new’ this approach to early modern religion is; Loetz is surprisingly and, at times, unjustly dismissive of much of the scholarship on the Reformation and early modern religion of the past 20 years (for example, see pp. 19 and 44). Another weakness, already mentioned above, is the lack of readability. What Loetz refers to as ‘Teutonic scholarship’ can be a barrier to understanding, even for experts. The theoretical introduction is longer than it needs to be, and the evidence in Parts II and III is not as accessible as one would like, partly because of dense prose and partly because of the lack of visuals. Apparently the original German publication of the <italic>Habilitationsschrift</italic> (Göttingen, 2002) contained tables, charts and graphs, but these visuals unfortunately fell victim to downsizing in the preparation of the English version.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Loetz’s descriptions of the blasphemy cases offer a fascinating look into the lives and minds of early modern people, and the evidence leads to some important conclusions. For example, she demonstrates that the Reformation was not a watershed in terms of ideas about blasphemy or its prosecution. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the attitudes and practices of secular and spiritual authorities changed very little and were remarkably similar in Protestant Zurich and Catholic Lucerne. Instead, the important chronological turning point was the eighteenth century, when religion was increasingly viewed as a private matter and prosecutions for blasphemy plummeted. Loetz’s study also offers significant challenges to various theoretical models that have been popular among early modern historians in recent decades. As she explains, ‘Our conclusion that religious policy in Zurich promoted neither state formation nor modernization, and that prosecution and stigmatizing of blasphemers depended largely on popular support and horizontal control, has momentous consequences for the interpretation of the Early Modern Era’ (283). Similarly, Loetz’s findings highlight weaknesses in acculturation theory, and, more broadly, in the idea of a strict division between popular and elite culture. As she explains, blasphemers in Zurich ‘were not subjects clinging to their own worldview and resisting an alien interpretation; neither were they passive people on whom such an interpretation was being imposed’ (283). The rejection of the elite vs popular divide and promotion of a more fluid model of culture is not new, but Loetz’s evidence confirms and deepens this important historiographical development.</p>
<p>Francisca Loetz’s <italic>Dealings with God</italic> is a difficult read; it is not a book for the uninitiated. The reader’s efforts are rewarded, however, with conscientious, original research and some important conclusions for scholars of religion and culture in early modern Europe.</p>
