<abstract>
<p>Twelve patients with 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) toxicity from a single rave event presented to multiple San Francisco Bay area hospitals with various life-threatening complications including seizures and hyperthermia. Eight required emergent endotracheal intubation and six had hypotension. Hyperkalemia, acute kidney injury, and rhabdomyolysis were present in most of the patients. In all, 2 patients died, 4 survived with permanent neurologic, musculoskeletal, and/or renal sequelae, and 6 survived without any apparent lasting deficits. Hyperthermia was present in 10 patients and was severe (40.9-43° C) in 7. Using multiple cooling methods, the average time to achieve cooling was 2.7 hours. Serum drug analysis was performed on 3 patients, demonstrating toxic MDMA concentrations without the presence of other xenobiotics. Two capsules confiscated by police at the event contained 82% and 98% MDMA, respectively, without other pharmacologically active compounds. Capsule #2 contained 270 mg MDMA, which is more than twice the amount of MDMA usually contained in 1 dose. The MDMA-induced hyperthermia significantly contributed to the morbidity and mortality in this case series. Factors contributing to the severity of the hyperthermia include ingestion of large doses of MDMA, a warm ambient environment, and physical exertion.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), commonly known as ecstasy, is a phenethylamine with stimulant and hallucinogenic properties. It is a popular recreational drug of abuse that has been linked with attendance at “raves,” all-night dance events with fast-paced electronic music. Users of MDMA report experiencing a relaxed, euphoric state characterized by increased empathy, openness, communication, and tranquility. Emergency department (ED) visits related to MDMA have increased by more than 120% from 2004 to 2009, while visits for other illicit drugs have remained relatively stable.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885066612445982">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>As a ring-substituted amphetamine derivative structurally related to mescaline, its effects are mediated through the neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. Typical recreational doses of MDMA are 1 to 2 mg/kg, with onset of effects occurring between 30 and 60 minutes. Peak effects occur at 90 minutes and last for 3 to 5 or more hours. The elimination half-life is about 8 to 9 hours.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885066612445982">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885066612445982">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In humans, doses of 125 mg MDMA result in significant increases in blood pressure and heart rate. The major subjective effects in a study of 100 recreational users were tachycardia, dry mouth, bruxism, and/or trismus.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885066612445982">2</xref>
</sup> Severe adverse reactions to MDMA include hyperthermia, seizures, hypertensive crises, cardiac dysrhythmias, metabolic disturbances, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury, hepatotoxicity, cerebrovascular accidents, and psychia-tric disturbances.<sup>

</sup> Fatalities in the United States related to MDMA use were reported as early as 1987.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885066612445982">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Hyperthermia is a major toxic reaction to MDMA that can lead to rhabdomyolysis, hypotension, DIC, and acute renal failure. It occurs as a result of complex interactions between serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine and environmental conditions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885066612445982">6</xref>
</sup> In laboratory animals, MDMA-induced hyperthermia is associated with neurotoxicity. This damage can be attenuated by placing the animals in a low ambient temperature and exacerbated by placement in elevated room temperature.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885066612445982">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885066612445982">7</xref>
</sup> The ambient temperature tends to be high at indoor rave parties, and this is exacerbated by vigorous physical exertion such as prolonged dancing.</p>
<p>In May 2010, the California Poison Control System (CPCS) was consulted regarding 12 patients hospitalized at 4 area hospitals after a rave party at the Cow Palace in Daly City. This indoor event was attended by about 16 000 people. At least 70 persons were arrested for possessing or selling drugs, and the county narcotics task force seized more than 800 presumed ecstasy pills.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885066612445982">8</xref>
</sup> Most of the 12 patients presented with or developed the following toxic effects: altered mental status, hyperthermia, seizures, tachycardia, rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury, hypotension, and DIC. There were 2 fatalities. Described in this report are the clinical features of these patients as well as laboratory data from analysis of patient serum and pill specimens.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>On May 30, 2010, over the course of 3 hours, the CPCS-San Francisco Division at San Francisco General Hospital was consulted on 12 MDMA-intoxicated patients. All patients admitted to using “ecstasy” to friends, emergency personnel, and/or medical staff. During the next 8 days, 2 patients died and 6 had complete recovery. Five months after the event, 4 patients had persistent neurologic, musculoskeletal, and/or renal sequelae.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885066612445982">Table 1</xref> summarizes the demographic and clinical characteristics of the 12 patients. They were aged 19 to 35 years, and 5 were female. Features common to most patients at the time of presentation were hyperthermia, tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, acute kidney injury, and generalized tonic–clonic seizure activity. Of the 12 patients, 8 required emergent intubation and 5 required emergent dialysis for acute renal failure, acidosis, and hyperkalemia. The 6 patients who presented with hypotension had the most severe outcomes (2 died and 4 had permanent morbidity). Over the hospital course, all patients developed rhabdomyolysis (creatine kinase 1511-196 000 U/L [reference range: males 38-174 U/L, females 26-140 U/L]). Of the 5 patients with DIC, all required red blood cell, platelet, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), cryoprecipitate, and/or factor VII transfusion. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0885066612445982">Table 2</xref> describes comparative characteristics of the patients with severe morbidity and those who survived intact. There was a trend towards higher initial temperatures and serum potassium in the group with severe morbidity.</p>

<p>Of the 12 patients, 2 died at 20.5 hours and 8 days after hospital arrival, respectively. Patient 1 was a 23-year-old man with no past medical history who arrived to the ED via ambulance, altered and seizing. He was seen running at the rave, then fell down 5 steps, and began to have generalized tonic–clonic seizure activity which did not abate after paramedics gave him midazolam 4 mg intravenously (IV). At the time of ED arrival, he had a bleeding scalp laceration and had been seizing for approximately 30 minutes. Since the seizure did not subside with an additional 4 mg midazolam IV, he was emergently intubated after etomidate and rocuronium. His initial temperature was 43°C, pulse 168 beats/min, and blood pressure 122/96 mm Hg which dropped to 95/41 after 5 minutes. In the ED, ice packs were placed in his groin and axillae. One hour after arrival, a surface cooling blanket was applied and 2 L cold (4°C) normal saline were administered IV. Two and a half hours after arrival, dantrolene 175 mg IV was given. His temperature was 38.7°C at 2.9 hours after arrival. A computed tomography (CT) scan of his head was normal. Eight hours after arrival, vecuronium was given to maintain neuromuscular paralysis. Ten hours after arrival, he remained hypotensive despite 3 vasopressors and had evidence of DIC with bleeding from the mouth, orogastric tube, scalp laceration, and central line site. Desmopressin (DDAVP), factor VII, cryoprecipitate, and prothrombin complex concentrate were given and a massive transfusion protocol was started (platelets, FFP, packed red blood cells). Sixteen hours after arrival, continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) was started. He remained profoundly hypoxic, hypotensive, and difficult to ventilate and was pronounced dead 20.5 hours after arrival. Coroner’s investigation listed the cause of death as multiple system failure due to sequelae of MDMA intoxication.</p>
<p>Patient 2 was a 25-year-old man with no past medical history who was carried into the ED by his friends and a police officer. According to his friends, the patient had ingested 2 ecstasy pills at an unknown time at the rave party and became unresponsive on the way home. Upon arrival to the ED, he was apneic, rigid with clamped teeth, and had a weak pulse. On the cardiac monitor, he had a pulse rate of 20 beats/min, with a narrow QRS complex. He was emergently intubated after succinylcholine. Shortly afterward, he lost his pulses and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was begun for pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. After atropine (1 mg IV) and sodium bicarbonate (50 mEq IV), he had return of spontaneous circulation. His pulse rate was 152 beats/min, BP 79/10 mm Hg, with 100% O<sub>2</sub> saturation on ventilation at 100% F<sc>io</sc>
<sub>2</sub>. His first temperature recorded 47 minutes after arrival was 39°C. He was placed on a surface cooling blanket and ice packs were placed in his groin and axillae. His temperature was 38.5°C at 2.2 hours after arrival. His initial head CT scan was unremarkable. Twelve hours later, he was still unresponsive and a repeat head CT scan showed progressive bilateral cerebral edema with effacement of the cerebral sulci. A repeat head CT on day 4 showed increasing cerebral edema with obliteration of the gray/white matter interface and narrowing of the lateral ventricles. Mannitol and dexamethasone were given without clinical change. On day 8, he developed decerebrate posturing and central diabetes insipidus and died shortly after being converted to comfort care. Coroner’s investigation listed the cause of death as terminal anoxic encephalopathy and acute MDMA intoxication.</p>
<p>Other severe outcomes contributed to the general morbidity of the 12 patients. Patient 3 survived with mild cognitive deficits which were slowly improving on 1 month follow-up. Patient 5, who required emergent dialysis, had a PEA arrest during her initial resuscitation and was placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). One of 3 patients who developed compartment syndrome, she required bilateral below the knee amputations due to lower extremity necrosis. At 3-month follow-up, she had normal cognition. At 5 months after the incident, patient 6 had severe cognitive deficits with persistent critical illness neuropathy manifested by leg weakness. Of the 5 patients who required emergent hemodialysis, only patient 6 was still on maintenance hemodialysis at the time of hospital discharge.</p>
<p>Multiple cooling methods were implemented in the care of these patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0885066612445982">Table 3</xref>), reflecting the preference of the treating physicians at each facility. Ice packs placed in the groin and/or axillae, surface cooling blankets, and antipyretics were most commonly used. Of the 7 patients requiring neuromuscular paralysis for rapid sequence intubation (RSI), 4 received additional doses of the paralytic vecuronium once the initial RSI paralytic wore off. Patients 1, 3, and 4 received 1 dose of dantrolene each. Although these 3 patients were subjected to the greatest number of cooling methods, more than 2.5 hours elapsed before adequate cooling was achieved (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0885066612445982">Table 3</xref>). Mean time to achieve cooling was 2.7 hours. Of the 7 patients presenting with hyperpyrexia (T &gt;40°C), the 2 patients who survived intact were cooled within 1.5 hours of ED arrival. Neither of those two patients required intubation or neuromuscular paralysis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This case series represents the most severe clinical outcomes reported due to MDMA toxicity from a single event. Although 6 of the 12 patients made a complete recovery, 2 patients died and 4 survived with long-term sequelae. Eight patients (66%) required emergent endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation and 5 (42%) required emergent hemodialysis. As expected with such a large event, public, medical, and media speculation was rife with conjecture. Although many news outlets postulated that these cases were due to ingestion of “tainted drugs,”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885066612445982">8</xref>
</sup> this hypothesis was unsupported by our laboratory analysis. The analyzed patient serum, urine, and confiscated pills as well as autopsy reports confirmed MDMA as the sole intoxicant.</p>
<p>Mass casualty events due to MDMA are rare. A similar incident occurred about 6 months prior to this event. In Los Angeles, MDMA intoxication at a rave resulted in 18 ED visits during New Year's Eve 2010. Fifteen patients were discharged home from the ED and 3 were admitted to area hospitals, with 1 ICU admission. There was 1 death at home, resulting from a multidrug overdose of MDMA, cocaine, and heroin.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885066612445982">10</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>There are several potential explanations for the poor clinical outcomes in our case series: the victims’ presenting core temperatures; the duration of hyperthermia; the treatment methods used for hyperthermia; the large amounts of MDMA in pills; and in some cases, prolonged hypoxia. Surviving patients commented that the indoor venue was unusually warm that evening. High ambient temperatures combined with prolonged high-energy dancing, seizures described in some cases, and the metabolic effects of MDMA account for the hyperthermia seen in 10 of 12 patients. Most of the severe morbidity and mortality in these cases can be attributed to hyperthermia effects.</p>
<p>Nonexertional heat stroke is defined by a body temperature greater than 40.6°C in the presence of altered mental status and anhidrosis. In contrast, exertional heat stroke occurs in a hot and humid environment and can be seen in otherwise healthy young patients such as our case series.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885066612445982">11</xref>
</sup> In a case series of 58 ICU patients admitted with nonexertional heat stroke during the 1995 Chicago heat wave, the patients’ mean core temperature was 41.5°C and over two thirds were found in an area with elevated ambient temperature. Though the report does not correlate temperature and time with complications, only 1 patient was cooled in the goal time of 30 minutes, and the mortality in this group was quite high (21% in hospital and 49% at 1 year). Although these patients tended to be older with more medications and comorbidities, this series supports the concept of the time and severity of hyperthermia as a driving force for organ dysfunction.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885066612445982">12</xref>
</sup> In our case series, although cooling measures were instituted rapidly, they were not uniformly effective. Patient 1, who died within 24 hours of presentation, was hyperthermic for almost 3 hours. This prolonged hyperthermia likely contributed to the development of DIC and multiorgan system failure.</p>
<p>Cooling methods in the ED are either active or passive. Passive treatment includes ice pack application to neck, groin, and axillae and evaporative cooling. Immersion in ice water (1-3°C) and evaporative cooling show equal efficacy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885066612445982">13</xref>
</sup> However, ice water immersion is often impractical in the setting of a critically ill patient who requires monitoring as well as IV placement, ventilation, and resuscitation. Other methods reported include ice water lavage via nasogastric (NG) tube, chilled IV fluids, electronic cooling blankets, and neuromuscular paralysis. These are not uniformly more effective than the previously mentioned methods but can be utilized as adjunct modalities.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885066612445982">13</xref>
</sup> Although dantrolene was not specifically recommended by poison center staff, it was used in the management of 3 patients in this series. In 1 case report, it has been reported to control muscle hyperactivity in the setting of MDMA-induced hyperthermia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885066612445982">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The MDMA-induced hyperthermia appears to be the common pathway for organ dysfunction in MDMA toxicity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885066612445982">14</xref>
</sup> However, the exact mechanism is not completely understood. Hyperthermia due to MDMA may result from effects on multiple neurotransmitters: serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885066612445982">6</xref>
</sup> The symptoms may be indistinguishable from serotonin syndrome with increased muscle activity, altered mental status, and elevated temperature.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885066612445982">15</xref>
</sup> For this reason, it has been postulated that the hyperthermic response is primarily due to increased serotonin. However, recent rat studies demonstrate that dopamine D<sub>1</sub> receptor effects may be primarily responsible for MDMA-induced hyperthermia, and serotonin is responsible for body temperature loss. This conclusion was noted when the 5-HT reuptake inhibitors zimeldine and fluoxetine did not affect the hyperthermic response in MDMA-treated rats, but a dopamine D<sub>1</sub> antagonist dose-dependently antagonized it.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885066612445982">16</xref>
</sup> Binge dosing of MDMA in rat models (similar to what may occur with recreational users) resulted in an increased temperature response in a dose-dependent fashion, with associated serotonin depletion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885066612445982">6</xref>
</sup> In these rat studies, serotonin function was necessary for adequate cooling in high ambient temperatures.</p>
<p>Pills sold as ecstasy do not necessarily contain pure MDMA, but may include methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) and methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA), which are similarly psychoactive phenethylamines, as well as other compounds such as paramethoxyamphetamine (PMA), dextromethorphan, caffeine, methamphetamine and ketamine.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885066612445982">17</xref>
</sup> One source claims that “a high quality tablet of street ecstasy generally contains an average of 60-80 mg of MDMA.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885066612445982">18</xref>
</sup> In a recent Australian study, 28 ecstasy pills contained 0 to 245 mg MDMA with all but 1 specimen containing less than 125 mg MDMA.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885066612445982">19</xref>
</sup> Although the first pill analyzed in this case contained a typical dose of 110 mg MDMA, the second pill contained a large amount of MDMA (270 mg) and none contained the above-mentioned adulterants. The wide range of drug quantity in the pills could have led to inadvertent MDMA overdose if it was assumed that all MDMA pills and capsules contain similar drug dosages.</p>
<p>Prolonged hypoxia was a concern in the second death case. Patient 2 developed cerebral edema within the first hospital day. Given that his hyperthermia was less severe; his final cause of death appears to be related to his anoxic brain injury during cardiac arrest. Cerebral edema has been of concern in previous instances of MDMA intoxication, occurring as a result of hyponatremia,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885066612445982">14</xref>
</sup> which was not the case in this patient. Of note, 1 patient in this case series who presented with hyponatremia and cerebral edema had a good outcome. This patient was not hyperthermic.</p>
<p>Another factor to be considered in future cases is hepatic cytochrome-P450 isoform CYP2D6 polymorphisms, which occur in 7% to 10% of Caucasian populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885066612445982">20</xref></sup> This genetic predisposition could have resulted in decreased metabolism of MDMA and increased toxicity. Unfortunately, we did not perform genetic testing in our patients.</p>
<p>There are limitations when drawing conclusions from this study. Treatment options were not standardized in our patients since they presented at multiple facilities ranging from community EDs to a level I trauma center/academic hospital. All patients were subjected to at least 1 type of cooling measure, and all but 1 underwent multiple cooling techniques. Although patient 4 had a significant delay in the initiation of cooling measures, this patient still survived to discharge neurologically intact. Of note, two patients were given succinylcholine in the course of induction of intubation. In the setting of hyperkalemia, which was present in our severe morbidity group, this is potentially dangerous because succinylcholine can itself raise serum potassium levels, causing cardiac collapse.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885066612445982">21</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Another limitation in this study is an inherent reporting bias to the CPCS. Perhaps only the most critical patients were referred to the CPCS for toxicology consultation. It is possible that there were other, more mildly affected MDMA users who were treated and released from local EDs without CPCS involvement.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>MDMA-induced hyperthermia can cause mortality and lasting morbidity due to sequelae such as shock, seizures, acidosis, acute kidney injury, rhabdomyolysis, DIC, and brain injury. Not all samples of MDMA sold on the street contain the same amount of drug. Rapid cooling is key in treating these patients in the ED and ICU.</p>
