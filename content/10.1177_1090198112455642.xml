<abstract>
<p><italic>Purpose</italic>. To examine the utility of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) for explaining physical activity (PA) intention and behavior among a large population sample of overweight and obese adolescents (Alberta, Canada), using a web-based survey. Secondary objectives were to examine the mediating effects of the TPB constructs and moderating effects of weight status. <italic>Methods</italic>. A subsample of 427 overweight and 133 obese participants (<italic>n</italic> = 560), completed a self-administered web-based questionnaire on health and PA behaviors, including assessment of attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control (PBC), and intention to participate in regular PA. Structural equation models were examined using AMOS 17.0. <italic>Results</italic>. Overall, 62% of the variance in intention was accounted for by attitude, subjective norm, and PBC; whereas 44% of the variance in PA behavior was explained by PBC and intention. When examining the TPB separately in overweight and obese subsamples, 66% and 56% of the variance for PA intention was explained for overweight and obese subsamples, respectively; and 38% and 56% of the variance in PA behavior were accounted for in the overweight and obese subsamples. Overall, attitude was the strongest predictor of PA intention, whereas PBC was the strongest predictor for PA behavior. Intention was not predictive of PA behavior. <italic>Conclusions</italic>. These results provide partial support for the utility of TPB in explaining PA behavior in a sample of overweight and obese adolescents. In particular, strong associations regarding attitude and PBC were evident across each subsample. These findings have implications for tailoring PA programs in this population.</p>

<p>Obesity has reached epidemic proportions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090198112455642">Biro &amp; Wein, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1090198112455642">Lutz, Karloy, &amp; Okun, 2008</xref>) in many developed nations worldwide, presenting significant liabilities to public health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1090198112455642">Janssen, Lam, &amp; Katzmarzyk, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1090198112455642">Wang &amp; Lobstein, 2006</xref>). An estimated 20% of Canadian youth are classified as overweight or obese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1090198112455642">Janssen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1090198112455642">McCrindle et al., 2010</xref>). Specifically, youth obesity prevalence continues to increase, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1090198112455642">McCrindle et al. (2010)</xref> report that 13% of Canadian youth are classified as obese. Similarly, in the United States and Australia, obesity stands as the second leading source of preventable morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1090198112455642">Hamilton &amp; White, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1090198112455642">Wang &amp; Lobstein, 2006</xref>). Obesity has a significant burden to the health care system, with substantial direct and indirect costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1090198112455642">Janssen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1090198112455642">Wang &amp; Lobstein, 2006</xref>). Physical inactivity and low fitness levels are strongly associated with increased weight in children and adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090198112455642">Burke, Beilin, &amp; Dunbar, 2001</xref>). Of concern, many young people continue to lead an inactive lifestyle, failing to meet recommended physical activity (PA) guidelines of at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity daily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1090198112455642">Department of Health &amp; Aging, 2004</xref>). For example, a recent Canadian national survey has identified a considerable decline in fitness measures (e.g., aerobic fitness) in children and youth from 1981 to 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1090198112455642">Tremblay et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Sharp increases in the prevalence of obesity in childhood and adolescence are particularly alarming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1090198112455642">Ogden et al., 2006</xref>), considering it is a significant predictor of obesity in adulthood and is linked to increased prevalence of morbidity and mortality, as well as numerous lifestyle diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090198112455642">Biro &amp; Wein, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1090198112455642">Gill et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1090198112455642">Rey-Lopez, Vicente-Rodriguez, Biosca, &amp; Moreno, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1090198112455642">Wang &amp; Lobstein, 2006</xref>). Research suggests that adolescents with an elevated body mass index (BMI) experienced 30% higher rates of mortality than do young and middle-aged adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090198112455642">Biro &amp; Wein, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Numerous adverse health consequences of childhood and adolescent obesity exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1090198112455642">Rey-Lopez et al., 2008</xref>); physical outcomes of obesity are associated with type 2 diabetes, obesity in adulthood, cardiovascular disease and several cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090198112455642">Biro &amp; Wein, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1090198112455642">Gill et al., 2009</xref>). Social, emotional, and physical health is generally poorer in obese adolescents in comparison with healthy weight adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1090198112455642">Wake et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Physical inactivity and sedentary behavior throughout childhood are independent contributors of obesity during adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1090198112455642">Rey-Lopez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1090198112455642">Tremblay &amp; Willms, 2003</xref>). It is the combination of nutrition and PA-related behaviors that affect energy balance and, therefore, weight status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1090198112455642">Kremers et al., 2006</xref>). As such, engaging in regular PA provides protection against overweight or obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1090198112455642">Rey-Lopez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1090198112455642">Tremblay &amp; Willms, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Theories are helpful for explaining and predicting health behaviors such as PA, and theory-based interventions are more efficacious than atheoretical approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1090198112455642">Michie &amp; Abraham, 2004</xref>). However, prior to the translation of theories into interventions, theories and their assumptions should be tested empirically to ensure their adequacy. The theory of planned behavior (TPB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090198112455642">Ajzen, 1991</xref>) is one such social-cognitive theory that has been widely examined to predict behavior in numerous populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090198112455642">Conner &amp; Sparks, 2005</xref>). However, the core tenets of the TPB have yet to be tested for PA in an overweight and obese adolescent population sample, which is the purpose of this article.</p>
<p>Briefly, the TPB proposes that a personâs intention to perform a behavior is the central determinant of that behavior because it reflects the level of motivation a person is willing to exert to perform the behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090198112455642">Ajzen, 1991</xref>). Intention is hypothesized to be determined by attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control (PBC). Attitude is reflected in a positive or negative evaluation of performing the behavior. Subjective norm is defined as the perceived social pressure to perform the behavior whereas PBC is defined as the perceived ease or difficulty of performing the behavior. PBC is also hypothesized to directly predict behavior. Application of the TPB identifies underlying beliefs that determine oneâs attitude, subjective norm, and PBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090198112455642">Ajzen, 1991</xref>) and can provide an applied basis for understanding the factors that help initiate behaviors (such as PA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090198112455642">Dishman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1090198112455642">Glanz, Rimer, &amp; Lewis, 2002</xref>). TPB has been used extensively to study a broad range of behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090198112455642">Armitage &amp; Conner, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1090198112455642">Godin &amp; Kok, 1996</xref>) with a particular focus on health behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1090198112455642">Godin &amp; Kok, 1996</xref>), including PA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1090198112455642">Dzewaltowski, Noble, &amp; Shaw, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1090198112455642">Hagger, Chatzisarantis, &amp; Biddle, 2002</xref>). For example, in a review of health behaviors by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090198112455642">Armitage and Conner (2001)</xref>, attitude, subjective norm, and PBC accounted for 40% of the variance in intention, whereas intention and PBC accounted for 27% of the variance in PA behavior.</p>
<p>The vast majority of studies examining the utility of the TPB in explaining PA behavior have focused on adult populations. Limited research, however, has been conducted with adolescents. Twelve nonintervention studies have examined the TPB to explain PA in adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090198112455642">AraÃºjo-Soares, McIntyre, &amp; Sniehotta, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198112455642">Baker, Little, &amp; Brownell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090198112455642">Craig, Goldberg, &amp; Dietz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090198112455642">de Bruijn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1090198112455642">Godin, Anderson, Lambert, &amp; Desharnais, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1090198112455642">Hagger, Chatzisarantis, Biddle, &amp; Orbell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1090198112455642">Hamilton &amp; White, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1090198112455642">Martin, Oliver, &amp; McCaughtry, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1090198112455642">Mummery, Spence, &amp; Hudec, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1090198112455642">Saunders, Motl, Dowda, Dishman, &amp; Pate, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1090198112455642">Sas-Nowosielski, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1090198112455642">Trost, Saunders, &amp; Ward, 2002</xref>); however, none of these are population-based studies, which limits our current knowledge regarding the generalizability of the TPBâs power in predicting PA in the general adolescent population. Furthermore, it appears no TPB study in an adolescent or adult population has examined the moderating effect of weight status.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of our study was to examine the utility of the TPB in explaining PA intention and behavior among a large population sample of overweight/obese adolescents from the province of Alberta, Canada. Secondary objectives include examining (a) mediating effects of the TPB constructs and (b) the moderating effect of weight status.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The main study is reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1090198112455642">Plotnikoff et al., 2011</xref>). However, this article examines the TPB by weight classification on a subset of the study population. The Web-Survey of Physical Activity and Nutrition (Web-SPAN; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1090198112455642">Storey et al., 2009</xref>) is a self-administered web-based survey of PA, diet, and smoking behaviors of adolescents. Briefly, all school boards in the province of Alberta, Canada were invited to participate. A total of 109 schools across 37 school boards agreed to participate (school board response rate of 64%, school response rate of 40%). Overall, 4,073 adolescents (out of a potential 9,071 students), consented and completed Web-SPAN during school time (111 individuals did not provide complete data and were eliminated from study analyses) yielding a student response rate of 44.8%. The current study examines a subsample of 560 overweight and obese participants.</p>

<p>To minimize response burden, short measures of core TPB constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1090198112455642">Hagger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1090198112455642">Rhodes, Macdonald, &amp; McKay, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1090198112455642">Spence et al., 2010</xref>) were used in the survey protocol, which included attitude, subjective norm, PBC, and intention. These published measures were developed in English-speaking countries (e.g., United Kingdom, Canada) with similar age groups. The measures were framed as achieving regular PA, defined as accumulating at least 30 minutes of PA on most days of the week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1090198112455642">Public Health Agency of Canada, 2002</xref>), over the next month (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1090198112455642">Plotnikoff et al., 2011</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1090198112455642">1</xref></sup></p>

<title>Physical activity</title>
<p>The Physical Activity Questionnaire for Older Children (PAQ-C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1090198112455642">Kowalski, Crocker, &amp; Faulkner, 1997</xref>) was used to assess PA levels of participants during the previous 7 days. The PAQ-C was specifically designed for Canadian school-aged youth, including components on PA during the school day, after school, and weekend PA. The questionnaire consists of nine items used to calculate an activity score. Responses are converted to a 5-point scale where a higher score represents greater PA levels (scores range from 1.00 to 5.00). The PAQ-C has been shown to be a reliable self-report measure of PA when testâretest reliability was examined over a period of 1 week among 84 boys (<italic>r</italic> = .75) and girls (<italic>r</italic> = .82) aged 9 to 14 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1090198112455642">Crocker, Bailey, Faulkner, Kowalski, &amp; McGrath, 1997</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1090198112455642">Kowalski et al.

<p>To correct for the clustering of effects at the school level, all variables were adjusted for school using multiple linear regression, and the unstandardized residuals were used in the analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090198112455642">Cohen &amp; Cohen, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1090198112455642">Dishman et al., 2006</xref>). The proposed model was tested using maximum likelihood analysis in AMOS and the PAQ-C score was used as the dependent variable. Model fit was assessed using multiple indices, including chi-square index, goodness-of-fit index (GFI), adjusted goodness-of-fit index (AGFI), comparative fit index (CFI), and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA). The chi-square tests the null hypothesis that the model is a good fit of the data. Although a nonsignificant chi-square result (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .05) indicates that the model is a good fit, it is oversensitive in large samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090198112455642">Bollen, 1989</xref>) and as a result additional measures are often used. The GFI provides an estimate of the proportion of variance in the varianceâcovariance matrix accounted for by the proposed model. The AGFI provides a GFI score adjusted for the number of parameters in the model. The CFI compares the existing model fit with a null model which assumes the indicator variables in the model are uncorrelated. GFI, AGFI, and CFI scores range from 0 to 1, with a score exceeding .9 indicating a good fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090198112455642">Bollen, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1090198112455642">JÃ¶reskog &amp; SÃ¶rbom, 1993</xref>). The RMSEA estimates closeness-of-fit compared with the saturated model and a value of &lt;.10 is considered to be acceptable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1090198112455642">Keith, 1993</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1090198112455642">Hu and Bentler (1999)</xref> have proposed more conservative model-fit values (CFI and TuckerâLewis index &gt;.95; RMSEA &lt; .06), but others have argued against using these higher cutoff criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1090198112455642">Marsh, Hau, &amp; Wen, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the univariate distribution of the data was generally normal, the multivariate kurtosis value was above the recommended value of 3. Consequently, bootstrapping procedures were used and the BollenâStine <italic>p</italic> value and bias-corrected regression coefficients are reported throughout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090198112455642">Bollen &amp; Stine, 1992</xref>).</p>

<title>Mediation analyses</title>
<p>In the TPB, intention is thought to mediate the relationship between attitude, subjective norm, PBC, and the behavior itself. The indirect effects of intention were examined using single-mediator models and asymmetric confidence intervals tested the significance of the indirect effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1090198112455642">MacKinnon, Lockwood, &amp; Williams, 2004</xref>). The unstandardized regression coefficients from PASW were used in the analyses for single models. In the first step, the pathways from subjective norm, attitude, and PBC to intention were identified (<italic>A</italic>). In the second step, the pathway from intention to PA was explored (<italic>B</italic>). The indirect (mediated) effect was then calculated by multiplying <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>. Asymmetric confidence intervals were used to test the significance of the product of coefficients (<italic>AB</italic>) using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1090198112455642">Mackinnon, Fritz, Williams, and Lockwoodâs (2007)</xref> PRODCLIN (PRODuct Confidence Limits for INdirect effects) program. If zero is outside the confidence interval the mediated effect is statistically significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1090198112455642">MacKinnon, 2008</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section12-1090198112455642">
<title>Moderation analyses</title>
<p>Weight status (overweight or obese) was identified as a potential moderator of the TPB model. Multigroup moderation analyses were conducted using a series of models, starting from an unrestricted model to the fully constrained model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1090198112455642">Nigg, Lippke, &amp; Maddock, 2009</xref>). In Model 1, the relationships between variables are unconstrained and this model serves as the basis for comparison. Model 2 is the measurement equivalent model, which includes equal factor loading across subsamples (loadings from the latent factors to measured items restrained to be equal across all groups). Model 3 includes the Model 2 constraints plus equal factor covariance (additional constraints that the interrelationships of attitude, subjective norm, and PBC would be equal across groups). Model 4 includes the Model 3 constraints plus equal paths (additional constraints that the interrelations of subjective norm to intention, attitude to intention, PBC to intention, PBC to behavior, and intention to behavior would be equal across groups). To compare the models, change in CFI was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090198112455642">Cheung &amp; Rensvold, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090198112455642">Cheung and Rensvold (2002)</xref> proposed critical values to indicate measurement invariance, which are robust for testing multigroup invariance. A ÎCFI â¤ â.01 indicates that the null hypothesis of invariance should not be rejected.</p>

<title>Overview</title>
<p>The sample reflects the age and sex distribution for Alberta youth. The mean age of our sample was 13.7 years (1.5) versus 13.3 years (1.3) in the total population of Alberta of Grades 7 to 10 students (<italic>N</italic> ~ 130,000). The sample (<italic>N</italic> = 560) included 308 boys and 252 girls. The proportion of boys in our sample was 55% versus 45% (Grades 7-10) for the province. Participants provided self-reported height and weight.</p>
<p>Based on the International Obesity Task Force classifications (obesity defined as BMI &gt;95th percentile, overweight as BMI &gt;85th percentile and &lt;95th percentile, and normal weight as BMI &lt;85th percentile), which is based on data from six countries, 427 participants were categorized as overweight and 133 as obese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090198112455642">Cole, Bellizzi, &amp; Flegal, 2000</xref>). In another population sample (<italic>N</italic> = 4,932) of Alberta youth conducted 3 years earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1090198112455642">Plotnikoff et al., 2009</xref>), 7.7% of boys and 4.5% of girls were obese according to International Obesity Task Force cutoffs; the corresponding proportions of obese youth in this study were 7.6% for boys and 6% for girls.</p>
<p>There were no significant age or gender differences between overweight and obese participants. The descriptive statistics and bivariate correlations among study variables are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1090198112455642">Table 1</xref>. Significant intercorrelations (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) were observed among TPB constructs and all the constructs were associated with PA (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study investigated the utility of the TPB in explaining PA intention and behavior among a large population sample of overweight/obese Canadian adolescents. Secondary study objectives were to (a) examine the mediating effects of the TPB constructs and (b) assess the moderating effects of weight status. Overall, our results partially support the TPB as an appropriate theoretical model for explaining the determinants of PA behaviors in a sample of overweight/obese adolescents. Among overweight adolescents the model was found to be an adequate-to-good fit to the data; for obese adolescents the model was an excellent fit to the data.</p>
<p>The model accounted for 66% and 56% of the variance in intention, and 38% and 56% of the variance in PA behavior in the overweight and obese subsamples, respectively. The reported variances are higher than those described in most TPBâPA studies in an adolescent population, which explained 6% to 37% of the variance in PA and 13% to 58% of the variance in intention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090198112455642">AraÃºjo-Soares et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198112455642">Baker et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090198112455642">Craig et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090198112455642">de Bruijn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1090198112455642">Godin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1090198112455642">Hagger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1090198112455642">Hamilton &amp; White, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1090198112455642">Martin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1090198112455642">Mummery et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1090198112455642">Saunders et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1090198112455642">Sas-Nowosielski, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1090198112455642">Trost et al., 2002</xref>). The higher variances explained in the current study may be attributed to the adolescent population under investigation.</p>
<p>The pathways from attitude to intention, and from PBC to PA, were statistically significant in both subsamples. In terms of attitude, Godin and colleagues describe similar results in an adolescent sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1090198112455642">Godin &amp; Kok, 1996</xref>), with the relationship between attitude and intention positively associated across each subsample. Similar findings have been previously reported by many studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090198112455642">Craig et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1090198112455642">Hamilton &amp; White, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1090198112455642">Mummery et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1090198112455642">Sas-Nowosielski, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1090198112455642">Trost et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, PA interventions targeting overweight and obese adolescents should provide information to enhance beliefs in favorable outcomes (e.g., fun, enjoyable, improve health) associated with participation in regular PA.</p>
<p>PBC was the strongest correlate of PA behavior across the two subsamples highlighting the importance of developing cognitive and behavioral strategies (e.g., scheduling activities) to overcome PA barriers (e.g., when tired, having homework), and enhance overweight/obese adolescentâs confidence in adopting and maintaining participation in regular PA.</p>
<p>Across each subsample, a moderate association between PBC and intention was observed. Interestingly, a stronger relationship between PBC and PA behavior (than between PBC and intention) was found across each of the two subsamples which is also consistent with the results of the overall sample (<italic>N</italic> = 4,073) from this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1090198112455642">Plotnikoff et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the magnitude of the association between PBC and behavior was greater for the obese group versus the overweight group. However, these observations are inconsistent with previous studies on youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090198112455642">AraÃºjo-Soares et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198112455642">Baker et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090198112455642">Craig et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090198112455642">de Bruijn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1090198112455642">Godin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1090198112455642">Hagger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1090198112455642">Hamilton &amp; White, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1090198112455642">Martin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1090198112455642">Mummery et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1090198112455642">Sas-Nowosielski, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1090198112455642">Saunders et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1090198112455642">Trost et al., 2002</xref>), which report that PBC is more strongly associated with intention than with behavior. Possible reasons for the differences in these findings include the uniqueness of our sample (i.e., population-based sample) and the unique target population (i.e., overweight/obese) youth. The ceiling effects and limited variability for the intention measure may have also accounted for this finding; 82% of the sample answered 3 or higher on the 5-point Likert-type scale for this measure, whereas there was greater variability for the PBC measure.</p>
<p>PA behavior was more strongly associated with PBC (<italic>r</italic> = .60, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) than intention (<italic>r</italic> = .42, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) in the study sample. The mean intention score was high and it is plausible to suggest that overweight and obese youth have good intentions to be physically active but only those with high levels of confidence are able to translate their good intentions into action. Subjective norm presented a very limited effect for each subsample, suggesting a lack of perceived pressure from peers to be active, possibly as a result of inactive peers or intimidation from active peers. The association between social norm and PA behavior is low to moderate (standardized beta coefficients ranging from .02 to .29) in the existing TPB studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090198112455642">de Bruijn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1090198112455642">Hamilton &amp; White, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1090198112455642">Everson, Daley, &amp; Ussher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1090198112455642">Trost et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The relationship between intention and behavior was limited for the overweight subsample (Î² = .09). Furthermore, a negative association (Î² = â.04) between the two constructs was reported for the obese subsample. Although these pathways were not statistically significant, this interesting finding may indicate that obese adolescents have lower self-esteem, poor psychomotor skills and/or are physically limited when attempting to participate in PA because of excess weight; therefore, intention is not translated into behavior. Indeed, the obese subsample was less active (based on our PA behavior measure) than the overweight (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and normal weight (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) subgroups in the total study sample.</p>
<p>Less time spent in PA for overweight and obese adolescents, compared with healthy weight adolescents, has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090198112455642">Brownson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1090198112455642">Martinez-Gonzalez, Martinez, Hu, Gibney, &amp; Kearney, 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090198112455642">K. Ball, Crawford, and Owen (2000)</xref> suggest overweight and obesity to be related to shyness, embarrassment, and lack of motivation for engaging in PA. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090198112455642">Blanchard et al. (2005)</xref> reported reduced access to PA facilities for obese individuals in contrast to individuals of healthy weight.</p>
<p>Intention was found to mediate the relationship between the TPB variables and PA in the single-mediator models. The largest mediated effect was observed for attitude, suggesting that intention to be active is an important mediator for the relationship between attitude to be active and PA behavior. Intention was a significant mediator in the single-mediator models, however in the full-model test, intention had a limited association with behavior for both subsamples. This may be explained in part by the fact that PBC accounted for a greater proportion of the variance for behavior, along with the strong correlation between attitude and PBC, mitigating the intentionâbehavior relationship in the full model.</p>
<sec id="section19-1090198112455642">
<title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
<p>There are limitations that should be acknowledged when interpreting the study results. First, the cross-sectional design prevents the assessment of temporal causality. Second, although a validated measure of PA was used, objective measures (e.g., accelerometry and pedometry) were not included. Furthermore, height and weight assessments were self-reported. However, in a sample of 459 Alberta adolescents, intraclass correlation coefficients between self-reported and measured height was .88; whereas self-reported and measured weight was .93 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090198112455642">Calengor, 2007</xref>). To limit response burden, the brief TPB instrument did not include the expectancy Ã value components for the TPB constructs as specified in the full TPB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090198112455642">Ajzen, 1991</xref>), and brief measures of the TPB may have potentially limited the content validity of the constructs. Finally, the temporality of the measurements maybe a limitation as some of the TPB constructs were framed âover the next monthâ whereas PA was assessed âwithin the past 7-days.â However, we do not believe that the lack of consistency in temporality of measurement would have a substantial effect on our findings and subsequent conclusions.</p>
<p>To date, however, this report appears to be the only testing the TPB in a large population sample of overweight/obese adolescents. There are very few TPB studies that have operationalized the TPB in the PA domain and to our knowledge there are no interventions targeting this population that have used the TPB. This study also included mediating and moderating (by weight status) results. Other study strengths include use of valid measures and a Web-based platform for data collection which facilitated access to a large number of students over a large geographic area.</p>

<title>Study Implications</title>
<p>In summary, the relationships among TPB constructs in our study are similar to those reported in other adolescent PAâTPB studies (with the exception of intentionâs lack of correspondence with behavior in our sample, which is discussed below).</p>
<p>Results of our study provide valuable insight for explaining adolescent PA intention and behavior, which can be translated into sport, recreation, and educational settings. The present study indicates that PBC is the strongest correlate of PA behavior; whereas attitude plays a key role in the formation of PA intention for overweight and obese adolescents. Across both samples in our study, subjective norm provided the least contribution in explaining intention to be physically active. This may suggest that overweight/obese adolescents do not perceive social pressures as an important or apparent influence when contemplating PA. Rather, it may be that overweight/obese adolescents are overly self-conscious, and therefore, practitioners should be encouraged to use individualized strategies to promote participation in PA. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090198112455642">G. D. C. Ball et al. (2011)</xref> demonstrated that one-on-one lifestyle coaching approaches can improve measures of obesity in adolescents, and the use of patient-centered, motivation-based approaches to weight management have been recommended for this population group.</p>
<p>These findings have implications for tailoring and future intervention design in this population. To achieve greatest PA gains, future interventions should implement strategies that reflect our findings on the importance of attitude and especially PBC, for overweight/obese youth. Our results suggest that PA interventions aimed at overweight/obese adolescents should endeavor to provide information highlighting the benefits of participating in regular PA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090198112455642">Boudreau &amp; Godin, 2007</xref>), for example, making PA fun/enjoyable, and developing strategies to show the importance of being physically active. More important, strategies in developing confidence in participating in PA when tired, busy with homework, along with parental strategies for transportation to sporting activities, are required to enhance the efficacy and control for PA behavior change. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090198112455642">Blanchard et al. (2005)</xref> argue that improving self-efficacy along with access to PA facilities for overweight/obese adolescents may enhance participation in PA in this target population. A continued understanding of the issues faced by overweight/obese adolescents in increasing PA levels is necessary for the development of successful PA promotion strategies.</p>
<p>The limited association between intention and behavior reported in our study is noteworthy. Investigations on the intentionâbehavior relationship reveal that intentions do not always translate into behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1090198112455642">Gollwitzer &amp; Sheeran, 2006</xref>). âImplementation intentionsâ are âif-thenâ plans specifying <italic>when, where</italic> and <italic>how</italic> one will act in order to achieve a goal, so that individuals commit themselves to acting as soon as the specified situation is encountered. Forming âimplementation intentionsâ has been proposed as a potentially effective strategy to help people act on their positive intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1090198112455642">Gollwitzer &amp; Sheeran, 2006</xref>). Planning and goal setting have indeed, been shown to be associated with PA behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1090198112455642">Hurkmans et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1090198112455642">Vallance, Plotnikoff, Karvinen, Mackey, &amp; Courneya, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Future applied tests of the TPB to explain PA and programs to promote PA in this overweight/obese population should assess and operationalize implementation intentions through action planning and coping planning. Specifically, action planning should consider (a) which physical activities to participate in, (b) where to participate in the physical activities, (c) on which days to participate in the physical activities, and (d) the duration of participating in physical activities. Coping planning, a barrier-focused strategy which requires individuals to plan how they would overcome certain behavioral obstacles, should consider (a) what to do if obstacles arise, (b) how to cope with setbacks, (c) what to do in difficult situations, (d) which options will result in action, and (e) when extra effort is needed to prevent lapses.</p>
<p>Other social cognitive theories/integrated models along with multilevel ecological models are recommended to be tested in future research studies in the overweight/obese adolescent population to further provide an evidence base for designing programs for practitioners.</p>

<p>We used the 30-minute criterion to be consistent with the initial epidemiological study conducted 3 years prior to this study, to examine secular trends in PA levels and cognitions of this age group in the province of Alberta, Canada.
