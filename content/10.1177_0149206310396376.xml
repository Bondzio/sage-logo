<abstract>
<p>Research suggests that certain personality characteristics lead to greater (or lesser) withdrawal from work, yet little research has examined exactly how personality translates into withdrawal behavior. To address this question, the present study demonstrated that the approach-avoidance personality traits of extraversion and neuroticism each showed simultaneous positive and negative effects on job search behaviors of employed individuals depending on the mediating mechanism involved (i.e., ambition values, job search self-efficacy, perceived job challenge, work burnout, perceived financial inadequacy, and job satisfaction). The authors’ findings extend theoretical insights on the pathways linking dispositional traits and employee withdrawal behaviors and suggest how employers can more precisely anticipate and mitigate employees’ search for new employment.</p>

<p>The popular press and economic literature suggest that an aging workforce, increased globalization, greater reliance on intellectual capital, and related labor market factors will make employee retention increasingly critical. One important component of retention is job search behavior because, unlike work-related attitudes or intentions, it is a specific action undertaken by the individual to seek employment elsewhere. Thus, job search behaviors may reveal unique insights about the employee turnover process but earlier in the process than actual departure. Job search behavior is also an important construct to understand because employees may engage in such behavior for reasons other than turnover intentions, including networking with other professionals within the field, utilizing job offers as leverage when renegotiating employment contracts, and comparing current employment with alternative employment opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0149206310396376">Blau, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0149206310396376">Boswell, Boudreau, &amp; Dunford, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0149206310396376">Bretz, Boudreau, &amp; Judge, 1994</xref>). Therefore, job search behavior is an important outcome as organizations expend many resources to both replace individuals who use search behavior to leave and to manage relationships with employees who have other objectives for engaging in job search activity.</p>
<p>A long tradition of research focuses on situational variables that influence employees’ withdrawal behaviors, but only recently has attention been given to dispositional factors, such as personality, that affect the likelihood of job search and separation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0149206310396376">Boswell, Roehling, &amp; Boudreau, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0149206310396376">Boudreau, Boswell, Judge, &amp; Bretz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0149206310396376">Parker, Bindl, &amp; Strauss, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0149206310396376">Wright &amp; Bonett, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0149206310396376">Zimmerman, 2008</xref>). Prior research in this area has typically examined the joint effects of personality traits and contextual factors by regressing job search behavior on contextual factors first, followed by personality, with the increase in the variance explained demonstrating the incremental effect of personality traits. While useful, this approach fails to explain <italic>how</italic> personality traits affect job search behavior. Similarly, some research has examined the relationship between personality and job search and withdrawal behavior in meta-analytic terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0149206310396376">Kanfer, Wanberg, &amp; Kantrowitz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0149206310396376">Zimmerman, 2008</xref>), which demonstrates overall bivariate relationships but does not explain how personality motivates this behavior. Importantly, hidden within the overall bivariate effect, there may be both positive and negative effects of the same personality trait on job search depending on the mediating mechanism involved.</p>
<p>To address this gap, we develop and test a model of the motivational pathways that transmit the effects of personality onto job search. Our model builds on the personality-motivational perspective of job search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0149206310396376">Kanfer et al., 2001</xref>) with a hedonic perspective of motivation, which argues that individuals are motivated to approach pleasure and avoid pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0149206310396376">Elliot, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206310396376">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206310396376">Higgins, 1998</xref>). Beginning with two dimensions of personality, extraversion and neuroticism, we investigate how critical motivational forces transmit the effects of these traits on job search. In addition, in contrast to previous research with recent college graduates or unemployed individuals who are looking for work (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0149206310396376">Brown, Cober, Kane, Levy, &amp; Shalhoop, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0149206310396376">Kanfer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0149206310396376">Tay, Ang, &amp; Van Dyne, 2006</xref>), we focus on employed individuals. Thus, we study job search behavior from a perspective of retaining current employees rather than a perspective of unemployed individuals trying to find work.</p>
<p>Our model and results offer two primary contributions. First, we provide theoretical understanding and an empirical test of the mechanisms through which personality influences job search, including examining possible differential effects of the same personality trait on job search behavior. Second, our model suggests that in addition to focusing on the more stable elements of personality, managers can also focus their retention efforts on the more malleable motivational pathways linked to these personality traits that are proximal to employee job search.</p>

<title>Personality and Job Search Behavior</title>
<p>Job search has been defined as a self-regulation process involving a “purposive volitional pattern of action that begins with the identification and commitment to pursuing an employment goal” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0149206310396376">Kanfer et al., 2001</xref>, p. 838). According to this perspective, when people perceive a discrepancy between their current job and their employment goal, job search behavior is activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0149206310396376">Kanfer et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, job search is inherently a goal-directed behavior.</p>
<p>As argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0149206310396376">Elliot (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206310396376">1999</xref>), goal-directed behaviors are driven by motivational tendencies to approach and/or avoid goals. In particular, the approach and avoidance framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0149206310396376">Brockner &amp; Higgins, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0149206310396376">Elliot, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206310396376">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0149206310396376">Higgins, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206310396376">1998</xref>) argues that although goal-directed behavior can be influenced by the external environment, individuals’ motives and goals are initially determined by their neurobiological makeup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0149206310396376">Elliot &amp; Thrash, 2002</xref>). That is, portions of the brain correspond to activation and inhibition tendencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0149206310396376">Gray, 1987</xref>), and these tendencies influence whether individuals pursue approach and/or avoidance goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0149206310396376">Elliot &amp; Thrash, 2002</xref>). People who pursue approach goals to a greater extent are sensitive to the presence or absence of positive stimuli (e.g., rewards) and are primarily concerned with accomplishments and advancements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0149206310396376">Higgins, 1987</xref>). In contrast, those who pursue avoidance goals are sensitive to the presence or absence of negative stimuli (e.g., punishments) and are primarily concerned with duties and obligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0149206310396376">Brockner &amp; Higgins, 2001</xref>), using avoidance as their goal attainment strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0149206310396376">Higgins, 1997</xref>). One can be motivated by approach and avoidance goals simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0149206310396376">Elliot &amp; Thrash, 2002</xref>) because in any given situation individuals may perceive both potential rewards and punishments.</p>

<title>Approach-Avoidance Pathways to Search Model</title>
<p>Based on the approach-avoidance perspective, we propose our model of job search, which has two basic premises. First, employees search because they have the desire and perceived ability to advance in their careers and/or because of a desire to avoid negative aspects of their current job or organization. This is likely particularly true given that the participants in this study are high-level professionals who have been with their organizations for several years and who have also been proactively identified by an executive search firm. <italic>Approach</italic> motives correspond to a desire to “get ahead,” which can lead to job search when individuals seek advancement or growth via higher level positions, enhanced reputation, and the like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206310396376">Hogan, Curphy, &amp; Hogan, 1994</xref>). <italic>Avoidance</italic> motives correspond to a desire to escape the current work situation, which can lead to job search when employees are burned out (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0149206310396376">Thoresen, Kaplan, Barsky, de Chermont, &amp; Warren, 2003</xref>) or perceive financial inadequacies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0149206310396376">Tang, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0149206310396376">Tang, Furnham, &amp; Davis, 2002</xref>). Thus, approach and avoidance motives both lead to job search but for different reasons (i.e., through different pathways).</p>
<p>Second, our model proposes that approach and avoidance motives are differentially related to personality, with extraversion and neuroticism being the two personality dimensions most closely linked to these motives (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0149206310396376">Elliot &amp; Thrash, 2002</xref>). Extraversion and neuroticism are core personality traits that can be found in almost all major models of personality, including the five-factor model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0149206310396376">Costa &amp; McCrae, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0149206310396376">Norman, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0149206310396376">Tupes &amp; Christal, 1961</xref>) and three-factor models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0149206310396376">Clark &amp; Watson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206310396376">Eysenck &amp; Eysenck, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0149206310396376">Tellegen, 1985</xref>). In addition, both personality traits are strongly correlated with trait affect such as positive and negative affectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0149206310396376">Clark &amp; Watson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0149206310396376">G. J. Meyer &amp; Shack, 1989</xref>) and corresponding neurobiological temperaments that motivate behavior through activation and inhibition (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0149206310396376">Broke &amp; Battmann, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0149206310396376">Elliot &amp; Thrash, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0149206310396376">Pickering &amp; Gray, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>As extraversion and neuroticism are the underlying foundation of approach and avoidance motives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206310396376">Carver, Sutton, &amp; Scheier, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0149206310396376">Elliot &amp; Thrash, 2002</xref>; Gable, Reis, &amp; Elliot, 2002), they are therefore the most appropriate personality traits to examine from the approach-avoidance theoretical lens. Accordingly, we draw on approach-avoidance models of motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0149206310396376">Elliot &amp; Thrash, 2002</xref>) to propose that extraverts are likely to have <italic>approach</italic>-related motives and neurotic employees are likely to have <italic>avoidance-</italic>related motives to look for alternative jobs. Specifically, extraverts are likely to be motivated to “get ahead,” reflected in a strong desire for increased pay, recognition, and reputation as well as the belief that they are capable of finding a better position, even though they are also likely to be satisfied with their current position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206310396376">Judge, Heller, &amp; Mount, 2002</xref>). On the other hand, neurotic individuals are more sensitive to negative stimuli and more likely to have negative work-related attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206310396376">Judge, Heller, &amp; Mount, 2002</xref>) and thus engage in job search as a means to evade (i.e., “avoid”) the negative aspects of the current position or organization. However, we also expect that neurotics may wish to avoid the negative feedback that an unsuccessful job search might bring. Thus, a particular trait might simultaneously have both positive and negative indirect effects on job search depending on how it influences the various mediating forces. If this is true, then both theory and practice can be enhanced with a more precise understanding of how these simultaneous positive and negative effects occur and combine into overall effects on job search.</p>
<p>To test our model, we selected five mediating variables that reflect approach and/or avoidance motives related to job search: ambition, job search self-efficacy, perceived job challenge, burnout, and financial inadequacy. These five mediators were chosen based on their prominence in the job search literature as well as representing both individual and situational factors influencing employees’ job search behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0149206310396376">Boudreau et al., 2001</xref>). However, these five variables have neither been studied in unison, nor have they been included in a process model linking personality with withdrawal behavior. We classify each of the mediators based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206310396376">Elliot’s (1999)</xref> distinction that approach motives reflect positive or desirable goals, whereas avoidance motives reflect negative or undesirable possibilities. In particular, we conceptualized perceived job challenge as being affected by approach motives because job challenge has been conceived as a positive motivating factor that increases both employees’ job performance and job satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0149206310396376">Fried &amp; Ferris, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0149206310396376">Hackman &amp; Oldham, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0149206310396376">Judge, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0149206310396376">Morgeson &amp; Campion, 2003</xref>). In contrast, we suggest that work burnout and perceived financial inadequacy are associated with avoidance motives as both induce stress in employees and encourage those with higher levels of these two constructs to seek out new work environments that alleviate these negative factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0149206310396376">Blau, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0149206310396376">Furnham &amp; Argyle, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206310396376">Lee &amp; Ashforth, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0149206310396376">Leiter &amp; Maslach, 1988</xref>). However, we posit that ambition values and job search self-efficacy can represent either approach and avoidance motives, depending on the perspective of the individual. That is, ambition values can be motivated by a desire to get ahead through advancement and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206310396376">Hogan et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0149206310396376">Lucas, Diener, Grob, Suh, &amp; Shao, 2000</xref>) or be motivated by perceptions of inequity or feelings of envy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0149206310396376">Costa &amp; McCrae, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0149206310396376">Digman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0149206310396376">Hogan, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0149206310396376">Shaver, Schwartz, Kirson, &amp; O’Connor, 1987</xref>). Similarly, job search self-efficacy may positively correlate with approach motives through optimism and confidence in a larger social network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0149206310396376">Clark &amp; Watson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0149206310396376">G. J. Meyer &amp; Shack, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0149206310396376">Wanberg, Kanfer, &amp; Banas, 2000</xref>) or negatively associate with avoidance tendencies due to a fear of failure or a desire to avoid situation that induce anxiety or insecurity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0149206310396376">Gray, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0149206310396376">Shaver et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0149206310396376">Zuckerman, 1995</xref>). Finally, we also incorporate the key role of job satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0149206310396376">Mobley, 1977</xref>) in the model as a potential mediator between the approach/avoidance mediating mechanisms and job search behaviors. In the section that follows, we develop our specific hypotheses regarding the role of these mediating factors in linking the personality traits extraversion and neuroticism to job search behavior. Our overall model representing these relationships is presented as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0149206310396376">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Extraversion</title>
<p>Despite being thought of as primarily “sociability,” extraversion is a complex trait with several different facets representing approach tendencies. In fact, ongoing debate has focused around whether the core of the trait is best represented as reward sensitivity/ambition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206310396376">Hogan et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0149206310396376">Lucas et al., 2000</xref>), social attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206310396376">Ashton, Lee, &amp; Paunonen, 2002</xref>), or positive emotionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0149206310396376">Watson &amp; Clark, 1997</xref>). Furthermore, as a dispositional representation of state positive affect, extraversion reflects individuals’ tendencies to be optimistic, energetic, prideful, and ascendant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0149206310396376">Shaver et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0149206310396376">Watson &amp; Clark, 1997</xref>). Given its complexity, extraversion likely affects employees’ job search behavior through multiple approach-related mechanisms.</p>
<p>Approach-avoidance motivation theorists argue that extraversion is a key building block of approach temperament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0149206310396376">Elliot &amp; Thrash, 2002</xref>), suggesting that extraverts are likely to seek opportunities for growth. Extraversion has also been linked to key self-regulatory processes. For example, theorists have argued that extraverts are more likely to have a promotion focus than a prevention focus in their self-regulatory approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0149206310396376">McAdams &amp; Pals, 2006</xref>). Moreover, psychobiological research has linked extraversion to the behavioral activation system that is characterized by approach behavior and the striving for rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0149206310396376">Gray, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0149206310396376">Zuckerman, 1995</xref>). These arguments are consistent with research demonstrating that extraverts have a tendency to be ascendant and seek growth opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0149206310396376">Shaver et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0149206310396376">Tokar, Fischer, &amp; Subich, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0149206310396376">Watson &amp; Clark, 1997</xref>). Therefore, the ambition and ascendance aspects of extraversion would likely increase employees’ desire to leave and have a positive effect on job search behavior due to their wanting to approach achievement goals, such as “getting ahead” in their careers by obtaining a higher level position, greater income, or increased reputation beyond what their current employers provide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206310396376">Hogan et al., 1994</xref>). Extraverts are also more likely to have high job search self-efficacy due to their positive (i.e., “approach”) tendencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0149206310396376">Clark &amp; Watson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0149206310396376">G. J. Meyer &amp; Shack, 1989</xref>) and because they have greater social networks to facilitate the job search process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0149206310396376">Wanberg et al., 2000</xref>). These arguments are consistent with evidence that extraversion is related to generalized self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0149206310396376">Judge, Erez, Bono, &amp; Thoresen, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>However, employees who are higher in extraversion are also more likely to perceive themselves and their surroundings more positively and recall more positive than negative information about the work environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0149206310396376">Weiss &amp; Cropanzano, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0149206310396376">Zimmerman, 2008</xref>). Therefore, extraverted employees are likely to have more positive views of their jobs through increased perceptions of job challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206310396376">Shaw &amp; Gupta, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0149206310396376">Spector, Jex, &amp; Chen, 1995</xref>) and job satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206310396376">Judge, Heller, &amp; Mount, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0149206310396376">Thoresen et al., 2003</xref>) thus motivating an interest in maintaining these desirable job features. This would help counter the previously discussed positive effects on search by decreasing the desire to leave. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0149206310396376">Zimmerman (2008)</xref> found that higher levels of extraversion associate with overall lower levels of turnover intentions among employees. Thus, based on prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0149206310396376">Zimmerman, 2008</xref>) we propose that extraversion will have an overall negative relationship with job search behavior, but this will be the result of indirect effects that are both positive and negative through differing motivational forces.</p>

<title>Neuroticism</title>
<p>The personality trait of neuroticism has been consistently defined as being anxious, insecure, depressed, and fearful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0149206310396376">Costa &amp; McCrae, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0149206310396376">Digman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0149206310396376">Hogan, 1983</xref>). Just as extraversion has been linked to positive emotionality, neuroticism has shown a strong relationship with negative emotionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0149206310396376">Clark &amp; Watson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0149206310396376">G. J. Meyer &amp; Shack, 1989</xref>). As a dispositional representation of state negative affect, neuroticism reflects the general tendency to be discontent, nervous, and envious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0149206310396376">Shaver et al., 1987</xref>). Neuropsychological researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0149206310396376">Gray, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0149206310396376">Zuckerman, 1995</xref>) have tied neuroticism to the behavioral inhibition system that is characterized by people engaging in behaviors that would allow them to avoid situations that would cause stress, increase anxiety, or heighten insecurity. In general, these facets of neuroticism are expected to increase employees’ desires to avoid negative aspects of their work environment and thus have a positive overall effect on job search. In terms of the specific mechanisms driving this effect, because job attitudes are considered affective in nature, neurotic individuals are likely to have negative perceptions of their work environments, including lower job satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206310396376">Judge, Heller, &amp; Mount, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0149206310396376">Thoresen et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>This dissatisfaction with all aspects of the job, along with the general tendency for neurotic individuals’ to be discontented with their current situations, may lead such people to desire better opportunities elsewhere, such as greater pay or promotion opportunities. In addition, those lower in self-esteem, an important component of neuroticism, have been shown to attach greater value to monetary elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0149206310396376">Tang, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0149206310396376">Tang et al., 2002</xref>). We thus expect that people higher in neuroticism are likely to be more sensitive to monetary cues that indicate that they may not be as valued as other employees, which may translate into such individuals placing greater weight on status-related indicators such as rewards, recognition, and reputation (i.e., higher ambition values) as well as avoid the situation of perceiving themselves as undervalued by their current employers by seeking out greater rewards. Consistent with this, research by Tang and colleagues has shown that people with lower self-esteem are likely to believe that they fail to undertake proper financial planning and perceive an overall inadequacy regarding their financial standing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0149206310396376">Tang, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0149206310396376">Tang et al., 2002</xref>), which may motivate them to search for employment alternatives to elevate their financial standing. Employees higher in neuroticism are also likely to experience more work-related burnout given the tendency toward anxiety, insecurity, and the like. This is supported by previous meta-analytic research showing a strong relationship between neuroticism and work-related stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0149206310396376">Swider &amp; Zimmerman, 2010</xref>). Therefore, neurotic individuals would seek to avoid workplace burnout by seeking a new work environment that may offer escape from their job-related stress and anxiety.</p>
<p>Recent meta-analytic evidence indicates that neuroticism relates to higher withdrawal cognitions and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0149206310396376">Zimmerman, 2008</xref>). However, Zimmerman found a weak, but significant, <italic>negative</italic> direct effect between neuroticism and actual turnover decisions after controlling for job performance, job satisfaction, and turnover intentions. He argued that neurotic individuals may dislike their jobs and intend to quit but also doubt their ability to find other employment or be insecure about exposing themselves to evaluation on the job market. This theorizing is consistent with the insecurity aspects of neuroticism as well as the tenets of avoidance motivation and suggests that there may be a negative relationship with job search self-efficacy due to lower perceptions of their ability to leave. In essence, although neurotic employees may wish to avoid the negative feelings induced by their current work environment, they would also wish to avoid the possibility of receiving negative feedback while seeking new employment (i.e., not receiving a job offer). Thus, whereas we expect an overall positive relationship between neuroticism and job search behavior, there are likely to be both positive and negative motivational mechanisms acting on search behavior.</p>

<title>Ambition values</title>
<p>Higher levels of ambition, defined as one’s goal to achieve higher levels of ascendency and power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206310396376">Hogan et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0149206310396376">Hogan &amp; Hogan, 1995</xref>), are likely to compel employees to engage in job search by increasing their desire to seek upward mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0149206310396376">Bretz et al., 1994</xref>). Searching for a new job is often seen as a key way to obtain work-related indicators of ascendency and power, such as higher pay, recognition, and reputation. Receiving an alternative employment offer can be used either as leverage to obtain a promotion and/or increased pay from a current employer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0149206310396376">Boswell, Boudreau, &amp; Dunford, 2004</xref>) or as an opportunity to transition to a job with greater rewards. In support of this, prior research has found positive relationships between ambition and job search behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0149206310396376">Boudreau et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0149206310396376">Bretz et al., 1994</xref>). Interestingly, one’s ambition may have little to do with level of satisfaction with the current job because both individuals who are satisfied and those who are dissatisfied can be driven by their ambitions to continually search for new and better opportunities regardless of whether they like their current jobs. This rationale is supported by previous research that found weak relationships between the importance of rewards and job satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0149206310396376">Tang &amp; Gilbert, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0149206310396376">Tang &amp; Kim, 1999</xref>) and between ambition and job satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0149206310396376">Boudreau et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0149206310396376">Bretz et al., 1994</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0149206310396376">Tang, Kim, and Tang (2002)</xref> showed that employees with a high rewards orientation were just as likely to leave regardless of their level of job satisfaction.

<title>Job search self-efficacy</title>
<p>Self-efficacy involves individuals’ expectancies regarding their abilities to successfully attain performance goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0149206310396376">Bandura, 1977</xref>), with task-specific self-efficacy reflecting their beliefs that they can perform on a specific task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0149206310396376">Stajkovic &amp; Luthans, 1998</xref>). Individuals with stronger levels of self-efficacy tend to dedicate their effort to the task-specific demands, have higher levels of confidence in meeting those demands, and will exert more effort and show greater persistence when encountering situations that prove difficult or demanding. Job search self-efficacy refers specifically to individuals’ beliefs that they are capable of performing the behaviors required to obtain a new job (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206310396376">Kanfer &amp; Hulin, 1985</xref>). That is, higher job search self-efficacy will increase employees’ perceptions of their ability to be successful in the search for alternative employment, thus leading them to be more likely to initiate a job search. Several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0149206310396376">Blau, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206310396376">Kanfer &amp; Hulin, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0149206310396376">Moynihan, Roehling, LePine, &amp; Boswell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0149206310396376">Saks &amp; Ashforth, 1999</xref>) have found that job search self-efficacy positively affects job search behavior.</p>
<p>However, we also expect that job search self-efficacy will be positively related to job satisfaction, thus also having an indirect negative effect on job search. First, generalized self-efficacy has been found to have moderate to strong positive relationships with both job satisfaction and job performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0149206310396376">Judge &amp; Bono, 2001</xref>). As generalized self-efficacy reflects how people typically feel about their ability to perform various tasks, we believe that the relationships with satisfaction and performance will also hold true for job search self-efficacy. Second, although employees who are better performers will likely perceive themselves as more marketable, they are also likely to receive greater rewards from their employers thereby enhancing their job satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0149206310396376">Allen &amp; Griffeth, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0149206310396376">Trevor, Gerhart, &amp; Boudreau, 1997</xref>). Third, employees who perceive themselves as being able to leave if they so desired would not feel “trapped” in their current job, which would relieve some of the negative affect attributable to less desirable aspects of the job.

<title>Perceived job challenge</title>
<p>Organizational researchers have long sought to identify aspects of the work performed that influence job attitudes and withdrawal behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0149206310396376">Herzberg, Mausner, &amp; Snyderman, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0149206310396376">Maslow, 1954</xref>). Based on this, organizations have attempted to “enrich” jobs to make them more desirable and motivating. Recent research in the work design literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0149206310396376">Judge, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0149206310396376">Morgeson &amp; Campion, 2003</xref>) suggests that job scope is an important aspect of work design consistent with the job characteristics model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0149206310396376">Hackman &amp; Oldham, 1976</xref>), representing employees’ judgments regarding the breadth and depth of the work they perform. The benefit of increased job scope is feeling challenged in one’s job through greater use of one’s skills and abilities.

The conservation of resources theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0149206310396376">Hobfoll &amp; Freedy, 1993</xref>) suggests that to cope with burnout, one may engage in coping responses including increased negative attitudes regarding the work environment and withdrawal from the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0149206310396376">Leiter &amp; Maslach, 1988</xref>).

<title>Perceived financial inadequacy</title>
<p>Perceived financial inadequacy is a subjective judgment by individuals that their monetary standings are insufficient to meet their financial obligations and goals. These subjective evaluations are important as employees may not feel financially secure even when their objective incomes are high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0149206310396376">Furnham &amp; Argyle, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0149206310396376">Oswald, 1997</xref>). People who believe that they are not financially secure are more apt to seek to resolve this situation, typically not by reducing spending but rather by increasing income (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0149206310396376">Furnham &amp; Argyle, 1998</xref>). As the majority of individuals receive most of their income through employment, the primary way to increase income is by obtaining higher pay in the current job or by finding a higher paying position elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0149206310396376">Furnham &amp; Argyle, 1998</xref>). Furthermore, this dependency on employment for income is likely to cause people who believe that they are not financially secure to see their employers, at least partially, as the source of their economic woes because it is their employers who make pay decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0149206310396376">Furnham &amp; Argyle, 1998</xref>). Although we recognize that employers often provide the wealth their employees do possess, they are also the primary target for employees who believe that they should be paid more either based on performance, need, or relative standing versus peers. Therefore, these employees would hold negative attitudes toward the job and have a greater desire to search for new employment where compensation may be more aligned with their needs and goals. Consistent with this, research by Tang and colleagues has shown that people who fail to undertake proper financial planning tend to have lower job satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0149206310396376">Tang &amp; Gilbert, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0149206310396376">Tang &amp; Kim, 1999</xref>).

<title>Job satisfaction</title>
<p>As a key work-related attitude, job satisfaction plays an important role in employee withdrawal. Attitudes toward the job influence beliefs about the utility of leaving the organization, which eventually leads to job search and turnover behavior. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0149206310396376">Hoppock (1935</xref>: 5) stated, “Whether or not one finds his employment sufficiently satisfactory to continue in it . . . is a matter of the first importance to employer and employee.” As such, organizational researchers often place job satisfaction as the primary antecedent in the turnover process. In fact, almost all withdrawal models incorporate the relationship between work-related attitudes and withdrawal cognition and behavior at their core. Based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0149206310396376">Mobley’s (1977)</xref> process model of withdrawal, job satisfaction does not directly affect turnover; instead, job attitudes are translated into withdrawal cognitions and job search behavior.

In sum, we put forth three final hypotheses regarding the mediational relationships and an overall model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0149206310396376">Figure 1</xref>) that reflects all of our hypotheses.</p>
<list id="list9-0149206310396376" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 9</italic>: The effects of extraversion on job satisfaction and job search behavior will be fully mediated by ambition values, job search self-efficacy, and perceived job challenge.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 10</italic>: The effects of neuroticism on job satisfaction and job search behavior will be fully mediated by ambition values, job search self-efficacy, work burnout, and perceived financial inadequacy.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 11</italic>: The effects of perceived job challenge and work burnout on job search behavior will be fully mediated through job satisfaction, while the effects of job search self-efficacy and perceived financial inadequacy on job search behavior will be partially mediated through job satisfaction.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Taken together, the above hypotheses compose a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0149206310396376">Figure 1</xref>) of the motivational pathways linking approach-avoidance personality traits, extraversion and neuroticism, to employee job search. Although prior research has considered the relationships among some of the variables in the model examined here, the present study seeks to understand the complex process by which employees’ dispositional tendencies linked to the desire to get ahead and/or escape negative aspects of the current situation motivate the search for alternative employment.</p>

<title>Sample and Procedure</title>
<p>We surveyed high-level professionals listed in the databases of a search firm over two time periods to minimize possible percept-percept bias. The initial survey, which assessed all study variables except job search behavior, was sent to each person listed in the database (approximately 10,000 high-level professionals). Because <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0149206310396376">Mobley’s (1977)</xref> process model of withdrawal suggests that work attitudes do not affect job search behavior until after an intervening period of withdrawal cognitions, job search over the preceding 6 months was assessed on a follow-up survey distributed to initial survey respondents 1 year later. This helped ensure that all job search behavior asked about in the survey occurred after the employees reported their work-related attitudes and perceptions and that sufficient time elapsed to capture the search process. A total of 587 employees (of 1,601 initial survey respondents; 37% follow-up response rate) responded to both surveys. No incentives were used for either survey. After listwise deletion and removing individuals who were not employed by the same organization across the two time periods (188 people indicated that they were no longer employed by the same organization), the analyses and results were based on a final sample of 362 employees. In comparing those individuals included in the final sample to those who were no longer at their prior employers when job search was assessed (follow-up survey), the latter group had significantly lower job satisfaction (<italic>M</italic><sub>stayers</sub> = 4.7, <italic>M</italic><sub>leavers</sub> = 4.5; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and higher job search behavior (<italic>M</italic><sub>stayers</sub> = 1.8, <italic>M</italic><sub>leavers</sub> = 2.0; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), though the magnitude of the differences was small. None of the other study variables (e.g., extraversion, neuroticism) or demographic variables (e.g., age, gender, industry, level) were significantly different.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the search firm operates on retainer by its client companies and does not accept resumes from people searching for jobs; rather, it identifies candidates in response to client needs through publicly available information (e.g., professional association lists, organizational charts, corporate directories). That is, the hiring organizations are the search firm’s customers, not the participants in the sample. Thus, participants of this study are likely to be typical of the general population of professionals in their search activity. The search firm serves clients of all sizes, industries, and regions, further suggesting that this sample is representative of the target population.</p>
<p>The surveys were prepared and mailed by the search firm. Participants were instructed to return the survey (business reply envelope included) directly to the researchers, under assurances of strict confidentiality. Surveys were encoded so that they could be matched across time periods. Respondents were primarily male (89%) and married (89%) and had been in their jobs an average of 3.0 years and with the present organization 5.6 years. The average respondent was 49 years old (range = 29-68). Respondents represented various industries including the manufacturing (33%), services (28%), finance (14%), transportation (7%), and retail (2%) sectors. Respondents were from throughout the United States, with 15% from the West, 27% from the Midwest, 13% from the Southwest, 18% from the South, and 27% from the Northeast. Of the respondents, 35% indicated that they were not actively searching for a new job, while 65% were actively looking to some extent. Over the period of time that the data were collected, the average national unemployment rate was 4.6%, with industry-specific unemployment at 5.2% for manufacturing, 4.9% for retail, 4.3% for transportation, 4.9% for information services, 2.9% for finance, and 5.6% for other services.</p>
<p>It was difficult to estimate the overall response rate precisely as it was unknown how many initial surveys were undeliverable due to incorrect and/or outdated contact information in the search firm database. However, we examined sample representativeness by comparing our respondent sample to the survey population on information contained in the search firm’s database (e.g., compensation, demographics, hierarchical level, industry, company size). Only age (<italic>M</italic><sub>respondent</sub> = 51.5, <italic>M</italic><sub>nonrespondent</sub> = 50.0; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and being from the financial sector (<italic>M</italic><sub>respondent</sub> = 0.14, <italic>M</italic><sub>nonrespondent</sub> = 0.19; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) revealed statistically significant differences, and the magnitudes of the differences were small, suggesting sample bias was not an issue.</p>
<p>Comparing those individuals who responded to both surveys to those who responded to only the first survey revealed that the former group had higher job tenure (<italic>M</italic><sub>respondent T1-T2</sub> = 3.0, <italic>M</italic><sub>respondent T1 only</sub> = 2.7; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and reported lower burnout (<italic>M</italic><sub>respondent T1-T2</sub> = 2.4, <italic>M</italic><sub>respondent T1 only</sub> = 2.5; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), though the magnitudes of the differences were again quite small. None of the other study variables (e.g., extraversion, neuroticism, job satisfaction) or demographic or work variables (e.g., age, gender, industry, level) were significantly different.</p>

<p>We used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0149206310396376">Saucier’s (1994)</xref> “mini-markers” scale to assess the personality traits. Eight adjectives represented each personality trait, and respondents were asked to indicate the extent to which each trait accurately describes them (1 = <italic>extremely inaccurate</italic>, 7 = <italic>extremely accurate</italic>). Sample items include bold and energetic (extraversion, α = .85) and fretful and temperamental (neuroticism, α = .78).</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section19-0149206310396376">
<title>Burnout</title>
<p>Burnout was assessed with three items from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0149206310396376">Maslach Burnout Inventory (1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0149206310396376">Maslach &amp; Jackson, 1986</xref>).

<sec id="section20-0149206310396376">

<sec id="section21-0149206310396376">
<title>Job satisfaction</title>
<p>We used the three-item measure of job satisfaction from the Michigan Organizational Assessment Questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0149206310396376">Cammann, Fichman, Jenkins, &amp; Klesh, 1983</xref>).

<sec id="section22-0149206310396376">
<title>Job search behavior</title>
<p>Job search behavior was measured with a 12-item scale from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0149206310396376">Blau (1993)</xref>. Individuals were asked to report the frequency (1 = <italic>never [0 times]</italic>, 5 = <italic>very frequently [10 or more times]</italic>) in which they engaged in various search behaviors (e.g., sent out resumes, interviewed with prospective employers) in the past 6 months.

<title>Analyses</title>
<p>The covariance matrix was analyzed with latent path analysis using LISREL 8.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0149206310396376">Jöreskog &amp; Sörbom, 2004</xref>). All of the variables were corrected for measurement error based on their coefficients alpha. We tested three models to compare the mediating effects of the study variables. Model 1 tested a strong form of our hypotheses by testing the relationship between personality and job search as fully mediated through the motivational forces. To relax these constraints, we tested two alternative models. The second model added two direct paths from extraversion and neuroticism to job satisfaction, and, in contrast, the third model added two direct paths from extraversion and neuroticism to job search. As such, for comparison purposes, Models 2 and 3 are both nested in Model 1.</p>
<p>We used several criteria to evaluate model fit. We report the chi-square test statistic but note that it is largely affected by sample size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0149206310396376">Bentler &amp; Bonett, 1980</xref>). We also examined a variety of fit indices including the root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0149206310396376">Steiger, 1990</xref>), the comparative fit index (CFI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0149206310396376">Bentler, 1990</xref>), the goodness of fit index (GFI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0149206310396376">Jöreskog &amp; Sörbom, 1996</xref>), the normed fit index (NFI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0149206310396376">Bentler &amp; Bonett, 1980</xref>), and the standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR).</p>

<p>All three models produced at least moderately good fit as indicated by the fit indices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0149206310396376">Bollen, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206310396376">Cheung &amp; Rensvold, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0149206310396376">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0149206310396376">Kline, 2005</xref>). To test whether the fit of Model 1 was improved by adding paths from extraversion and neuroticism to satisfaction (Model 2) or to job search (Model 3), we examined the differences in the fit indices after adding the additional paths and we performed a chi-square difference test between each model and Model 1. The fit statistics of Model 2 were the same or worse than Model 1, with Model 2 possessing fewer degrees of freedom. In addition, the chi-square difference between the two models was not significant, indicating a preference for the more parsimonious Model 1. In addition, the direct paths from extraversion and neuroticism to job satisfaction were not significant. However, the fit statistics for Model 3 were generally better than those for Model 1. Furthermore, the chi-square difference between Model 1 and Model 3 was significant (<inline-formula id="inline-formula1-0149206310396376">

<p>Hypothesis 1 predicted that extraversion would be positively related to ambition, job search self-efficacy, perceived job challenge, and job satisfaction but negatively related to job search. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0149206310396376">Figure 2</xref>, the path coefficients between extraversion and the three mediating forces were statistically significant at .43, .38, and .26 for ambition, job search self-efficacy, and perceived job challenge, respectively. In addition, the total effects of extraversion on job satisfaction and job search were .16 and –.22 (both <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .05), respectively. These results support Hypothesis 1.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 2 predicted that neuroticism would be positively related to ambition, work burnout, perceived financial inadequacy, and job search but negatively related to job search self-efficacy, perceived job challenge, and job satisfaction. The path coefficients between neuroticism and the mediating forces were statistically significant at .22, .52, .31, and –.28 for ambition, work burnout, perceived financial inadequacy, and job search self-efficacy, respectively. Neuroticism had total effects on job satisfaction and job search behavior of –.32 and .24 (both <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .05), respectively. These results support Hypothesis 2.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 3 predicted that ambition would be positively related to job search. A significant path was found (β = .48, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), supporting Hypothesis 3. Hypotheses 4-7 dealt with the motivational forces predicting job satisfaction and job search, and Hypothesis 8 then predicted a negative relationship between job satisfaction and job search. Job search self-efficacy was positively related to job satisfaction (β = .10, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) as well as directly related to job search behavior (β = .23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; total effect of .19, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), supporting Hypothesis 4. Hypothesis 5 was supported as perceived job challenge was positively related to job satisfaction (β = .52, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and had a negative total effect on job search of –.21 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Hypothesis 6 was supported given that burnout was negatively related to job satisfaction (β = –.45, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and had a positive total effect on job search (.19, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Hypothesis 7 was supported as perceived financial inadequacy was negatively related to job satisfaction (β = –.20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and also had a positive direct effect on job search (β = .38, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; total effect of .46, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). In support of Hypothesis 8, job satisfaction was negatively related to job search behavior (β = –.41, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).</p>
<p>Hypotheses 9-11 involved the mediating mechanisms for the relationships discussed. Hypothesis 9 predicted that the effect of extraversion on satisfaction and job search would be fully mediated by ambition, job search self-efficacy, and perceived job challenge. The best fitting model (Model 3) demonstrated that though the effects of extraversion on job satisfaction were fully mediated by ambition, job search self-efficacy, and perceived job challenge, extraversion affected job search behavior above and beyond these variables. The total indirect effects of extraversion on job satisfaction was .17 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and on job search was .22 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), with the latter composed of both negative indirect effects through perceived job challenge and job search self-efficacy (–.07) and positive indirect effects through ambition values and job search self-efficacy (.29). Thus, Hypothesis 9 is not supported as we found only partial mediation of the relationship between extraversion and job search.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 10 proposed that the effects of neuroticism on job satisfaction and job search would be fully mediated by ambition, job search self-efficacy, perceived job challenge, work burnout, and perceived financial inadequacy. We did find full mediation of neuroticism with a total indirect effect on job satisfaction of –.32 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and a total indirect effect on job search of .29 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), with the latter composed of both negative indirect effects through job search self-efficacy (–.07) and positive indirect effects through the other mediating constructs (.36). Although the best fitting model included a path from neuroticism to job search, this path was nonsignificant (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .05). The combination of a nonsignificant direct effect between neuroticism and job search with the previously discussed significant mediating relationships supports Hypothesis 10.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 11 predicted that job satisfaction would fully mediate the effects of perceived job challenge and work burnout on job search and partially mediate the effects of job search self-efficacy and perceived financial inadequacy on job search. To test this, we added paths to Model 3 from all of the motivational forces to both job satisfaction and job search behavior. With the addition of these paths, the chi-square was not significantly improved (<inline-formula id="inline-formula2-0149206310396376">

</inline-formula> = 0.92, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05), the SRMR, GFI, CFI, and NFI statistics were unchanged, and the RMSEA was worse (.091). In addition, the direct paths from perceived job challenge and work burnout to job search were not significant. Based on these results, we concluded that the more parsimonious mediating model (Model 3) provided at least equivalent fit, which supports Hypothesis 11.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Based on the approach-avoidance framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0149206310396376">Brockner &amp; Higgins, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0149206310396376">Elliot, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206310396376">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0149206310396376">Higgins, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206310396376">1998</xref>), our research suggests that employees with different personality traits may be differentially motivated to search for alternative employment. Yet the existing job search literature has largely overlooked such explanatory factors, revealing little about <italic>how</italic> personality influences search activity. We note that while some of the variables included in this study may have been previously examined as bivariate relationships or incremental effects in a regression analyses, such methods do little to explain the complexity of the relationships within a process model of job search behavior. In the absence of research examining such mediating mechanisms, the job search literature provides managers with little guidance about how to best prevent employees with different personalities from searching for new employment opportunities. We found that extraversion and neuroticism had statistically significant unique effects (average β = │.34│) on the mediating motivational forces, which in turn had significant unique effects on job satisfaction (average β = │.32│) and job search behavior (average β = │.31│). As such, we contribute both theoretical and practical insight to explain “why” employees may be predisposed to seek alternative employment.</p>
<p>Focusing first on extraversion, our results showed that extraverted individuals exhibit higher ambition and job search self-efficacy, which are subsequently related to greater job search. However, by perceiving greater job challenge and feeling as if they could find another job if needed, such individuals are also more satisfied with their jobs, which ultimately related to a decreased tendency to search for alternative employment. Taken together, these findings suggest counteracting positive and negative effects of extraversion on job search that, on one hand, may influence an individual to seek new employment (i.e., through ambition and search self-efficacy) but, on the other, may facilitate retention in the present job (i.e., through perceived job challenge and job satisfaction). These findings may help explain the weak effects (and/or suppressor effect) often found in prior research on the relationship between extraversion and job search (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0149206310396376">Boswell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0149206310396376">Boudreau et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>We found similar counteracting effects for neuroticism on job search behavior. In particular, neuroticism was associated positively with ambition, burnout, and perceived financial inadequacy. These motivational forces then were associated with greater job search, directly and mediated through lower job satisfaction. On the other hand, neuroticism was associated with lower job search self-efficacy, which in turn was related to reduced job search. Again, these findings reveal important insight regarding the divergent pathways by which dispositional tendencies motivate job search behavior.</p>
<p>We note that there appear to be stronger countervailing mechanisms at work for extraversion than for neuroticism, where the effects were more consistently positive in relation to job search. Yet the findings that both extraversion and neuroticism may simultaneously increase and decrease the likelihood that an individual would engage in job search behavior supports the importance of greater precision in conceptualizing and measuring the complex goal-directed nature of personality traits in predicting behavior. Models linking personality to employee withdrawal should thus consider the possible opposing tendencies fostered by one’s disposition.</p>
<p>Our findings are consistent with the approach-avoidance theoretical perspective of personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0149206310396376">Brockner &amp; Higgins, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0149206310396376">Elliot, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206310396376">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0149206310396376">Higgins, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206310396376">1998</xref>), along with related perspectives such as self-regulatory theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0149206310396376">McAdams &amp; Pals, 2006</xref>) and the psychobiological approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0149206310396376">Gray, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0149206310396376">Zuckerman, 1995</xref>). The positive and negative effects of extraversion on job search behaviors were explained through motivational forces consistent with allowing one to “get ahead” through growth or advancement mechanisms either in the current position or in a new job, including higher ambition values, stronger job search self-efficacy, and greater perceived job challenge. Conversely, the positive and negative effects of neuroticism on job search were explained by motivational forces consistent with avoiding negative work-related experiences, such as feelings of being undervalued, burned out, financially inadequate, and rejected by the job market.</p>
<p>Interestingly, though we examined an array of important and theoretically justified forces through which dispositions influence job search behavior, extraversion still had a significant direct effect on job search. As the effects of extraversion on job satisfaction were fully mediated, any unmediated effect for extraversion on job search is above and beyond motivational forces related to job satisfaction. One construct that might explain the remaining effect is the concept of embeddedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0149206310396376">Allen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0149206310396376">Mitchell, Holtom, Lee, Sablynski, &amp; Erez, 2001</xref>). Specifically, Mitchell and colleagues argued that the more links that employees have to others within their organizations, the harder it would be to leave. Because extraverts are more likely to seek out social relationships, they are more likely to have a greater number of links to others within their organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0149206310396376">McCrae &amp; Costa, 1997</xref>) and therefore would be less likely to seek alternative employment. As the number of links would not necessarily affect how employees’ felt about their particular jobs, it may help explain the negative effects from extraversion to job search that were not mediated through the variables examined here.</p>
<sec id="section26-0149206310396376">
<title>Practical Implications</title>
<p>Our findings suggest that the link between personality and search for alternative employment is much more complex than simply a main and/or clear directional effect. Though recent meta-analytic work (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0149206310396376">Zimmerman, 2008</xref>) suggests the overall effect on withdrawal-related cognitions is negative for extraversion but positive for neuroticism, the present study reveals that there are varying motivational forces operating that will help to explain one’s tendency to search. Thus, although hiring applicants higher on extraversion or lower on neuroticism may yield employees who are less likely to subsequently engage in job search behavior, employers can reinforce these traits in more nuanced ways to reduce job search and potentially increase retention. For example, our findings suggest that extraverts will more likely have higher ambition and greater job search self-efficacy, indicating that if these individuals do not perceive opportunities for greater achievement in their own organizations, they may seek them elsewhere. Therefore, organizations that attract extraverts can capitalize on this and reinforce the negative effect of extraversion on job search by providing clearly targeted employee development opportunities, particularly for high performers. Our findings suggest that providing employees with a clear sense of the path to meet their ambitions may be particularly useful in reducing job search for those high on extraversion.</p>
<p>Regarding our findings for neuroticism, employees higher on the trait demonstrated a tendency to experience greater burnout and greater financial inadequacy. Thus, effective retention efforts for neurotic employees include participative management practices and job redesign interventions to mitigate potential burnout tendencies. Employees high on neuroticism may benefit from greater resources during periods of increased workload, perhaps in the form of employee assistance programs or counseling to alleviate felt stress and/or financial worries. Implementation of retirement savings plans may also minimize the likelihood of job search due to financial worries. In sum, the present findings illuminate how and why individual differences lead to different work-related values, attitudes, and beliefs, which may allow managers to preempt employees from engaging in job search. This may be more effective than trying to retain an employee who has already made the decision to leave and found an opportunity elsewhere.</p>
<p>Although not the primary contribution of our study, our findings also extend beyond the specific effect for those high in extraversion or neuroticism to any individual who may experience the motivational forces examined here. For example, employees who perceive greater job challenge will be more satisfied with the job and less likely to search while those with higher ambition values will be more likely to search regardless of the level of job satisfaction. Or those employees who are experiencing work burnout will be less satisfied with their jobs and thus more likely to search for new employment, while those with greater perceptions of financial inadequacy will be more likely to search, with some of the effect independent of their level of job satisfaction. Therefore, our findings also inform managers on how to enhance job satisfaction as well as prevent all types of employees from seeking alternative employment based on the five work-related motivational forces examined in this study.</p>
<p>We would like to note that while the countervailing forces for each personality trait may first appear to pose a conundrum to managers in that the differential effects within each trait could “wash out” whether specific people would be more or less likely to quit, in actuality these countervailing forces give managers more of an opportunity to influence their employees’ job search behaviors as each effect through one of the mediators could be separately targeted. For example, although extraverts are more ambitious, which leads to greater job search, they also perceive greater job challenge, which leads to less job search. Therefore, managers can work to address both issues and have a greater impact on extraverts searching for jobs. That is, as a key contribution of this study, by breaking down the effects of personality through various pathways, managers can more effectively address what may lead certain individuals to search. It is when the pathways are not understood (e.g., focusing only on the overall bivariate effect) that managers would miss important pieces to the puzzle.</p>
<p>A key difference in this study compared to most other job search research is our emphasis on job search of current employees versus unemployed job seekers. This distinction is important for two reasons. First, our study informs organizations on how to minimize employee job search behavior, thus taking a proactive approach to mitigating potential turnover. Second, currently employed individuals have a different set of factors that influence their search behavior. These differences can result in the same antecedents of search behavior to influence people in starkly contrasting ways. Specifically, while previous research on <italic>unemployed</italic> job seekers has found that individuals higher in extraversion were more likely to search for a job (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0149206310396376">Kanfer et al., 2001</xref>), our findings suggest that <italic>employed</italic> individuals who are higher on extraversion were less likely to search for a new position. Although both employed and unemployed extraverts are more ambitious and possess higher job search self-efficacy (both of which have positive effects on job search behavior), employed extraverts also tend to have more positive views of their work environments and higher job satisfaction, which leads them to actually engage in less job search behavior. Therefore, the context of the job search behavior is critical to understanding the underlying mechanisms that are related to such behavior.</p>

<title>Limitations, Strengths, and Future Research Directions</title>
<p>It is important to note both the limitations and strengths of this study. First, there may be some concerns regarding the representativeness of the sample used in our study. Although the sample included employees from a wide array of industries and professions, the focus on high-level professionals may constrain our ability to generalize to employees at lower hierarchical levels within an organization. Furthermore, because the search firm does not accept resumes from job seekers, this could contribute to a “high-performer” bias in the sample. However, as the search firm broadly identifies candidates from several sources of information (e.g., organizational charts, directories) that would include all professional-level employees, this should reduce concerns about only high performers being included in our sample. In addition, those individuals who were no longer employed by the same organization across both time periods were dropped from the analyses to ensure that subsequent job search behavior could be conceptually linked to the work attitudes and perceptions assessed the prior year. This did eliminate some employees who had been searching for a new job (though some may have left for involuntary reasons) and thus could affect the relationships with job search behavior observed in this study. However, the mean comparisons of respondents to nonrespondents as well as the comparison to those who were no longer employed by the same organization indicate sample bias was not a significant concern.</p>
<p>A second limitation is that common method variance may be an issue because the variables examined here were generated from self-reports. On the other hand, an important strength of this study was the data collection over two periods, which helps to reduce concerns related to common-method variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0149206310396376">Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, &amp; Podsakoff, 2003</xref>) for the primary outcome of interest in this study (i.e., job search behavior). In addition, the magnitude and pattern of the observed correlations tend to allay concerns about common method variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0149206310396376">Spector, 2006</xref>). That is, instead of correlations that are consistently high across all relationships, the magnitudes of the relationships varied and were typically moderate. Nevertheless, future research could examine these variables, the motivational forces in particular, as reported by coworkers or family members.</p>
<p>Another limitation related to our method involved the focus on job search behavior as the dependent variable. Though job search is a strong predictor of actual turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0149206310396376">Griffeth et al., 2000</xref>) and an important variable in its own right as an indicator of employee attachment to an organization, a more complete model would include other withdrawal-related variables including voluntary turnover. Furthermore, focusing on an array of different mediating mechanisms allowed us to explain an overall model of the pathways linking extraversion and neuroticism to job search. Yet future research could seek to explain the remaining unmediated effect for extraversion, such as its possible effect on “embeddedness” in the organization. Finally, as we included only the two personality traits most relevant based on the theoretical framework of focus here, future process models could explore how the remaining five-factor traits affect job search behavior and, in turn, actual turnover. A post hoc analysis of data collected on the remaining traits in the five-factor model of personality (conscientiousness, agreeableness, and openness to experience) revealed nonsignificant relationships between these personality traits and job search behavior (–.02, –.06, and .04, respectively).</p>
<p>We see several additional avenues for future research. First, it would be interesting to investigate the potential moderating role of industry in the relationships examined here as differences in industry norms and mobility opportunities may facilitate differences in an employee’s career focus and motivations for job search. Second, as the data were collected during a period of relatively low unemployment, it would be important for future research to assess the generalizability of our results to periods of higher unemployment levels. Both of the aforementioned situational factors may also attenuate the effect of personality traits due to the strength of the external environment (R. D. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0149206310396376">Meyer, Dalal, &amp; Hermida, 2010</xref>). Third, because our hypothesized model was based on full mediation, our reliance on an alternative model with a significant direct effect between extraversion and job search behavior could be influenced by capitalization on chance and therefore should be replicated (and, as discussed previously, expanded on to identify other potential mediators) in future research. Finally, one might expect narrower (facets of) personality traits to be more strongly related to some of the mediating variables. We chose to use broad measures of extraversion and neuroticism in this study for two reasons. First, job search behavior is conceptualized as a broad behavior (although composed of narrower activities), just as overall job performance is a broad behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0149206310396376">Ones &amp; Viswesvaran, 1996</xref>), thus supporting the focus on predictor variables (i.e., personality) at the broader level. Second, the magnitude of the covariance between facets and the challenges in interpreting such a complex model including specific facets and the array of potential links suggest the value of first investigating broad personality traits as in this study. It would be fruitful for future research to examine narrower personality traits when the focus is on either individual mediators and/or specific job search behaviors.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study advances previous literature by drawing on the approach-avoidance theory of personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0149206310396376">Brockner &amp; Higgins, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0149206310396376">Elliot, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206310396376">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0149206310396376">Higgins, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206310396376">1998</xref>) to build a framework to investigate the motivational pathways linking personality and job search behavior. We found that employees with higher levels of extraversion and neuroticism are likely to experience several motivational forces related to advancing their careers and/or avoiding negative aspects of the job that influence their job search behavior. Moreover, each personality trait had both positive and negative effects on job search, depending on the specific mediating mechanism. These findings underscore the practical value of understanding employees’ diverse motives for job search and suggest that managers can utilize their knowledge of employees’ personalities to better anticipate and mitigate tendencies that lead to the search for alternative employment. As the process by which individuals’ dispositions affect their withdrawal behaviors has only recently been studied, continued research in this area is warranted.</p>
