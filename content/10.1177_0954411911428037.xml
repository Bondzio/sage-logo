<abstract>
<p>A surgical instrument to aid implantation of a range of lumbar spinal fusion cages has been developed. Once the cage is in position, the entrance to screw holes is partially blocked by the edge of the vertebral body. In order to insert fixation screws to secure the cage between the vertebrae, some part of the blocking edge has to be removed. Rongeurs are currently being used, but they can be time consuming and have the disadvantage that they may remove more bone than is necessary and may cause damage to the fusion cage if not used with care. In addition, access around some of the screw holes may be difficult. The aim of this instrument was to overcome these shortcomings. This paper describes the design of a surgical instrument for cutting edges from vertebral bodies. The development and evaluation of concept designs are presented and discussed. Potential risks were considered and modifications were performed on the selected concept. Functional prototypes were manufactured and tested on sheep lumbar vertebrae. The results showed that the newly designed cutting instrument functions as required and removes the required amount of bone from the vertebral body edge.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This paper describes the development of a surgical instrument to aid implantation of a range of lumbar spinal fusion cages (STALIF™ TT, Surgicraft Ltd, Redditch, UK); specifically, the instrument is intended to remove parts of the vertebrae that obscure the holes for screw insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411911428037">Figure 1</xref>). Spinal fusion is a surgical procedure where the intervertebral disc is excised and replaced with bone fragments to encourage bone growth to fuse adjacent vertebrae together.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411911428037">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411911428037">4</xref></sup> A fusion cage is used to retain the bone fragments and maintain the distance between adjacent vertebrae.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411911428037">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411911428037">4</xref></sup> The STALIF™ TT cage is manufactured from medical grade polyetheretherketone (PEEK) for implantation in the lumbar spine. Screw fixation is used to secure the cage between the vertebrae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411911428037">Figure 1</xref>). With the STALIF™ TT, once the cage is in position, the surgeon may find the entrance to the screw hole partially blocked by the edge of the vertebral body (VB). Currently, rongeurs are used to nibble the VB edge adjacent to screw holes in a cage. However, some of the holes in the fusion cage are positioned at an awkward angle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411911428037">Figure 1</xref>), which may make the use of rongeurs difficult. In addition, rongeurs can take away more bone than is necessary and may cause damage to the PEEK cage. To avoid these problems, a VB edge cutter was designed. This instrument removes enough VB bone adjacent to all screw holes in a cage to enable access for screw insertion using the appropriate instrument. It is important that this is performed because instruments need to engage in the screw holes that produce a pilot hole in the VBs for the screw to follow. This trajectory then ensures the screws stay within the confines of the VB and cannot go into the vertebral canal or disc spaces above and below, making the surgical procedure safe and reproducible.</p>

<list-item><p>The instrument had to facilitate minimally invasive surgery. It had to be sufficiently small to fit easily into the wound and avoid obstructing the surgeon’s view; the length of the cutter should not exceed 47 mm.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The instrument had to be capable of being positioned correctly within the cage screw holes. Hence, it was required to have a feature as a guide with sufficient dimensions to cover all cage sizes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The instrument had to be compatible with an existing Surgicraft Ltd articulating instrument handle that has a universal joint at its end. This handle allows continuous 360 ° clockwise and anti-clockwise motions so that the VB edge cutter can reach the fusion cage side holes that are located at awkward angles. These holes are at the far end of the cage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411911428037">Figure 1</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The instrument had to be designed so that it would connect to the (universal joint) handle in such a way that it would minimise the risk of it becoming detached while in use.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The instrument had to operate without causing any damage to the PEEK fusion cage.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The instrument had to avoid damage to the patient’s soft tissues during insertion and removal.</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>The instrument had to be able to withstand the forces to which it was subjected during surgery.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The instrument had to be able to be easily cleaned and sterilised without complications, for reuse.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The instrument had to have teeth that are sufficiently sharp to penetrate and to easily and neatly remove the targeted VB edge.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The instrument teeth had to remain sufficiently sharp to aid implantation of 25 cages; each cage requires four VB edges to be removed. Hence, at least 100 neat cuts were required from the instrument. This design requirement (the ability to reuse) was included to justify the manufacturing cost as well as preventing the instrument to be used until it becomes blunt.</p></list-item>

<title>Concept designs</title>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Initially, 11 concept designs were produced (not presented in this paper). Three of these were analysed in more detail are discussed here: the split ring cutter, screw threaded cutter and spring cutter. There are common features within all three cutters that are described below and are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411911428037">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

In order to position the instrument correctly within the screw hole as well as to fully protect the cage, there is a need for a guide with dimensions to cover all cage sizes. The instrument head in all the concepts acts as this guide. The instrument head sits in the screw hole and holds the instrument in place. This ensures that the instrument can only follow the desired direction along its centre-line. There is a clearance between the screw hole and the instrument head that allows free rotation of the instrument. The shaft is a rod connected to the instrument head that allows part A to be attached to part B (by inserting it into the bone cutter) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411911428037">Figures 3</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954411911428037">5</xref>).</p>

The sharp teeth are at one end of part B. When the instrument head is placed within the cage screw hole, the sharp teeth cut the targeted VB edge (explained in detail in the following three subsections and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954411911428037">Figure 6</xref>). The attachment neck is at the other end of part B opposite to the sharp teeth. It joins the instrument to the universal joint handle. The attachment neck has a hexagonal cross section and has the same dimensions as the handle head. The ring belt is inside part B next to the sharp teeth. This is a common feature between the split ring cutter and the screw threaded cutter. It eliminates disassembly of parts A and B.</p>

<title>Split ring cutter</title>
<p>The split ring cutter consists of three parts: part A, part B and a split ring. A cut has been made at the end of the shaft to allow the placement of the split ring that, when compressed, fits the diameter of the shaft. When the shaft is inserted into part B, the split ring recoils to its original diameter. The diameter of the ring belt on part B is smaller than that of the split ring, which eliminates separation of the two parts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411911428037">Figure 3</xref>). Once the instrument head is placed within the cage screw hole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954411911428037">Figure 6(a)</xref>), the targeted VB edge is removed by the sharp teeth when part B is pushed down whilst rotating the handle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954411911428037">Figure 6(b)</xref>). The axial movement of the shaft is possible because of the free space in part B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411911428037">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0954411911428037">
<title>Screw threaded cutter</title>
<p>The screw threaded cutter consists of three parts: part A, part B and a screw. In this concept, the shaft has a screw thread at its end. The instrument is assembled such that the shaft is inserted into part B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411911428037">Figure 4</xref>). A screw is then inserted into the shaft. The head of the screw has a greater diameter than that of the ring belt, which eliminates separation of the two parts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411911428037">Figure 4</xref>). Once the instrument head is seated within the cage screw hole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954411911428037">Figure 6(a)</xref>), the sharp teeth can then remove the targeted VB edge when part B is pushed down whilst rotating the handle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954411911428037">Figure 6(b)</xref>).

<p>The spring cutter consists of three parts: part A, part B and a spring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954411911428037">Figure 5</xref>). The instrument is assembled such that a spring is attached to the shaft and then inserted into part B. A stopping hole is made at the end of part B next to the attachment neck. A pin is then inserted into this stopping hole through the spring to eliminate separation of the spring and part B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954411911428037">Figure 5</xref>). After placing the instrument head in the cage screw hole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954411911428037">Figure 6(a)</xref>), part B has to be pushed down whilst rotating the handle to allow the sharp teeth to cut away the targeted VB edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954411911428037">Figure 6(b)</xref>).

<title>Final design</title>
<sec id="section9-0954411911428037">
<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The final design was derived after analysing the three concept designs in more detail. The spring cutter concept was chosen because it was the easiest to assemble. In addition, cleaning and sterilisation of the spring cutter can be easier. A few modifications were then carried out to produce the final design.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0954411911428037">
<title>Description</title>
<p>The final design consists of an instrument head, a bone cutter, a universal joint and a handle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954411911428037">Figures 7(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954411911428037">8</xref>). The instrument head is attached to a shaft that enables the attachment of the instrument head and the bone cutter. At one end of the bone cutter, there are sharp teeth. The other end of the bone cutter is designed so that it attaches to the universal joint. The VB edge cutter instrument was manufactured from heat-treated 17-4 grade stainless steel on a sliding head machine (Sheffield Precision Medical Ltd, Sheffield, UK). A 6° taper was added to the inside of the bone cutter to produce the sharp teeth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954411911428037">Figure 7(b)</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The instrument head dimensions enable engagement with a cage screw hole, but part of the head has been cut away (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954411911428037">Figure 8</xref>) so that the instrument can be placed in the screw hole when it is partially blocked by the VB edge. There is a spring attached to the shaft. When the spring is in an unloaded state, its length covers all of the STALIF™ TT cage range heights. When it is compressed, there is a 1 mm clearance between the tip of the teeth of the bone cutter and the instrument head. The spring, suitable for surgical instruments (product code: LC 018AA 06S316), was purchased from Lee Spring Ltd (Wokingham, UK) and was made of 316 grade stainless steel with stiffness of 1.5 N/mm. The original length of the purchased spring was 16 mm. It was cut down to 14.5 mm to be used in the cutter instrument.</p>
<p>When the instrument head is placed within the cage screw hole the instrument handle has to be rotated and pushed down to cut the targeted VB edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954411911428037">Figure 6(a)</xref>). This is possible because of the length of the spring and the free space in the bone cutter. When the spring reaches its compressed position, all of the targeted VB edge has been removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954411911428037">Figure 6(b)</xref>), and the teeth of the cutter do not cause damage to the PEEK cage.</p>

<title>Risk assessment</title>
<p>An important step in the design of a medical instrument is to carry out a risk assessment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411911428037">5</xref></sup> Any risk associated with the instrument must be eliminated or reduced as far as possible so that the safety of patients and healthcare workers is not compromised.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411911428037">5</xref></sup> A failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411911428037">11</xref></sup> guided by the British Standard, BS EN ISO 14971:2009,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411911428037">12</xref></sup> was carried out. FMEA is a method that considers all the potential hazards of each component, sub-assembly and final product assembly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411911428037">11</xref></sup> In this study, FMEA was only carried out on the VB edge cutter part of the instrument. This is because the handle with the universal joint (Surgicraft Ltd) has successfully passed the required analysis and is already commercially available. The potential hazards and harms were identified and then evaluated in terms of their severity (<italic>S</italic>) and probability (<italic>P</italic>). Each of these elements was scored on a scale of 1 to 5. A risk number (<italic>SP</italic>) was then calculated by multiplying the scores for the two elements (<italic>S</italic> and <italic>P</italic>) together (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411911428037">Table 1</xref>). If <italic>SP</italic> was 10 or greater, the risk was considered to be unacceptably high and had to be reduced. If <italic>SP</italic> was between 5 and 9, the risk was considered as high and had to be reduced where practicable. Any residual risk was to be justified against the device benefits. If the obtained <italic>SP</italic> was between 3 and 4, the risk was considered as medium and had to be reviewed to ensure that it is as low as reasonably practicable. If <italic>SP</italic> was 2 or less, the risk was considered to be safe. The results of the risk analysis are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411911428037">Table 1</xref>.

<title>Cutting tests</title>
<p>The VB edge cutter instrument was used to compare the cutting action with that of a conventional rongeurs. Sheep lumbar vertebrae were used in this experiment. The mineral density of the sheep lumbar vertebrae was measured using the bone ashing method,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411911428037">13</xref></sup> and was found to have a value of 0.47 g.cm<sup>−3</sup>. This mineral density value is higher than that of human vertebral bodies (0.15 g.cm<sup>−3</sup>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411911428037">13</xref></sup> Therefore, it was assumed that if the VB edge cutter can cut away the denser sheep lumbar vertebrae, it can cut away those of humans with more ease. The intervertebral disc was removed by use of a scalpel, and a STALIF™ TT cage (STT39130-12LT) (39 × 27 × 13 mm) was placed in between the adjacent vertebrae. The vertebrae containing the fusion cage were secured in an open plastic box (30 × 20 × 5 cm) using acrylic cement (WHW Plastics, Hull, UK) to avoid any undesired movements. The VB edge cutter and rongeurs were used to cut two separate VB edges adjacent to the cage screw holes. This test was repeated five times on two different sheep vertebrae (10 cuts were produced by each VB edge cutter instrument and rongeurs). The instrument head was placed within the screw hole, which allowed alignment of the cutting teeth with the hole axis. This prevented the teeth contacting the cage as well as providing it with full protection.</p>
<p>When using the rongeurs, although the specimen was placed in an open box (which allowed for more space than would be available during surgery), it was found to be difficult to align the tip of the rongeurs with the screw hole axis. In some cases, the sharp edges of the rongeurs were in contact with the cage. The cuts from the instrument and the rongeurs were compared after removing the targeted edges.</p>
<p>In all cases, the VB edge cutter instrument removed only the amount of bone required to enable screw access. However, the rongeurs in some cases removed more bone than necessary, and in some cases not enough bone. Once the targeted edge was removed by the VB edge cutter, the screw could be comfortably placed in the screw hole. The VB edge cutter fully protected the cage while removing the VB edge. This level of protection could not easily be achieved when using the rongeurs</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0954411911428037">
<title>Torsion tests</title>
<p>To ensure that the bone cutter does not detach from the handle or loosen, a torque test using a TWD20SB Torqueleader (MHH Engineering Co. Ltd, Guildford, UK) was carried out. The cutter instrument was placed and tightened in between the clamp of the Torqueleader and a torque (5 N.m) was applied to the universal joint that attaches the bone cutter to the handle. The instrument was held by hand while the test was being performed. The joint remained intact. The torque (5 N.m) chosen in this study is assumed to be reasonable, as it is much greater than that applied in orthodontic treatments (0.1 N.m).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411911428037">14</xref></sup> In addition, this chosen torque (5 N.m) is expected to be greater than the torque applied to the instrument during surgery to remove the VB edge. This expectation was confirmed by setting 5 N.m on the torque-wrench and securing its tip in a vice. Attempts to turn the torque-wrench handle were unsuccessful.</p>

<sec id="section15-0954411911428037">
<title>Teeth and spring durability</title>
<p>To determine how many times the instrument could be used before the teeth became too blunt, a durability test was carried out: 150 holes were cut in sheep lumbar vertebrae. On average, five rotating actions were made per hole. Micrographs were taken of the teeth before and after the durability test using a Nikon SMZ1500 Stereo microscope (Buhler Centre of Excellence, School of Mechanical Engineering, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK) at a magnification of ×19. The sharpness of the teeth after cutting 150 holes was found to be the same as the beginning of the test; the ease with which the bones were cut did not change. In addition, the micrographs showed that the teeth were undamaged and intact at the end of the tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954411911428037">Figure 9</xref>). While carrying out the durability test, the instrument spring did not get stuck and functioned properly and smoothly.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This paper has described the development of a surgical cutting instrument to aid implantation of a range of spinal fusion cages. Once the cage is in position, between the adjacent vertebrae, the VB edge partially blocks the entrance to the screw hole. In addition, some of the screw holes of the cage are positioned at an awkward angle. To insert fixation screws to secure the cage between the vertebrae, some part of the blocking edge has to be removed. The final design of the VB edge cutter instrument was derived after modifications were made to the selected concept. The device as a whole consists of the cutting instrument and a handle. The cutting instrument is attached to the handle by a universal joint. The universal joint allows free rotation of the instrument, which can provide access to all of the screw holes. The length of the cutting part of the instrument is 43.4 mm in order to meet the requirement of a minimally invasive surgery. The instrument is manufactured from heat-treated 17-4 grade stainless steel to avoid instrument breakage.</p>
<p>The instrument head of the VB edge cutter instrument acts as a guide, it sits in the cage screw hole and holds the instrument in place. This ensures that the instrument can only follow the desired direction along its centre-line. There is a clearance of 0.2 mm between the diameter of the cutting teeth and the cage screw hole. This and the instrument head (by aligning the cutting teeth with the axis of the screw hole) provide full protection to the cage and allow only the intended targeted VB edge to be cut away. The design characteristics of the VB edge cutter instrument overcome the drawbacks of the rongeurs currently in use, which have difficulty in accessing the angled VB edges and may cut away more bone than necessary.</p>
<p>Tests were carried out to assess any potential risks. The durability test demonstrated that the instrument teeth can stay intact and sharp for as long as required (25 operations). It was also shown that the force required to cut the bone does not excessively bend the instrument shaft. The instrument remained attached to the handle after applying a torque of 5 N.m. The instrument was tested on sheep lumbar vertebrae, and the results showed that the VB bone cutter removes the required amount of bone and overcomes the shortcomings of the rongeurs. Future development will require testing on a cadaver to ensure that the instrument does not cause any damage to surrounding blood vessels.</p>
