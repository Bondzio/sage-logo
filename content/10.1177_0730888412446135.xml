 <p>The rapid transformation of Central and Eastern Europe in the postsocialist period provides very important insights into processes of social change. The shift from a demand economy called into question previous certainties about access to employment and the value of educational qualifications. The impact was all the more pronounced for young people who were leaving full-time education and entering the labor market, providing a unique opportunity to examine institutional effects on the life course. <italic>Making the Transition</italic>, edited by Irena Kogan, Clemens Noelke, and Michael Gebel, presents new research on the pathways taken by young people in the postsocialist period, exploring changes in education and the labor market across 10 countries.</p>
<p>The book clearly challenges the myth of homogeneity in the Eastern bloc, highlighting important differences in the countries’ educational systems pretransformation, changes in the nature of education and training post- transition, and variations in the economic reforms adopted. During the socialist period, education and training systems were highly centralized and stratified, with a very strong link between education and the type of occupation entered. However, the nature of the stratification, that is, the timing and degree of choice between different tracks, varied across countries as did the proportion taking vocational programs at secondary level (being particularly high in Russia, for example). Countries varied too in whether higher education had previously been confined to a small elite and even more markedly in the extent of higher education expansion posttransformation.</p>
<p>In spite of these differences, certain commonalities can be identified. The transition process became longer and more turbulent, with continuing high levels of youth unemployment in Serbia, Poland, the Ukraine, and Estonia. In most cases, educational stratification became more pronounced posttransformation as education became a valued resource for access to (high-quality) employment. While most of the relationship between social background and labor market outcomes was mediated by young people’s educational attainment, parental, social, and cultural resources were found to have a direct impact in, for example, the Czech Republic and Croatia. These findings provide important insights for the study of social stratification and the way in which more advantaged groups use their resources to their children’s benefit, even in situations of flux. The number leaving school at lower secondary level increased in some countries (such as Estonia and East Germany) and this group of young people became increasingly marginalized within the labor market. Early tracking into academic and vocational routes within secondary schools often reemerged. At the same time, the system of work-based training more or less collapsed as the previously close link between educational institutions and employers dissolved in most countries (an exception to this pattern was Croatia, where some work-based training survived the transition). In addition, higher education provision became more diversified, between longer and shorter courses and between public and private institutions, resulting in new inequalities in employment chances and job quality for young people.</p>
<p>The book not only provides important insights into rapid and extensive social change in Central and Eastern Europe but also raises broader questions for our understanding of school-to-work transition processes. In particular, the authors point to the need to reassess the role of firm-based training in easing the transition to employment. Research on Western countries (such as Germany) had highlighted the way in which firm-based training provides a smoother transition into employment because of the close alignment between skills development and employer needs. This relationship is called into question by the research emerging from Central and Eastern Europe where firm-based training appears to provide no straightforward advantages over school-based provision.</p>
<p>The book is also interesting from a methodological perspective. The lack of fully comparative data has often been seen as a barrier to cross-national research. Here the teams of authors use somewhat different data sources, including school leavers’ surveys, register data, and population surveys, but employ them to address a specific set of research questions across all of the countries. Each chapter looks at the impact of education (along with other factors such as gender and social background) on the time to first significant job and the occupational status of the job entered. This meshing of a common analytical framework with a nuanced discussion of the specific national context indicates the value of such “side by side” analysis.</p>
<p>The editors do not explicitly present a further research agenda but, for me, their analyses prompt a number of further questions. In particular, there seems considerable scope for conducting qualitative research to capture the ways in which young people and their parents view the complex negotiation of pathways in a still changing context.</p>
