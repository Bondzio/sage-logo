<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study was to examine the influences of presentation modes (audio and visual) on perceptions of expressive choral performance. The stimulus recording included four choral selections, each conducted by a different conductor in two ways: using expressive conducting gestures and using strict conducting gestures. Three groups of participants: (1) listened to the eight audio excerpts; or (2) listened and viewed the conductor from the rear; or (3) listened and viewed the conductor from the front. They then answered questions regarding expressivity, tone quality, and overall impression of the choral performance. Results indicate significant differences between presentation modes and conducting style. Participants rated performances conducted with an expressive gesture higher than performances conducted with a strict gesture in all three presentation modes.</p>

<p>Ensemble directors generally desire to achieve musically-expressive performances. Oftentimes they look to their own conducting gestures to achieve this expressivity. It is unclear whether expressive performances occur as a result of expressive conducting, but the goal of musical expression is ubiquitous among music teachers of all age groups, if elusive. Indeed, the expressivity of a performance is one factor that differentiates beginner and advanced performers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0255761411434823">Woody, 2002</xref>). While even children as young as kindergartners can perceive musical expression, the ability to produce music expressively appears to be a more difficult task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0255761411434823">Rodriguez, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Researchers have endeavored to define elements of expressiveness, and many agree that tempo, dynamics, and articulation contribute to perceptions of musically-expressive performances. In a series of studies, Johnson ascertained that participants favored more rubato, and that rubato was equated with musicality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761411434823">Johnson, 1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0255761411434823">1996b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0255761411434823">1997</xref>); further, there was a fairly wide window for the amount of rubato that was acceptable, as long as it complied with the pattern of temporal flow established by common practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0255761411434823">Johnson, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0255761411434823">Crist (1996)</xref> noted that tempo and dynamics were components associated with musical expressivity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0255761411434823">Woody (2006)</xref> agreed, and added articulation to the list, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0255761411434823">Sheldon (2004)</xref> proposed that tempo and articulation were the elements that accounted for expressivity.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0255761411434823">Ervin (1975)</xref> defined expressive conducting as ‘when the conductor deviates from a strict beat pattern for expressive purposes such as dynamics, phrasing, accents, cueing, etc. Variation in the size of the beat patterns and facial expressions are also considered to be examples of expressive conducting’ (p. 47). Thus it appears that expressiveness in conducting is defined in terms of musical elements as well as nonverbal aspects of a conductor’s behavior. This is consistent with findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0255761411434823">VanWeelden (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0255761411434823">Fredrickson, Johnson, and Robinson (1998)</xref>, which indicated that posture, facial expression, and a variety of pre-conducting behaviors affected perceptions of conductors. The gesture itself is in fact a form of nonverbal communication. Conductors work to develop a common gestural vocabulary that is recognizable. These gestures have been referred to as ‘emblems,’ and various studies have sought to establish which gestures are most recognized by instrumental performers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0255761411434823">Mayne, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0255761411434823">Sousa, 1988</xref>) and how this recognition can be improved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0255761411434823">Cofer, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>When considering the amount of time future music teachers spend in conducting classes, purportedly learning the physical skills and coordination required for conducting in addition to the ability to communicate expressively with gestures, it seems worthwhile to question how expressive conducting contributes to student attitude and performance. The research literature is mixed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0255761411434823">Laib (1993)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0255761411434823">Yarbrough (1975)</xref> reported positive high school student opinions and higher performance scores with expressive conductors, compared with nonexpressive conductors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0255761411434823">Sidoti (1990)</xref> asserted that performances (of musical expression markings) were more accurate under the expressive conducting condition. Conductors of more musical bands used more expressive gestures in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0255761411434823">Grechesky’s (1985)</xref> study. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0255761411434823">Price and Winter’s (1991)</xref> adolescent participants failed to yield a significant performance difference between the strict conductor and the expressive conductor. A strict conductor was defined as using minimal body movement, expressive gestures or facial expressions, or group eye contact. An expressive conductor engaged in frequent body movement, expressive gestures, approving and disapproving facial expressions, and group eye contact. However, it should be noted that Price and Winter’s participants did prefer the expressive conductor over the strict conductor, so expressive conducting affected student attitude in a positive way, even though there was no effect on performance achievement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0255761411434823">Price and Chang (2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0255761411434823">2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0255761411434823">Price (2006)</xref> consistently found no relationship between expressive conducting and expressive performance.</p>
<p>Because music is experienced in a variety of ways via multiple forms of media, it is logical to assume that perhaps listeners/viewers respond to musical performances differently depending on the mode in which they are presented. There is evidence that presentation modes affect participants’ cognitive and affective responses to music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0255761411434823">Geringer, Cassidy, &amp; Byo, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0255761411434823">1997</xref>). Presentation modes can also affect performance ratings in vocal performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0255761411434823">Wapnick, Darrow, Kovacs, &amp; Dalrymple, 1997</xref>), in choral rehearsal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0255761411434823">Yarbrough &amp; Hendel, 1993</xref>), and in marching band settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0255761411434823">Johnson, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Several studies have examined presentation mode with respect to conductors and ensemble performances. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0255761411434823">Price’s (2006)</xref> participants rated audio recordings of band ensembles higher than video recordings of their conductors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0255761411434823">Madsen’s (1991)</xref> evaluators listened to performances displaying good and bad conducting gestures, but good conducting gestures did not result in significantly higher ratings of collegiate choral performances when evaluators listened to the performances on audiotape. In a similar study investigating cultural differences, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0255761411434823">Madsen (2009)</xref> did not find a significant difference due to presentation mode (audio, visual, or audiovisual) or culture (Americans and Argentinians) when participants viewed or listened to excerpts of choral music. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0255761411434823">Price and Mann (2009)</xref> tested whether participants’ evaluations of wind ensemble performances would differ among various conductors and determined that the conductor significantly impacted both conductor and ensemble performance evaluations. The researchers concluded that music does sound different, depending on the visual information accompanying it.</p>
<p>The link between presentation mode and perceptions of expressivity is unclear. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0255761411434823">Lucas, Hamann, and Teachout (1996)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0255761411434823">Lucas and Teachout (1998)</xref> found that undergraduate and graduate music majors evaluated expressiveness differently when listening (aural-only mode), when viewing the conductor (visual-only mode), and when listening and viewing the conductor (aural-visual mode). Expressive performances received higher ratings than did the nonexpressive performances in each of the three presentation modes, and visual-only and aural-visual modes yielded higher expressiveness ratings than did aural-only mode. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0255761411434823">Hamann (2003)</xref> reported different findings with middle school participants: aural excerpts were rated as more expressive than video-only excerpts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0255761411434823">Silkebakken’s (1988)</xref> results also indicated a significant main effect for presentation mode. There were significantly higher ratings for expressiveness when conductors were viewed from the rear as opposed to from the front. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0255761411434823">Price and Chang (2005)</xref> used two presentation modes for high school bands: video-only (view of the front of the conductor, no audio track) and parallel audio-only excerpts. Their participants did not rate expressivity significantly differently. Whether conductors were viewed from the front or back had a significant impact on participants’ evaluations of the conductors in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0255761411434823">Price and Mann’s (2009)</xref> study.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to add to the existing body of literature examining presentation mode as an independent variable influencing perceptions of expressivity. In light of the number of performances where an audience member views the conductor exclusively from the back, and the proliferation of films and videos of conducted performances from the audience point of view, this seems an under investigated area of research. Of the literature surveyed, only two studies compared rear and front view presentation modes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0255761411434823">Price &amp; Mann, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0255761411434823">Silkebakken, 1988</xref>), and neither involved choral ensembles.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants included 131 high school students (95 females and 36 males) enrolled in a summer choral camp at a large southeastern university, representing seven states. There were 19 students who had completed their first year (freshmen), 36 students who had completed their second year (sophomores), 64 students who had completed their third year (juniors), and 12 students who had completed their final year (seniors). All participants voluntarily took part in the study with no incentive provided, and all were briefed at the end of the session regarding the purpose of the research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0255761411434823">
<title>Preparing the stimulus recording</title>
<p>Senior university choral music education majors from another state were recruited to produce the stimulus video and audio recordings. There were four conductors and a group of 12 singers formed the chorus. The researcher met with each of the conductors ahead of time for a training session. Conductors were each given a musical selection (all in unison and in English) and instructed to prepare to conduct the first musical idea. These phrases ranged from eight to 12 measures. For each selection, conductors were asked to conduct with a strict conducting gesture first and then with an expressive conducting gesture. These terms were defined according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0255761411434823">Price and Winter (1991)</xref>: a strict conductor uses little to no body movement, expressive gestures, facial expressions, and group eye contact. An expressive conductor engages in frequent body movement, expressive gestures, approving and disapproving facial expressions, and group eye contact. Conductors practiced with the researcher to ensure that appropriate contrasts were perceptible. As a validity check, four graduate students also unanimously agreed that the strict conducting gestures were different from the expressive conducting gestures, and both were indicative of the appropriate condition.</p>
<p>At the recording session, chorus members were given the opportunity to read through the first 8–12 measures of each piece several times until pitches and rhythms were secured. There were two digital video cameras, one positioned in front of the conductor, at such a distance that everything above the torso was in view, and another positioned behind the conductor, at the same distance, torso and above, with no view of the conductor’s face. In addition, a <italic>Zoom H2 Recorder</italic> was placed at the front of the room to produce the audio recording. The researcher and two assistants operated the video and audio equipment, and the researcher gave conductors cues as to when to begin, when to do another take, and when to change conducting conditions. At the end of the session each master tape contained four pieces, conducted in two different ways, with strict gestures and with expressive gestures, for a total of eight excerpts.</p>
<p>Video footage was edited using iMovie. Verbal instructions were inserted into the video, as well as labels for each forthcoming example. A practice example was included at the beginning of each recording. Two videos were produced: the video from the front of the conductor, and the video from the rear of the conductor, in addition to the audio recording. Each recording was approximately 12 minutes long. Pilot studies were conducted to determine whether one-minute intervals between examples would be sufficient time to answer the three questions on the answer sheet. Other changes incorporated after pilot studies included adding an audio cue to indicate the next example was forthcoming, adding a 15-second interval between the indication of an example and the start of the example, and clarifying wording to reflect that participants were evaluating the choir and not the conductor.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0255761411434823">
<title>Design and procedure</title>
<p>Participants were randomly separated into six groups with some consideration for male/female representation. Groups 1 and 2 listened to the audio CD, groups 3 and 4 watched the front videos of the conductors, and groups 5 and 6 watched the rear videos of the conductors. There were two orders employed, and these orders were the same for all three groups (audio CD order 1 and 2, front group order 1 and 2, and rear group order 1 and 2). The first was a random order, and the second was the same order in reverse. The purpose of this reverse order was to isolate the independent variable more specifically: by the last few excerpts, participants may have guessed that the experiment concerned expressive conducting, so the two orders distributed the bias in both directions. In order to give participants the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the task, there was one practice example. Demographic data were collected and participants were given the following instructions:
<disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for agreeing to take part in this study. You will be viewing/listening to eight short excerpts and you will answer three questions after each. Let’s do a practice example.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>On the response sheet participants were asked to rate tone quality, expressiveness, and overall performance of the choral performance on a seven-point Likert-type scale, 1 being poor and 7 being excellent.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>There were 131 participants who completed the study and answered all questions (43 in the CD group, 54 with a front view of the conductor, and 34 with a back view of the conductor). Preliminary analyses revealed differences between individual student conductors and possible order effects. Since the individual conductors and order presentation were not the main focus of the study, these were combined in the subsequent analyses, and a multivariate analysis of variance was conducted with presentation mode as the between-subjects variable (CD, front, or rear) and conducting style (strict/expressive) as the within-subjects variable. The variates were musical element (tone quality, expressivity, and overall impression). An alpha level of .01 was established <italic>a priori</italic>.</p>
<p>There were significant multivariate main effects for conducting style, <italic>F</italic>(3, 126) = 57.04, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .57. Prior to examining the univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) results, the alpha level was adjusted to α = .003 because three dependent variables were analyzed. These ANOVAs indicated differences were present in conducting style for all three variates: tone quality, <italic>F</italic>(1, 128) = 78.83, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .38, expressivity, <italic>F</italic>(1, 128) = 172.79, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .57, and overall impression, <italic>F</italic>(1, 128) = 139.96, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .52. All musical elements were rated higher under the expressive conducting condition (<italic>M</italic> = 21.12, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.61 for tone quality, <italic>M</italic> = 20.74, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.52 for expressivity and <italic>M</italic> = 21.10, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.84 for overall impression) than under the strict conducting condition (<italic>M</italic> = 18.36, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.96 for tone quality, <italic>M</italic> = 15.55, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.64 for expressivity and <italic>M</italic> = 17.15, <italic>SD</italic>= 4.00 for overall impression). See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0255761411434823">Figure 1</xref> for an illustration of this effect.</p>

<p>Presentation modes were also significantly different from each other, <italic>F</italic>(6, 252) = 5.56, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .11, with respect to tone quality, <italic>F</italic>(2, 128) = 9.28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .12, and overall impression, <italic>F</italic>(2, 128) = 11.80, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .15. Tukey HSD post-hoc comparisons indicated significant differences between CD and front view presentation modes in tone quality ratings (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and overall impression (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). There were no other significant differences or interactions. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0255761411434823">Figure 2</xref>, consistently, participants who viewed the conductor from the front gave the lowest ratings. Highest ratings alternated between the audio CD and rear conductor view presentation modes, but when examining the strict conducting condition, participants who listened to the CD always gave the highest ratings.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to examine whether presentation modes affected participants’ ratings of expressivity, tone quality, and overall impression of choral performances. The data indicated that presentation modes did indeed affect perceptions of tone quality and overall impression: there were significant differences between the aural-only group and those who viewed the conductor from the front (the aural group rated performances higher), but no differences between front and rear conductor view ratings. This is inconsistent with findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0255761411434823">Price and Chang (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0255761411434823">Madsen (2009)</xref>, who reported no significant differences between presentation modes, and with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0255761411434823">Madsen (1991)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0255761411434823">Lucas and Teachout (1998)</xref>, whose participants rated video excerpts higher than aural excerpts. However, this study’s results are congruent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0255761411434823">Price’s (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0255761411434823">Hamann’s (2003)</xref> in that audio excerpts were rated higher than video excerpts. Unlike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0255761411434823">Price and Mann (2009)</xref> and Silkebakken (1998), there did not appear to be a difference between ratings of performances when viewing conductors from the front or from the rear. The differences surfaced between the CD group and the front view group instead. Interestingly, many of the cited studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0255761411434823">Lucas et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0255761411434823">Lucas &amp; Teachout, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0255761411434823">Madsen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0255761411434823">Price, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0255761411434823">Price &amp; Chang, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0255761411434823">Price &amp; Mann, 2009</xref>) researched perceptions of undergraduate and graduate students. The current study examined perceptions of high school students, particularly those high school students who were committed enough to enroll and participate in a choral camp, indicating a more unusual participant pool.</p>
<p>It is interesting that the participants who viewed the conductor from the front consistently gave the lowest ratings. It is possible that observing the conductors’ faces could have provided some distraction or that, given access to the conducting pattern, they felt compelled to criticize aspects of the conducting that were not as they expected. Participants with a rear view of the conductor could not see much nuance in the gesture, and those in the CD group clearly saw nothing, so a focus on the choir performance was more likely in these groups. One could conjecture that having some visual information is different from having all the visual information in a performance and, as others have noted, a choir might ‘sound different’ simply by the accompanying visual signals they receive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0255761411434823">Price &amp; Mann, 2009</xref>). It might be worthwhile to endeavor to learn where participants focus their attention while they are taking in so many visual cues.</p>
<p>With respect to strict versus expressively-conducted performances, participants rated expressively-conducted performances higher than strictly-conducted performances across all presentation modes. However, unlike other studies that have used some form of deception with the same recording and different conductors superimposed over the aural information, this study did in fact have different performances each time, so that variable could not be teased out. One obvious question arises: did the choir sing differently when a conductor conducted in the expressive condition as opposed to the strict condition? Participants did in fact perceive those performances as different, even in the aural condition without the visual cues. Another possibility is that the choir attempted to make differences between strict and expressive conducting conditions more obvious since they knew that they were being video and audio recorded for an experiment.</p>
<p>What are the implications for practitioners given this study’s findings? On the one hand, participants did perceive certain conductors to be more expressive, and this lends support to continuing to teach expressivity in collegiate conducting classes, especially given that conductors and their ensembles will be adjudicated on a regular basis (most likely with a rear view of the conductor). On the other hand, sometimes there is no control over which presentation mode will be used for evaluation. Some festivals/contests are based on aural recordings only, and others might indeed require visual information via a live conducting session or video recording. Perhaps one might consider that adjudicators will potentially be more critical when they are viewing a front view of the conductor, although more study is warranted before drawing definitive conclusions.</p>
<p>There are several limitations in this study that should be noted. First, despite the attempt to control for order effect, it was still evidenced. Second, there were differences between individual conductors. These two issues are perhaps related. It is possible that the CD/DVD that contained more expressive conductors towards the beginning influenced participants’ perceptions of subsequent conductors. Future studies may choose to incorporate more conductors in the stimulus recording and examine perceptions of preservice or experienced teachers rather than high school students.</p>

<title>Les influences des modes de presentation de la performance chorale expressive sur les perceptions des etudiants de musique a l’ecole secondaire</title>
<p>Le but de cette étude était d’examiner l’influence des modes de présentation (audio et visuel) sur les perceptions de la performance chorale expressive. Le stimulus sonore enregistré comprenait quatre sélections de chorales, chacune menée par un conducteur de deux manières différentes: en utilisant des gestes expressifs et en utilisant des gestes avec des restrictions. Trois groupes de participants (a) ont écouté les huit extraits audio, ou (b) ont écouté et regardé le conducteur de l’arrière, ou (c) écouté et regarder le conducteur de l’avant. Ils ont ensuite répondu aux questions concernant l’expressivité, la qualité sonore, et l’impression générale de la performance chorale. Les résultats indiquent des différences significatives entre les modes de présentation et les styles de conduir l’orchestre. Les participants ont évalué en plus haut dégrés les performances réalisées avec un geste expressif par rapport a celles réalisées avec un geste avec des restrictions dans tous les trois modes de présentation.</p>

<title>Influencias de los modos de presentación de las interpretaciones corales en las percepciones expresivas de los músicos en Secundaria</title>
<p>El propósito de este estudio fue examinar las influencias de los modos de presentación (auditivia y visual) sobre las percepciones expresivas de las interpretaciones corales. La grabación empleada como estímulo comprendía cuatro selecciones corales, cada una dirigida por un director diferente y empleando dos estilos de dirección: utilizando gestos expresivos y sin expresión, rígidamente. Hubo tres grupos participantes, cada uno de los cuales: a) escuchó los ocho fragmentos de audio; b) escuchó y vio al director de espaldas; c) escuchó y vio al director de frente. Después respondieron a preguntas sobre expresividad, calidad tonal, y su impresión global sobre la interpretación coral. Los resultados indican la existencia de diferencias significativas entre los diferentes modos de presentación y el estilo de dirección. Los participantes puntuaron más altas las interpretaciones con dirección expresiva que las que no lo eran en los tres modos de presentación.</p>
