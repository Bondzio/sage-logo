<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Laparoscopic surgeries are minimally invasive surgeries that entail visually projecting the target tissue onto a monitor, with instruments partially inserted into the patient through small openings. Compared with open surgery, this surgery is more beneficial for patients, as indicated by shorter hospital stays, lower risks of infection and blood loss, reduced mortality rates, and less postoperative pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018720812448393">Cuschieri, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018720812448393">Goodney, Birkmeyer, &amp; Birkmeyer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018720812448393">Rattner, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018720812448393">Shea et al., 1996</xref>). However, performing this type of surgery poses perceptual-motor challenges for surgeons and surgical assistants. By having to view the surgical field from the camera’s perspective instead of a direct view, this environment induces a disruption of normal hand-eye mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018720812448393">Holden, Flach, &amp; Donchin, 1999</xref>). The laparoscopic environment also results in a reduction of degrees of freedom of movement for the surgical instruments, resulting in the fulcrum effect. The fulcrum effect occurs when movement of the instrument handle outside of the patient leads to opposite movement of the instrument tip inside the patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018720812448393">Gallagher, McClure, McGuigan, Ritchie, &amp; Sheehy, 1998</xref>). Furthermore, three dimensions are reduced to two dimensions when the surgical field is presented on a monitor. Depth cues arising from binocular disparity, accommodation, and convergence are rendered ineffective in the laparoscopic environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018720812448393">Reinhardt-Rutland, Annett, &amp; Gifford, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Traditional training in low-fidelity laparoscopic trainer boxes allows surgeons to adapt to these perceptual-motor distortions and hone their technical skills. However, traditional simulator training does not help trainees develop decision-making skills in the laparoscopic environment. Although technical skills are essential, surgical experts have attributed good decision making as the major factor for successful surgical outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018720812448393">Spencer, 1978</xref>). Prior research indicated that surgical trainees and expert surgeons differ in their decision making in the surgical environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720812448393">Agha, Arora, &amp; Sevdalis, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720812448393">Dominguez, Flach, McDermott, McKellar, &amp; Dunn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018720812448393">Szatmary, Arora, &amp; Sevdalis, 2010</xref>). For example, by analyzing surgeon responses to semi-structured interviews and vignettes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018720812448393">Szatmary and colleagues (2010)</xref> found that expert and novice surgeons differed in confidence on their judgment of expected patient outcome. Novice surgeons were less confident in their judgment and tended to push forward with the decision to operate in anticipation of a better outcome, whereas experts were more circumspect, willing to forego a procedure if they expected a positive patient outcome without surgery.</p>
<p>Task analysis has been shown to be promising in identifying crucial information pertaining to surgical decision making that might otherwise be omitted during traditional training. Information derived from task analysis approaches has been shown to be valuable for the development of training modules that aid surgical decision making for specific procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018720812448393">Campbell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018720812448393">Luker, Sullivan, Peyre, Sherman, &amp; Grunewald, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018720812448393">Sullivan et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>During surgical training, residents become sensitive to critical decisions, cues relevant for these decisions, strategies, and possible traps by obtaining hands-on experience while performing surgeries. Work hour restrictions, which were first introduced by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education in 2003 and have been recently modified in 2011, resulted in a reduction in surgical cases performed by residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018720812448393">Carlin, Gasevic, &amp; Shepard, 2007</xref>). Experience is essential for learning good decision making. Surgical training policies should develop focused training approaches that ensure that the reduction of work hours does not result in reduced experience needed to achieve skilled decision making in the laparoscopic environment.</p>
<p>The primary goal for the present study is to employ cognitive task analysis to identify decisions, cues, strategies, and novice traps that are relevant to a wide array of laparoscopic surgeries during the preoperative, operative, and postoperative phases, with the long-term goal of aiding laparoscopic training. Cognitive task analysis fits under the larger umbrella of cognitive systems engineering, a family of approaches and methods intended to reveal the mental components of work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018720812448393">Eggleston, 2002</xref>). Analysis of the decision processes of experts is a primary method of revealing these mental components. The model of expert decision making frequently used in the context of cognitive task analysis is the recognition-primed decision model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018720812448393">Klein, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018720812448393">2003</xref>). This mode of decision making is highly intuitive, accurate, and successful. Experts are said to have an integrated and primed knowledge base in the domain of expertise, and the appropriate subsets of this knowledge are easily activated when a valid pattern of domain relevant cues is perceived by the expert. From this pattern recognition, an expert automatically generates a plan of action, which is either (a) quickly selected, if the expert recognizes the situation as typical, or (b) evaluated by mentally simulating the likely outcome of the action, if the situation is judged as atypical.</p>
<p>The model appears to be consistent with known traits of surgical expertise, such as superior perception of domain-specific cues, size of knowledge base, and automaticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720812448393">Abernethy, Poolton, Masters, &amp; Patil, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720812448393">Ericsson, 2011</xref>). Prior work with alternative cognitive task analysis methodologies has demonstrated superior expert recognition at predicting patient outcome, given a set of domain-specific cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018720812448393">Szatmary et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, a cognitive task analysis can be used to understand the nature of decision making within the surgical domain.</p>
<p>One approach can be to take a narrow and deep investigation of a single decision, such as the choice to perform a hernia repair via open or laparoscopic surgery. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720812448393">Agha et al. (2011)</xref> found that this decision was driven by multiple factors, such as nature and site of hernia as well as the prior surgical history of the patient. This approach can yield rich information on the complexity of a single decision and how experts navigate that choice. Alternatively, one may take a broad survey of decision making in a domain. Although this approach does not delve as deeply into the myriad factors affecting any one decision, it can ascertain the nature of many different decisions. The first goal for this study is to identify these decisions and their associated factors relevant to laparoscopic training. Thus, by broadly considering the types of decisions that are made and how those decisions are made, observations can also be made on how surgeon decision making in laparoscopy adheres to the recognition-primed decision model, which is a second goal for this study.</p>
<p>A cognitive task analysis consists of several steps: selection of participants (experts in the domain of interest), a knowledge elicitation phase, and an analysis and representation phase. Common techniques in the knowledge elicitation phase are the critical decision method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018720812448393">Hoffman, Crandall, &amp; Shadbolt, 1998</xref>) and the knowledge audit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018720812448393">Militello &amp; Hutton, 1998</xref>). The critical decision method asks experts to recall a critical incident (i.e., a severe complication during a laparoscopic procedure). The expert recalls the incident in detail, and a timeline is established. The analyst then asks the expert to retell the incident several times with different foci, such as asking the expert to identify decision points within the incident timeline or probing the expert on alternative scenarios that could have happened. The steps for telling and retelling the incident are outlined in prior research and are intended for a broad variety of domains. With this method, the analyst can extract critical information about key decisions and the information behind these decisions that underlie successful performance.</p>
<p>The knowledge audit is a set of questions or probes that have been extracted from the literature of expert–novice differences. Knowledge audit questions have been developed that are applicable to elicit expert–novice differences in a wide variety of work environments. When one uses the knowledge audit to question experts, one acquires critical facets of domain knowledge, such as how experts acquire the big picture, notice meaningful cues, and effectively improvise in unique situations. An example question may be “What are the important elements to keep in mind?” The analyst selects the most applicable questions from the set for the domain under investigation and follows up with questions on how novices may behave or think differently in similar situations. In the analysis and representation phase, the investigators consider the data and organize the findings from knowledge elicitation in a useful format. The choice of representation is crucial, as different representations emphasize different relationships and concepts in the domain. The format could be timelines, general narratives, concept maps, tables, or diagrams. In this case, the researchers adopted tables. Tables allow for a broad snapshot of multiple categories of information and how they relate to key decisions, facilitating integration of the presented ideas.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section9-0018720812448393">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were eight expert surgeons working in the United States (six men and two women). The average length of experience in laparoscopic surgery was 12.9 years (range 7 to 21 years). The surgical areas of expertise included general surgery, trauma, urology, and pediatric surgery. All participants were attending surgeons at an established surgical teaching center in the United States. Some of their responsibilities included training novice surgeons. Among the participants in this project were three of the authors, but they did not conduct interviews or data analysis. The individuals who performed the interviews and the data analysis were not expert surgeons and did not serve as participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0018720812448393">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The first part of cognitive task analysis is the selection of participants. The experts were attending surgeons involved in surgical education and had expertise in laparoscopic surgery. Of these, seven surgeons who were willing to participate signed a consent form and participated in an in-person interview, which lasted between 1 and 2 hours. An eighth surgeon participated in verifying the information elicited in the interviews (see Analysis and Representation Phase). The task analysis procedure adhered to guidelines specified for interviews described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018720812448393">Kirwan and Ainsworth (1992)</xref>, the knowledge audit described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018720812448393">Militello and Hutton (1998)</xref>, and the critical decision method described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018720812448393">Hoffman et al. (1998)</xref>.</p>
<sec id="section11-0018720812448393">
<title>Knowledge elicitation phase</title>
<p>The initial phase of the interview included general, unstructured questions about laparoscopic surgery. Then the investigators used the critical decision method to elicit memorable laparoscopic incidents requiring extensive surgical expertise to successfully resolve. Laparoscopic surgery in general was the focus of this study, but surgeons were free to discuss specific procedures. An example of an elicited laparoscopic critical incident was a splenectomy on an obese patient with a rare blood disorder, requiring improvisation to successfully perform the surgery. If feasible within the time constraints of the interview, the critical incident was elaborated into a timeline with key decision points. The critical decision method was followed by the knowledge audit, which entails a set of domain-general questions designed to elicit differences between expert and novice behavior. Examples of questions from knowledge audit probes include “Have you had experiences where part of a situation just popped out at you, where you noticed things going on that others didn’t catch?” and “Can you think of an example when you have improvised in this task or noticed an opportunity to do something better?”</p>
<p>These examples were adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018720812448393">Militello and Hutton (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018720812448393">Klein and Militello (2005)</xref>, who provided probes to elicit expert–novice differences in a wide variety of work environments. The probes were tailored by the research team to better fit the surgical context. Questions were posed in such a way that they first clarified the nature of the question being posed (e.g., how experts are generally better at improvisation) and then directly addressed laparoscopic surgery (e.g., “Have you improvised this surgical procedure?”). If surgeons responded positively, they were asked to provide personal experience and specific examples to elaborate on the knowledge audit question. Given the skill-based nature of surgery, the most commonly used probes in this study targeted expertise in noticing cues, job smarts, improvisation, self-monitoring, and spotting anomalies (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018720812448393">Table 1</xref>). Critical incidents and specific examples focused on by surgeons during the knowledge elicitation phase included but were not limited to laparoscopic cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal), colectomy (partial colon removal), and herniorrhaphy (hernia repair).</p>

<p>After each interview, the investigators (one primary interviewer and one co-investigator) met to discuss the interview and to address <italic>reflexivity</italic>, in which issues with the research process are examined to enhance credibility and integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018720812448393">Davies &amp; Dodd, 2002</xref>). Reflexivity is intended to reduce or manage researcher bias, primarily by involving multiple researchers in discussing potential issues. In this process, they reviewed the most recent interview and discussed the findings, future interview strategies, and the project in general. Because of reflexivity, the researchers increased focus on eliciting knowledge about operative and postoperative decision making and developed a stronger emphasis on the knowledge audit in later interviews.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0018720812448393">
<title>Analysis and representation phase</title>
<p>At the end of the first round of interviews that constituted the knowledge elicitation phase, the interviews were transcribed and coded for key decisions, cues informing those decisions, expert strategies, and typical novice errors. This method is consistent with coding schemes in research with similar methodology (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018720812448393">Crandall, Klein, &amp; Hoffman, 2006</xref>). To control for rater bias, two raters independently scored the interview transcriptions; one of the raters trained to code the transcriptions was not involved in the interviews. If the two raters came to an agreement and found the decision, cue, strategy, or novice trap referenced more than once, that element was placed into a Decision Requirements Table (DRT). The DRT is a “data organizer” representation, intended to integrate information and compare data across multiple categories. We used the categories of decisions, information, expert strategies, and novice failures, as these categories are general, are easily understandable, and can help relate decision factors in laparoscopic surgery to other domains.</p>
<p>After the initial draft of the table was constructed, the investigators requested follow-up interviews with surgeons for further knowledge elicitation involving both unstructured questions and knowledge audit techniques and to check that the table was an accurate representation of their decision-making processes. There were four surgeons who participated in these follow-up interviews; one of them did not participate in the initial round of interviews. <italic>Expert checking</italic> is a technique for ensuring credibility of qualitative data, in which experts verify whether the information reflects their understanding of the domain and is free from misrepresentation by the research team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018720812448393">Glesne, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018720812448393">Whittemore, Chase, &amp; Mandle, 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Interrater Reliability</title>
<p>Next, two raters, one of whom did not take part in the interviews to reduce researcher bias, independently scored the interviews into five categories: decisions, information, expert strategies, novice traps, and other. Cohen’s kappa for calculating interrater agreement equaled 0.70, indicating good agreement. For the disagreements, a third party independently resolved the disagreement. The percentage of statements coded as “other” was 9.6%, suggesting that the coding scheme was a comprehensive fit to the data.</p>

<p>Initial data representation of the decision making, information cues, strategies, and novice traps for the preoperative, operative, and postoperative phases resulted in initial versions of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018720812448393">Tables 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0018720812448393">3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0018720812448393">4</xref>. Then four surgeons, of whom three also participated in the knowledge elicitation phase, participated in separate follow-up expert checking consultations. While meeting with these surgeons, researchers also clarified and added any missing elements to the tables. The initial <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018720812448393">Tables 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0018720812448393">3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0018720812448393">4</xref> contained a total of 149 elements, of which 55 elements needed to be clarified or added by expert checking. The final tables had a total of 156 elements within it, including 15 key decisions in the laparoscopic surgical process, 46 cues informing those decisions, 46 expert strategies, and 46 novice traps. Preoperative decisions comprise the issues surgeons need to consider before beginning the procedure (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018720812448393">Table 2</xref>). Operative decisions refer to those decisions that need to be made during surgery (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0018720812448393">Table 3</xref>). Postoperative decisions involve the period after the case, when the surgeon needs to decide whether to revise his or her approach to that procedure and improve technique (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0018720812448393">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>Experts in this sample attend to a wide variety of information to inform their decisions, and the nature of attended information changes throughout the course of a surgical case (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018720812448393">Tables 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0018720812448393">3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0018720812448393">4</xref>). In the preoperative phase, surgeons attend to physical information (size and type of organ, patient body type and function, availability of instruments), procedure information (risk, complexity, and length of case), and personal information (comfort level, experience). In the operative phase, surgeons attend more carefully to perceptual information (visualization, proprioceptive feedback, sound) and the length of surgery. In the postoperative phase, surgeons rely on retrospective assessment (length of time on surgery, discomfort) and outcome data.</p>
<p>Surgeons have a unique responsibility to decide (with the patient) the nature of the procedure and must attend to the indicated preoperative information and patient history. Furthermore, surgeons are responsible for monitoring the situation within the patient while maintaining good visualization and keeping the operation moving efficiently. Surgeons also rely on cues generated by other team members to maintain awareness, including the behavior of anesthesiologists and nurses, and sounds generated by the operating equipment. For example, if the operation is going smoothly, the skilled surgeon may not expect conversations involving the anesthesiologists, because there are no issues with the patient, or between the nurses, because there are no issues with equipment. If the surgeon hears conversation, it may signal an emerging problem. Novices are less likely to attend to these cues, risking a reactive (instead of proactive) response to problems.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study was designed (a) to determine the critical decisions and associated factors inherent in a wide variety of laparoscopic procedures during the preoperative, operative, and postoperative phases, with the long-term goal of aiding laparoscopic training, and (b) to observe how surgical decision making is consistent with the recognition-primed decision model. To reach these goals, cognitive task analysis was employed.</p>
<sec id="section18-0018720812448393">
<title>Critical Decisions and Their Implications for Training</title>
<p>Consistent with previous research, the results of the present study suggest that task analysis is powerful for determining critical factors and decisions in the laparoscopic environment. Although previous research reported the development of surgical curricula based on task analysis research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018720812448393">Campbell et al., 2011</xref>), this study extends the literature by providing more detailed information about surgical decisions. The analysis identified a multitude of decisions, cues, strategies, and novice traps inherent in the laparoscopic environment (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018720812448393">Tables 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0018720812448393">3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0018720812448393">4</xref>). The findings in the preoperative phase were also consistent with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720812448393">Agha and colleagues (2011)</xref>, who found that the decision of performing laparoscopic versus open surgery was significantly influenced by the nature and site of the organ in question (e.g., hernia) as well as the incidence of prior surgeries performed on the patient.</p>
<p>Particularly interesting were the results pertaining to training. For instance, novices are likely to rely too much on tests or scans to identify anatomical abnormalities. Therefore, surgical trainees should be made aware of the limitations of the specific tests or scans used for a given procedure. Because video guides and reviews used for preparing for complex cases might omit steps, surgical trainees need to be made aware about the possible limitations of these resources. To ensure that critical steps are not missed, experts in this study indicated that they used mental simulation to prepare for the surgery. Prior quantitative research indicate benefits of mental simulation for improving laparoscopic practice and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018720812448393">Arora et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018720812448393">Hall, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018720812448393">Sanders et al., 2008</xref>), so trainees can also be made aware of this method.</p>
<p>The results of the present and future studies can aid the development of surgical simulation, including virtual reality (VR) training. Current VR laparoscopic simulators offer training modules for specific surgical procedures. Limited research has been conducted to determine whether these modules aid in acquiring surgical decision skills, and the literature does not provide detailed description of laparoscopic decisions. The results of the present study provide an overview of novice traps inherent in a wide variety of laparoscopic surgeries and indicate that training modules should include scenarios involving adhesions, inflamed organs, extensive bleeding, and abnormal anatomies. Although the results of the present study are broad, the results can be applied to any laparoscopic procedure, and future cognitive task analyses can be employed to determine procedure-specific issues.</p>
<p>Decisions regarding the pre- and postoperative phases can be trained with the use of low-fidelity simulations. For example, case studies can expose surgical trainees to the preoperative planning for rare cases. Such low-fidelity training formats may be nearly as effective as high-physical-fidelity training formats, as long as the cognitive processes are the same as those in the real world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018720812448393">Gopher, Weil, &amp; Bareket, 1994</xref>). Along these lines, there have been software programs that provide modules to train decision-making ability, and these programs appear to be effective at improving student understanding and distinguishing between expert and novice abilities on decision making and technique but not knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018720812448393">Sarker, Rehman, Ladwa, Chang, &amp; Vincent, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018720812448393">Servais et al., 2006</xref>). We recommend that novices begin decision-making training as they begin mastery of surgical content such that training occurs within the surgical context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018720812448393">Luker et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Other decisions not as easy to simulate, such as postoperative evaluation or whether the procedure is novel or complex enough to merit review by manuals and videos, can be directly discussed and taught or monitored by surgical teaching staff. For example, in training residents about preoperative decision making, vignettes may be constructed with the relevant decision points (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018720812448393">Table 2</xref>) as choices for the trainee to make, along with relevant cues that may inform those decisions, such as a patient history, data from the physical exam, and results from scans. The scans may miss information or provide misleading information that an expert would most likely detect in the physical exam and history data, helping residents place less emphasis on the scans.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0018720812448393">
<title>Recognition-Primed Decisions in Laparoscopy</title>
<p>The recognition-primed decision-making model emphasizes the use of valid information in the environment and rapid retrieval of the appropriate action in memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018720812448393">Klein, 1998</xref>). Decisions, such as selecting open surgery versus laparoscopic surgery, whether to pause the operation, and whether to revise surgical technique, are made by recognition of domain-specific patterns. Respective examples of such patterns include the flimsiness of adhesions, the size of the target organ, the interaction between other members of the surgical team, and the experience of physical discomfort during the procedure. These examples suggest that surgeons frequently decide in a manner consistent with the basic form of the recognition-primed decision model, in which experts recognize a situation as typical and select the easily generated action. For example, decision making during a typical, uncomplicated gallbladder removal usually adheres to the recognition-primed decision-making model.</p>
<p>However, the laparoscopic environment, an unpredictable and complex sociotechnical system, often does not lend itself to procedural if-then decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018720812448393">Durso &amp; Drews, 2010</xref>). Thus, surgical experts sometimes cannot rely on rapid recognition to make correct decisions. For example, even expert surgeons find themselves in situations in which they must thoughtfully reevaluate their approach during surgery, evaluating alternative actions, such as the selection of different instruments or changing the position of the patient. Another facet of surgical decision making that does not fit with the basic variation of the recognition-primed decision model is the commonplace requirement for expert surgeons to review the literature and practice for rare or difficult procedures (e.g., abdominal wall reconstruction). Thus, a research need exists to identify surgical areas that do and do not strictly adhere to the recognition-primed decision-making model.</p>
<p>Consequently, the laparoscopic domain is better characterized by “fractionated expertise” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018720812448393">Kahneman &amp; Klein, 2009</xref>), which refers to experts who are deeply skilled in some activities but not others within the domain. In the context of surgery, this fractionation occurs because of the relative infrequency or complexity of some procedures, leading to an inability to gain high levels of expertise. The surgeons then face the challenge of judging whether they are fully expert in a prospective procedure and how to make the judgment. Some experts in our sample appear to use an explicit heuristic (e.g., “If I only perform one of these a month . . .”), whereas others appear to rely on a feeling of fluency or ease (e.g., “If it feels like I’ve got it . . .”). This choice is critical, because as the key decisions during the operative phase suggest (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0018720812448393">Table 3</xref>), surgeons frequently find themselves mentally evaluating the appropriate course of action during atypical situations. The effectiveness of this mental evaluation depends on having an accurate mental model of what to expect given a course of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018720812448393">Klein, 2003</xref>). Investing time in practice of the procedure and review of the medical literature improves mental model accuracy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0018720812448393">
<title>Research Opportunities</title>
<p>One of the key benefits of qualitative research is that it identifies and opens research and training opportunities for those using quantitative methods. Mental flexibility, which was a theme that distinguished novice from expert surgeons in this study, is not widely studied in the surgical environment. One could ask whether techniques known to decrease forms of mental rigidity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018720812448393">Arnon &amp; Kreitler, 1984</xref>) could be adapted to laparoscopic training. Good flexibility has been verified as an important marker of good decision making in surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018720812448393">Rennie, van Rij, Jaye, &amp; Hall, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, determining how to improve time-on-task prediction and monitoring would be significantly beneficial for training and human factors intervention in health care, as operation time is a critical performance marker during any kind of surgery. Novice traps with equipment could lead to improved design of medical devices, such as improving ease of performing intracorporeal knot tying and providing augmented visual support on the surgical camera.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0018720812448393">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Although it can be argued that the sample size of the current study is small, it lies within the acceptable range for interview-based research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018720812448393">Guest, Bunce, &amp; Johnson, 2006</xref>). These findings may be considered preliminary, requiring further empirical investigation with other converging methodologies and perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018720812448393">Hoffman &amp; Militello, 2008</xref>). Instead of interviewing novices, we assessed the testimony of experts to determine novice traps. However, experts are more likely to have a thorough understanding of the domain and to recognize when an error has occurred, and the experts in this sample are all educators who have been exposed to novice traps firsthand.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0018720812448393">
<title>Methodological Take-Away</title>
<p>The appropriateness of a particular task analysis depends on its context of use. The use of techniques such as the critical decision method has both advantages in the richness of the knowledge it can generate and disadvantages in that it is both time and resource intensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018720812448393">Fowlkes, Salas, Baker, Cannon-Bowers, &amp; Stout, 2000</xref>). The expert population of surgeons has significant demands on their time and energy. Therefore, an approach such as the critical decision method was not very effective in this context. The knowledge audit, which is quicker, was more useful. There is also a sociopolitical climate in medicine and surgery that promotes wariness of accusations of malpractice and reservation in reporting surgical errors. Thus, the significant self-disclosure and introspection required for in-depth interview methods, such as the critical incident technique, were not plausible without a great degree of trust between the surgeon and the interviewer and the time needed to develop that trust. Therefore, methodological flexibility on the part of the analyst is important for generating usable data.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Laparoscopic surgery is mentally demanding and requires both technical and decision-making skill for successful performance. Technical training is well established, but training in decision making is neglected. This article presents information on decision making to assist those interested in training surgical practitioners. With this research as a starting point, researchers should focus on empirical verification of these findings, extend cognitive task analysis to specific subtypes of laparoscopic surgery, and specify which subdomains within laparoscopic surgery are characterized by fractionated expertise to determine when surgeons can rely on their expert intuitions.</p>

<list-item><p>The recognition-priming approach may underpin surgical decision making, but researchers should consider issues with fractionated expertise.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Future task analyses that focus on specific laparoscopic procedures can identify procedure-specific decision-making issues.</p></list-item>
