<p>Jacques de Ville’s new book <italic>Jacques Derrida: Law as Absolute Hospitality</italic> proposes to provide a new and improved reading of Derrida’s work in connection with law. Concentrating on Derrida’s approach to questions of law and justice, the work challenges earlier interpretations and claims to offer a better one than most that have been put forward in legal theory. The author engages in a critical dialogue with some of these previous works, showing what for him results in misinterpretations of Derrida’s ideas.</p>
<p>De Ville argues strongly and convincingly that Derrida’s ideas on law cannot be interpreted separately from his other work – it is necessary to understand Derrida’s whole project in order to be able to understand what he says about law. De Ville maintains that we can comprehend Derrida’s own thinking only in relation to the texts of Husserl, Heidegger, Freud and to some extent Levinas. This idea is, of course, not a new one, but the extent to which de Ville stresses the importance of Freud is unusual.</p>
<p>The book is divided into eight chapters, including an introduction where de Ville explains the main thesis of the book. Some of the chapters are partly rewritten articles on different themes now collected into one volume. The chapters contain analyses of Derrida’s texts that relate in one way or the other to law and justice. De Ville seeks to offer a detailed reading of these texts and manages to show that even where connections to the legal field may not be obvious, they can nevertheless be sought and found. One of the merits of de Ville’s project of finding an alternative reading of Derrida is that he manages to make rather a compelling argument of his own by concentrating on the texts that may seem surprising in this context.</p>
<p>The introductory chapter includes a discussion of prevailing ways of understanding Derrida’s concept of law. De Ville argues against both hostile and sympathetic readings of Derrida, claiming that both of these often lack an understanding of Derrida’s broader project. The dominant readings in the legal field de Ville calls (1) the methodical reading, which was developed in the United States by Critical Legal Studies; (2) the postmodern reading, which emphasizes undecidability and indeterminacy; (3) the ethical-liberal reading, which claims that justice, being the recognition of the plurality of interests, is impossible; and (4) the cosmopolitan reading put forward by Costas Douzinas, which connects some of the ideas of Derrida, Levinas, Lacan and Foucault. De Ville rejects all of these as misguided.</p>
<p>Above all, de Ville’s own argument is that we have to be attentive to Derrida’s deconstruction of the metaphysics of presence because it is the cornerstone of all his thinking. According to Derrida, western metaphysics is based on a desire for presence. Everyday thinking and language rely on the processes and concepts of metaphysics, and thus they are also based on the desire for presence. The idea is that metaphysics seeks to find itself in the living present and deny a necessary relationship with absence, or death, which is in this context another form of nonpresence. De Ville maintains that we cannot understand Derrida’s thoughts on law if we do not keep in mind the deconstruction of the metaphysics of presence, which he developed very early in his thinking. As thinking and language are ultimately based on the concepts and processes of metaphysics, so also is law. This means that law also tends to reflect a desire for presence and deny absence, uncertainty and insecurity. Derrida seeks ways of exceeding metaphysics in his readings of different texts by, for instance, Husserl, Heidegger, Levinas and Freud. In this book, Freud gets a prominent role because de Ville argues that there is a direct relationship between Derrida’s reading of Freud’s death drive and Derrida’s thoughts on justice, absolute hospitality, the gift and democracy.</p>
<p>The chapters are arranged more or less chronologically, meaning the order in which Derrida’s texts, on which the chapters are based, have been published. In Chapter 2, de Ville analyzes <italic>Declarations of Independence</italic> and delves into speech-act theory, representation, signature, and so on. Here Derrida’s philosophy of language is discussed in connection to the questions of sovereignty and the state. Already at this point, some psychoanalytical themes are brought up. De Ville claims that it is essential to understand the role of Freud’s thinking here. A Freudian point of view undermines the idea upheld by the classical speech act theory that there would be a self-present conscious ego behind every speech act. Derrida, as De Ville lucidly shows, pays attention to what happens unconsciously in language.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 concentrates on one of the classical texts of Derrida-inspired legal theory: <italic>Before the Law</italic>, which is an essay of Derrida’s on Kafka’s text. <italic>Before the Law </italic>also includes a reading of Freud’s <italic>Totem and Taboo</italic>. In Chapter 4, de Ville analyzes Derrida’s reading of Foucault’s <italic>History of Madness</italic>. According to de Ville’s Derrida, the exclusion of a certain madness is the precondition of meaning and language. De Ville’s approach is to read Derrida and Foucault together, although their projects have often been seen as opposing ones. De Ville shows how we can see total madness as another name for Freud’s death drive or what in Derrida becomes a desire for death, that is, a past which has never been present and which always remains to come. Another name for this madness, according to de Ville, is justice. De Ville explains this central claim of his: ‘Justice […] stands in tension with all claims of identity and sovereignty, also via law. Law’s confrontation with justice cannot be avoided. In the same way in which the self can relate to itself only by way of a passage through madness, law can be constituted only by way of justice. This justice […] involves self-destruction; auto-immunity; a mad, impossible hospitality, without limitation, control or reciprocity (p. 112).’ We can see how he constructs his argument of Derrida’s concept of law and justice through strong relationships to both madness and death.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 concentrates on Derrida’s texts on the gift, and in Chapter 6, de Ville discusses <italic>Force of Law</italic>, which is the best-known – and most debated – of Derrida’s writings in legal theoretical circles. Chapter 7 is a particularly interesting one and deals with Heidegger’s reading of the Anaximander fragment and Derrida’s discussion thereof in <italic>Specters of Marx</italic>. Here, de Ville touches on Derrida’s thinking of Marxism and justice, Heidegger’s thoughts on Being and Levinas’s ideas on the other. Even more extensive coverage of these themes, which are essential for understanding Derrida’s notion of law, would have been welcome. Marxism is a particularly intriguing subject in this context and could also have other interesting connections to Derrida’s understanding of law and justice than those offered by de Ville. Not surprisingly, also when discussing these themes De Ville sees Derrida’s thinking as ‘clearly informed by Freud’s analysis of the death drive’ (p. 191). Suspicion even arises that his strong commitment to this idea might have guided his interpretation of Derrida toward a predetermined goal that fits the general argument of the book.</p>
<p>The notion of time and the problem of how to understand the future are addressed in the closing chapter. Derrida’s ideas on the future are fascinating, but what is their connection to law and justice? As de Ville explains, the future is for Derrida the condition of the possibility of history, and it flows over history and the present. At the same time, the future presupposes a historical link, tradition and memory. The notion of future is here understood in a similar way as the ‘to come’, the event, the promise and also the impossible. The future is for Derrida the nonidentifiable, which means that it has no recognizable form. It is simply never present and it does not approach us head on, which means that it cannot be seen. The future often comes from the back. De Ville links this idea of the future to his overall argument and the death drive. He compares the future that comes back and haunts us with unconditional justice, autoimmunity, and the promise and threat of madness. De Ville argues that the future in a radical sense does not stand a chance without a deconstruction of that which we take for granted in law. Only through questioning the concepts of time and the subject can the future have a chance of coming. This way, through such a deconstruction, law can open up in a radical way.</p>
<p>De Ville gives us an interpretation of Derrida that is both insightful and original. The introductory chapter makes it relatively easy to follow the main argument of the book as it develops through different chapters. However, the way Derrida is read emphasizes psychoanalytical elements to the extent that some will surely find excessive, even though de Ville’s reading is coherent and convincing. Also, de Ville’s assertion that he offers the correct interpretation against the false dominant ones may raise an eyebrow or two. Derrida wrote so much on such a variety of themes that any reading is compelled to make choices of emphasis, which are to some extent arbitrary and based on the interpreter’s preferences. A claim that he had just one project into which all his texts fit is a strong claim. De Ville himself seems to agree with this when he says toward the end that the book shows some of the complexity of Derrida’s thinking and opens certain texts of his to differing interpretations.</p>
<p>
<italic>Jacques Derrida: Law as Absolute Hospitality</italic> can be recommended to everyone who is interested specifically in Derrida or in general legal theory. It is evident that de Ville has read his Derrida thoroughly, including the less well-known texts, and can back up his arguments with ample references. The work offers such an intriguing exposition of Derrida’s philosophy that even those who do not agree should find it a valuable contribution to the discussion.</p>
