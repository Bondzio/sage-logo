<title>1. How do you differentiate between asthma and COPD when an adult patient presents with recurrent cough, wheeze, and shortness of breath?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Gorin:</speaker>
<p>First, an accurate history of possible asthma symptoms in childhood or adolescence is extremely helpful in influencing you toward that diagnosis in the adult. This would include a history of chronic cough or frequent respiratory infections as a child, or of exercise limitation in gym classes, in the absence of a clear history of bronchospasm. Does the patient have first-degree relatives diagnosed with asthma? Is there a personal or family history of allergic disorders? Additional useful history is with regard employment in fields known to have associated risks of airways sensitization and asthma (eg, lumber milling of red cedar, plastics manufacture with isothiocyanate exposure). Does the patient have a history of cigarette smoking or of heavy wood smoke or dung fire exposure if raised in a third world country? But, in the end, the most useful discriminator is probably measurement of diffusion capacity in the pulmonary function laboratory. This is a marker of the presence of emphysematous changes (or interstitial fibrotic changes) in the lung; abnormalities are seen in more than 80% to 85% of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but the test is usually normal in adult patients with asthma (unless they have more complex disease associated with asthma, such as Churg–Strauss syndrome).</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Gomez-Villalobos:</speaker>
<p>The combination of past medical history, social history, and pulmonary function testing provide a good starting point. In the past medical history, the symptom onset or the presence of respiratory symptoms at a young age; the description of specific environmental/allergic triggers, including aspirin; upper airway symptoms; and comorbidities, including allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, and gastroesophageal reflux, help when trying to characterize asthma. The presence of cigarette smoke exposure plays a major role in COPD; therefore, this piece of information is key. However, biomass smoke and occupational exposures are also associated with COPD, particularly in developing countries. Family history is occasionally helpful, as asthma is commonly found in families; however, it is very important to also consider genetic causes of COPD, including alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. With pulmonary function testing, bronchodilator reversibility and the lack of diffusion impairment abnormalities suggest asthma in a good number of individuals; however, the addition of an elevated fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), may also suggest this diagnosis. In COPD, the bronchodilator reversibility tends to be absent or not significant, and the presence of concomitant emphysema is sometimes associated with diffusion impairment. Other findings on common tests, such as chest x-ray, include hyperinflation with decreased parenchyma, which suggest emphysema. Elevated eosinophils or elevated IgE are abnormal in some individuals with atopic asthma, suggesting this diagnosis over COPD.</p>
</speech>
<p>Some of the nuances in differentiating asthma and COPD are too specific in certain cases, and the differential diagnosis between the 2 conditions should always be considered and continuously reassessed to identify the needs of patients and potential therapeutic indications of new pharmacologic agents. Our understanding of the multiple phenotypes that comprise the asthma and COPD syndromes continues to evolve and is becoming more sophisticated, through the correlation with biomarkers and the analysis of large groups of individuals with the conditions.</p>

<title>2. What strategies do you employ to encourage acceptance of long-term control therapy for newly diagnosed adult asthma patients?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Gorin:</speaker>
<p>We might divide the patients into 2 groups: (<italic>a</italic>) those in whom symptoms are only present during and following a respiratory infection and (<italic>b</italic>) those with chronic, usually low levels of small and large airway bronchospasm. First, spirometry is essential to demonstrate to the patients that they actually have obstructive airways disease and that treatment with short-acting beta-agonists and with inhaled glucocorticoids ameliorates the abnormalities seen on spirometry. Patients with respiratory infection–associated symptoms are usually aware of persistent and increased cough. Inhaled steroids virtually always improve the cough. These patients will almost always agree to start inhaled corticosteroids with the onset of symptoms and maintain treatment for a period of 4 to 6 weeks. Follow-up 2 weeks after stopping the inhaled steroids, with spirometry, will demonstrate whether or not additional inhaled steroids are needed. Patients with chronic, low-level airways obstruction are more difficult to deal with. They are usually at an age where they have limited exertion, or they actively limit exertion to avoid experiencing dyspnea. They may wish to avoid using maintenance medication to limit expenses. I will try to get them to increase their activity levels, becoming more “heart healthy,” when they may realize the benefits of maintenance treatment, or argue that they will suffer fewer winter episodes of respiratory illness (which will hopefully result in the desired outcome). Educating the patient about the risk of accelerated loss of lung function, if underlying inflammation is left untreated, is motivating in some cases. In the extreme, and in accordance with our EPR3 Guidelines, making the patients, or their family, aware that even the mildest of asthma in patients still carries a risk for a fatal exacerbation.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Gomez-Villalobos:</speaker>
<p>On the initial visit, I educate the patients about what is causing their symptoms, and I provide some information about what asthma does to their airways and the key components, inflammation and bronchoconstriction, we are trying to address with the most common asthma medications. I always show a figure of the normal airway and one of the asthmatic airway, which helps anchor the message of what is happening with inflammation and bronchoconstriction.</p>
<p>My approach is to give patients the opportunity to try their medications and identify the agent that works better for them, sometimes requiring the use of different products and devices until the patient feels comfortable with the intervention. Assistance during this period is essential since it provides a unique opportunity to educate your patients, but you are also allowing them the opportunity to choose what the best strategy to treat their disease. Sometimes frequent visits in a relatively short period of time help patients with a new diagnosis until they achieve a better control and comfort with their management. The participation of all the members in the clinic and the assistance from either your nurse or respiratory therapist in educating the patients are invaluable in this process.</p>

<title>3. What do you feel is the biggest obstacle to treating asthma in the older adult population and how do you address it?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Gorin:</speaker>
<p>In my experience, the greatest obstacle has always been financial duress. Even co-pays for these medicines are usually expensive for many patients on fixed incomes. Fortunately, many pharmaceutical companies have established programs supplying free medication or reduced cost medication to financially challenged patients (eg, Astra Zeneca, GlaxoSmithKline). I keep a supply (in English and Spanish) of the application forms in my office and will have office staff assist patients in applying for this benefit. An additional obstacle to treating asthma in older patients with asthma is failure to recognize the disease and instead misinterpreting the symptoms as cardiac in origin, COPD, or “just a part of the aging process.”</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Gomez-Villalobos:</speaker>
<p>In my experience, the appropriate use of inhaler devices is the biggest challenge for the older adults due to the differences in how the devices are prepared to deliver the treatment, how they are triggered, schedules, and coordination with the respiratory effort, in addition to polypharmacy. My approach starts with a demonstration by the patients on how they are using the inhaler or inhalers on their visit with me; I also try to simplify their regime as much as possible and educate when I am starting a new inhaler to maximize their success with therapy. The use of spacers in this population is of great help to overcome some of those challenges.</p>

<sec id="section4-2150129713481450">
<title>4. What therapies for smoking cessation do you recommend for your adult asthma patients?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Gorin:</speaker>
<p>Varenicline (Chantrix) undoubtedly has the best data regarding successful smoking cessation, achieving quit rates of 40% to 50%. If therapy can be maintained for 6 months, rather than 3, even less recidivism is seen. Fortunately, many insurers seem to have recognized this and will actually pay for 6 months of therapy. While the package insert suggests a “one size fits all” therapy, with all patients advancing to a dose of 1 mg twice daily, small patients more frequently seem to suffer the side effect of intractable nausea. This will remit if the dose is reduced to 1.5 mg (1 mg in the morning and 0.5 mg in the evening) or 1 mg daily(0.5 mg twice daily), and the majority of these patients are able to quit smoking. Pfizer also has a plan available to reduce co-pays for this product. In patients unable to afford or tolerate Varenicline, I am frequently able to use Buproprion-XL, since this is covered by most insurance plans as an antidepressant. Here the dose is 150 mg twice daily, with at least a 6-hour interval between the 2 doses (since peak dose is associated with the potential side effect of seizure). This drug should not be used in patients with a history of seizure disorder. An extremely effective part of convincing your patients to quit smoking is impressing on them how important it is to “You,” their health care provider, that they accomplish this, and by asking them about their status/progress at every contact.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Gomez-Villalobos:</speaker>
<p>I always emphasize that one of the most important elements of smoking cessation is to develop a plan on when to start, and I give them information related to the available resources in the community and in our health care system. I follow-up with them on their next visit and may initiate nicotine replacement therapy with a combination of a nicotine patch and rapid release forms including gum or lozenges. In general, this is a long process and requires education as well as support for the patients, since the frequency of relapse is high and requires adjustments based on the specific challenges that they face to stop smoking.</p>

<speaker>Gomez-Villalobos:</speaker>
<p>Our program at the Yale Center for Asthma and Airways Disease has an interdisciplinary team that includes a PA who is also an RT, nurses, study coordinators, in addition to the group of physicians. This gives patients the opportunity to interact with multiple health care professionals specialized in the disease and provides opportunities to reinforce the management plan.</p>
</speech>
<p>In addition, we provide handouts with information related to asthma that provides basic facts about the disease, symptoms, action plans, and therapies.</p>
<p>The American Lung Association Web site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lung.org/associations/charters/midland-states/program-information/asthma/caare/resources.html">http://www.lung.org/associations/charters/midland-states/program-information/asthma/caare/resources.html</ext-link>) is also a great resource for patients and practitioners.</p>
