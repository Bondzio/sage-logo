<p>Drawing on Mary Douglas’s cultural theory, our research analyzes the cultural schemes or biases mobilized by compensation committee (CC) members, in the context of public companies, when making sense of their committee’s work. Relying on semi-structured interviews mostly conducted with CC members in Canada, our analysis brings to the fore the production of moral and rational comfort within the boundaries of the individualistic and hierarchical culture. Under an individualistic bias, the compensation market is seen as natural, providing conditions of possibility that serve to establish fair compensation through the creation and enforcement of contracts. Under a hierarchic bias which emphasizes principles of objectivity and measurability, members of CCs tend to conceive the design of compensation policies as an act of expertise, relying extensively on consultants and measurement techniques to determine acceptable reward boundaries. Not only does our paper contribute to corporate governance literature by providing insight into a central aspect of CCs, that is to say CC members’ ways of thinking and doing, but the juxtaposition of cultural theory with CC empirics provides us with the opportunity to reflect and theorize on the issue of cultural change.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Following the 2007–2009 debacle among many financial institutions, an increasing number of critics have expressed dismay over the current state of executive pay. Concerns have risen about the relatively weak relationship between top executive compensation and corporate performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0170840611433993">Bebchuk, Cohen, &amp; Spamann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0170840611433993">Bryant &amp; Sapp, 2007</xref>). In 2007, when the effects of the mortgage crisis were already well advanced, bonuses for seven of Wall Street’s top investment firms were up by 10 percent from 2006, despite these firms’ shareholder value collectively decreasing by $200 billion during 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0170840611433993">Tse &amp; Merle, 2008</xref>). Critics also decried the increasing earnings decoupling between executive and average employee remuneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0170840611433993">Harris, 2009</xref>). Such debates occur not only in the arena of US public opinion but also in many other advanced economies such as Canada where claims of executive pay packages being excessive are increasingly being heard. For instance, the average executive salary of the 50 highest paid CEOs of Canadian publicly traded corporations grew from 85 times that of the average worker in 1995 to 398 times in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0170840611433993">Mackenzie, 2009</xref>). In light of these preoccupations, boards of directors and their compensation committees, which are responsible for determining executive compensation, are now under public scrutiny as critical interrogations emerge, in a search to better understand how remuneration packages are awarded to top executives of large public firms (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0170840611433993">Bingham, 2010</xref>; Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0170840611433993">Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The compensation committee (CC) is one of the main corporate governance mechanisms upon which are predicated stakeholders’ hopes in monitoring the remuneration of executives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0170840611433993">1</xref></sup> Yet it is typically recognized that CCs are confronted with considerable uncertainty in their tasks, as the determinants of executive pay remain elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0170840611433993">Tosi, Werner, Katz, &amp; Gomez-Mejia, 2000</xref>) and corporate governance codes offer little precision regarding the crucial question of what constitutes an appropriate level of remuneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0170840611433993">Cadbury Report, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0170840611433993">Saucier Report, 2001</xref>). Until now, most of the research on CCs has confined itself to the examination of relationships between measurable features of CCs, indicators of CEO compensation, and indicators of corporate performance (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0170840611433993">Barkema &amp; Pennings, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0170840611433993">Berrone &amp; Gomez-Mejia, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0170840611433993">Cheng &amp; Farber, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0170840611433993">Daily, Johnson, Ellstrand, &amp; Dalton, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0170840611433993">Devers, McNamara, Wiseman, &amp; Arrfelt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0170840611433993">Laux &amp; Laux, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0170840611433993">Zajac &amp; Westphal, 1994</xref>). This may be attributed, in part, to the practical difficulties of studying boards at work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0170840611433993">McNulty &amp; Pettigrew, 1999</xref>)—but also to a variety of other reasons, such as boards’ confidentiality concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0170840611433993">Leblanc &amp; Gillies, 2005</xref>) and academics’ preferences for “hard” data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0170840611433993">Panozzo, 1997</xref>). As such, we know very little about the “close operation” of CCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0170840611433993">Perkins &amp; Hendry, 2005</xref>, p. 1451), and current research provides limited insights into the shared values and beliefs that underlie the work of CCs.</p>
<p>Adding to a small number of recent studies concerned with developing in-depth understandings of CCs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0170840611433993">Hermanson, Tompkins, Veliyath, &amp; Ye, forthcoming</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0170840611433993">Main, Jackson, Pymm, &amp; Wright, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0170840611433993">Ogden &amp; Watson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0170840611433993">Perkins &amp; Hendry, 2005</xref>), our study attempts to address this gap by analyzing the cultural biases which allow CC members to be morally comfortable with their responsibilities in overseeing top executive remuneration. Our study also provides insight into the work of CCs—although we are sensitive to the potential gap between espoused theories (as revealed in interviews) and theories-in-use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0170840611433993">Argyris &amp; Schön, 1974</xref>).</p>
<p>We conduct our examination through a cultural angle drawn from “cultural theory”, as elaborated in the work of anthropologist Mary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0170840611433993">Douglas (1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0170840611433993">1992a</xref>). While business organizations are often thought to differ significantly from the imagery of typical groups and communities studied by anthropologists, Douglas’s cultural theory can shed light on major issues facing contemporary business organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0170840611433993">Altman &amp; Baruch, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0170840611433993">Gephart, Van Maanen, &amp; Oberlechner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0170840611433993">Lane &amp; Quack, 1999</xref>), including corporate governance issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0170840611433993">Hendry, 1999</xref>). Drawing on Douglas’s work, we seek to better understand why CC members do what they do, showing that the design of executive remuneration schemes is informed by cultural logics that reflect CC members’ preferences about justice, work, risk, compensation and performance. Our study therefore illuminates the cultural biases through which CC members’ ways of thinking and doing are constituted morally—not only mechanically as suggested by agency theory or strategically as posited by institutional theory.</p>
<p>Our analysis, based on semi-structured interviews conducted in Canada mainly with CC members, brings to the fore the production of moral and rational comfort within the boundaries of the individualistic and hierarchical cultural schemes. Under an individualistic scheme which emphasizes principles of individual freedom to negotiate and social competitiveness, members of CCs tend to interpret risks and issues attached to remuneration policies from a market-based perspective. Under a hierarchic scheme which emphasizes principles of objectivity and measurability, members of CCs tend to conceive of the design of compensation policies as a neutral act of expertise, relying extensively on consultants and measurement techniques to determine acceptable reward boundaries. The combination of individualism and hierarchy is not unique to CCs; on the contrary, their association is frequently encountered and constitutive of the “center” in Western social thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0170840611433993">Douglas &amp; Wildavsky, 1982</xref>). Arguably, the views of the center are deeply involved in engendering a sphere of executive compensation characterized by high inflation and an increasing gap with the average worker pay.</p>
<p>As human beings, CC members fundamentally feel the need to make sense of the world and their place in it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840611433993">Douglas, 1992b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0170840611433993">Weick, 1995</xref>). One of the main impressions arising from our data is a sense of CC members genuinely doing their best to fulfill their responsibilities, according to their cultural beliefs (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0170840611433993">Gendron &amp; Bédard, 2006</xref>). In so doing, public criticisms of top executive remuneration will tend to be dismissed in board circles, especially when CC members are accused, as it is often the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0170840611433993">Harris, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0170840611433993">Kaplan, 2008</xref>), of irrationality or of being moved by unworthy motives such as greed or vanity. However, far from being constrained to relativism or inertia, the identification of dominant cultural biases and their underlying morality allows us to envision a reformist agenda predicated on cultural pluralism.</p>
<p>The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we introduce Douglas’s cultural theory. This is followed by information on how data was collected and analyzed. Interview evidence is presented and discussed in the subsequent section—our focus being how CC members perceive and construct executive compensation in the light of values and beliefs derived from Douglas’s cultural biases. Finally, the last section presents our conclusions and what we view as the main implications and contributions of the paper.</p>

<title>Preferences</title>
<p>Where do preferences come from? As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0170840611433993">Thompson, Ellis, and Wildavsky (1990</xref>, p. 55) observe:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>This is the great unanswered question in the social sciences. Indeed for the most part, it is the great unasked question. Economists take preferences as given, as external to the system being considered. They can, of course, handle the consequences of changes in preferences, but they cannot say anything about where these preferences come from. Political scientists are interested in how people get what they want through political activity. But in both cases, the prior question of why people want what they want is not normally posed. Similarly, decision-making theorists focus on the means used to achieve a given end but rarely ask how people come to prefer that end over some other end.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Research on CCs is not immune to this characterization and has, until now, largely ignored the question of the origin of preferences with regard to compensation policies. Under the agency theory umbrella, most of the research carried out takes for granted that the committee’s preferences are (or should be) essentially motivated by a will to balance the asymmetry between the wants of executives and the interests of shareholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0170840611433993">Perkins &amp; Hendry, 2005</xref>). On this basis, studies attempt to measure under which conditions—composition, independence, experience, etc.—committee members are most able to achieve this preferential objective (see for instance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0170840611433993">Daily et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0170840611433993">Laux &amp; Laux, 2009</xref>). Articulated around institutional theory, another stream of research investigates the strategies mobilized by CCs to legitimize their recommendations and decisions vis-à-vis stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0170840611433993">Berrone &amp; Gomez-Mejia, 2009</xref>). According to this perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0170840611433993">Main et al. (2008</xref>, p. 225) find for instance “that concerns with legitimacy push remuneration committees towards an institutional isomorphism in processes and practice”, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0170840611433993">Ogden and Watson (2008</xref>, p. 711) show how “remuneration committees, concerned about potential stakeholder criticism, devoted considerable time and resources to ensure that their choice of comparators and performance metrics would be regarded as legitimate”.</p>
<p>In spite of the insights they have engendered, these two theoretical perspectives tend to underestimate the question of CC members’ preference formation. Either preferences are taken for granted, or research is confined to the understanding of how they are legitimized. However, in neglecting the construction of preferences, current research on CCs is not very helpful in addressing the issue of soaring compensation, which is commonly viewed as resulting from: (a) unbounded arbitrariness and irresponsibility on the part of CC members; or (b) technical isomorphism, in which members mechanistically apply remuneration schemes viewed as legitimate in director compensation networks but whose outcomes are not necessarily perceived favorably in the wider community. In short, there is a vacuum about why CC members do what they do.</p>
<p>Before addressing this research problem, it should be recognized that the adoption of executive compensation policies now constitutes a central stake for organizations. Not only because it is often claimed that their performance depends on their abilities to recruit and motivate skilled executives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0170840611433993">McDonald, Khanna, &amp; Westphal, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0170840611433993">McDonald, Westphal, &amp; Graebner, 2008</xref>), but also, and perhaps mainly, because various scandals have brought to the fore reputational risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0170840611433993">Power, 2007</xref>) tied to the levels of compensation awarded. The work of CCs is therefore more and more understood as being about managing risks—in a context where economic and moral considerations closely intertwine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0170840611433993">Harris, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Under this angle, Mary Douglas’s cultural theory appears particularly appropriate to study CC members’ ways of thinking. One of the main intuitions underlying her theory is the conception of risk management as a socially constructed process involving the distribution of responsibilities and the allocation of blame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0170840611433993">Mikes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0170840611433993">Power, 2007</xref>). Never fully objective or knowable outside of belief systems and moral positions, risks for Mary Douglas are always embedded in cultures which give them meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0170840611433993">Lupton, 1999</xref>) and legitimize organizational forms and actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0170840611433993">Gephart et al., 2009</xref>). As pointed out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0170840611433993">Douglas and Wildavsky (1982</xref>, p. 5), the construction of dangers and risks fundamentally relates to the notion of preferences: “Risk should be seen as joint product of knowledge about the future and consent about the most desired prospects.” In sum, Douglas’s perspective is well adapted to the examination of the choices and preferences of individuals whose work, in the current context, is increasingly located at the crossroad of risk and morality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0170840611433993">
<title>Drawing preferences from social relations</title>
<p>According to Douglas’s cultural theory, preferences are formed from the most basic desire of human beings—how we wish to live with other people and others to live with us. Her theory identifies four primary ways of perceiving, organizing and justifying social relations: individualism, hierarchy, egalitarianism and fatalism. These four ways of life, also called cultural biases, operate in every conceivable domain of social life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0170840611433993">Ellis &amp; Thompson, 1997</xref>). Theoretically, the fourfold typology is derived from two kinds of societal control: grid and group. ‘Grid’ concerns the amount of classification and rules to which individuals are subject to in the course of their interactions. In other words, grid relates to the extent of autonomy a person has over the selection of roles in their daily life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0170840611433993">Linsley &amp; Shrives, 2009</xref>). Grid therefore addresses agency and attempts to evaluate the extent to which individuals are free to negotiate their own behavior. ‘Group’ represents the individual’s commitment to their community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0170840611433993">Linsley &amp; Shrives, 2009</xref>). More specifically, it relates to the amount of moral pressure that a community puts on its members in terms of the claims it makes over them, and the boundaries it draws around them. The notion of group therefore addresses communitarian identity and attempts to evaluate the extent to which the individual belongs to an existing social unit, or conversely, has to forge his or her own social network.</p>
<p>For instance, when admission to the social unit is hard to achieve, the unit is more exclusive and conscious of its boundaries and group strength tends to be high. An extreme case might be the monastic community whose members renounce their private property upon entering and depend on the corporate body for all of their material and social needs. By contrast, group strength is low when people negotiate their way through life on their own—that is to say, when individuals pick and choose with whom they associate, according to their preoccupations and perceived interests. Grid is high whenever roles are distributed on the basis of explicit public classifications, such as gender, age or position in a hierarchy. On the other hand, a low-grid environment is one in which role distribution is not heavily circumscribed, being instead focused on personal abilities to compete and negotiate for positions, and on formal conditions that ensure equal access and opportunity to compete.</p>
<p>Assigning two values (high and low) to these two dimensions, cultural theory identifies four types of cultural biases (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0170840611433993">Figure 1</xref>): individualism (low grid, low group), hierarchy (high grid, high group), egalitarianism (low grid, high group) and fatalism (high grid, low group). In the paragraphs below, we detail how each cultural bias reflects distinct values and conveys a certain view of the world, particularly regarding attitudes towards risk and blame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0170840611433993">Douglas, 1992a</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section5-0170840611433993">
<title>The individualistic bias</title>
<p>The individualistic bias is primarily oriented towards the preservation of individual freedom to contract. In an environment dominated by competitiveness and low grid, the social experience of individuals is not significantly constrained by external boundaries or by substantive signs of ascribed status. Existing classifications are only provisional and negotiable; relationships between individuals are ambiguous. To behave morally simply means to respect the terms of contracts which are established in the course of daily life. In this context, the role of the state is limited to ensuring that fair play prevails, and that obligations from contracts are enforced.</p>
<p>Authority is attributed to individuals on the basis of their personal resources and wealth. Consistent with this personalization of authority, blame for misfortune is allocated on an individual basis due to the failures of the leader’s personal resources. If the leader does not deliver on her or his promises, those who initially supported her/him can change their allegiance in favor of a new leader. Individuals are not committed to tradition; indeed innovation often requires rupture from the past. Furthermore, people within this system are reluctant to admit that free negotiation or market mechanisms can engender failure. Thriving on confrontation, the individualistic bias interprets disasters from a Darwinian viewpoint, as collapses ensuing from the incompetence of an agent constitute basic opportunities from a competitive angle, allowing new and potentially stronger leaders to emerge through contests.</p>
<p>Overall, the bias is characterized with a social logic which imputes agency to individuals for untoward events or for failure to respond effectively to such events. As a result, morality surrounding crisis is directed at locating individuals as source of risks and at blaming individuals for concretizations of risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0170840611433993">Gephart et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0170840611433993">
<title>The hierarchic bias</title>
<p>The hierarchical way of perceiving and organizing is predicated on principles of order between people. Hierarchy seeks to reduce competition and introduce a “fair” and “objective” division of tasks, and therefore a “fair” and “objective” distribution of wealth, according to age, gender or experience in order to secure the internal structure of authority in the group.</p>
<p>In the modern context, knowledge plays a key role in constituting hierarchic order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0170840611433993">Coyle, 1997</xref>). Fairness and objectivity are thus mainly “determined by experts and dispassionate authority” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0170840611433993">Verweij et al., 2006</xref>, p. 4), requiring in particular “objective bases for comparison that can be used to justify the decision made” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0170840611433993">Douglas, 1997</xref>, p. 131). For instance, along the hierarchic bias, “environmental management requires certified experts to determine the precise locations of nature’s limits, and statutory regulation to ensure that all economic activity is kept within those limits” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0170840611433993">Verweij et al., 2006</xref>, p. 4). In its concern for measurability, hierarchy tends to produce risk metrics that are presented as being technically neutral, that is to say, not politicized. Blame for misfortune tends to be attributed to agents who did not abide by some of the rules; as a result disasters are interpreted to support or reinforce the set of controlling measures. In sum, in a hierarchical social setting, “actors see the world as relatively controllable” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0170840611433993">Verweij et al., 2006</xref>, p. 4). Moral behavior consists of behaving responsibly in the service of the community’s well-being, those at the top of the hierarchies being seen as servants of the community as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0170840611433993">Hendry, 1999</xref>).</p>

<title>The egalitarian bias</title>
<p>The egalitarian bias is essentially a radical political discourse; it represents the conscience of the community, reformist in its objectives, holistic in its modes of reasoning, rejecting rankings, formalities, mechanistic rules and inequalities: “It is not enough that people start off equal; they must end up equal as well—equality of result. Trust and levelling go hand in hand, and institutions that distribute unequally are distrusted” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0170840611433993">Verweij et al., 2006</xref>, p. 4). Being committed to the moral virtue of equality, egalitarians associate ambition with inequality and corrupted stratification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0170840611433993">Douglas, 1992a</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0170840611433993">Douglas (1997</xref>, p. 130), egalitarianism constitutes “the source of scorn routinely poured on the bureaucratic concerns of the [hierarchic] type and on the materialist goals of the [individualistic] type”. From this bias, the villain is often the fundamentally inequitable structure of advanced industrial society—in particular, the profit motive and the obsession with economic growth—and the heroes are those organizations and individuals who stand resolutely against the illusion of socio-economic progress and its cortege of inequalities. Individual prosperity is condemned. Further, to strengthen the value of their collective aims, egalitarians rely on strategies that disvalue the world outside: “The threat of danger from outside is used in internal politics to justify factions and to force expulsions and splits” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0170840611433993">Douglas &amp; Wildavsky, 1982</xref>, p. 121). Although it is often accused by others of amplifying dangers, the egalitarian culture is viewed by Douglas as being well adapted to pick up and relay warnings of low-probability but high-consequence disasters.</p>

<sec id="section8-0170840611433993">
<title>The fatalist bias</title>
<p>Finally, in a fatalistic social setting, “actors suppose that man is fickle and untrustworthy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0170840611433993">Verweij et al., 2006</xref>, p. 5). Fairness is not to be found in this life, and there is little scope for effecting change for the better. In a fatalist culture individuals are surrounded with a web of rules which establish a sense of social order and prevent the community from being exceedingly divided and fragmented. Individuals are therefore restricted in terms of the social roles they are allowed to undertake. Further, group boundary is weak as individuals are not significantly committed to the entities they encounter in the course of their daily lives.</p>
<p>The fatalistic world, unlike the three others, is thus one in which learning and risk management are almost impossible. Briefly stated, fatalism conveys skepticism about knowledge and about effective action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0170840611433993">Douglas, 1992a</xref>, p. 267). Since there is little that can be done about anything, there is little that can be blamed on anyone. “Why bother?” is the typical response. As a result, the fatalist bias does not motivate people to participate loudly and consistently in public debates. However, Douglas maintains that like the egalitarian criticism, fatalism, through withdrawal, constitutes a way of resisting the influence exerted through hierarchic or individualistic logics.</p>

<title>Locating and discussing Douglas’s theory</title>
<p>Mary Douglas’s followers have predominately come from the field of public policy studies, seeking to better understand how individuals and groups interpret and address contemporary sociopolitical issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0170840611433993">Ellis &amp; Thompson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0170840611433993">Thompson et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0170840611433993">Verweij &amp; Thompson, 2006</xref>), such as climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0170840611433993">Verweij et al., 2006</xref>), legislation on safety belts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0170840611433993">Adams, 2006</xref>), or the politics of social housing in Denmark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0170840611433993">Jensen, 1999</xref>). This dense and varied production contrasts with the rather modest use of Douglas’s work in the organizational analysis literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0170840611433993">Gephart et al., 2009</xref>). One of the first notable contributions is that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0170840611433993">Altman and Baruch (1998)</xref>, who rely on two case studies in Israeli organizations to introduce, at a very general level, the basis of grid/group analysis by stressing its explanatory power and originality in comparison to other analytical models, such as those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0170840611433993">Miles and Snow (1978)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0170840611433993">Hofstede (1991)</xref>. This work is followed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0170840611433993">Lane and Quack (1999)</xref> as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0170840611433993">Hendry (1999)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0170840611433993">Lane and Quack (1999)</xref> employ Douglas’s cultural theory to investigate differences in terms of risk management in German versus British banks. They argue that hierarchy and individualism, each shaping attitudes towards risk in distinct ways, are respectively emphasized in German and British risk management templates. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0170840611433993">Hendry (1999)</xref> relies on cultural theory to analyze changes in social structures in the 1980s–90s, in the US/UK business and management arenas. Fundamental to Hendry’s study is the relationship between hierarchy and individualism. He discusses how, particularly in the US, business organizations were then increasingly permeated with an individualistic culture, although the hierarchical culture was exerting a degree of influence.</p>
<p>Arguably, Douglas’s major theoretical contribution is to reorganize the potentially infinite diversity of ways of thinking and doing into a few specific cultural types. In the words of political scientist Harry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0170840611433993">Eckstein (1997</xref>, p. 31), the four cultural biases encapsulate “a great many meanings into a limited set of supermeanings”. However, at the organizational level, the deployment of such broad categories requires some clarification in terms of two key issues, namely, organizational change and cultural pluralism:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Before Douglas’ theory can be applied to the problems of contemporary societies and organizations, two questions arise: Given the self-reinforcing quality of the cultural types, how does the theory account for and accommodate structural change? What happens when different collectivities characterized by different cultural types come into contact and overlap in their memberships? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0170840611433993">Hendry, 1999</xref>, p. 563)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this context, the following point developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0170840611433993">Douglas (1997</xref>, p. 128) takes on special significance:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>A cultural bias is a point of view, with its own framing assumptions and readily available solutions for standardized problems. Scattered persons not in any group at all may share a similar cultural bias.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In other words, cultural groups or factions rarely exist in pure form. In practice, especially in contemporary society, most of people’s lives cannot be neatly partitioned. Membership to multiple collectivities is the norm and it is very common for these to be of different cultural types. The same individual may well live within a predominantly hierarchical society, work within a competitive marketplace and worship as a member of an egalitarian protestant church (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0170840611433993">Thompson et al., 1990</xref>). Thus, Douglas’s cultural theory assumes that, in the field, the four biases of perceiving and organizing interact at each conceivable level of social organization and can account for an endlessly changing and complex social environment. Interaction occurs especially through conversation between individuals, and also through the mind of single actors internally debating how to conduct themselves and make decisions in their daily undertakings.</p>
<p>Since individuals tend to argue from different premises anchored in distinct forms of biases, cultural theory implies logics of contention. However, contention can be “all to the good” as “each way of organizing and perceiving distils certain elements of experience and wisdom that are missed by the others” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0170840611433993">Verweij et al., 2006</xref>, p. 6). For instance, an individualistic environment can benefit from egalitarian concerns against inequalities, and from the regulatory capacities of hierarchy to enforce property rights and contracts.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0170840611433993">Douglas and Wildavsky (1982)</xref> also conceptualize the relationship between the different cultural biases through the duality of center and border. They note that Western social thought and organization theory are usually focused on the rivalry opposing hierarchy to individualism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0170840611433993">Adler, 2001</xref>). Yet in spite of pursuing different ends, hierarchy and individualism share a number of social appreciations— especially an aversion to threats of radical change to the fabric of society. The future is seen as an extension of the present; as a result the two cultures are not significantly sensitive to long-term, low-probability risks. In the words of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0170840611433993">Douglas and Wildavsky (1982</xref>, p. 181), “Market and hierarchy make a formidably stable combination.” While individualism brings innovativeness and entrepreneurship to the center, hierarchy contributes stability. In contrast, the egalitarian ethos aims to criticize the injustices engendered by the dominance of the center, having a vested interest in bad news of impurity and pollution. A different future is expected if the center continues to reign, and this future is expected to be bad. As a result, the egalitarian ethos expects discontinuity between present and future, and its social role can be viewed as that of the “border”:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The center sees the future as continuous with the present. It has numberless ways of discounting information to the contrary. It expects disturbances and setbacks in the normal course, but it also expects to weather them. In the long run it is optimistic. The border foretells imminent disaster. It does not believe in the long run, and in the short run it is pessimistic. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0170840611433993">Douglas &amp; Wildavsky, 1982</xref>, pp. 122–3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Expecting discontinuity, the border nonetheless is paradoxically optimistic about the perfectibility of humanity, professing faith in human goodness as the basis for a better society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0170840611433993">Douglas &amp; Wildavsky, 1982</xref>). The border’s favorite mechanism to promote its critical agenda is the small group, seen as being conducive to equal participation in governance. The small group structure is also iconic, given the philosophy’s opposition to the encompassing institutions of the center.</p>
<p>Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0170840611433993">Douglas and Wildavsky (1982)</xref> maintain that while the border constitutes a form of permanent opposition to the center, it has no intention of governing, and is not really interested in exercising power. The border is not stable enough to maintain a center. Ironically, the border’s viability depends on the center’s capability; the border needs a stable opposing center against which it can define itself.</p>
<p>In sum, beginning with the premise that cultural biases exert influence on people’s views regarding what to prefer and what to abhor, cultural theory upholds that individuals’ preferences do not arise mysteriously from within the individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0170840611433993">Wildavsky, 1987</xref>). Drawing on Douglas’s cultural theory, we propose that a pertinent way to develop a better understanding of CCs is to analyze how CC members perceive and construct executive compensation and their committee’s work, in the light of values and preferences derived from cultural biases. Our research also contributes to the importation of Douglas’s work into the organizational analysis literature—not only at the methodological level, through reliance on individual interviews to study the influence of cultural biases in organizations, but also at the theoretical level, through an analysis of the intertwining between cultural change and the promotion of diversity.</p>
<p>Importantly, cultural biases are integral to social organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0170840611433993">Douglas &amp; Wildavsky, 1982</xref>). When we say, therefore, that some CC members are biased toward stressing executive compensation policies from a specific cultural scheme, we are not saying that there is a totally pure and overarching unbiased line of reasoning, but rather that all stakeholders involved in the construction and sense-making around executive compensation policies—whether CC members, CEOs, consultants, policy-makers, shareholders, journalists, etc.—are inevitably culturally biased and that each bias, as a point of view, needs to be acknowledged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0170840611433993">Douglas, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>In terms of the knowledge development process, our research can be understood as belonging to the theory illustration category, in that we seek “to establish the plausibility of a specific theoretical perspective by demonstrating its capacity to illuminate some previously unappreciated aspect” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0170840611433993">Keating, 1995</xref>, p. 69) of CC members’ ways of thinking and doing—particularly in providing insight into members’ production of moral and rational comfort. As emphasized in the discussion and conclusion, illumination includes the development of reflective views on the very important notions of change and regulation.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>To carry out the investigation we rely on in-depth, semi-structured interviews, which are recognized as a valuable way to obtain information on processes taking place in naturalistic settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0170840611433993">Patton, 2002</xref>). While observation of CC meetings would have constituted a relevant data-collection mechanism, field observation is challenging to achieve since boards of directors tend to be reluctant to let outsiders observe their processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0170840611433993">Leblanc &amp; Gillies, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0170840611433993">Spira, 2002</xref>). We approached data collection with two basic preoccupations in mind: to investigate the nature of the work carried out by CC members as well as the thoughts and logics they mobilize in their endeavors on committees. Consistent with flexibility and open-mindedness as key principles of qualitative research, we realized subsequently to data collection the appropriateness of relying on cultural theory as an interpretive lens.</p>
<p>Through Douglas’s cultural theory we examine how cultural biases are mobilized by interviewees when making sense of their committee’s practices, debates and decisions. In so doing, we assume that the biases at a group level are equally found at the individual level. Cultural theory’s typology is applicable at all levels of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0170840611433993">Verweij et al., 2006</xref>) and it can be useful for characterizing group culture as well as individual orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0170840611433993">Eckstein, 1997</xref>). Conducting individual interviews is thus an appropriate data collection mechanism to identify cultural biases which influence CC members’ individual subjectivity and, as a logical consequence, the CC as a group. In sum, our unit of analysis is constituted by discourses and thoughts, as captured through individual interviews, which can influence talk, debate and decision-making in the context of actual processes surrounding CCs.</p>
<p>Our study is based on a “pragmatic epistemology” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0170840611433993">Calori, 2000</xref>, p. 1033), seeing research as the confluent of two types of knowledge. On the one hand, practitioner experience provides immediate “knowledge of acquaintance” while on the other hand, “knowledge about”, which results from the examination of practitioner narratives from a broader conceptual angle, relates the field of practice to the field of theory (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0170840611433993">Golden-Biddle &amp; Locke, 2007</xref>). As observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0170840611433993">Calori (2000</xref>, p. 1033): “The distinction between the ‘knowledge of acquaintance’ possessed by practitioners and the ‘knowledge about’, mainly possessed by professional researchers, shows the complementarity and the necessary co-authorship of managers and researchers in building management theories.”</p>
<p>From a pragmatic perspective, some narratives have more value than others. First, as reflective beings, seasoned practitioners build over time sophisticated interpretive schemes, predicated on life experiences having been lived through and thought over (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0170840611433993">Schön, 1983</xref>). Second, “the expert should be sincere in his/her subjective account. The dissimulation or the distortion of facts and thoughts may happen when the personal interest of the respondent is involved. … When the anonymity of the expert is preserved, the risk of dissimulation or distortion can be reduced” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0170840611433993">Calori, 2000</xref>, p. 1035). The point is that individuals in position of power, such as board members, can be viewed as not being tightly constrained in interviews to the realm of espoused theories (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0170840611433993">Tri-Council, 2010</xref>). Of course, in any case, the narratives of sincere experts do not necessarily provide information on theories-in-use. “They are subjective accounts of experiences constructed after action (‘espoused theories’ according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0170840611433993">Argyris, 1982</xref>). In other words, and obviously, theory building based on such accounts is phenomenological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0170840611433993">Schütz, 1971</xref>)” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0170840611433993">Calori, 2000</xref>, p. 1035). This is why we conservatively specify that our study provides insight into the cultural biases mobilized by CC members when making sense of their work, recognizing however that interviews can provide a bridge from the bank of espoused theories to that of theories-in-use.</p>
<p>Twenty-eight individuals were contacted to take part in this research; three of them never returned our soliciting phone calls or e-mails and one individual explicitly refused to participate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0170840611433993">2</xref></sup> It is our understanding that most individuals were pleased with the opportunity to discuss, in an anonymous setting, what they viewed as an important topic.</p>
<p>Interviews on the role of CCs were conducted in Canada in 2008 with 24 participants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0170840611433993">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0170840611433993">3</xref></sup> All interviews were led by either one or two of the authors. Further, all interviews were face-to-face, apart from one interview carried out by telephone for convenience. The interviews were with: 17 individuals who, at the time of their interview, were members of at least one public company CC; two compensation consultants; one individual highly experienced as corporate director (but not member of a public company CC at the time of the interview); one shareholder activist; one former public company vice-president (human resources); one vice-president of an important pension fund; and one senior manager of a director association. Two interviewees were persons of our acquaintance while the others were identified either through publicly available information or suggestions provided by several key contacts. While this may seem like a small set of participants, multiple directorship and significant boardroom experience are common among this population. This small group of individuals, holding a large number of boardroom appointments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0170840611433993">Table 1</xref>), can be conceived of as what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0170840611433993">Pettigrew (1992</xref>, p. 178) refers to as “network stars” in his study of managerial elites.</p>

<p>Semi-structured interviews were carried out to allow interviewees to express themselves according to their own interpretive schemes. Among the most critical issues discussed with participants was the relationship between executive compensation and performance. We also enquired about the following: background information on professional career and board involvement; compensation committee processes; viewpoint regarding the notion of fair compensation; capacities of CEOs; views regarding the recent collapse of financial institutions; and opinions about regulation of compensation, particularly with regard to disclosure. As most interviewees had extensive experience with compensation, we also incorporated into our discussions elements of change in their attitudes, practices and beliefs over time. For the vast majority of the interviews we let participants discuss these themes extensively, asking questions from time to time that were consistent with the flow of their thoughts. Before the end of each interview, we made sure that all of the main elements included in our listing of predetermined themes had been covered. Interviews lasted, on average, 75 minutes. All interviews were tape recorded and transcribed. Importantly, interviewees did not constrain their thoughts to the range of generalities; on the contrary they often provided anecdotes and specific events in order to strengthen and illustrate their viewpoints.</p>
<p>Measures to ensure the trustworthiness of our research were incorporated from the outset in the interviews. In particular, we asked interviewees for permission to record the interview, while emphasizing that complete anonymity would be provided to them and the organizations they serve. Also, participants were told that they would have the opportunity to subsequently verify the accuracy of their transcript and add changes that they felt were needed to make them comfortable with what they said during the interview.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0170840611433993">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The interview transcripts were analyzed using qualitative procedures, involving data reduction (coding), data reorganization, and elaboration strategies such as comparisons across transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0170840611433993">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>). In particular, we used a coding scheme developed while reading the transcripts to enhance data sensitivity. The scheme comprised a number of main themes and sub-themes. After coding, a conceptual matrix was prepared to group together all individual sentences, dispersed across the interview transcripts, along every theme and sub-theme. We subsequently re-examined our interview material and conceptual matrix in light of the categories of cultural theory.</p>
<p>Before going further, it is worth stressing that cultural theory should not be understood as deterministic:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>No one is forced by cultural pressures to choose one way or another. [Cultural theory] does not even assume that people know what they want, but it does assume what they do not like, and that they are realistic about their opportunities. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0170840611433993">Douglas, 1996</xref>, p. 45)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Translating Douglas’s words regarding determinism, cultural theory assumes that humans are surrounded by cultural webs which can influence their mindset and behavior—but their influence is necessarily constrained and modulated by their reflective abilities and their room to manoeuver in social spaces. Accordingly, cultural theory can be applied as a means to increase people’s awareness of the socially constructed nature of their daily lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0170840611433993">Douglas &amp; Wildavsky, 1982</xref>). Markets, organizations and hierarchies are not value free; instead they fundamentally reflect and promote certain cultural beliefs, values and preferences.</p>

<title>Compensation Committees from a Cultural Theory Perspective</title>
<p>In accordance with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0170840611433993">Douglas and Wildavsky’s (1982)</xref> notion of center, the individualistic and hierarchic cultural types are pivotal in the accounts of CC processes produced through our interviews. From an individualistic viewpoint, free markets play a key role in determining executive compensation. The compensation market is seen as natural, providing conditions of possibility that serve to establish fair compensation through the creation and enforcement of contracts. From a hierarchic perspective, comfort in establishing compensation ensues from the rigorous application of evaluative protocols comprising a mix of objectives, performance measures, and remuneration components. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0170840611433993">Table 2</xref> indicates the number of individual sentences found in the interviews (CC members as well as Other 5 and Other 20) along every bias, categorized in accordance with the main analytical themes which emerged from our qualitative analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0170840611433993">5</xref></sup> While the empirical section is not specifically organized along these themes, they nonetheless underlie the discussion. The most frequently coded themes relate to ways of rationalizing high remuneration in favor of top executives (155), competencies of CC members (121), processes followed in setting remuneration (110), and attitudes on the regulation of executive compensation (86). Whereas one should be cautious in interpreting this type of data (which does not take into account how interviewees give weight to their sentences), the latter is nonetheless consistent with the initial intuition that followed our initial reading of the transcripts, in that the individualistic and hierarchic biases largely predominate with 433 and 258 sentences respectively.</p>

<p>The interview excerpts that we incorporated below are drawn from the conceptual matrix which we used to develop <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0170840611433993">Table 2</xref>. Yet in accordance with the flexibility principle underlying qualitative research, we present our findings without being overly methodical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0170840611433993">Gendron, 2009</xref>)—the objective being to craft a meaningful and interesting theorized storyline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0170840611433993">Golden-Biddle &amp; Locke, 2007</xref>) reflective of the main patterns found in the data.</p>
<sec id="section12-0170840611433993">
<title>The individualistic bias: normalizing the atypical</title>
<p>We begin our empirical journey by examining how the individualistic bias affects CC members’ line of reasoning. Recall that the setting for this individualistic story is a world in which humans are inherently self-seeking and atomistic—but simultaneously creative and innovative. Innovativeness should not be constrained; markets will be able to identify innovations which benefit society, and how to fairly compensate its promoters. Consistent with this characterization, several interviewees maintain that market pressures translate into fair remuneration conditions. In the following quote, one CC member argues that market-based remuneration provides a sense of social justice:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Obviously executive compensation is high. Stockholders are the first to recognize this. However, compensation committee members want to ensure that compensation is fair towards the individual who performs well. To ensure fairness, we need to take into account how other companies in the industry pay their CEO. We want our CEO to have the same remuneration, perhaps even a little higher if we are very satisfied of his performance. So this is how I interpret fairness. Otherwise it would be quite easy to conclude: “It does not make any sense! Two million a year! It’s too high. This guy is not worth it!” (CC 4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This sense of fairness is basic to low-grid competitive pressures because it extends the individual scope for negotiating. Further, a free contracting environment implies a form of egalitarian distributive justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0170840611433993">Douglas, 1978</xref>), concerned with distributing benefits in proportion to the individual’s contribution. Those who make a greater productive contribution to their group deserve to receive more benefits. Those who put in the most get the most out. Politically, the individualistic bias is also visible through the strong opposition of some interviewees to governmental interference in the regulation of compensation policies. For instance:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Governance in and of itself doesn’t make a company successful. Talented CEOs and boards of directors make companies successful. And so I think we’ve gone overboard, and I think we’re going to go overboard again with all this new regulatory talk. Today I was at a luncheon with a prominent democrat and he talked about the new buzz about more regulation. He said, everybody’s focused on regulation. And you’d think he’d be really in favor of it, being a democrat, but he’s not. Because he fears it will be overkill again. SOX [i.e., Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002] didn’t prevent the financial challenges that we have now, did it? (CC 24)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This opposition is not just symptomatic of a basic conflict of political preferences, but reflects a deeper sense of historicity in which tradition is continually questioned. In contrast to hierarchic cultural regimes which often rely on historical narratives to justify present actions, individualistic regimes submit all claims of historicity to a competitive screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0170840611433993">Douglas, 1978</xref>). Because market conditions are always changing, the past is not a valuable referent to evaluate the present, and comparisons in remuneration levels over time are inappropriate:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>What we went through in the financial markets from 1990 until 2000 is just the magic of Disney World. From 1896, it took the Dow Jones 72 years to reach 1,000 points—right before the oil crisis of 1973. It then took 20 years for the Dow Jones to reach 2,000 points, in 1990. This was followed, again, by a crisis. And then, all of a sudden, in 1992, it was just taking several months for the Dow Jones to increase by 1,000 points. Before this frantic movement, stock prices were increasing by 8% or 10% a year. It was taking ten years for stocks’ value to double. This was the environment which historically characterized stock option remuneration. But when companies were giving stock options in the 1990s, the stocks’ value was sometimes tripling in the same year! Lay people then came to interpret the magnitude of option compensation very negatively. The reality is, however, that the magnitude of option compensation is just the result of market trends in stock prices. (CC 3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Markets are therefore seen as ahistorical. In line with this conception of time, rule-based regulation is seen as paralyzing the vitality of market mechanisms and restraining the scope of individual negotiations. Accordingly, several interviewees maintain that the regulation of compensation can only be provisional because the markets’ future is constantly full of uncertainty. The following quote, where a form of self-regulation is advocated, illustrates this point:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The problem regarding government-based security regulation is lack of adaptability. … But fundamentally speaking, I’m much more positive on the role of organizations which measure companies’ commitment towards corporate governance. The fact is that we all want to perform well in these rankings. Improvement pressure is therefore much more likely to ensue from rankings than from rules dictated by government. Indeed it typically just takes three or four years for people to find ways to bypass government rules. The power to ensure that things are dealt with appropriately resides in the market, through the involvement of its managers and institutional investors. (CC 11)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Douglas’s cultural theory considers that the individualistic setting is characterized by a propensity towards change. However, this inclination does not make CC members susceptible to all “prophecies” announcing potential failures in remuneration policies and means to avoid them. In market regimes, prophets must rhetorically promote their claims like any other people or idea, competitively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0170840611433993">Douglas, 1992</xref>a); and as also expressed in the former quote, claims which naturalize the incentives of profit maximization seem to constitute more persuasive prophecies than those which aim to bring order through government intervention.</p>
<p>The individualistic bias also provides a “villain” to blame in case of failure. In this respect, CC members were asked not only to make sense of the recent accumulation of highly visible scandals regarding executive compensation, but also to comment on the increasing discrepancy between executive compensation and the average worker’s pay. A first common pattern emerging from several interviews is that failures are attributed to individuals, with the fault primarily residing in atypical “bad apple” executives and CCs:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The main benefit of stock options is “pay as you go”. When stockholders make money they are able to give money to the executives; when they don’t make money they don’t have to give money to the executives. Some atypical cases have been blown out of proportion because people think that these atypical cases constitute the norm. However, I know many CEOs who do not make lots of money through stock options. As a matter of fact, the number of CEOs who do not benefit significantly from stock options is much higher than the number of CEOs who benefit significantly from options. (CC 1)</p>
<p>In 2002 a number of business scandals emerged simultaneously. People then got the impression that all executives were dishonest. I then decided to calculate some proportions to put the scandals in perspective. In North America, 28,000 companies were then listed companies. I added up the number of scandals; the total was 16. I don’t know if you remember the 2004 summer Olympics that took place in Athens—people got the impression from the media that all athletes were taking steroids. Was this true? In all, during these games they tested 3,500 athletes out of 6,000. Twenty-two cases were found to be positive. The same rationale applies to business. Most people in business are actually honest—but this is not what we see in the media, which enjoys making scandalous reports. (CC 3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While in the first quote experiential claims are mobilized to contextualize the frequency of excessive compensation cases, in the second quote the interviewee’s argument is predicated on quantification and analogical reasoning. Specific figures are invoked, thereby conveying a sense of accuracy and factuality. Significant consequences ensue from the tendency to apportion blame in an individualistic fashion, with a few “bad apples” having infected an otherwise robust system. As collective sense-making is centered on atypicalities, the programmatic and normative aspects of CEO remuneration remain unquestioned. Further, while a number of CC members recognize that market mechanisms exert inflationist pressures on executives’ compensation packages, the blame is not allocated on the market itself. Instead, the interviewees deplore the excessive development of regulation, forcing companies to publicly disclose executive compensation, thereby creating an incontrollable spiral of social isomorphism:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The requirement to disclose public companies’ executive wages has had a pernicious effect. … Why should my compensation be lower than this other CEO given that I’m as good as him? Since our company is the biggest in the industry does our CEO deserve more compensation than the other CEOs? … You know, if you own a hockey team, you want to have good scorers. But to have good scorers you need to pay for good scorers, whose value is determined by the market. If you’re not willing to pay good scorers on the basis of their market value, then none of them will accept to play in your team! Thus, a kind of incontrollable pattern has resulted in significant pay increases in the last few years. (CC 1)</p>
<p>I said at the time that disclosure would drive up compensation. And that’s exactly what it did. And all the advisors and all the companies knew what X got and everybody knew what Y got and there was a huge push to equalize compensation and that meant meeting the higher ones. The very people who wanted all this disclosure are now complaining about what they regard as excessive compensation. … But as I said from the beginning, disclosing it is just going to ratchet it up. (CC 24)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another common individualistic pattern implies the denial of failure. From this perspective, compensation issues are seen through the vocabulary of demand and supply, thereby reinforcing the imagery of the invisible hand of economics in determining wages and contracts. Through this imagery, claims of excessive remuneration are denied; remuneration is not and cannot be excessive when CC members obey market laws. Blaming is unwarranted since failure is refuted. Accordingly, a variety of justificatory schemes are mobilized by CC members to rationalize high-remuneration cases. For instance, interviewees express the view that inflationist pressures on executive compensation ensue from a rarity of supply—that is to say a scarcity of talents. Therefore, in a context of free market negotiations between executives and CCs, the balance of power tends to be perceived as structurally unfavorable to the latter—hence the inevitability of paying higher wages:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>You know, the wage increase trend is a quite complex matter. Inflation plays a role in the process, as well as the shortage of candidates. In each industry and company, people on compensation committees would like to favor new CEOs being chosen from within the ranks of the company. However, in a number of cases good candidates cannot be found within the company. So when you look outside the company’s boundaries, you rapidly find out that there are not hundreds of good candidates available. (CC 4)</p>
<p>Is it difficult to find a CEO who can actually provide huge value added to my business? It’s very difficult. … In 1993 we fired the CEO [of Corporation Z] and we brought in [Name of new CEO]. [Corporation Z] was a second rate company in Canadian life insurance. Now it’s number two in the world. [First name of new CEO] has done this in a 15-year run. Finding a guy like that is next to impossible. To find a Michael Eisner [former CEO of Walt Disney Company] is next to impossible. (CC 25)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As implicitly recognized in these quotes, the perception of a supply shortage is reinforced by the adhesion of interviewees to a glorification of talented executives, virtually magnified as heroes upon which rests much of the companies’ success, and who must be paid in consequence. This representation of executives is also symptomatic of an individualistic bias, where substantive signs of collective realizations are fragmented to the point where the only recognized achievement is individual; collective referents in explaining organizational performance are overshadowed. Along this bias there are no moral limits or social constraints for rewards, as long as the individual at the top delivers on their promises:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>There are some really talented CEOs, you know. If you had the main stockholders of [Corporation X] in front of you, they would tell you: “We don’t know any other individual who could have done better for the company than [Name of CEO of Corporation X]. True, he received $500 million in stocks—but the company’s performance over the last 15 years is astounding. Over this time period stockholders benefited every year from a 22% rate of return! No other CEO could have done better. This guy is definitively irreplaceable.” Our company is certainly smaller than [Corporation X], but in terms of performance our current CEO is excellent and it would definitively not be easy to replace him with someone as qualified. (CC 7)</p>
<p>When it’s time to recruit a new CEO no board member on earth is going to say: “Hey, we should select an average individual.” It’s just natural to search for the best individual because companies fundamentally need someone with top capabilities. So when we identify an individual with top capabilities, the remuneration package which is offered to the individual needs to reflect his top capabilities. … When [Corporation Z] buys [Corporation Y], they cannot pay [Name of CEO of Corporation Z] less than [Corporation Y]’s CEO. And [Corporation Z] is a global organization; in order to lead this organization we need the best, one of the best in the world. (CC 11)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Competencies in managing a public corporation are therefore seen as undeniably tied to organizational performance; in so doing, it makes sense to pay a high price in “purchasing” these valued competencies. The latter quotes also indicate the kind of tautological reasoning at work within CC members inclined to individualistic views. As they firmly believe in the market’s capacity to determine the remuneration of the best executives, they cannot allocate compensation that is under the market, unless they admit to recruiting executives who underperform. This line of thought, palpable in several of our interviewees, echoes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0170840611433993">Ezzamel and Watson’s (1997)</xref> “bidding-up” hypothesis, whereby executives who are underpaid relative to the market have their pay raised, but those who are overpaid receive no parallel downward adjustment.</p>
<p>As highlighted above, the dismantling of collective classifications in the name of individual competitiveness is a fundamental and constant justifying point of reference for the individualistic culture. Individuals’ abilities are glorified and markets should not be constrained in providing stockholders with much-sought-after talents, abilities and ideas. Yet paradoxically, this low-grid ethics of individual equality is very often confronted with high inequalities engendered by the competitive environment. The individualistic bias professes equality, but engenders inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0170840611433993">Douglas, 1978</xref>). Based on her anthropological observations, Douglas maintains that low-grid dynamics, despite their claim of adherence to an ethic of equality, never recognize that their own processes of screening out and competitive selection deeply contradict their initial calls for egalitarian individualism. Instead, proponents of low-grid values develop theories to account for the contradiction without demolishing the central ideological edifice at stake:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Rather than dismantle the institutions which protect and promote the competition between individuals, a typical low grid solution to the moral dilemma is to subscribe to a theory of unequally distributed native ability: “Too bad we can’t all be clever…” “You can’t make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear.” And so the pressures to exclude are justified. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0170840611433993">Douglas, 1978</xref>, pp. 35–36)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>During the interviews, we explored CC members’ thoughts regarding the large and increasing disparities between compensation of top executives and that of the average workers. Several interviewees develop arguments consistent with the theory of unequally distributed native ability. In the following excerpt, the interviewee views compensation differences between executives and non-executives as two distinctive worlds which cannot be compared:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Various reports specify that 50 years ago the average CEO salary represented 40 to 50 times the average worker’s salary and that now it’s got…</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewee:</speaker>
<p>You know what? There’s no relationship, in my opinion, between what the CEO does and what the average worker does. This is especially so in terms of responsibility. So while I know that the average worker does his or her job it is not the CEO’s job. And I am not sure about internal equity. I am in favor of merit and accountability. Socialism is not the answer. The CEO has responsibilities that the mailroom person never even thought about. … I think individual merit is important. Some people claim that there should be built into any compensation scheme some subjective benchmarks. As a result of such a scheme, some people have done better than others and those who haven’t done as well get brought along by those who have done well. And I think that’s wrong. I’m not a socialist and therefore I don’t believe in this kind of sort of sharing the wealth. (CC 24)</p>
</speech>
<p>Interestingly, what may appear as inconsistency or injustice to other cultural regimes is rationalized by the individualistic culture as morally acceptable considering the jobs are as different as their pay. Markets ensure that people are paid in accordance to their worth and abilities, thereby providing a convenient means to dismiss “inappropriate” comparisons.</p>
<p>Overall, our analysis suggests that the hard core of the individualistic culture is protected from radical doubt with regard to executive compensation by several normalizing strategies which allow stratospheric compensation schemes to be maintained on what is perceived as a moral and rational basis. Inequalities in labor wages are attributed to the individuals’ varying degrees of competencies, while allegations of excessive compensation are rationalized through invocations of the laws of the market. At the end of the day, the individualistic claim that humans are equal citizens is not diminished by the factuality of social inequalities—given that humans are viewed as not being equally endowed with personal qualifications for success.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0170840611433993">
<title>The hierarchic bias: protocolizing compensation</title>
<p>Our analysis identifies the hierarchic bias as another cultural type significantly influencing sense-making and preferences with respect to executive compensation. When an individual’s social environment is characterized by strong group boundaries and binding prescriptions, the resulting social relations are hierarchical. Individuals in this social context are subject to the control of other members in the group, and the demands of socially imposed roles, rules and protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0170840611433993">Thompson et al., 1990</xref>). Along this bias, boards, and CCs in particular, do not “rubber stamp” the laws of the market or CEOs’ requests; instead CCs assiduously submit compensation claims and requests to the gaze of standard protocols of evaluation. Fairness is assumed to result from compensation being determined and sanctioned by standard operating and control procedures.</p>
<p>As the following quotes indicate, boards and CCs are perceived as powerful instruments of control in the hierarchical chain of corporate command:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think the whole issue of governance has improved. I don’t think there’s any doubt about it. We all have our doubts about Enron and the legislation that followed, which was heavy-handed and bureaucratic, and to some extent, wasteful and so on. But it put a certain fear into directors and gave them a certain amount of courage. I don’t think there’s any doubt that the pendulum has swung. That’s not a universal truth—but I think on balance that boards are much more willing to recognize their job, which is to govern, to oversee, and to direct the management. (CC 22)</p>
<p>I am absolutely against say-on-pay because the question of management performance evaluation belongs to the board. If shareholders think the board is not doing its job, they should change the board. How can one, in the context of an annual general meeting, adequately assess the CEO’s performance or that of the management team in general? How can one evaluate the strategy, and how it was applied by the CEO? I think that it is the board’s responsibility and it should remain so. (Other 5)</p>

<p>The two excerpts signal from different angles a hierarchic conception of governance, predicated on trust and acceptance of authority ensuing from organizational and regulatory structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0170840611433993">Douglas, 1986</xref>). The first excerpt defends a positive view of post-Enron regulation which presumably translates into a reinforcement of the board’s authority. The second manifests hostility regarding shareholders’ interference in board decisions related to executive compensation: say-on-pay disrupts established evaluative mechanisms and authority structures. Altogether, these quotes convey the idea that compliance with rules and established organizational order translates into hierarchic authority being protected “from contamination by the levels below” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0170840611433993">Thompson et al., 1990</xref>, p. 9). The second excerpt also reveals a sense of fairness based on: (a) the hierarchic delegation of power: “If shareholders think the board is not doing its job, they should change the board”; and (b) the power of expertise: “How can one, in the context of an annual general meeting, adequately assess the CEO’s performance?” This association between order and knowledge is far from unexpected. As observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0170840611433993">Coyle (1997</xref>, p. 63), such cohabitation is symptomatic of hierarchic views:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When value agreement and factual certainty are high, the corresponding organizational form (and culture) is hierarchy. In these cases, group identity and role differentiation are strong, and these variables identify the upper right corner of the cultural model. It is knowledge that provides order; when knowledge is complete, the organization is like a fully analyzable machine, held together by standard operating procedure.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Accordingly, being hopeful about the power of human reasoning, one of the fundamental features of hierarchy consists of mobilizing expertise grounded in mechanization. The mechanization of expertise is reflected in our interviews in several ways. For instance, expertise implies adhesion to compensation rules predicated on quantifiable objectives and measurable criteria:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>At the beginning of the year, we set objectives. They relate to three components: profit; business growth; and general costs. And the weight of each component is also specified. So we set the objectives at the beginning of the year, and at year-end we say: “Here are the results.” It is mathematical. There is a remaining 15%. In [the case of our CEO] there remains a 15% of qualitative evaluation from the board. So what I do in January I send a little survey to each board member. I think there are eight questions or something like that and I say: “Give him a mark from 1 to 5.” After that, I add them up and we add this 15% to the mathematical calculation of the three other components. (CC 7)</p>
<p>In order to benefit from the long-term compensation plan, the individual needs to beat the industry average. The goal is to exceed by 4% the industry’s ROE [return on equity]. The minimum is 0% in order to get shares. To begin with, there is a three-year cycle, with a potential number of allocated shares. At the end of year three we measure the ROE and compare it to the industry according to a scale from 0 to 8%. If the individual gets 4, then it’s the number of shares determined at the beginning. If it’s 8, then we double. If it’s zero then no shares are allocated. I consider that such a scheme measures the organization’s relative performance. With a scheme like this, it’s clear that ROE will be the number one item upon which people concentrate their efforts. (CC 11)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Further, in the words of CC 2: “The easy part [of a compensation policy] is to apply the recipe. However, the recipe needs to be elaborated beforehand.” Importantly, most of the “recipes” detailed in our interviews rely on quantifiable benchmarking techniques:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>This business [i.e., CEO compensation] is one of the most measured businesses on a quantitative basis around so you can set up benchmarks which are calculated as what the average of everybody is doing and you can compare yourself to the benchmarks. And you can set targets which are some percentage equally or exceeding by some percentage and run the thing through on that basis. (CC 18)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As the following excerpt indicates, adhesion to the ideal of measurability and mechanization of compensation policy is not universal and contrasts with the smell test of the individualistic bias: “pragmatic in style of reasoning and casting suspicion on grand theories” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0170840611433993">Douglas, 1997</xref>, p. 130):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s a moving target, there is no basic formula. CEO compensation includes a high degree of value judgment. These are not rules defined on a piece of paper. For a small part, but ultimately not. You know the guy has been performing well for the past twenty years, or five years, and then suddenly he has a bad year: what do you do? Do you say: “I am going to destroy him”? Or do you tell yourself there is a good chance that he will perform exceptionally well in the next three to four years and therefore you forgive him? (CC 12)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The individualistic culture being receptive to compassion fed by anticipation of earnings is noteworthy and, as such, the excerpt illustrates the unpredictable paths and connections that cultures may develop in the field. Nonetheless, the key point we wish to stress is that, contrary to pragmatic and individualistic abilities in developing experiential and intuitive-based anticipations of opportunities, the hierarchic bias tends to promote dispassionate and depersonalized judgments shaped by reliance on standardized protocols and ways of doing. Along this line, the legitimacy granted to CC members does not depend on their stature or individual charisma, but rather on their control of the substantive knowledge required to appropriately execute the committee’s evaluative protocols. The latter are not formalized algorithms that can be operated through deskilled human involvement; instead their application necessitates nimbleness and experience:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Our methods, our systems have become more complicated, you know, with a mixture of salary, incentive bonus, stock options and restricted stock, looking at vesting periods that are longer. It’s become a more complicated task in the last couple of years than it would have been years before. (CC 17)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As a result of this complexity, CC members influenced by the hierarchic bias tend to promote a recruitment strategy within CCs in which strong individual leadership is toned down in favor of human resource expertise:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think it’s important that we have the same ground rules for compensation as for the audit committee. That is, everybody should be literate and there must be a test of—I don’t mean a written test, but a significant measure of literacy, and one should be expert. Now we don’t have that. In very few compensation committees is there anyone expert. And you know, the reason is, the kind of people that join boards are typically CEOs, former CEOs, former chairs retired whatever, but usually mainstream executives who did not develop that expertise. So I’m saying … that probably we should have more vice-presidents of human resources on boards. (CC 21)</p>
<p>One ought to be looking for something called human resource expertise and human resource literacy on the compensation committee. And in my experience there are very few compensation committees that can adequately hold themselves out to have sufficient degree of human resource expertise and human resource literacy to do their job. (CC 18)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Furthermore, expertise in executing emotionally detached evaluative protocols is often perceived as benefiting from the specialized knowledge of consultants:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[The decision to rely or not to rely on outside expertise] depends on how comfortable the board is with its own expertise. How comfortable the board is with the status quo in terms of the process and the system, or the method of compensation. But if you want to change anything from the existing mix or the existing parameters, or you think you’re out of line in terms of competitive practice, then you might want to bring in [Name of consulting firm]. (CC 21)</p>
<p>Now you could argue that the human resources or the vice-president of human resources ought to have that, too—but I think a consultant sees—in any field of consulting, I guess—sees a very wide range of practices, and has a broader scope of knowledge. (CC 21)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, the use of consultants is not exclusive to hierarchy. As argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0170840611433993">Abrahamson (1996)</xref>, business people are generally receptive to techniques that are framed as being at the forefront of management processes. This is likely to be the case under an individualistic environment where the advantage goes to the innovating individuals who can spring a surprise on competitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0170840611433993">Douglas, 1978</xref>). As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0170840611433993">March and Olsen (1989)</xref>, in such settings, actors through a “logic of appropriateness” may tend to adopt fashionable best practices in response to perceived uncertainty. Indeed, in some of our interviews, remuneration consultants appear to exert a significant influence over CCs in the exposure and appropriation of the latest compensation policy techniques. For example, in the following quote, the interviewee claims that the company’s CC benefits from consultants’ input in complying with the latest set of best practices:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Well, we’re saying [to the consultant] we need the benefit of your wisdom on this and we need to tap into your creativity because you see a whole lot more plans and schemes and things than we would see and we want you to be able to bring to us the best practices that you see around. Our consultant does most of the really major companies in Canada. I want them to say this is your vanilla formula but if you were to tweak this and tweak that and look at it from this point of view, it would better meet your objectives. (CC 24)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Nonetheless, consultants are often hierarchically mobilized—for example, because of their substantive expertise in helping apply complex evaluative protocols:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s become a complex field and there are a lot of tax implications and there are a lot of variables in terms of subsets of options or stock grants and deferred this and deferred that. And the expertise that these folks have developed is pretty significant. (CC 15)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Hierarchy is also characterized by peculiarities regarding the process of allocating failure and blame:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Hierarchists cannot blame the collective. “System blame”, blaming the relationship between the parts and the whole on which they pride themselves, would amount to self-destruction. Instead, hierarchies are famous for their blame-shedding techniques. … Blame is shifted to deviants who do not know their place. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0170840611433993">Thompson et al., 1990</xref>, p. 59)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Taken into the context of executive compensation, blame in case of failure is allocated to deviant CC members who destabilize the foundations of the hierarchical vision, namely, the authority of the CC and the reliability of its expertise. Accordingly, in the following excerpts, blame is allocated to CCs that are deficient in observing their protocols and authoritative powers with regard to management:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We expect a lot and in a number of cases CEOs don’t work very hard. And I’m still shocked by that and how much money they make. It’s scary, it’s really scary but a lot of them don’t have a whole lot of accountability. They’ve got board members who sit back and go to a meeting and a dinner once a quarter, and are happy that you’re not losing money—so what incentive do they have to do better? (CC 8)</p>
<p>If poor results lead to excessive compensation, it’s because somewhere there is a formula that was deficient in its conception. It’s probably because the compensation committee didn’t read the future correctly, made bad forecasts or basically created a formula thinking everything would turn out right you know. (CC 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These two quotes also implicitly reflect a distinctive feature of the hierarchic culture, concerned with ensuring that exuberant behavior never goes too far, that the ball remains within the zone of equilibrium and is formalized “in analytic operational formulae” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0170840611433993">Douglas, 1997</xref>, p. 130). Unbridled experimentation is therefore negatively perceived. Instead, hierarchic comfort is constructed through the quest for average. The inclination is towards the production of certainty and predictability as generated through formulas being comparatively applied; that which breaks from norms of reasonableness is negatively perceived:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In a world where there is excess on both sides, some people are literally being exploited, we don’t talk about them, but they exist. To find a formula which appears reasonable in all of this is the challenge we face, to find a happy medium. (CC 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0170840611433993">Thompson et al. (1990</xref>, p. 61): “controlling envy is of paramount importance in hierarchy because its way of life institutionalizes and justifies inequality. Ostentation is reserved for the collectivity.” One of the key dangers for the hierarchic organization is the loss of internal cohesion, not least through claims of excessive inequalities in compensation across hierarchical ranks. The more important the remuneration gap between hierarchical echelons, the higher the risk of individual strategies to promote individual gains—thus threatening internal cohesion and respect of collective order. Inequalities within the hierarchic organization need to be reined in, given that to endure over time, the organization needs to constrain internal rivalries: “its success depends on not allowing one member’s personal glory to be distinguished from the collective honour” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0170840611433993">Douglas &amp; Wildavsky, 1982</xref>, p. 90). The following excerpt is consistent with this view:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think fair has to do with treating the whole organization as decently as you can in terms of fair income, fair salaries, fair benefits and so on. I think the relativities within the compensation structure are important. I hate it when I see a CEO earning much more than his direct reports. I think the relativity as you go down the structure should have a certain kind of consistency. So that would be the foundation of fairness. So fairness is probably more a bottom up thing than it is a top down thing. (CC 22)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In short, in the context of CCs, the hierarchic culture emphasizes experts, systems of expertise and protocols as indispensable mechanisms of rationality, which are used to determine morally acceptable compensation boundaries across hierarchical ranks. However, the hierarchic bias can be a victim of its own faith in structured protocols and expertise. On the one hand, by naturalizing benchmark techniques as forms of objective evaluation, hierarchy is not conducive to sensitivity with respect to inflationist pressures. That is, a mechanical focus on the average of the industry is not likely to engender a rigorous questioning of the evolution of the average. On the other hand, driven by a sense of legitimacy derived from the formal duties and powers they possess, CC members may tend to isolate themselves from pressures and criticisms that come from the outside. As observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0170840611433993">Douglas (1992a</xref>, p. 66): “One unintended consequence of setting up a successful bureaucracy … is that its viewpoint tends to be insensitive to political outcomes.” Hierarchy can therefore expose the organization to the risk of misperceiving societal expectations regarding executive compensation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our point of departure in undertaking this research was to examine how CC members make sense of their decision-making processes in determining executive compensation. To investigate the matter we mobilized Douglas’s cultural theory, which presents a conceptualization of the relationship between preferences, ways of organizing and behavior. In the words of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0170840611433993">Douglas and Wildavsky (1982</xref>, pp. 174–175):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Each [cultural type] provides a theory of how society should be organized and a set of smooth grooves into which a life style can be cast. Each also provides an explanatory philosophy to justify it. These … types arise out of an interest in power, either for exerting it or for checking it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Methodologically speaking, we sought through interviews to assess the extent to which cultural theory’s biases are reflected in discourses and thoughts expressed by CC members, when making sense of their committee’s work. We found that individualism and hierarchy especially characterize the interviewees’ narratives. Drawing on the rationalities that underlie individualism and hierarchy, CC members can sincerely claim that their determination of top executive’s remuneration is morally acceptable. Comfort ensues from the intertwining of the two biases.</p>
<p>From an individualistic viewpoint, any top executive has the right to enter the system of exchanges that constitutes the compensation market and benefit from the immunities and protections devised to make it work. High inequalities are accepted since individual success, in fair competition, needs to be appropriately rewarded, specifically in accordance with parameters as “naturally” determined by the market. From this angle, the main duty of CCs is to ensure that CEOs are paid according to market practices. Presuming that CEOs exert significant influence on their employer’s destiny, high compensation is therefore morally acceptable when the CEO delivers more than the initial expectations of their performance. Complaints of inequality and failures are attenuated by fixing blame on losers and incompetents. As such, individualism encourages the glorification of individuals who apparently make a significant difference in terms of corporate profitability.</p>
<p>Hierarchy does not preach social equality as necessary, good or possible. Some degree of inequality (as long as it is not outrageous) is embedded in its constitution. Its vision of the human being in society is predicated on the channeling of wealth and control to established authority. Contrary to the market system that loses moral plausibility when the pattern of wealth holding is stabilized, hierarchy needs to stabilize the control of wealth. Accordingly, comfort in establishing remuneration ensues from a careful and consistent application of evaluative protocols involving a diverse mix of objectives, performance measures, and remuneration components. Expertise is central in operating these complicated protocols. Moreover, excessive compensation is viewed as being incoherent with the necessity of maintaining internal cohesion within the organization. Nonetheless, due to the prevalence of the average in evaluation protocols, CCs that are significantly influenced by the hierarchical bias may be unable to react to abrupt increases in CEO remuneration across the industry. Although the influence of hierarchy across society may be less significant than in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0170840611433993">Hendry, 1999</xref>, p. 567), our analysis indicates that it meaningfully affects sense-making of actors involved in corporate governance processes. Standardization and the quest for the average still constitute important social forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0170840611433993">Porter, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Although most of CC members interviewed arrived to a point at which moral issues about executive compensation were satisfactorily settled, all participants were not deeply and neatly divided among the two prominent biases. As indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0170840611433993">Table 3</xref>, adherence to more than one bias is palpable in all individual transcripts—of course in varying proportions. Further, individualistic and hierarchic statements prevail in every transcript. Accordingly, the proportion of individualistic and hierarchic sentences on the total number of coded sentences varies from 71.7% to 98.3%, with the overall average being 88.5% (last column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0170840611433993">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>The intermingled and dominant presence of the two cultural biases of the center among CC members can be interpreted along the combinative point elaborated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0170840611433993">Douglas and Wildavsky (1982)</xref>, in that the individualist culture leans upon the hierarchic culture in order to develop, and vice versa. While pursuing very different goals, the individualistic and hierarchic logics can be in agreement regarding the means of achieving them. This can be illustrated through the role played by compensation consultants. From an individualistic viewpoint, their role is mainly related to their spirit of innovation. From a hierarchic viewpoint, their function is mainly welcomed for their ability to refine comparative protocols and legitimize the corporate order. In both cases, resorting to consultants is a common tool, even if for different purposes. In forming several of these circumstantial alliances, the individualistic bias and the hierarchic bias can prosper simultaneously within CCs.</p>
<p>Upon further analysis, the concomitant presence of the center’s cultural values underlines the question of change. If cultural biases are self-protecting, socializing and instructing people as to what should be valued or preferred, then how can individualistic or hierarchic perceptions of executive compensation ever lose or gain in adherence within CCs? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0170840611433993">Thompson et al. (1990</xref>, p. 69) suggest as an answer that cultural change occurs in a way relatively similar to the processes leading to the adoption or desertion of scientific theories—that is to say, through “the cumulative impact of successive anomalies or surprises”. Cultural biases, like theories, cannot exclude reality tests altogether. As evidence builds up against theories, or as cultural preferences do not pay off for adherents, doubts may gradually build up, followed eventually by defections. A persistent pattern of surprises may lead individuals to look for alternative cultural conceptions that can provide a more satisfying fit with the world. For instance, members of a given CC sympathetic to hierarchy would expect their company to perform fairly well given the CEO’s remuneration package, as sanctified through the advice of expert consultants. They are likely to be surprised when seeing that actual compensation increases while the company’s performance decreases, in spite of expert advice having been used in designing the remuneration package. Their lack of comfort will solidify if the negative correlation between remuneration and performance persists over time. From this angle, cultural change implies reflexive individuals able to confront their beliefs, values and expectations to the environment in which they evolve.</p>
<p>Our interviews highlight two types of culturally reflexive individuals. The first kind relates to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0170840611433993">Olli (1999</xref>, p. 60) describes as:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>the sequential individual who holds more than one cultural bias and also has the ability to switch between the biases as if they were roles. If the context in which sequential individuals find themselves changes, they will quickly adapt by changing their biases to a new set of values and attitudes thereby still being internally coherent.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This description resonates with a point developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0170840611433993">Beck (2000)</xref>, according to whom inner or psychological mobility increasingly characterizes contemporary life, with individuals having to go back and forth between different worlds, whose opposition and tension lodge in the same locus, that is to say, the individual’s interpretive schemes. For instance, in the following quote, one interviewee specifies that they feel the need for changing “hats” when sitting on CCs:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>When you sit on these compensation committees, how do you come to feel at ease with the compensation that’s being offered?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewee:</speaker>
<p>I really have to put the second hat on my head. I mean, I begin with a hat that says this can’t be. This is Alice in Wonderland. You know, you have a senior manager who is working 80 hours a week and trying so hard to build his position in the company and you’re paying him $85,000 and his variable pay for the year is $50,000. Then you got the CEO who is making eight or ten million, it’s just that gap is too big. And so I put my hat on and say, let’s work with the comparatives of similar companies. Then we’re clearly not out of line and in the case of the three Canadian companies on which I serve, they all happen to be, thank God at the moment, very, very good performing companies so you feel kind of comfortable that your people are well rewarded. (CC 17)</p>

<p>The interviewee appears to justify the unjustifiable through an argument based on the cultural impermeability of boundaries between two different worlds, that of the average employee and that of top executives—as if these worlds are predicated on incommensurable paradigms and logics. Taking this type of reflexivity into consideration, where the individual’s explicitly supported bias is dependent upon context—then the cultural appreciation of a member on a compensation policy can shift from one bias to another, depending on circumstances and the dominant cultural logic(s) within the committee(s) of which s/he is a member. Seen from this viewpoint, cultural change is then especially dependent on the power dynamics within the committee.</p>
<p>The other kind of reflexivity found in our interviews has similarities with the “synthetic individual” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0170840611433993">Olli, 1999</xref>, p. 59) who</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>learns about the different [social and organizational] solidarities in a manner that makes cultural biases almost turn into schemes or versatile jigsaw pieces of knowledge. Synthetic individuals are not internally coherent in terms of cultural biases, but they display an individual stability and consistency across different contexts.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In other words, such individuals are characterized with the ability to build syntheses and rely on a global approach to make sense of the situations in which they are involved. Since synthetic individuals’ cultural biases are less influenced by the context, they have a greater repertoire of ways to act (and justify their actions) in a given situation. This cultural flexibility is conspicuous in the following excerpt where, in reaction to the failure of some compensation policies, the interviewee proposes combining a governmental and authoritarian course of action that is basically hierarchic in nature—calling for a strong state intervention—and a return to the basic individualistic moral principles of competition:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>So if I were a dictator in Canada I would re-establish Glass-Steagall [Act]. If you’re running a bank and you produce a big bottom line and the compensation is driven by the bottom line, then obviously you’re going to be out there betting with the best of them, if the rules of the road allow that. So at the end of the day, it’s a compensation thing, but it’s allowed to be a compensation thing because we’ve allowed our regulation to deliver temptation to people running banks. [Individual W], who ran [Canadian Bank X] for nine years led it downhill. [Canadian Bank X] was the largest bank in this country and it’s had this kind of regal decline over the years. … When he left it was fifth. [Individual W] walked out with $100 million. Now ask yourself whether you want to be the Chairman of that compensation committee. What they did, was like having termites in the woodwork. You don’t hear them, you don’t see them, but it’s getting weaker and people can’t see what’s going on. That’s why you don’t just look at whether he delivered his targets. You don’t just look at what he did. You ask: “How are we doing versus our competitors?” And that is the acid test. In that case he should have been fired after about three years. (CC 22)</p>

<p>Fundamentally speaking, people, according to cultural theory, rarely correspond to dense and consistent little boxes—hierarchical, individualist, egalitarian, or fatalist to the core—infused by a steady and unambiguous cultural environment; they are likely to be every bit as plural as the fields in which they act. In many cases, people are simply the micro end of the plural communities to which they belong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0170840611433993">Douglas, 1997</xref>). Exposed to representations and practices of various cultural influences gravitating at the core or in periphery of their activities, people do not act simply as automatons but are able, at least in principle, to accept, remodel or just reject social pressure and any preference issued from the cultural system in which they are evolving. As observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0170840611433993">Thompson, Grendstad, and Selle (1999</xref>, p. 12), it can be</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>much more helpful to speak of the dividual [instead of the individual], there being no reason why a person should not lead different parts of his or her life as a component of different solidarities. This is what most of us do and the insistence on forcing every part of life into just one solidarity, is the mark of the fanatic.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Accordingly, the visible tension in some of the members that we interviewed regarding the basis for action of individualistic and hierarchic morals, signals the prevalence of a cultural pragmatism of sorts among reflexive directors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0170840611433993">Argyris, 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>The internal mobility described above either in the form of a cultural synthesis or through the ability to move from one cultural bias to another, is indicative of a disposition for change by a few CC members. However, such dispositions were not found across all interviews. One of the main impressions we had when analyzing the transcripts is that many CC members seem to have a strong cultural identity, “where the bias comes very close to being a permanent trait of the individual, almost like a personality” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0170840611433993">Olli, 1999</xref>, p. 59). These members tended to reject any cultural understanding different from the compensation philosophy they support. Returning to the analogy with scientific paradigms, scientific revolutions have not been shown to be easily accepted by all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0170840611433993">Kuhn, 1970</xref>). Therefore, without underestimating or ignoring the reflexive tension within certain CC members—and the ensuing openness to change it stimulates—our use of Douglas’s work implies both a normative and regulatory questioning: Which is the ideal cultural regime for a compensation committee? How can such a regime be promoted?</p>
<p>First, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0170840611433993">Douglas and Wildavsky (1982</xref>, p. 175) remind us, “it is axiomatic for the cultural approach that none of these [cultural] schemes … is imposed upon individuals from the outside. Each bias only endures to the extent that its subscribers see no viable alternatives.” Adherence to a given bias is therefore not eternal. Second, Douglas’s cultural theory gives no lessons about preferring one culture to another. Each cultural bias is imperfect—having to confront its own contradictions and breakdown. Recognizing these distinct imperfections, it can be argued that the survival of each bias is partly dependent on the existence of the other biases and the alliances they can provide. As maintained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0170840611433993">Thompson et al. (1990</xref>, p. 87), “Without some modicum of hierarchy to make rules and to enforce contracts, unmitigated self-regulation leads to chaos.” But how is the individualist ever going to see the need for hierarchy? “Never, unless the voice from the border shocked at injustice and waste, creates a public scandal. Then the market is forced to compromise with hierarchy and the two occupy the center once more and the egalitarians are pushed in the border” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0170840611433993">Douglas &amp; Wildavsky, 1982</xref>, p. 181). Cultural pluralism is therefore thought to be, at least theoretically, a pertinent social arrangement. Following this principle, an agenda for reform implies strategies of intervention aimed at reintegrating the marginalized cultural biases without annihilating the moral underpinnings of the historically-dominant biases.</p>
<p>In light of our interviews, the reintegration of marginalized cultural biases essentially implies attending to the voice of the “border”, particularly the egalitarian one. A first strategy consists of encouraging the nomination, within CCs, of members well known for their egalitarian cultural values. While it may appear attractive for its simplicity, this approach is not necessarily the most effective. Given our theoretical point about “dividuals”, identifying individuals who possess a strong cultural bias may prove difficult. Also, nothing guarantees that once a member of the committee, the egalitarian individual will not adapt to the dominant cultural logics, leading to a dilution of his or her cultural commitment. Another line of action, less spectacular and provocative, but perhaps more relevant, is to make the egalitarian voice heard indirectly, within the consultation and subsequent adoption processes of compensation policies.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, a number of organizations have modified their governance procedures through the adoption of say-on-pay measures which imply the presentation in a general shareholder meeting of executive compensation policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0170840611433993">Deane, 2007</xref>). While say-on-pay was expected to provide shareholders with more power and control over the amount and design of executive compensation, recent research indicates that say-on-pay did not translate into a significant impact on executive compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0170840611433993">Conyon &amp; Sadler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0170840611433993">Ferri &amp; Maber, 2009</xref>). From a Douglassian viewpoint, these results are not surprising. As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0170840611433993">Hendry (1999)</xref>, representatives of institutional shareholders, who exert the most influence during shareholder meetings, often have the cultural views of the center. Can say-on-pay be conducive to empowerment? Similar to efforts made by a growing number of organizations to take into account various stakeholder perceptions with regard to social and environmental issues—such as stakeholder panels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0170840611433993">O’Dwyer, 2011</xref>) or the UK’s Prince of Wales Accounting for Sustainability Forum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0170840611433993">Hopwood, 2009</xref>)—we can outline a say-on-pay arena where the consideration of stakeholder voices is not circumscribed to the most important institutional shareholders, but is inclusive of a larger group comprising employees, unions, public authorities as well as small shareholder associations. It is not unreasonable to imagine that an encompassing say-on-pay template—especially in the setting of an egalitarian cultural public opinion as in the United States for instance (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0170840611433993">Douglas &amp; Wildavsky 1982</xref>, p. 152, “America is a border country”)—can play a role in the development of a plural cultural environment surrounding the adoption processes of executive compensation.</p>
<p>However, this strategy of intervention should not be pursued at the expense of the historically dominant cultural biases. Concretely, a pluralist position implies the consideration of principles at the core of the prevailing moralities, such as the limitation of excessive compensation gaps in order to promote internal cohesion within the organization (hierarchy) and the binding of performance and compensation in order to promote executive accountability (individualism). At the end of the day, cultural theory suggests that regimes that have largely excluded a particular bias “lose the wisdom attached to that bias, and thus inevitably pile up trouble for themselves” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0170840611433993">Thompson et al., 1990</xref>, p. 96). If this is true, then compensation policies which reflect and promote a diversity of cultural biases are more likely to do better than policies that repress variety. In other words, plans to reform executive compensation may be constrained as long as they neglect to take into account the productive relations of dependence that exist between rival perceptions of compensation policies.</p>
<p>As illustrated above, studies predicated on cultural theory can participate to a broader epistemological movement, founded on phronesis which advocates a conception of research “as a practical, intellectual activity aimed at clarifying the problems, risks, and possibilities we face as humans and societies, and at contributing to social and political praxis” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0170840611433993">Flyvbjerg, 2001</xref>, p. 4). Of course, when making sense of our prescriptive claims, one needs to be reminded about the complexities of translations underlying the implementation of policies and strategies of intervention in concrete settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0170840611433993">Clegg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0170840611433993">Justesen &amp; Mouritsen, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Critiques of compensation policies and compensation committees—whether in academic or public discourse—usually focus on sensationalizing the amount of top executives’ pay packages around two main objections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0170840611433993">Harris, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0170840611433993">Kaplan, 2008</xref>): (1) pay packages are unreasonable on their face, based on their comparative and gross magnitude; and (2) they violate principles of justice and fairness. Accompanying these objections is an imagery of CC members as irrational and unethical individuals. For instance, in an exhaustive analysis of the recent financial crisis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0170840611433993">Lowenstein (2010</xref>, p. 122) brings to the fore the idea of a moral disconnection, in the realm of executive compensation, between the views of corporate elites and those of the public. Yet, as indicated in our study, CC members’ ways of reasoning predominantly reflect the cultural logics and preferences that participate in the entrenchment of the center, as constituted through the combination of individualism and hierarchy. In other words, members’ interpretive schemes tend to be in agreement with the moral principles that underlie the cultural schemes of the center.</p>
<p>Our paper can be used as a basis to make sense of the continuous reporting of “scandalous” executive compensation by the media. The point is that most CC members are part of a centric culture which does not consider compensation excessive—as long as it seems to be in line with the economic laws of the market (individualism) or fitting with the normality of the present as captured through the notion of average compensation (hierarchy). Events which are construed by the media as scandalous do not tend to be perceived as such in CC circles. Moreover, our analysis suggests that, far from being socially or morally dissuasive, the disclosure of executive compensation can constitute, in certain cultural circles, a powerful force to salary inflation.</p>
<p>Our study also casts doubt on some widely conveyed representations of CC regulation in current academic and professional literature. For instance, from an agency theory perspective, independence and competencies are often viewed as two key features of effective CC members. However, studies that have measured board monitoring in terms of the proportion or quality of outside directors either on the board or on the CC indicate only a limited effect on the level of top management pay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0170840611433993">Conyon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0170840611433993">Conyon &amp; He, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0170840611433993">Conyon &amp; Peck, 1998</xref>). Drawing on cultural theory, these weak findings are not surprising because director independence should not be considered only in terms of business proximity or financial independence, but also in terms of communal beliefs and values shared with executives. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0170840611433993">Ezzamel and Watson (1997</xref>, p. 73) suggest cozy collusion taking place between executive and outside directors, we argue that the relationship between the two can be apprehended from the viewpoint of cultural collusion.</p>
<p>Competencies also tend to be promoted in best practice pronouncements pertaining to compensation committees. Yet cultural theory leads us to uphold that <italic>variety in competencies</italic> should be a key focus point of these pronouncements. Regulating the work of compensation committees would therefore imply the promotion of cultural diversity—although this task is far from being easy since a predetermined point of cultural equilibrium is inexistent.</p>
<p>Our study points to several avenues of research. It would be relevant to examine, from a cultural theory perspective, how and why the ratio of CEO compensation to the average worker compensation has increased significantly over the last few decades. We surmise that a cultural change occurred in board settings, and perhaps in society, over this time frame. Also, one could investigate in a deeper way the motivations of CC members (e.g., what do they want to achieve as members: operational comfort, prestige, conflict avoidance, etc.), and how their motivations relate to cultural biases and decisions made by the committees on which they sit. Moreover, the formation of a dominant cultural logic necessarily implies trials of strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0170840611433993">Bourguignon &amp; Chiapello, 2005</xref>), and in consequence, the investigation of the dynamics of power within CCs constitutes another promising area of research.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, a number of researchers have argued that research should not be constrained by epistemological blinders, which prevent the development of alternative ways of understanding the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0170840611433993">Abbott, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0170840611433993">Flyvbjerg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0170840611433993">Gendron, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0170840611433993">Hopwood, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0170840611433993">Williams, Jenkins, &amp; Ingraham, 2006</xref>). A rich and diverse body of research precisely depends on the juxtaposition and mobilization of different theoretical “languages”—which do not necessarily contradict each other, but instead often unite in complementing one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0170840611433993">Clegg, 2006</xref>). In accordance with an epistemological stance predicated on diversity, we contend that cultural theory represents a promising analytical lens to be utilized in developing a better understanding of the social world of corporate governance, businesses and economics. Endeavors and decisions in these areas are not culturally free, but are instead upheld by shared beliefs, values and preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0170840611433993">Douglas &amp; Wildavsky, 1982</xref>). Our use of cultural theory in the context of CCs, according to which levels of executive compensation are not a mere function of self-interest, lies within the scope of research plurality—adding to a growing movement among academics borrowing from social psychology, behavioral law, and economics to help us understand the dynamics of board processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0170840611433993">Bebchuk &amp; Fried, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0170840611433993">Langevoort, 2001</xref>).</p>

<p>While adherence to discourses of globalization and best practices may suggest that our cultural theorization of sense-making in CCs is not significantly constrained by the local specificities of our Canadian data, our findings nonetheless relate to time and place. Accordingly, although Douglas’s cultural typologies operate across contexts, their articulation and the ways in which they relate to one another in the field inevitably vary at the micro level. In particular, our findings concern the domain of public company’s Anglo-Saxon corporate governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0170840611433993">Weimer &amp; Pape, 1999</xref>). Jurisdictions which require the presence of the “border” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0170840611433993">Douglas &amp; Wildavsky, 1982</xref>) on boards of directors (e.g., employees and unions in Germanic governance systems), as well as public sector entities (e.g., government corporations), are likely to be characterized with distinct cultural dynamics—which however are beyond the scope of our study.</p>
