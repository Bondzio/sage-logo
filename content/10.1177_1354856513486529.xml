<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the past decade, the relationship between communication and participation has regained prominence on the public and academic agenda, feeding the hope of the (continued) democratization of our societies. But the unfolding of history is convoluted and contradictory, and one is ill-advised to expect utopian outcomes. Yet, in this article, we still retain a degree of guarded optimism, a stance that we would claim rests on analysis rather than on some wishful thinking, to show that when we use a long-term perspective (at the expense of a multitude of relevant details), we can indeed see an intensification of the democratic revolution within the media sphere. We offer this perspective as a broader, historical counterpoint to the understandably troubled portrait that characterizes the analyses of contemporary democracies and the functioning of (mainstream) media organizations, but also to the reductionist privileging of digital media as the ultimate sites of participation.</p>
<p>This article aims to provide a more historically grounded approach to the relationship between communication and participation, by distinguishing different waves of media democratization. Focusing on (mainly the second half of ) the 20th and the 21st centuries, this article aims to briefly but still carefully sketch a series of intense moments of participation in and through the media, arguing that the recent wave of media democratization in and through the Internet should not be privileged and that we should not give amnesia when it comes to writing participatory histories. But given the complexity of the concept of participation, it is still very necessary to first initiate a debate about the concept of participation itself, avoiding that this concept’s meaning becomes too fluid, open and under theorised,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1354856513486529">1</xref>
</sup> which would impede upon any attempt to produce a more historically grounded approach towards media participation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1354856513486529">
<title>The concept of media participation and its complexities</title>
<p>The concept of media participation is surprisingly complex. One level of complexity arises because the concept of media participation is a conflation of two interrelated forms of participation, which can be termed participation <italic>in</italic> the media and <italic>through</italic> the media, similar to the way by which Janet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1354856513486529">Wasko and Vincent Mosco (1992</xref>: 7) distinguish between democratization in and through the media. Participation <italic>through</italic> the media deals with the opportunities for mediated participation in public debate and for self-representation in the variety of public spaces that characterize the social. The media sphere serves as a location, where citizens can voice their opinions and experiences and interact with other voices. Obviously, the structures and cultures of the media sphere itself (and its many components), and the ideological-democratic environment, have a strong impact on the intensity of the participation. Participation <italic>in</italic> the media then deals with participation in the production of media output (content-related participation) and in media organizational decision-making (structural participation).</p>
<p>A second complexity is related to the limits of the concept of participation itself, which we see as a political process, where the actors involved in decision-making processes are positioned towards each other through power relationships that are (to an extent) egalitarian. The debates on participation in institutionalized politics and in all other societal fields (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354856513486529">Carpentier, 2011</xref>), including media participation, always produce very different contexts, but they also have a lot in common in that they all focus on the distribution of power within society, ranging from the macro- to the microlevel. The balance between people’s inclusion in the implicit and explicit decision-making processes within these fields, and their exclusion through the delegation of power (again, implicit or explicit), is central to discussions on participation in all fields.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1354856513486529">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>This connection with power (and the political) renders the concept of participation contingent; in other words, the concept itself is part of the power struggles in society, which further complicates the notion of participation. The meanings attributed to participation are part of a <italic>politics of definition</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354856513486529">Fierlbeck, 1998</xref>: 177), since its specific articulation shifts depending on the ideological framework that makes use of it. More particularly, the definition of participation is one of the many societal fields, where a political struggle is waged between the minimalist and the maximalist variations of democracy. In the minimalist model, democracy is confined mainly to the processes of representation, participation to elite selection and the political to politics. In the maximalist model, democracy is seen as a more balanced combination of representation and participation, where attempts are made to maximize participation. The political is considered a dimension of the social, which allows for a broad application of participation in many different social fields (including the media), at both micro- and macro level, and with respect to societal diversity.</p>
<p>A similar logic can be used to describe minimalist and maximalist media participation. In (very) minimalist forms, media professionals retain strong control over process and outcome – often restricting participation to mainly access and interaction – to the degree that one wonders whether the concept of participation is still appropriate. Participation remains articulated as a contribution to <italic>the</italic> public sphere but often mainly serving the needs and interests of the mainstream media system itself, instrumentalizing and incorporating the activities of participating non-professionals. This media-centred logic leads to a homogenization of the audience and a disconnection of their participatory activities from other societal fields and from the broad definition of the political, resulting in the articulation of media participation as non-political. In the maximalist forms, (professional) control and (popular) participation become more balanced and attempts are made to maximize participation. Here, we see the acknowledgement of audience diversity and heterogeneity and of the political nature of media participation. The maximalist articulation allows for a recognition of the potential of media participation for macroparticipation and its multidirectional nature.</p>
<p>Moreover – and this again adds complexity to the concept of participation – we would like to argue that a participatory process requires the presence of several actors, <italic>and</italic> the potential presence of a power imbalance between actors that take diverse positions, which is then addressed (and limited) through the participatory process itself, rendering it egalitarian (to an extent).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1354856513486529">3</xref>
</sup> First of all, if we look at the etymology of participation, there is a strong emphasis on ‘taking part’, which unavoidably implies the presence of more than one actor in the participatory process. <italic>Ad absurdum</italic>: It is rather difficult to participate with oneself. This limit to participation impacts on the analysis of participatory processes in relation to the media. For instance, in cases of single-authored self-administered publications, it is difficult to use the concept of participation at the level of the production process itself – labelling it participation <italic>in</italic> the media – as there is only one person involved. Of course, this kind of publishing act still remains a form of participation <italic>through</italic> the media because that one person enters a broader community, in which she/he then participates <italic>through</italic> that publication.</p>
<p>The second requirement – the potential presence of a power imbalance that is redressed – would, for instance, imply that medieval scribes, when merely copying manuscripts, are not seen as engaging in participation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1354856513486529">4</xref>
</sup> Moreover, the modernist conceptions of ownership and authorship are necessary components to understand contemporary forms of media participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354856513486529">Hamilton, 2003</xref>). This type of argument is supported by the core structure of democratic theory, where we can always find a balance between participation and representation in democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1354856513486529">Held, 1996</xref>: 3). The logics of representation imply the delegation of power, which in turn implies that a power imbalance between rulers and ruled is generated, which is then (partially) addressed by participatory processes such as elections. When we look at the mainstream media, media production is restricted to a specific group of people, who are here termed ‘media professionals’, who are characterized by the possession of specific forms of expertise and skills, institutional embeddedness and autonomy and the deployment of management and power strategies to achieve specific objectives.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1354856513486529">5</xref>
</sup> In these mainstream media contexts, one can again wonder whether the concept of participation is appropriate for the activities of media professionals in the process of media production. The concept seems to fit better for the activities of non-professionals that are granted access and (some degree of) participation to the professional system. But things might be more complicated, as media professionals often find themselves excluded from the management of the media organization itself – they do have a much weaker power position here – and participation might still be a valuable concept to describe, for instance, the mechanisms where media professionals become involved in managerial processes. A second complication is that – at least at first sight – community and alternative media organizations risk becoming excluded from this definition of participation. The resolution to this definitional problem can be found in the argument that community and alternative media organizations are characterized by internal diversity, which also generates many different power positions within these organizations. Moreover, as a whole, the rhizomatic field of community and alternative media organizations can be seen as a way to redress the power imbalances within the mainstream media.</p>

<sec id="section3-1354856513486529">
<title>Waves of media democratization</title>
<p>Historically, the debate about the definition of participation matters for contextualizing the early phases of participation in media production. Although we can go even further back in history, as the example of the scribes shows, it was the invention of the printing press in particular that generated a structural shift in the use of media technologies for self-expression. Books, newspapers, leaflets, almanacs and so on became key resources for participation <italic>through</italic> the media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1354856513486529">Keane, 1991</xref>: 36–37). The question here becomes whether these forms of media production also allowed for participation within the media. At first sight, and unfortunately there is not much research to build upon, we often see small groups of publishers and editors, situated in fairly similar power positions, which do not fit well with the defining characteristic of the potential presence of a power imbalance between actors that take diverse positions (which is then redressed). Again, we believe that it is perfectly legitimate to consider this a process of participation <italic>through</italic> the media, but want to raise doubts whether these are cases of participation <italic>in</italic> the media, given the lack of diversity in the positions within the production environment.</p>
<p>Darling’s (2008) work on the print media in Spain’s American colonies in the early 19th century indicates that there are exceptions, though, as she writes: ‘Newspapers were inventing themselves and everyone was welcome to be part of that process of invention’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354856513486529">Darling, 2008</xref>: 69). In the case of these print media, this openness enabled the (sometimes very prominent) inclusion of reader contributions and letters to the editor, which can be considered as forms of participation <italic>in</italic> the media. Interestingly, she adds the suggestion that the professionalization and institutionalization of these newspapers led to the foreclosure of this participatory openness. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354856513486529">Griffen-Foley (2004</xref>: 535) argues, some late 19th century periodicals also allowed ‘for personalized editor/reader interaction’. A similar point can be made for radio technologies, which were used in more participatory ways in the 1920s, for instance in radio clubs, before radio became institutionalized. Radio then became a tool of distribution, despite, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354856513486529">Brecht’s (2001)</xref> call for it to be used as a tool for communication.</p>
<p>The rise of industrial capitalism and private media empires tended to quite effectively thwart any popular participation in the press and commercial radio and television. Traditionally, regulatory mechanisms aimed at commercial media in regard to their output have been at best modestly successful, and the distance between such regulation and participation is quite long. Only in the realm of public service broadcasting systems did any kind of participatory structures develop, in the form of civil society representation. Despite its growing problems, public service as a manifestation of democratic input into media decision-making has had enormous significance as an effort to politically establish democratic control and accountability in the media. Yet today, public service is on the defensive and not always very different from commercial broadcasters in (not) organizing participation.</p>
<p>The institutional closure, especially for radio but also for print media, opened up in the 1960s and 1970s, which we can consider as the first wave of post-World War II media democratization, where participation <italic>in</italic> and <italic>through</italic> the media were combined. All around the world, a heterogeneous galaxy of ‘independent’, ‘underground’, ‘alternative’, ‘community’, ‘citizens’, ‘participatory’ and ‘radical’ media flourished, comprising radio stations, newspapers, fanzines, independent theatres, filmmakers, music labels and publishers, revolutionary libraries and bookshops and so on. What these communicational practices shared was access by the community and participation of the community (and its constituent subgroups). One of many illustrations can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354856513486529">Howley’s (2005</xref>: 4) work, when he describes community media as ‘locally oriented, participatory media (that facilitate the) process of collective identity construction in geographically defined communities’.</p>
<p>If participation in media structures and decision-making has mostly been marginal from a societal perspective, the political impact of alternative, community and radical ‘small media’ has by no means been insignificant (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354856513486529">Atton, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354856513486529">Bailey et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1354856513486529">Downing et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354856513486529">Girard, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1354856513486529">Ostertag, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1354856513486529">Rodriguez, 2001</xref>), also because it was supported by debates within United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354856513486529">MacBride Commission, 1980</xref>). The history of various political and social movements underscores the important role they have played, for example, from class-based and union politics to ecological and women’s struggles and in recent decades antiwar movements and a vast variety of groups focused on identity politics. The relevance of such media linkages to political practices flows directly into the contemporary situation with Web 2.0, to which we will return shortly.</p>
<p>Many of those journals, radio stations and so on did not survive the 1970s, although some of them still exist, such as the very first community radio station in Europe, Radio Študent in Ljubljana (Slovenia), which was established in 1968. After these participatory decades, television successfully adopted talk show formats from radio (see Munson, 1993), creating another upsurge of participatory programming, but this time the mainstream setting led to much less radical – less maximalist – versions of participation. The television talk show became a popular subgenre that differed considerably from set format programmes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354856513486529">Carbaugh, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354856513486529">Livingstone and Lunt, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354856513486529">Peck, 1995</xref>). Despite these intragenre differences, all these programmes were based on the principle that ‘an active role is accorded to the studio audience which participates in a discussion about social, personal or political problems under the supervision of a presenter’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354856513486529">Leurdijk, 1999</xref>: 37, our translation). Moreover, they relied on heavy forms of professional management that limited the participatory intensity, rendering them more minimalist-participatory, a process that only intensified when the talk show’s successor, reality television, became popular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354856513486529">Andrejevic, 2004</xref>). In addition, as, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1354856513486529">Jenkins (1992</xref>) argued, popular culture, through the logics of fandom, became a site of participatory culture, where audience members not only displayed forms of media activism but also organized the production of a wide variety of media texts (e.g. fan fiction).</p>
<p>A new wave of media democratization came about with the popularization of the Internet, especially Web 2.0. While in the pre-Web 2.0 phase, the debates about participation <italic>through</italic> the media were often restricted to the Internet’s potential for organizing forms of direct democracy (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354856513486529">Budge, 1996</xref>), the Web 2.0 phase was seen to have triggered more extensive forms of participation. A series of e-concepts was used to point out the possibilities for increased participation in institutionalized politics. Moving beyond institutionalized politics, the deliberative turn also affected new media studies, where these deliberative models were seen to ‘conceive of a more complex horizontal and multidirectional interactivity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354856513486529">Chadwick, 2006</xref>: 100). Through counterpublic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1354856513486529">Fraser, 1990</xref>) approaches, (new) information and communications technologies (ICTs) also become articulated as mobilization tools, assisting in political (in the broad sense) recruitment, organization and campaigning, again contributing to participation <italic>through</italic> the Internet.</p>
<p>In contrast to participation <italic>through</italic> the Internet (and ICTs), participation <italic>in</italic> the Internet focuses on the opportunities provided to non-media professionals to (co-)produce media content themselves and to (co-)organize the structures that allow for this media production. In new media theory, the opportunities for bypassing mainstream media organizations and professionals are put as one of the key arguments in favour of the Internet’s democratic–participatory potential, although its limits and problems are also often acknowledged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354856513486529">Andrews, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354856513486529">Fuchs, 2011</xref>). One entry into this debate, which also captures some of its complexities, is the concept of user-generated content (UGC), which is frequently used to describe Internet content production. Although the term UGC often implies the incorporation of users in commercial production environments, the broad category of UGC also leaves room for a wide variety of nonmainstream practices and forms of online alternative journalism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354856513486529">Atton and Hamilton, 2008</xref>, for a broad approach to alternative journalism), which allows for more maximalist versions of participation. One example is the Indymedia network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1354856513486529">Kidd, 2003</xref>), which uses the principle of open publishing to allow for these more intense forms of participation <italic>in</italic> the media.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1354856513486529">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The objective of this article was not to organize a linear-historical narrative, leading up to a participatory media (Internet) heaven. The history of the democratization of Western societies, and their media spheres, is characterized by a series of continuities and discontinuities, dead ends and sedimented practices. Despite these ever-present fluctuations, we can see that structures, cultural resources and subjective dispositions have been geared towards more participation and equality, also within the media sphere. Although different societal spheres have different social logics, they are at the same time overdetermined, and it would make little sense to privilege one sphere over the others, attributing to that specific sphere, such as, for instance, the media sphere, determining powers.</p>
<p>This raises the impossible question of whether this structural shift, favouring participation <italic>in</italic> and <italic>through</italic> the media, will persist or whether it will even intensify. Obviously, there is still a lot of space for democratic–participatory innovation, for instance with regard to mainstream media, but also in relation to the Internet. Moreover, there is no guarantee that this long-term increase in participation will continue. Democracy is always unfinished, but it is also always threatened. What this brief history does show, and what we can see as a reason for hope, is that, deeply embedded within our cultures, there is a need for control over our communicational practices. The right to communicate might not be acknowledged as a human right (at least not in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights), but in the many different participatory practices, using a variety of media technologies, we can see the continued materialization of this right to communicate.</p>
