<p>The <italic>Australian Journal of Management</italic> is interested in original, innovative and highly rigorous research. The domain of study (be it defined by country, management problem, or methodological approach) is much less important than quality and interest to both an academic readership and, preferably, a sophisticated practitioner one.</p>
<p>What distinguishes the <italic>Australian Journal of Management</italic> from other journals is its emphasis on general management. In practice, this means that high quality articles within the discipline areas listed below will be entertained while cross-disciplinary approaches, addressing cross-disciplinary problems, or with cross-disciplinary managerial implications will be particularly well received. Another characteristic of the <italic>Australian Journal of Management</italic> is that of relevance. Articles will be more academically sophisticated than industry-targeted management journals but may share the objective of having a contribution that is relevant to a practitioner audience. Of course, relevant, and supportable managerial implications does not mean that the article needs to be written for a lay audience. Implications and writing style are two different issues.</p>
<p>We strongly prefer papers that explain their main intuition, logic, and implications in clear and concise English. Importantly, papers must be written in a transparent and accessible manner and where necessary, we recommend authors use the services of a professional editor for English expression and grammar.</p>
<p>The following subject area statements provide more specific guidance:</p>
<sec id="section1-0312896212455760">
<title>Accounting</title>
<p>The Accounting section seeks papers on topics that deal with the Accounting discipline broadly defined. In this sense, the topics of interest include those relating to the various aspects of each of the sub-disciplines of accounting, specifically financial accounting, managerial accounting, auditing, and taxation. Additionally, the section supports studies conducted using the range of research methodologies including analytical (theoretical), experimental, and empirical (using archival, survey, or field data). Here, regardless of the choice of relevant sub-discipline and methodology, all research published must meet a high standard of credibility and rigor. Finally, since the <italic>Australian Journal of Management</italic> publishes articles across the various management disciplines, accounting manuscripts that have strong implications for management practice and additionally are of likely interest to neighbouring disciplines are especially encouraged.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0312896212455760">
<title>Finance</title>
<p>In the Finance discipline we seek to publish empirical papers that are informed by mainstream theory and contemporary literature. We are happy to receive papers in all areas of finance and we look for creative and original work of relevance to academics and the broader finance community. The contribution of the paper to the literature should be clearly identified. Papers that examine issues specific to an individual country will be considered, but these papers must demonstrate the broader relevance to international markets and the global economy. Authors of empirical papers should provide or make available enough information and data so that the results are reproducible.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0312896212455760">
<title>Information Technology Management</title>
<p>The objective of the Information Technology Management area of the Journal is to publish high quality research into development, implementation, use and governance of information systems and technologies, and the impact of these technologies on people, organisations, industries and society as a whole. Submissions are welcome on any information technology management topic and work from all disciplinary, theoretical and methodological viewpoints.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0312896212455760">
<title>Economics</title>
<p>The Economics section of the <italic>Australian Journal of Management</italic> invites research in economics that is related to management. More specifically, we welcome theoretical, empirical, and experimental research in the fields of organizational economics, managerial economics, industrial organization economics, labour economics, contract theory, behavioural economics, public economics, and international economics. We are interested in papers that are well motivated by important real-world issues, and yield novel and significant managerial implications for firms and/or policy implications for governments. We put more weight on microeconomics papers, but we do not exclude macroeconomics papers as long as they meet criteria just mentioned.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0312896212455760">
<title>Marketing</title>
<p>Within the overall guidelines for the Journal, including its call for cross disciplinary research and work with clear managerial implications (and application), falls a lot of research in marketing. While articles describing new theory to real management applications or those with cross-disciplinary teams will find an obvious home at the Journal, pure conceptual or theoretical pieces (with sufficient contribution) will also be accepted. Such articles may cover consumer markets, business markets, or even not for profit or government marketing issues. They may be concerned with durables, packaged goods or services. They may use primary data, secondary data, or no data at all if the advance is sufficient. In short, what the Journal seeks in the marketing area are significant, rigorous contributions relative to the existing literature that are relevant to its target readership.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0312896212455760">
<title>Organizational Behaviour</title>
<p>In the field of Organizational Behaviour we seek high quality theoretical and empirical submissions. Theoretical submissions should be based on a solid review of relevant literature and provide an advance to our conceptual understanding of the impact of organizational behaviour in organizations. Empirical papers should be grounded in a solid theory and be methodologically rigorous and apply appropriate analytical techniques. Both qualitative and quantitative submissions are encouraged. Literature reviews that are comprehensive and that provide well thought out directions for future research will be considered for publication.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0312896212455760">
<title>Strategy</title>
<p>The strategy discipline welcomes high quality empirical and theoretical work especially in the areas of firm internationalisation, international business, innovation strategy and entrepreneurship, sustainability strategy and adaption, resilience and change. Both quantitative and qualitative papers are encouraged.</p>
