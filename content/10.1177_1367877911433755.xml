<p>The 2000s were the first decade in human history where the majority of the world’s population lived in cities. While there has been much debate about what it means to have such an agglomeration of people in urban centres, there has perhaps been less discussion of its corollary of such developments in many of these cities, which has been suburbanization. The growth of urban populations has frequently involved their outward expansion through the development of new urban growth corridors, often in a planned way through the creation of new master-planned communities.</p>
<p>Suburbanization today is not necessarily what it used to be: rather than suburbs being outer urban commuter zones for people who work in the central business district, people living in new suburbs are increasingly likely to work in those suburbs, or to commute to other outer suburbs as their places of work. At one level, such trends affirm the analyses of the ‘Los Angeles School’ of urban geographers about the shift from the classical modernist city, with radial zones spreading out from a city centre where core businesses were located, to a more decentralized, ‘postmodern’ city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367877911433755">Dear and Dahmann, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367877911433755">Soja, 2010</xref>). But they increasingly move beyond this postmodern perspective, in that the many suburbs are themselves centres of work and industry, and not simply centres of lifestyle and consumption. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367877911433755">Ed Soja (2010</xref>: 123–4) makes the point that far more people now commute from Los Angeles County to neighbouring Orange County – an archetypal case study in late 20th-century suburbanization – than move in the other direction to work. Some have suggested that we should now refer to post-suburban cultural economies (Collis et al., 2012).</p>
<p>This special issue of <italic>International Journal of Cultural Studies</italic> critically reflects upon the contemporary dynamics of the suburbs, and the public discourses that surround their development, in the context of the rise of the creative industries. Understood by international agencies such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367877911433755">UNCTAD (2008)</xref> to incorporate the arts, media, design, heritage and cultural services sectors, the creative industries now account for between 4 and 8 percent of the gross domestic product of OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries. In Australia, to take one example, the creative industries now account for at least 5 percent of the total workforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367877911433755">CIE, 2009</xref>). Yet it has become apparent that an imagined geography prevails in debates about the creative industries and cities, which fails to account of the significant proportion of those working in these industries who live in suburban areas.</p>
<p>The concept of creative cities was highly influential in the 2000s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367877911433755">Evans, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367877911433755">Florida, 2008</xref>), but its focus was very much upon how investment in cultural amenities in inner cities could attract an allegedly geographically flighty ‘creative class’, who were attracted to bohemian lifestyles that could only be indulged in an inner urban <italic>milieu</italic> where people lived cheek-by-jowl. Even critics of creative-class theories tended nonetheless to subscribe to concepts such as creative clusters, which saw creativity as being uniquely sparked by living in close proximity to others in related fields, and that the likelihood of such bottom-up clustering of talents occurring was minimal in areas such as the suburbs, which by their nature tend to be more dispersed and decentralized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367877911433755">Grodach and Loukaitou-Sideris, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367877911433755">Mommaas, 2009</xref>). The articles in this issue take up these themes, drawing upon an Australian perspective in a number of instances.</p>
<p>Rob Shields’ ‘Feral suburbia’ article draws upon four years of fieldwork undertaken at Fort McMurray, a frontier city in Alberta, Canada, located at the edge of the Athabasca tar sands. Shields’ account captures the tensions that exist in such a fast-growing location between the desire of city planners to domesticate and suburbanize this new population centre, and the ways in which unpredictable migration flows and the topography of the space itself continue to undercut measures to bring order to such a ‘savage’ space. Louise Johnson chronicles the historic stereotyping of Australian suburbs by artists, political activists, social scientists and cultural critics, drawing out the frequently gendered dimensions of the dismissal of suburban developments as ‘safe’, and thus unable to unleash the Promethean dynamics of creativity that are markers of a truly creative city. By contrast, Johnson observes that architectural and design creativity have frequently been found in Australian suburban developments, from the application of modernist styles to project homes in the new Sydney suburbs in the 1950s and 1960s to environmentally sustainable design practices in new master-planned communities in Melbourne.</p>
<p>The articles by Terry Flew and Mark Gibson draw upon research undertaken as part of ‘Creative Suburbia: A Critical Evaluation of the Opportunities and Scope for Creative Cultural Development in Australia’s Emergent Suburban Communities’, a three-year Discovery project funded by the Australian Research Council. Flew examines the quantitative and qualitative research undertaken through this project in the cities of Brisbane and Melbourne to draw attention to the knowledge gap that exists in understanding ‘suburban creatives’, those who are employed in creative occupations and who live in outer suburban areas by choice. Their decision to live in the suburbs, and apparent happiness in doing so, runs up against both the imagined geography of creative industries discourse, which associates such industries and work practices with densely populated inner city areas, and the presumptions that exist – in critical discourses as well as those surrounding creative cities – about the sterile and soulless nature of suburban culture. Gibson also finds a rich vein of anti-suburbanism in Australian intellectual discourse, but notes that it exists alongside a ‘suburban canon’ of popular intellectuals who have championed the creative freedom and absence of constraint that can exist in suburban environments. He notes that the absence of attention on the part of government policy makers towards suburban culture can cut both ways: while it is indicative of a lack of intrusion and pressure to conform to group norms, it also entails a lack of recognition and support. Both Flew and Gibson pose the question of whether new investments in high-speed broadband infrastructure, such as the National Broadband Network being developed in Australia, can do more to facilitate networking and the more effective distribution of digital creative content from suburban communities.</p>
<p>An international perspective on such questions is provided in the articles by Nicholas Phelps and Wen Wen. Phelps refers to the forgotten history of London’s outer suburbs in the development of the UK economy, as well as the role played by suburban university campuses as incubators of innovation and economic activity. Phelps notes the renewed interest in basing businesses in the London suburbs, particularly among small to medium-sized enterprises, to take advantage of lower housing costs and better quality of life. Wen discusses the White Horse Lake Eco-creative City Project developed in the Chinese city of Hangzhou, which has become a central location for the Chinese film production industry. Observing that this new mega-development on the peripheral urban fringe of Hangzhou promotes itself as being a city for the ‘four comforts’ – for residence, business, travel and culture – Wen identifies the White Horse Lake project as a major case study in how the creative industries are drawn upon in the Chinese context as a branding tool for new urban developments targeted at the rising professional classes. She also identifies a range of contradictions and tensions in such developments, ranging from the interaction with established rural communities in the area to the more general tensions between a ‘socialist culture’ that values asceticism and conformity to group norms, and the emergent ‘creative ethos’ that associates development and modernity with individualism and a bohemian lifestyle.</p>
<p>The article by Chris Gibson and his colleagues at the Australian Centre for Cultural Environmental Research takes the regional city of Wollongong as a case study for critically evaluating the relationship between, on the one hand, cultural planning that seeks to promote the creative industries as an alternative source of employment in post-industrial cities, and the lived experience of residents in such cities on the other. Drawing upon the innovative methodology of cultural asset mapping, they identify a curious mapping of places that were felt to be ‘cool’ and ‘creative’. While they note that the more middle-class suburbs of North Wollongong were identified as ‘cool’ places by those who lived outside of them, they also observed an unexpected propensity for people living in the more middle-class areas to identify the southern suburbs where the steelworks used to be located as ‘cool’. This is perhaps reflective of what they describe as a ‘transition fantasy’ whereby such areas are deemed able to draw upon organic community resources to establish creative industries as an alternative to the lived experience of manufacturing decline.</p>
<p>Television has always featured prominently in those accounts of cultural studies that give priority to the suburban experience (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367877911433755">Hartley, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367877911433755">1999</xref>), and the papers by Alan McKee and Tania Lewis draw upon such traditions. McKee contrasts the monumentalism of ‘official’ culture to the smaller-scale and more suburban wellsprings of ‘Pro-Am’ or vernacular culture, by comparing Australia’s National Film and Sound Archive, located in the national capital of Canberra, to the Australian Television Archive, an online resource developed in the outer Melbourne suburb of Boronia. He describes the Australian Television Archive as a ‘suburban archive’, developed by enthusiasts who wished to chronicle, share and build community around resources associated with Australian television. He notes that it is an eclectic archive, devoted less to what are commonly seen as the landmark programs in the medium’s history, and more to shows such as serial dramas, comedies and variety programs that held a special place in the lives of the diverse range of contributors to the archive. Lewis draws upon ongoing work around ethical consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367877911433755">Lewis and Potter, 2010</xref>) to consider how television programs such as the US program <italic>Living with Ed</italic> and the Australian reality shows <italic>Guerilla Gardeners</italic> and <italic>Eco House Challenge</italic> frame the possibility of ‘green citizenship’ as a response to environmental concerns. Lewis argues that green citizenship is a particularly suburban manifestation of ethical consumption practices, focused upon the scope for creativity, play and a do-it-yourself (DIY) ethos both to transform urban landscapes and to develop a more ethical self. Lewis’s article shares with that of Mark Gibson the observation that suburban creative practices are frequently associated with an ethos of romanticism that is very much bound up with creativity discourses, yet is at odds with the assumptions that suburban life is resolutely utilitarian and uninterested in larger issues such as environmental sustainability.</p>
