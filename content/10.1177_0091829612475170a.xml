<p>Missionaries of various traditions have long admired Matteo Ricci, the Jesuit who entered China in the sixteenth century. This work, showing significant knowledge of the politics and culture of China during the Ming dynasty, is perhaps the most thorough biography of Ricci.</p>
<p>Fontana has done extensive research into the culture and scientific concepts of China during the sixteenth century. This leads the reader to greater understanding and appreciation of the obstacles that Ricci faced and largely succeeded in overcoming. Her expertise in the history of science helps the reader to understand the importance of the encounter of Western and Chinese scientific concepts at that time and Ricci’s skillful use of that encounter in communicating the Christian faith. She also shows the incredible patience and perseverance that Ricci exhibited as he slowly moved toward residence in the imperial capital, which appeared impossible as he dealt with a series of obstacles, misunderstandings, and difficult officials.</p>
<p>Ricci’s education as a Jesuit involved a strong focus on the sciences and mathematics, which at the time included astronomy, music, geography, and applied disciplines like mechanics and architecture. Mathematical knowledge was considered important for theological purposes and for the communication of the Christian faith. That concept was essential in Ricci’s understanding of his mission. Consequently he made significant contributions to the Chinese in their understanding of astronomy and other sciences.</p>
<p>Confucianism was the integrating concept of Chinese political, social, and intellectual life. At a time when most Westerners, including Roman Catholics in Latin America, showed little respect for cultures other than their own, Ricci immersed himself deeply in the Confucian classics and the Chinese language. He devoted himself to the study of the most important canonical works that Chinese scholars had to know perfectly in order to pass the imperial examinations. He was so successful that one Chinese scholar said of him, “He is no longer a foreigner, he belongs to China” (169). Ricci translated Confucian works into Latin for the use of other missionaries. He also translated Western works, including Euclid, into Chinese. He collected Western maxims on friendship and translated them in order to show their compatibility with Confucian thought. Perhaps his greatest work was his “Catechism”; not a catechism in the usual sense, but “the first attempt by a Catholic scholar to use a Chinese way of thinking to introduce Christianity to Chinese intellectuals” (225). He also made maps to demonstrate to the Chinese that the world was greater than they had realized.</p>
<p>Ricci’s goal was to use all of his knowledge of Western science and Chinese culture and literature to communicate the Christian faith. In this he was successful, leaving behind a significant group of high-level converts, including one who became tutor to the Prince.</p>
<p>He sought to ‘contextualize’ the Christian faith. For a time he and others dressed like Buddhist monks before deciding that it was counterproductive because the monks were not usually respected. So he dressed like a Mandarin. He saw similarities between Confucian and Christian ethics, describing Confucian writings as “sound moral documents.” He adopted terminology for God that seemed acceptable to the Chinese and advocated the acceptance of rites in honor of the ancestors. Unfortunately, after Ricci’s death, rivalry and disagreement between the Jesuits, Franciscans, and Dominicans prejudiced the work. It led to a series of decisions in Rome that created confusion and resentment in China. Changes in the imperial court and the fall of the Ming dynasty also hampered the Catholic mission in China. Nevertheless the mission continued and one is reminded that when Morrison, the first Protestant missionary arrived in China in 1807, his language teacher was a Chinese Catholic Christian.</p>
<p>This is a remarkable book, carefully researched, well written, and will be of interest to any student of mission history.</p>
<p>Paul E. Pierson served 17 years as a Presbyterian missionary in Brazil and Portugal. He served from 1980 to 1992 as Dean of the School of World Mission (now the School of Intercultural Studies) at Fuller Theological Seminary. His Ph.D. is from Princeton Theological Seminary.</p>
