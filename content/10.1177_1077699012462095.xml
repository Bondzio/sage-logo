<p>If you weren’t already burning through enough of your time watching <italic>The Daily Show</italic> on Hulu between meetings, Trischa Goodnow’s edited volume <italic>The Daily Show and Rhetoric</italic> promises to make sure that you are getting your necessary dosage of Jon Stewart’s comedic commentary. The volume positions Stewart as a “master rhetorician,” and contains thirteen essays on various rhetorical aspects of <italic>The Daily Show</italic> that provide a unique and valuable discussion of an especially complex, and deeply rhetorical, media text.</p>
<p>Goodnow, an associate professor in the Department of Speech Communication at Oregon State University, organizes the essays in four sections. The first three chapters deal primarily with a description of <italic>The Daily Show</italic> as a rhetorical phenomenon exploring host Jon Stewart’s ethos, the problem of the “real” versus “fake” news labels, and the program’s thoroughly intertextual construction. The second section of the book addresses the process of argument as performed by Stewart and company. The four chapters make a case for the inherently argumentative nature of satire, the capacity of political humor to model agonistic argument, the role of self-parody in carnivalesque purification, and Stewart’s use of a dialectical vernacular to encourage responsibility in the public sphere. The third section of the book concerns itself with the rhetorical strategies employed on the show including the use of an overtly comic frame, the use of inter- and intra-textual parody, and a visual aesthetic that mirrors traditional news coverage with a healthy dose of composite imagery. The fourth, and final, section explicates three key topics and issues at which Stewart and his team of comedic correspondents regularly take aim: LGBTQ concerns, religion, and race. While each of these essays is strong in its own right, these final chapters are merely teasers for what could be an entire book on the various issues that <italic>The Daily Show</italic> and other kinds of political satire engage with on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The most notable strength of this book is its examination of a great variety of the show’s components using a vast array of the rhetorical tools available in the critic’s tool chest. This is due partly to the broad conception of rhetoric, evidenced by the juxtaposition of the classical approach taken by Jonathan Barbur and Trischa Goodnow in the first chapter and the Post-Modern attitude adopted by Aaron Hess later in the book. This inclusive conception of rhetoric opens spaces for inventive critiques that push and pull rhetoric into places where it may not have otherwise been expected or welcome. In fact, some of the approaches towards rhetorical theory and criticism fall well outside of my own preferences, but that is precisely where their contributions to both the fields of media studies and rhetorical studies can be found. For example, Penina Wiesman’s discussion of framing takes a detour into what might be more traditionally classified as media studies, drawing more on Robert Entman’s understanding of framing than the more rhetorical Burkean version—which is utilized quite effectively in C. Wesley Buerkle’s essay on <italic>The Daily Show</italic>’s treatment of queer topics—and yet her analysis provides a useful critique of the show’s rhetorical positioning through the organizational and contextual cues of its comic frame by expanding those preexisting theoretical boundaries.</p>
<p>The primary weakness of the book is that it is little more than a collection of essays. This is not to say that the essays themselves are not valuable, just that they lack a certain coherency that would provide the reader with a more robust sense of the subject. The brief introduction attempts in vain to provide the tie that binds, but it is simply not enough. While reading, I find myself wishing for some commentary at the start or end of each of the four sections or a concluding chapter that might provide a summary statement of the book’s position on the rhetorical nature of <italic>The Daily Show.</italic> Of course, the kind of definitive statement that I so desire is not likely to be found in any single volume on such an intricate popular culture text.</p>
<p>The lack of cohesion also causes some overlap in content. The reader will surely tire of reading about that time when Jon Stewart berated Jim Cramer of <italic>Mad Money</italic>, and that other time when he skewered the hosts of <italic>Crossfire</italic> on their own show. While these events are certainly important for any understanding of <italic>The Daily Show</italic>, their repetitive appearance in the analyses serves to offer a potentially reductive picture of the show to the reader and leave other aspects of the program overlooked—such as the powerful synecdoche in the “Moments of Zen” and Stewart’s penchant for blurring the lines between sincerity and comedy following national crises.</p>
<p>On the whole, Goodnow’s volume brings together essays that extend existing conversations about rhetoric, news, and comedy. For example, Robert Spicer’s chapter on satire engages with the issue of “real” news versus “fake” news in ways similar to scholars such as Amber Day, in her book <italic>Satire &amp; Dissent</italic> (2011), and Geoffrey Baym. Also, both Kelly Wilz’s and Ryan McGeough’s chapters engage issues of civility and argumentation in the public sphere that add nuance to already existing debates more broadly in Baym’s work as well as the work of Jeffrey Jones. Beyond these specific examples <italic>The Daily Show and Rhetoric</italic> builds on the work of other similar volumes and texts like Jonathan Gray, Jeffrey Jones, and Ethan Thompson’s <italic>Satire TV</italic> (2009) more generally by adding nuance through a close examination of a specific satirical text. In sum, this valuable volume ought to be considered a must-read for any scholar interested in issues of parody, satire, and contemporary television news.</p>
