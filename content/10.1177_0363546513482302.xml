<sec id="section1-0363546513482302">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Trochlear dysplasia is one of the most consistent anatomic factors that can lead to recurrent patellar dislocations. Various trochleoplasty procedures have been described to treat patellar dislocations in high-grade dysplasia by creating a new congruent trochlea.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546513482302">
<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>To present the midterm efficacy and outcome of the sulcus-deepening trochleoplasty procedure in patients with recurrent patellar dislocations due to high-grade trochlear dysplasia. The clinical evaluation results, the amount of radiological correction, and the prevalence of arthritis were recorded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546513482302">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Case series; Level of evidence, 4.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546513482302">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>A total of 27 skeletally mature patients (31 knees) with recurrent patellar dislocations due to high-grade trochlear dysplasia without any previous surgery were retrospectively included from September 1993 to September 2006. All patients underwent sulcus-deepening trochleoplasty combined with a bony and/or soft tissue procedure according to concomitant etiological factors to patellar dislocations: medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction (16.1%), vastus medialis obliquus plasty (83.8%), tibial tuberosity distalization (51.6%), tibial tuberosity medialization (67.7%), and lateral retinaculum release (67.6%). Mean follow-up was 7 years (range, 2-9 years).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546513482302">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The mean sulcus angle decreased significantly (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01) from 152° ± 16° preoperatively to 141° ± 9° postoperatively, tibial tuberosity–trochlear groove distance decreased significantly (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) from 19 ± 4 mm to 12 ± 5 mm, and patellar tilt decreased significantly (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) from 37° ± 7° to 15° ± 8°. No recurrence was observed, and there was no case of stiffness. Apprehension signs remained positive in 19.3% of the cases, patellar tracking was normal in all cases, and the lateral patellar glide test finding was negative in 96.8%. The mean preoperative International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score was 51 (range, 25-80), and the mean postoperative IKDC score was 82 (range, 40-100) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), while the mean Kujala score improved from a preoperative 59 (range, 28-81) to 87 (range, 49-100) postoperatively (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). There was no radiographic evidence of patellofemoral arthritis at the latest follow-up.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546513482302">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Sulcus-deepening trochleoplasty is a valid option for the primary surgical treatment of carefully selected patients with recurrent patellar dislocations with high-grade trochlear dysplasia type B and D. Concomitant etiological factors must be cautiously corrected in an associated procedure. Midterm follow-up showed satisfactory restoration of patellar stability and improvement of knee scores with no complication of subsequent arthritis.</p>

<p>Trochlear dysplasia is a developmental condition in which the femoral trochlea loses its normal concave shape and turns to an abnormal flat or even convex geometry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513482302">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513482302">14</xref></sup> It has been identified as the most consistent anatomic factor present in patients with recurrent patellar dislocations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513482302">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513482302">18</xref></sup> For its treatment, various surgical procedures have been published and proposed to reshape the abnormal trochlea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513482302">28</xref></sup> Trochleoplasty procedures involve a certain amount of technical difficulty,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513482302">6</xref></sup> and they were initially accepted with skepticism or reserved as salvage options.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513482302">10</xref></sup> The recent literature contains studies with encouraging short-term and midterm results on the treatment of patients with patellar dislocations due to high-grade trochlear dysplasia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0363546513482302">§</xref></sup></p>
<p>Four basic trochleoplasty procedures have been proposed; Albee’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513482302">1</xref></sup> pioneer procedure involved the elevation of the lateral facet to restore normal anatomy. The second procedure is sulcus-deepening trochleoplasty, which was first proposed by Masse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513482302">27</xref></sup> and later modified by Dejour and Saggin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513482302">16</xref></sup> and Dejour et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513482302">17</xref></sup> The third procedure was introduced by Bereiter and Gautier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513482302">7</xref></sup> in 1994, was later followed by von Knoch et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546513482302">37</xref></sup> and is known as the Bereiter procedure. An osteochondral flake with only 2 mm of subchondral bone is elevated from the trochlea without osteotomy of the condyle, and the distal femoral subchondral bone is deepened with osteotomes and a high-speed bur. The same procedure has been performed arthroscopically by Blønd and Schöttle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513482302">9</xref></sup> The fourth procedure is recession wedge trochleoplasty, which was introduced by Goutallier et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513482302">23</xref></sup> in 2002; its results were later published by Beaufils et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513482302">6</xref></sup> In this technique, the trochlea’s shape is not changed, but the removal of a proximally based wedge results in a more posteriorly placed trochlea.</p>
<p>Patellar stability is reported to be restored in a great majority of patients with recurrent patellar dislocations. There is skepticism on the potential complication of trochleoplasty in the late development of osteoarthritis, for which midterm to long-term studies are needed. The purpose of this study was to present the midterm results using the sulcus-deepening trochleoplasty procedure in patients with recurrent patellar dislocations and not with patellofemoral pain alone, due to high-grade trochlear dysplasia, who had not undergone previous surgery. The clinical evaluation results, the amount of radiological correction, and the prevalence of arthritis were recorded.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>This is a retrospective study that included patients treated for recurrent patellar dislocations between September 1993 to September 2006. The study was approved by the ethics committee of our institution. Inclusion criteria for the study were patients with more than 3 documented episodes of patellar dislocation with high-grade trochlear dysplasia type B or D according to the Dejour classification,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513482302">14</xref></sup> no previous patellofemoral surgery, and a pathological lateral patellar glide test using the quadrant test (the patella can be shifted by 3 or more quadrants laterally by the examiner with the patient’s knee placed at full extension). Patients with open growth plates, patellofemoral arthritis, or patellofemoral pain syndrome with no true dislocation were excluded from the study.</p>
<p>Preoperative objective clinical evaluation included the apprehension test, lateral patellar glide test, and patellar tracking. Subjective findings included the presence of patellofemoral pain and/or feeling of instability. Radiological assessment included anteroposterior and true lateral weightbearing radiographs, axial view at 30° of flexion, and computed tomography (CT) using the patellofemoral protocol evaluation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513482302">30</xref></sup> Trochlear dysplasia was graded using the Dejour classification, and sulcus angle, lateral patellar tilt (without quadriceps contraction), tibial tuberosity–trochlear groove (TT-TG) distance, and patellar height (according to the Caton-Deschamps index<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513482302">11</xref></sup>) were measured on CT scans.</p>
<p>Patients with recurrent patellar dislocations and trochlear dysplasia were treated according to the presence of concomitant predisposing anatomic abnormalities, and trochleoplasty was combined with other procedures when needed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513482302">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513482302">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513482302">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513482302">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513482302">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546513482302">31</xref></sup> If the TT-TG distance was greater than 20 mm, tibial tuberosity medialization osteotomy was performed to obtain a TT-TG distance between 10 and 15 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513482302">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513482302">18</xref></sup>; if patella alta was recorded (Caton-Deschamps index &gt;1.2), distalization osteotomy was performed to obtain a normal patellar index of 1.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513482302">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513482302">18</xref></sup>; if the lateral patellar tilt was greater than 20°, a correction was performed with vastus medialis obliquus (VMO) plasty or reconstruction of the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) using a double-looped gracilis tendon graft.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513482302">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513482302">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513482302">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513482302">30</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Sulcus-deepening trochleoplasty was performed with the same surgical technique in all patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513482302">16</xref></sup> (see Video Supplement for details). The principle was to remove subchondral cancellous bone under the trochlea with a high-speed bur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546513482302">Figure 1</xref>). The amount of bone removal was determined by having a new trochlear groove flush with the anterior femoral cortex and by making the prominence disappear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546513482302">Figure 2</xref>). The trochlea was osteotomized with a scalpel carefully over the position of the desired new groove. The new trochlear groove was positioned according to the preoperative TT-TG value in a more lateral position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546513482302">Figure 3</xref>). The trochlear facets were fixed with 2 “custom-made” metallic staples of 1-mm diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546513482302">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<p>All patients followed the same rehabilitation protocol. This “fast-track” rehabilitation protocol included immediate postoperative care with full weightbearing with the use of crutches in an extension knee brace. Patients started continuous passive motion between 0° and 100° immediately and isometric quadriceps and hamstring strengthening up to 45 days postoperatively. After 45 days, the brace and crutches were removed, and closed chain and weightbearing proprioception exercises were the basic rehabilitation therapy up to the 90th day postoperatively. After 3 months, the patient was encouraged to pursue a gradually more active rehabilitation that involved running and single training in the sport of preference. Return to sport activities was allowed at 6 months postoperatively.</p>
<p>Postoperative clinical evaluation was performed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and at the last follow-up. It included clinical and radiological examination (same preoperative protocol of radiography and CT), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513482302">24</xref></sup> and Kujala<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546513482302">25</xref></sup> scores, and level of activity at final follow-up. At final evaluation, patients were also asked on their overall satisfaction with the surgery.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Twenty-seven patients (31 knees) were retrospectively included. Mean age was 21 ± 7.9 years (range, 14-47 years) at the time of surgery, with a female-to-male ratio of 0.93 (13 women, 14 men). Mean follow-up was 7 years (range, 2-9 years), and no patient was lost to follow-up. Forty-four percent (n = 12) had a positive familiar history of recurrent patellar dislocations, and 14.8% (n = 4) had bilateral surgery. Patients’ preoperative symptoms and clinical signs were lateral patellar dislocation (100%, n = 31), patellofemoral pain (6.4%, n = 2), positive apprehension sign (96.7%, n = 30), and abnormal patellar tracking during active or passive motion (54.8%, n = 17). Trochlear cartilage status (International Cartilage Repair Society) at the time of surgery was 67.7% normal (n = 21), 6.4% grade I (n = 2), 16.2% grade II (n = 5), 3.2% grade III (n = 1), and 6.5% grade IV (n = 2) and for the patella was 25.8% normal (n = 8), 0% grade I, 19.2% grade II (n = 6), 22.5% grade III (n = 7), and 32.5% grade IV (n = 10). Trochleoplasty was combined with an additional procedure in all cases: MPFL reconstruction in 16.1% (n = 5), VMO plasty in 83.8% (n = 26), tibial tuberosity distalization in 51.6% (n = 16), tibial tuberosity medialization in 67.7% (n = 21), and lateral release in 67.6% (n = 21).</p>
<p>The mean sulcus angle decreased significantly (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) from 152° ± 16° preoperatively to 141° ± 9° postoperatively, and the mean TT-TG distance decreased significantly (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) from 19 ± 4 mm to 12 ± 5 mm. The TT-TG distance in patients who had no additional tuberosity procedure decreased from 18.5 mm (range, 12-24 mm) to 13.2 mm (range, 6-22 mm) from the trochleoplasty. On the other hand, patients who underwent additional distalization and/or medialization osteotomy of the tuberosity to the trochleoplasty had a decrease in mean TT-TG distance from 23.0 mm (range, 20-26 mm) to 12.2 mm (range, 6-24 mm) postoperatively. Mean patellar tilt decreased significantly for the whole study population (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) from 37° ± 7° to 15° ± 8° (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546513482302">Table 1</xref>). Mean patellar tilt in patients with trochleoplasty and tuberosity realignment decreased from 38.5° ± 7.4° to 23.5° ± 7.9° (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Mean patellar tilt in patients with only trochleoplasty and no tuberosity realignment decreased from 36.6° ± 7.5° to 11.6° ± 5.9° (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Mean patellar height in patients with tuberosity realignment decreased, according to the Caton-Deschamps index, from 1.14 ± 0.17 to 0.98 ± 0.14 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Mean patellar height in patients with trochleoplasty and no tuberosity realignment decreased from 1.03 ± 0.11 to 0.96 ± 0.14 (<italic>P</italic> = .28).</p>

<p>At the last follow-up, there was no recurrence of patellar dislocations, the apprehension sign remained positive in 19.3% of the cases (n = 6), patellar tracking was normal in all cases (n = 31), and the lateral patellar glide test finding was negative in 96.8% (n = 30) (&lt;1 quadrant in 70% [n = 22 knees], and &lt;2 quadrants in 26.8% [n = 8 knees]) and positive (patellar hypermobility) in 3.2% but with no patellar dislocation (1 patient who reported being “satisfied” with the surgery).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study was designed to evaluate the results of sulcus-deepening trochleoplasty on recurrent patellar dislocations with high-grade trochlear dysplasia. We found that the effect on patellofemoral stability was satisfying with no recurrence of dislocations, the objective radiological results showed significant correction of the 4 instability factors, and there were no signs of patellofemoral arthritis at midterm follow-up.</p>
<p>The rationale of sulcus-deepening trochleoplasty has 3 key elements: First, in cases of a flat or a convex trochlea, trochleoplasty tries to convert it to a more anatomic and concave geometry by deepening the proximal sulcus, so that it engages the patella in early degrees of knee flexion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513482302">16</xref></sup> Second, in cases of a convex trochlea, trochleoplasty removes the sulcus prominence that the patella needs to override during flexion and that leads to patellar dislocations over the lateral facet. Last, trochleoplasty creates a new trochlear groove in a more lateral position than the dysplastic one, thus decreasing the excessive TT-TG distance and serving as a “proximal realignment procedure.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513482302">16</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The biomechanical effects of sulcus-deepening trochleoplasty have been studied by Amis et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513482302">2</xref></sup> who reported that the mediolateral flattening of the anterior surface of the trochlear facets results predominantly from an excess of bone centrally in the groove. This can also form a supratrochlear prominence or “bump” anterior to the femoral shaft; during knee flexion, the patella has to override this prominence. The authors showed that “simulated” trochlear dysplasia led to a significant reduction in lateral stability, and by re-creating a deep trochlear groove with a trochleoplasty procedure, lateral stability increased significantly similarly to the intact knee.</p>
<p>Fucentese et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513482302">22</xref></sup> reported the results from 44 Bereiter trochleoplasties after an average of 4 years. The mean Kujala score improved from 68 to 90 points (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), and instability (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and pain (<italic>P</italic> = .027) decreased significantly with no major complications, such as chondrolysis or subchondral necrosis, except for deterioration of the cartilage on the lateral trochlear facet. Donell et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513482302">19</xref></sup> reported data after performing sulcus-deepening osteotomy in 17 cases after an average of 1 year. Eleven cases had normal patellar tracking postoperatively, and the Kujala score improved from a mean of 48 to 75 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05), but 8 patients required a new procedure (ie, arthrolysis). Verdonk et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546513482302">36</xref></sup> reported the results of 14 cases of sulcus-deepening trochleoplasty after a mean follow-up of 18 months. In that study, patients were assessed using the Larsen-Lauridsen score on pain, stiffness, crepitus, and loss of function. Seven scored poorly, 3 scored fairly well, and 4 scored well. On a subjective scoring system, 77% of patients found the procedure satisfactory: 6 patients rated the result as very good, 4 as good, and 1 as satisfactory, with only 2 patients rating the result as inadequate. All these authors conclude that sulcus-deepening trochleoplasty requires a careful attention to detail.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546513482302">36</xref></sup> It is a technically demanding procedure that addresses a rare condition, with satisfactory results and an acceptable level of complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513482302">19</xref></sup> Sulcus-deepening trochleoplasty is more suitable for severe cases of dysplasia type B and D in which the presence of a trochlear prominence is amenable to correction with this technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513482302">21</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Evaluation of the results after trochleoplasty presents certain difficulties. There is no agreement as to whether satisfactory long-term results can by defined by the correction of imaging findings, the correction of pathological mediolateral patellar laxity, or the absence of the patient’s preoperative subjective feeling of instability, pain, or lack of apprehension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513482302">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513482302">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546513482302">36</xref></sup> Certainly, the latter is the optimal goal of any procedure for patellofemoral instability, but authors offer different functional scores with varying results after measuring postoperative satisfaction in the same population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513482302">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546513482302">36</xref></sup> Yet, most important, selecting the right candidate for trochleoplasty has been controversial because authors set different clinical (pain, instability, or both) or radiological inclusion criteria (type of dysplasia, height of prominence) for performing such a procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513482302">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513482302">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513482302">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546513482302">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546513482302"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546513482302"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546513482302">37</xref></sup> Furthermore, trochleoplasty procedures are often performed with different surgical techniques with various rehabilitation protocols, which make the comparison of their results challenging. Last, evaluating the efficacy of trochleoplasty as a single procedure is very difficult to do in a patient population that usually presents concomitant anomalies that need associated correction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0363546513482302">‖</xref></sup></p>
<p>The results of this study were satisfactory because there was no recurrence of patellar dislocations. The IKDC score improved significantly, and there was only 1 case with a positive lateral glide test result without patellar dislocation. Other authors report equally successful results from 90% to 100%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513482302">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513482302">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546513482302">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546513482302"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546513482302"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546513482302">37</xref></sup> All radiographic findings were significantly corrected postoperatively, in particular the lateral patellar tilt. This can be attributed to both the trochleoplasty, with the restoration of a congruent patellofemoral joint, and the concomitant soft tissue procedures. Another interesting finding was the significant decrease of the TT-TG distance. This can be helpful in eliminating the need for an additional procedure (medial transfer of the tuberosity) because the groove position could be lateralized while performing the trochleoplasty, similar to a proximal realignment procedure. The effect of trochleoplasty alone in reducing the TT-TG distance without any additional tibial tuberosity surgery was on average 5 mm. At the beginning of the surgeons’ learning curve, the trochlear groove’s position was not changed, and medialization tuberosity osteotomy was performed more commonly in patients when the TT-TG distance was increased. However, with the improvement of the trochleoplasty technique, tuberosity osteotomy was performed less often because the new trochlear groove was more efficiently lateralized by trochleoplasty, according to the preoperative TT-TG value.</p>
<p>Trochleoplasty procedures are not void of surgery-specific complications. Early concerns on postoperative cartilage viability have been studied by Schöttle et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546513482302">32</xref></sup> who recorded normal subchondral bone, viable cartilage cells, bone flap healing, and minimal risk for cartilage deterioration after Bereiter trochleoplasty, where a thin 2-mm cartilage flap was impacted on the groove. Overcorrection or undercorrection of normal trochlear geometry and the relationship between the new trochlea and the patella are another concern. This is difficult to verify because authors use different imaging parameters for postoperative comparison. Fucentese et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513482302">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513482302">22</xref></sup> showed a significant decrease of the TT-TG distance, patellar tilt, and lateral translation, while von Knoch et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546513482302">37</xref></sup> showed correction of the crossing sign, changes in the trochlear depth, and a bump. Donell et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513482302">19</xref></sup> also recorded a significant reduction to normal values of the height of the prominence, TT-TG distance, and patellar tilt without measuring the sulcus angle, which they considered inaccurate for estimating trochlear dysplasia. In our study, there was a significant decrease of the sulcus angle, TT-TG distance, and lateral tilt. The clinical importance of such changes in radiographic findings is difficult to evaluate because of the multifactorial nature of patellar instability. Yet, the persistence of instability and the need for reoperation after trochleoplasty procedures are rarely recorded,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513482302">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546513482302">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546513482302">37</xref></sup> and when they are present, authors attribute it to other untreated pathological lesions, that is, MPFL deficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513482302">22</xref></sup> Similarly, in this study, there was no case of postoperative patellar instability.</p>
<p>Postoperative stiffness is a potential complication after any knee surgery, and the conflicting results of its occurrence by Verdonk et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546513482302">36</xref></sup> (46%) and Donell et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513482302">19</xref></sup> (33%) to its complete absence in the long-term study of von Knoch et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546513482302">37</xref></sup> prevent safe conclusions. In this study, there was no case of postoperative stiffness. Similarly, reports of postoperative pain associated with trochleoplasty procedures vary among authors, and it is difficult to compare, especially in the case of patients treated for patellar pain rather than dislocations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513482302">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546513482302">36</xref></sup> In a midterm and long-term evaluation, von Knoch et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546513482302">37</xref></sup> with an 8-year follow-up recorded a 49% rate in improvement of pain and a 33% rate in increase of pain. Fucentese et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513482302">22</xref></sup> with 4 years’ follow-up reported an increase of pain in 7% of their cases. In the present study, patients were treated with trochleoplasty for patellar dislocations and never for patellofemoral pain alone: postoperatively, 75% reported a decrease in pain, and 25% reported that their symptoms remained unchanged or increased. The unpredictability of postoperative pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513482302">22</xref></sup> and its potential association with severe cartilage lesions on both femoral and patellar sides before surgery have been suggested as factors of postoperative pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513482302">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513482302">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546513482302">35</xref></sup> The differences observed in postoperative stiffness and pain may be attributed to different surgical techniques among authors, different rehabilitation protocols after trochleoplasty, and different indications for trochleoplasty (pain vs dislocation, and also mixed group of patients who had previous surgeries or not, and only patients with no previous surgery, as in the present study).</p>
<p>The most concerning, although potential, complication of trochleoplasty procedures is the late development of osteoarthritis. Recurrent patellar dislocations can lead to degenerative changes if left untreated,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513482302">26</xref></sup> and trochlear dysplasia can accelerate osteoarthritis as well,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513482302">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513482302">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546513482302">37</xref></sup> but the role of corrective surgeries in the development of arthritis is poorly known.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546513482302">33</xref></sup> On one hand, trochlear dysplasia can predispose to patellofemoral arthritis, and on the other hand, trochleoplasty can be an additional factor for arthritis as with any other corrective surgery for patellar dislocations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513482302">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513482302">26</xref></sup> An additional difficulty in estimating the risks of arthritis from trochleoplasty is the presence of severe cartilage lesions before surgery. The only available long-term data show the presence of arthritic findings in 30% of patients after 8 years of trochleoplasty, but von Knoch et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546513482302">37</xref></sup> reported the presence of such degeneration in most of the cases at the time of surgery and attributed it to previous patellar dislocations. In the present study, there were no cases of postoperative patellofemoral arthritis at the last follow-up in axial radiographs, even for the cases with cartilage damage on the patellar side at the time of surgery. Most of these cartilage lesions were unipolar and were located on the patellar side probably because it impinges during each knee flexion and dislocation of the patella, while the trochlear side is most of the time unloaded with normal cartilage. A difference between morphological characteristics of the patella and the groove in patients with trochlear dysplasia has been previously reported in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513482302">21</xref></sup> The absence of patellofemoral arthritis could be attributed to the relative young age (mean, 21 years) of the patients of the study and the fact that degenerative changes had not been established at the time of trochleoplasty.</p>
<p>The novelties of the present study can be found in the presentation of the results of this procedure, which are rarely recorded in the literature, where the indications were patellar dislocations and not patellofemoral pain alone, the application of this procedure only in patients without any previous patellofemoral surgery, and the documentation of the postoperative changes on different and additional imaging modalities. Similar to previous studies, one limitation of the present study is that determining the effect of sulcus-deepening trochleoplasty is difficult when it is always combined with other procedures. The effects of trochleoplasty on the TT-TG distance, patellar height and tilt, and patellar tracking are almost impossible to define when trochleoplasty is combined with lateral retinaculum release, MPFL reconstruction, and tuberosity osteotomy. This would require a comparison between different patient groups, with one having undergone trochleoplasty for patellar dislocations and the other having undergone tuberosity osteotomy or MPFL reconstruction, which is difficult to apply, because trochleoplasty is never indicated as a sole procedure. Fixation of the reshaped trochlear groove with metallic staples caused skepticism for its potential future effects, and this technique has been currently changed to absorbable sutures. Another alteration of the technique over this long period involves the replacement of all medial soft tissue augmentation procedures by MPFL reconstruction, which is a supplement to trochleoplasty in every case. Other study limitations are that the preoperative cartilage lesions were evaluated macroscopically during surgery, while the postoperative presence of arthritis was retrospectively evaluated in axial radiographs. We did not perform postoperative second-look arthroscopic surgery, CT arthrography, or magnetic resonance imaging. Patellofemoral arthritis was not present on radiographs, but the extent of exact cartilage damage is unknown to the authors. Other limitations include the assessment of preoperative and postoperative pain based on patients’ responses and not on a visual analog scale.</p>
<p>In conclusion, sulcus-deepening trochleoplasty remains a technically demanding and difficult procedure, but it is a valid option for the primary surgical treatment of carefully selected patients with recurrent patellar dislocations and high-grade trochlear dysplasia type B or D. Concomitant etiological factors must be cautiously assessed and corrected. Combination of the procedure with soft tissue surgery, such as MPFL reconstruction, is necessary to achieve patellar stability throughout the whole range of knee motion. The effects of such procedures are difficult to compare, and there is a need for agreement on the choice of the right candidate for trochleoplasty, the surgical technique, the rehabilitation protocol, and the parameters that are expected to be corrected postoperatively. Midterm follow-up showed satisfactory restoration of patellar stability and knee scores and good to excellent patient satisfaction with no major complications of subsequent arthritis or deterioration of patellofemoral function.</p>
