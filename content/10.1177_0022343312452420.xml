<abstract>
<p>This article explores the empirical determinants of state fragility in sub-Saharan Africa over the 1992–2007 period. Our dataset includes those sub-Saharan countries for which we have information on the distribution by quintiles of the World Bank Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) ratings. We evaluate the potential influence on fragility of a wide range of economic, institutional, and historical variables. Among economic factors, we consider per-capita GDP, both in levels and growth rates, investment, natural resources, and schooling. We also consider economic policy variables such as government expenditures, trade openness, and inflation. Demographic forces are accounted for through the fertility rate, life expectancy, and the youth bulge. Institutional factors are captured by measures of ethnic fractionalization, civil liberties, revolutions, and conflicts, as well as governance indicators. Moreover, we select historical variables that reflect the colonial experience of the region, namely the national identity of the colonizers and the political status during the colonial period. Finally, we account for geographic factors such as latitude, access to sea, and the presence of fragile neighbors. Our central findings is that institutions are the main determinants of fragility: even after controlling for reverse causality and omitted variable bias, the probability for a country to be fragile increases with restrictions of civil liberties and with the number of revolutions. Before controlling for endogeneity, economic factors such as per-capita GDP growth and investment show some explanatory power, but economic prosperity displays a contradictory net impact since growth reduces fragility while investment facilitates it. Moreover, instrumental variables estimates show that per-capita GDP growth is no longer a significant factor. Colonial variables display a marginal residual influence: after controlling for all other factors former colonies are actually associated with a lower probability of being fragile.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The concept of state fragility (from now on, fragility) has recently reached center stage in the debate on economic development, and in particular on the growth prospects of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The concept of fragility has been associated with various combinations of the following dysfunctions: inability to provide basic services and meet vital needs, unstable and weak governance, a persistent condition of extreme poverty, lack of territorial control, and high propensity to conflict and civil war. The crucial relevance of fragility for SSA countries is motivated by the fact that they are overrepresented among fragile states, as shown by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022343312452420">European Report on Development (2009)</xref>, which is entirely devoted to the problem of fragility in Africa. Likewise, the Global Report 2009, prepared by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022343312452420">Marshall &amp; Cole (2009)</xref> within the Polity IV Project, underscores the continuing malaise affecting the area. Moreover, since the condition of fragility may jeopardize aid flows, the poorest countries of the region run the risk of being excluded from international intervention.</p>
<p>Several studies have examined the influence of the condition of fragility on development, either through its direct impact on income and growth, or indirectly through aid allocation. The purpose of the present article is instead to investigate the potential determinants of fragility, taking into account the complex pattern of interrelationships among a wide range of factors. We focus our attention on SSA, for several reasons. The first reason is that, as previously explained, this issue is particularly important for policy intervention in this region. The second reason is that fragility has proven such a multifaceted issue that by concentrating on a specific area we can reach more meaningful conclusions and more useful policy implications. Indeed, by restricting the attention to SSA, we can highlight its specific economic, social, geographic, and political characteristics, which are sufficiently heterogeneous despite a common history of colonization, ethnic conflict, natural resources abundance, and other factors that may trigger fragility.</p>
<p>In selecting our measure of fragility, that is, our dependent variable, we refer to the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) ratings prepared annually by the World Bank (WB). According to the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC), fragile states are defined as those countries in the bottom two CPIA quintiles (as well as those which are not rated). Since CPIA ratings are publicly available only since 2005, in our empirical investigation we employ information on their distribution by quintiles compiled by the OECD-DAC, which has been available since 1999.</p>
<p>The variables which we include in our investigation as regressors, since they are potentially relevant for Africa’s economic and institutional performance, and therefore also for fragility in the region, are chosen among those which have been found relevant within the empirical literature on growth and institutional development. Moreover, in selecting our covariates we also take into account the insights coming from non-quantitative studies in the fields of political sciences and applied development. On the basis of these contributions, we develop a conceptual framework that justifies our selection of the following three sets of determinants. The first set includes economic variables: namely, measures of the level of development and economic activity, policy-related variables, and demographic factors. The second set of variables captures the quality of institutions, that is, of a potentially very large set of non-economic or demographic factors that we try to capture with measures of repression, conflict, acute political instability leading to revolutions, and ethnic fragmentation. We also explore the explanatory power of the peculiar history of the region, which has been marked by the colonization experience. Therefore, we also select a third set of variables that reflects the history of African colonization. Most of the variables are taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022343312452420">Bertocchi &amp; Canova (2002)</xref>, who assemble a dataset for Africa in order to investigate the role of colonization within a growth regressions approach drawing on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022343312452420">Barro (1991)</xref>.</p>
<p>Our results can be summarized as follows. Over the 1992–2007 period, institutions are the key determinants of fragility: the probability for a country to be fragile increases with restrictions of civil liberties and with the number of revolutions. At first glance, economic determinants such as per-capita GDP growth and investment show some explanatory power, but economic prosperity displays a contradictory net impact, since growth reduces fragility while investment facilitates it. Moreover, the former loses significance once we control for endogeneity. Economic policies and demographics are insignificant, and so are natural resources, despite their central role within the debate on development in SSA. Other institutional variables such as conflicts and ethnic fractionalization display some non-robust significance, depending on the chosen specification. Finally, we find only a mild residual impact of colonial variables.</p>
<p>The rest of the article is organized as follows. We first present the related literature. Second, we develop a conceptual framework that highlights the potential determinants of fragility and generates testable implications. Third, we detail our definition of fragility and describe our dataset. Fourth, we present our empirical findings. Finally we conclude and suggest directions for future research.</p>

<sec id="section2-0022343312452420">
<title>Related literature</title>
<p>Within the literature on international relations and development, there are very few studies that focus on the determinants of fragility. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022343312452420">Vallings &amp; Moreno-Torres (2005)</xref> present a discussion of the main issues and argue that institutions are the central drivers of fragility, since any other factor commonly associated with fragility is itself linked to weak institutions. For instance, while poverty is certainly associated with fragility, not all poor areas turn out to be fragile, since fragility occurs only when poverty is combined with the presence of a weak state that cannot manage effectively the causes and consequences of poverty itself. On the other hand, the empirical study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022343312452420">Carment, Samy &amp; Prest (2008)</xref> over a cross-sectional sample of world countries finds that per-capita income is the main driver of fragility, with higher income being associated with lower fragility. These contradictory conclusions emerging from the literature are one of the motivations for the present investigation.</p>
<p>Our work is also related to several streams of research within the economic literature. First, while our focus is to investigate the determinants of fragility, a number of authors have tried to identify the effect of fragility on economic outcomes. In a growth regression framework, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022343312452420">Bertocchi &amp; Guerzoni (2011)</xref> find that for SSA a conventional definition of fragility is not a significant covariate once standard regressors are accounted for, while only an extreme measure of fragility exerts a detrimental effect on growth. For a comparable sample, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022343312452420">Baliamoune-Lutz (2009)</xref> shows that the impact of fragility on per-capita income interacts with several other factors: in fragile countries, beyond a threshold level trade openness may actually be harmful to income, while small improvements in political institutions can have adverse effects. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022343312452420">Burnside &amp; Dollar (2000)</xref> provide evidence that aid is most effective in developing countries with sound institutions and policies, even if this conclusion is challenged by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022343312452420">Hansen &amp; Tarp (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022343312452420">Dalgaard, Hansen &amp; Tarp (2004)</xref>, among others. For a world sample of fragile countries, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022343312452420">McGillivray &amp; Feeny (2008)</xref> find that, while growth would have been slower in the absence of aid, at the same time these countries can only efficiently absorb a fraction of the aid flows. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022343312452420">Chauvet &amp; Collier (2008)</xref> analyze the preconditions for sustained policy turnarounds in failing states and show that financial aid can prolong state failure, while aid through technical assistance can shorten it. Overall, a clear impact of fragility on economic outcomes has proved hard to assess. One possible explanation for the absence of a clear causal link running from fragility to economic development is the endogeneity of fragility, or else the presence of a common third factor that determines both outcomes. In our investigation, we explicitly take into account this potential endogeneity.</p>
<p>A broader stream of research has tried to uncover the economic and non-economic determinants of a wide range of institutions. The connection with this literature comes from the fact that in the definition of fragility, institutions play a crucial role. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022343312452420">North (1981)</xref> has become the standard reference for the idea that institutions shape economic outcomes and are in turn affected by them. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022343312452420">Engerman &amp; Sokoloff (1997)</xref> show how factor endowments shape economic and political institutions through history. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022343312452420">Acemoglu, Johnson &amp; Robinson (2004)</xref> distinguish between economic and political institutions, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022343312452420">Acemoglu &amp; Johnson (2005)</xref> unbundle the relative importance of property-rights vs. contracting institutions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022343312452420">1</xref>
</sup> Our work acknowledges the potential relevance of different kinds of institutions.</p>
<p>Finally, our contribution is indebted to the research line on colonial influence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022343312452420">La Porta et al. (1998)</xref> have focused on the legal systems inherited by the colonies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022343312452420">Bertocchi &amp; Canova (2002)</xref> on the nationality of the colonizers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022343312452420">Hall &amp; Jones (1999)</xref> on the extent to which the colonizers’ languages are spoken today. Together with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022343312452420">Landes (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022343312452420">North, Summerhill &amp; Weingast (2000)</xref>, these contributions tend to agree on the conclusion that former British colonies inherited better institutions than the former colonies of France, Spain, and Portugal.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022343312452420">2</xref>
</sup> Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022343312452420">Acemoglu, Johnson &amp; Robinson (2001)</xref> develop a theory of institutional development which emphasizes the environmental conditions in the colonies, and in particular settler mortality (employed as an instrument for current institutions). Our investigation builds on these earlier contributions.</p>

<title>The determinants of fragility</title>
<p>While a theory of the determinants of fragility has not yet been developed, in this section we summarize the main explanations of its emergence which have been advanced within a widely interdisciplinary, often non-quantitative literature. Our main goal is to extract a set of hypotheses that can guide our empirical investigation, generate testable implications, and offer an interpretation of the resulting evidence.</p>
<p>An early approach to the analysis of fragility, pioneered by international organizations such as the WB and the OECD, linked it to the level of development. Within this policy-oriented debate, standard measures of economic success, such as income and growth, were evaluated together with indicators of the quality of government intervention in the realms of fiscal, monetary, and trade policy. More recently, public policies focused on human capital, both in terms of health and education, were also added to this list. As discussed at length in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022343312452420">Carment, Prest &amp; Samy (2009)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022343312452420">Collier &amp; O’Connell (2007)</xref>, and in extended literature summarized in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022343312452420">European Report on Development (2009)</xref>, over time the perception that economic progress and sound policies can guarantee a state’s strength has been shaken. It has been acknowledged that, especially in SSA, the beneficial influence of economic factors is by no means mechanical, since relatively wealthy societies have often been plagued by corruption and predation activities that have generated instability and dysfunctions, and thus lead to fragility. The availability of natural resources can also play a counterproductive role, since it can lead to the well-known curse, especially when associated with high level of societal stratification and/or demographic pressure.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022343312452420">3</xref>
</sup> In such situations, even commitment to economic reform can bring about, perversely, turbulence and instability. Thus, the lesson to be learnt from the approach that has stressed economic explanations of fragility is that the beneficial effect of positive economic outcomes is not necessarily warranted, which calls for careful analysis of the channels at work.</p>
<p>A parallel approach has focused on the consequences of institutional instability and conflict for a state legitimacy and strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022343312452420">Collier et al., 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022343312452420">Ndulu et al. (2007)</xref> explore the political economy of Africa in the post-war period and examine several possible kinds of instability-inducing conditions. Internal conflicts are often linked to ethnic and/or political struggle and can lead to repression, human rights limitation, violence, and sudden changes in regimes. External conflicts are conducive to wars, border instability, and refugee flows. Paradoxically, conflicts can be particularly disruptive when there is more wealth to be appropriated by competing entities and/or when demographic pressure is particularly intense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022343312452420">Collier &amp; Hoeffler, 1998</xref>), so that complex interactions between economic and non-economic factors are often present and the impact on fragility of economic factors may change as institutional factors do. For instance, high income growth and/or investment activity may reduce fragility under good institutions but increase it under bad ones. Even institutions per se may have a non-linear impact. For example, the impact of civil liberties on fragility is <italic>a priori</italic> ambiguous: while on the one hand autocracies intrinsically feed fragility, on the other at least in principle very liberal democracies may also prove to be vulnerable to political and economic disorder. Moreover, revolutions and other episodes of acute political unrest are likely to represent a threat to stability, but in principle they could also represent a reaction to dysfunctions and thus a prelude to a new, more stable order.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022343312452420">4</xref>
</sup> The direction of the links between these factors and fragility therefore remains an empirical issue.</p>
<p>More recently, the attention has shifted toward the connection between a state’s colonial history and its current fragility. This theme has been especially relevant for Africa. Historically, nowhere else was colonization so far-reaching as in the African experience that began at the end of the 19th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022343312452420">Bertocchi &amp; Canova, 2002</xref>). Indeed there is a shared perception that fragility, as well as other related dysfunctions such as corruption and ethnic conflict, might find its roots in the legacy of colonization: the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022343312452420">European Development Report (2009)</xref> illustrates the central role of colonization for state formation in this region, by stressing its artificial character following decolonization, the extractive nature of colonial domination, the political and economic dependence from the metropolitan power, and the exacerbation of ethnic fragmentation. The Polity IV Project also has studied the importance of bearing a colonial past for fragility. However, the hypothesis that fragility is determined by colonial history has not yet been tested econometrically.</p>
<p>While the above contributions are mostly based on informal reasoning, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022343312452420">Besley &amp; Persson (2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022343312452420">2010</xref>) formalize a model of state capacity, a concept which largely overlaps with that of fragility. Indeed their goal is to provide a unifying framework for thinking about a range of issues that are common to our previous discussion, such as the risk of external or internal conflict, the degree of political instability, and economic dependence on natural resources. Through a set of propositions and extensions, they identify a number of key causal links. They argue that state capacity increases with the general level of development and wealth, while it decreases with policy distortions and the proportion of national income generated by natural resources. It also increases with the demand for public goods, which in turn can be induced by different factors such as welfare expenses and external threats. State capacity is reinforced by political stability and weakened by conflict and ethnic tension. The model also predicts that reverse causation can affect the above channels, thus leaving to the empirics a final answer.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022343312452420">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Based on the above considerations, we can operationalize our empirical strategy as follows. We explore the empirical determinants of fragility in SSA by selecting a large number of variables that reflect the literature described above. We select three sets of variables that we respectively label as economic, institutional, and colonial. Our economic variables can in turn be classified according to three subsets. First, we identify standard measures of development and economic activity: namely, the level of per-capita income, its growth rate, private investment, a measure of natural resources, and investment in human capital through schooling. Second, we introduce measures of the quality of policies, such as trade openness, the rate of inflation, and the size of government. Third, we capture demographic considerations with life expectancy, the fertility rate, and the youth bulge.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022343312452420">6</xref>
</sup> Our institutional variables include common measures of civil rights repression, sudden regime change associated with revolutions, armed conflict and ethnic fragmentation, which should proxy for the complexity of the institutional environment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022343312452420">7</xref>
</sup> Among colonial variables, which capture the specific history of Africa, we select the political status of the countries involved and the national identity of the colonizer. Operationally, based on the previous discussion it is reasonable to expect fragility to be more likely whenever economic performances and institutional quality are worse, as well as in association with a colonial past. Taking into account the warnings previously mentioned, we also investigate the possible interactions among the above covariates, as well as their potential endogeneity and codetermination. Our choice of a large number of regressors should minimize the omitted variable bias which is typical in comparable investigations. The potential two-way relationship between fragility and some of the regressors is directly addressed by means of instrumental variables estimation. More details on the definition and sources of all the variables are provided in the next section, which describes our dataset.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0022343312452420">
<title>Data</title>
<p>The concept of fragility is an elusive one. Failure, vulnerability, and weakness have often been used as synonymous of fragility, by the Fund for Peace, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Brookings Institution, respectively. Fragility itself has been defined in several different manners by various international organizations. For example, the United Kingdom Department for International Development (DfID) defines as fragile those states where the government cannot or will not deliver core functions to its people. The fact that multiple definitions of fragility have been proposed stems from its intrinsic multi-dimensional nature, which has been acknowledged both in academic and policy-oriented work.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022343312452420">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Since one of our goals is to generate useful directions for policy, for our empirical investigation we select a definition of fragility which is particularly relevant for policy, because of its direct influence on the concessional lending and grants assigned by the WB through the International Development Association (IDA).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022343312452420">9</xref>
</sup> According to the WB, fragile states are defined as low-income countries scoring 3.2 and below (over a 1–6 range) on the CPIA ratings. The OECD-DAC defines as fragile states those countries in the bottom two CPIA quintiles, as well as those which are not rated.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022343312452420">10</xref>
</sup> Since CPIA ratings have been publicly available only since 2005, for the purposes of our empirical investigation we use the OECD-DAC information about the distribution of the IDA member countries by CPIA quintiles, which is available from 1999 until 2007.</p>
<p>CPIA ratings are prepared annually by WB staff and are intended to capture the quality of a country’s policies and institutional arrangements, with a focus on the key elements that are within the country’s control, rather than on outcomes (such as growth rates) that are influenced by elements outside the country’s control. Scores are assigned on the basis of 16 criteria (20 until 2003) which are grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments based on country knowledge, originated in the WB or elsewhere, and on relevant publicly available indicators.</p>
<p>For our purposes, to refer to the CPIA ratings offers three advantages. First, the ratings have a crucial practical relevance, since as previously mentioned they significantly influence aid allocation according to a specific formula. Second, information on their distribution by quintiles is now available for a relatively extended time period (1999–2007). Third, because of their design, they do not reflect mechanically any of the variables we employ as regressors, so that they can safely be employed to define our dependent variable.</p>
<p>Despite the above considerations, it should be pointed out that the CPIA ratings are not free of criticism. Doubts have been cast by various parties about both the methodology of the assessments and the confidence with which they should be used as a basis for aid allocation. A common criticism is that they implicitly rely on a uniform model of what matters in development (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022343312452420">Kanbur, 2005</xref>). Another is that transparency and accountability could be addressed more accurately. It has also been argued that lack of reliable information may prevent objective assessments by WB staff. The WB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022343312452420">Independent Evaluation Group (2010)</xref> has recently reviewed the ratings and proposed recommendations for revision.</p>
<p>We construct a dataset including those 41 sub-Saharan countries for which we have information on the CPIA ratings distribution by quintiles. For these countries, we define a fragility dummy variable, which takes the value 1 if a country belongs to the bottom two CPIA quintiles or if it is not rated, 0 otherwise.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0022343312452420">11</xref>
</sup> The variables which we include as regressors are the following.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0022343312452420">12</xref>
</sup> Among economic factors, we consider per-capita GDP, both in levels and growth rates, and investment. We proxy for natural resources with diamond deposits.<sup>

</sup> Human capital is measured with primary school enrollment. Among policy variables we consider government expenditures, trade openness, and inflation. To account for demographic pressure, we select the fertility rate, controlling at the same time for life expectancy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0022343312452420">14</xref>
</sup> We also include the proportion of males aged 14 to 24 over population as a proxy for the youth bulge. To gauge the explanatory power of conflict and institutions, we include the following variables: the index of ethnic fractionalization first introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022343312452420">Easterly &amp; Levine (1997)</xref>, the Freedom House index of civil liberties, the number of revolutions,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0022343312452420">15</xref>
</sup> and the number of years under an armed conflict.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0022343312452420">16</xref>
</sup> Even though these variables can only be viewed as proxies of the complex institutional environment, they do capture potentially different facets of the institutional environment since, for instance, not all conflicts, even merely internal ones, involve revolutions. The former are often long-lasting, chronic experiences, while the latter reflect acute episodes. Furthermore, a revolution may occur at different levels of civil liberties. We also consider alternatives such as the index of political rights and three of the Worldwide Governance Indicators, namely government effectiveness, rule of law, and voice and accountability. Next, we select our controls for colonial history as a set of dummies for the identity of the colonizers, that is, Britain, France, and Portugal, respectively, and a dummy capturing the political status during the colonial period.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0022343312452420">17</xref>
</sup> Finally, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022343312452420">Sachs &amp; Warner (1997)</xref>, our investigation also accounts for the potential role of geography,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0022343312452420">18</xref>
</sup> as captured by latitude (as a proxy for climate, and hence productivity, disease, etc.), access to sea, and information about the occurrence of fragility in neighboring countries.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0022343312452420">19</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>For the empirical investigation, the available data are organized as a panel that covers the 1992–2007 period and is composed of two cross-sections, over 1992–99 and 2000–07. The dependent variable is the fragility dummy in 1999 and 2007, that is, in the final year of each cross-section. For those regressors for which we have yearly information we consider their average value in 1992–99 and 2000–07.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0022343312452420">20</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>This approach is meant to maximize the length of the period of observation, given the limited range of the information on fragility. By organizing the available data in this way, we are able to extend the investigation back to 1992, even though information on fragility is only available from 1999. Moreover, by treating as a dependent variable fragility in the final year of each subperiods, we are able to mitigate the reverse causality problem running from fragility itself to the regressors.</p>
<p>The pairwise correlation coefficients show that fragility is highly correlated with civil liberties restrictions (0.50) and revolutions (0.44) and less so with conflicts (0.26), while the correlation with economic variables is much lower (e.g. –0.14 with per-capita GDP growth). The correlation between fragility and the Worldwide Governance Indicators is very high but far from perfect (ranging between –0.58 and –0.71). We also find a high but not perfect correlation of revolutions with conflicts (0.60) and with civil liberties restrictions (0.43). This pattern of correlation suggests that each indicator captures different facets of the environment and justifies our broad choice of diverse institutional indicators.</p>

<p>Because of the binary nature of the dependent variable, we run probit regressions. The marginal effect of each regressor should therefore measure how the probability of being fragile is affected by changes in the regressor itself. Among the regressors, we include the economic, institutional, and historical variables previously discussed. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022343312452420">Table I</xref>, Column 1, we present our baseline specification. We find that, among economic variables, the most significant variable is GDP growth, which exerts a negative impact on the probability of being a fragile country.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0022343312452420">21</xref>
</sup> Investment, on the other hand, has a positive coefficient that may be attributed to the disruptive side-effects of capital accumulation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0022343312452420">22</xref>
</sup> Natural resources display a positive coefficient, but it is insignificant, suggesting that they do not affect the probability of being a fragile country once other covariates are controlled for.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0022343312452420">23</xref>
</sup> Likewise, the remaining economic and demographic variables do not provide additional explanatory power to the regression. In more detail, our measure for human capital – primary schooling – displays a negative but insignificant coefficient. The impact of trade and inflation goes in the expected direction (i.e. negative and positive, respectively), but is again not statistically significant.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0022343312452420">24</xref>
</sup> Turning to institutional variables, we find that civil liberties and revolutions are highly significant and with the expected sign, that is, more restricted civil liberties<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0022343312452420">25</xref>
</sup> and a higher frequency of revolutions make fragility more likely. The interpretation is that autocracies tend to be associated with fragility more often than democracies<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0022343312452420">26</xref>
</sup> and that episodes of acute political unrest constitute a further threat. The variable that accounts for armed conflicts is not significant,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0022343312452420">27</xref>
</sup> and the same is true for ethnic fractionalization.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0022343312452420">28</xref>
</sup> Fixed time effects are included in the form of a period dummy for the second subperiod that shows a significantly positive (unreported) coefficient, pointing to an intensification of fragility in the second subperiod. We include the period dummy in all subsequent specifications.<sup>

</sup> To sum up, these preliminary results show that both economic and institutional factors tend to be associated with fragility.

<title>Controlling for endogeneity</title>
<p>A provisional conclusion from Column 1 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022343312452420">Table I</xref> is that both economic and institutional variables play a relevant role in the determination of the condition of fragility. However, the results presented so far need to be taken with caution, since our investigation is plagued by two major concerns, reverse causality and omitted variable bias. Indeed, despite the large number of potential determinants we consider, we still face the danger of having omitted crucial variables. Moreover, our regressors may be endogenous to fragility. The two problems are actually linked, since the potential two-way relationship between fragility and some of the regressors may be driven by a third factor which we have failed to include. However, in the discussion below we address each question separately, starting with endogeneity.</p>
<p>While it is conceivable that fragility, rather than being caused by bad performances, may well be the cause behind them, this potential problem is mitigated by the fact that our dependent variable is constructed as the value of fragility in the final year of each cross-section, while the regressors predate the dependent variable. This reduces the potential of reverse causality, even though it does not rule it out under serial correlation in fragility. Nevertheless, we address this issue by running IV probit regressions. We start by regarding as potentially endogenous the four variables that display a significant impact in the initial probit specification of Column 1, that is, growth, investment, civil liberties, and revolution. For each variable, one by one, we preliminarily run a IV probit regression where the selected variable is instrumented with its initial value at the beginning of each subperiod (1992 and 2000, respectively). The rationale is that this procedure at least ensures that the values of the regressors are determined prior to those of the dependent variable.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0022343312452420">31</xref> </sup>For each resulting IV probit regression, we run a Wald test for exogeneity. Results indicate that only the variable measuring revolutions is endogenous, while growth, investment, and civil liberties do pass the exogeneity test. In other words, to use an instrument is justified only for revolutions. Thus, in Column 2 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022343312452420">Table I</xref> we report an IV probit regression where the revolutions variable is instrumented with its initial value. The resulting estimates show that civil liberties and revolutions retain their full significance, while economic growth loses it entirely. A longer life expectancy now appears to be associated with more fragility, albeit with marginal significance (at only 10%). Moreover, despite the previously reported positive pairwise correlation between conflicts and fragility, we find that after controlling for everything else more conflicts tend to reduce fragility.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0022343312452420">32</xref>
</sup> To conclude, after addressing endogeneity we observe a predominance of institutions, over economic factors, as exogenous determinants of fragility.<sup>

<title>An alternative definition of fragility</title>
<p>As previously explained, the concept of fragility is an elusive one. Therefore, as a preliminary robustness check, in Columns 3 and 4 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022343312452420">Table I</xref> we run analogues of the previous two regressions for a different definition of the dependent variable, that is, extreme fragility. Even under this more severe definition, previous results are largely confirmed, with a predominance of institutional factors especially after controlling for endogeneity. Moreover, ethnic fractionalization now emerges as an additional determinant, with more fractionalization being associated with a higher probability of extreme fragility. Since our results prove not to depend on the definition of fragility being used, in the rest of the article we focus on the more common OECD-DAC definition, which is also the most relevant for policy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0022343312452420">
<title>Colonial history</title>
<p>Despite the fact that previous regressions already control for a large number of factors, in order to address the potential issue of omitted variables we now expand the set of covariates even further to include the role of history, and in particular colonial history. We consider a set of three dummies capturing the national identity of the colonizers (namely, Britain, France, or Portugal), as well as a dummy for political status which distinguishes among colonies, dependencies, and independent countries. Since preliminary checks confirm the endogeneity of revolutions even in this expanded setting, we add each additional covariate, one by one, to the benchmark IV probit regression of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022343312452420">Table I</xref>, Column 2. Results from these extended specifications are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022343312452420">Table II</xref>. We find that the coefficient of the dummy for British colony (Column 1) is negative, while French (Column 2) and Portuguese (Column 3) colonies display a positive coefficient. This suggests that having being a British colony decreases the probability of being a fragile country, while the opposite occurs for French and Portuguese colonies. The relatively beneficial impact of British colonial domination confirms the findings of several other studies, including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022343312452420">Bertocchi &amp; Canova (2002)</xref>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0022343312452420">34</xref>
</sup> However, none of the three variables is statistically significant. In Column 4 political status displays a negative and highly significant coefficient, which suggests that after controlling for all other factors former colonies have a lower probability of being fragile. Other minor differences between this specification and the benchmark can be attributed to the reduced sample size.<sup>

<p>We can summarize the main results as follows. First, our previous conclusions from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022343312452420">Table I</xref> regarding economic and institutional variables are confirmed, with a predominant impact of institutional variables. Second, the evidence supporting the view that past colonization is crucial for fragility is limited to the significance of the political status dummy which, however, suggests that former colonies are now less likely to be fragile. Moreover, the identity of the colonizers and the fact that a country was a settler colony do not emerge as significant factors for today’s fragility. This may be due to their limited variability within SSA, to a faded impact of colonial history, or to the fact that the latter is already accounted for through standard regressors. In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022343312452420">Bhattacharyya (2009)</xref> also casts doubts on the ability of colonial legacy to explain African underdevelopment.</p>

<sec id="section10-0022343312452420">
<title>Extended specifications</title>
<p>Along the same lines of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022343312452420">Table II</xref>, in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022343312452420">Table III</xref> we add a number of covariates reflecting other possible channels of influence to our IV probit benchmark specification of Column 2, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022343312452420">Table I</xref>. In Columns 1 and 2 we add, one by one, two geographical variables, namely a country’s latitude and a dummy reflecting the fact that a country is landlocked. They are both insignificant and leave previous conclusions unaltered.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0022343312452420">36</xref> </sup>In Column 3 we gauge the potential relevance of the fact that a country has a fragile country at its border. The impact is significant but negative.</p>
<p>Finally, in Columns 4–6, we add, one by one, three of the Worldwide Governance Indicators, which reflect a large number of specific and disaggregated individual variables measuring various dimensions of governance. We select government effectiveness, rule of law, and voice and accountability, which may be viewed as closer substitutes for the previously selected institutional variables. To be noticed is that these variables are highly correlated with fragility (–0.71, –0.61, –0.58, respectively), but at the same time they are also highly correlated with our institutional variables: their correlation coefficients with civil liberties restrictions are –0.63, –0.70, and –0.92, respectively, while with revolutions they are –0.54, –0.52, and –0.43. Unsurprisingly, the added variables do not show any explanatory power, while the significance of both revolutions and civil liberties are hardly affected, with the exception of Column 4 where civil liberties lose significance in combination with voice and accountability. The effect of conflicts is instead not robust to these additional controls. Other economic variables emerge as significant in some specifications, but again not in a robust fashion. We can interpret these results as evidence that the governance indicators capture factors that are already measured by our original institutional variables.</p>

<sec id="section11-0022343312452420">
<title>Summary and comparisons</title>
<p>Our empirical investigation points to institutions as the predominant cause of fragility. Purely economic factors such as the level of income, its growth rate, or investment, display a non-robust impact on the dependent variable. Colonial history appears to be only marginally relevant for fragility once we control for contemporary institutions.</p>
<p>Over a longer-run perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022343312452420">Bertocchi &amp; Guerzoni (2010)</xref> reach consistent findings for a cross-sectional dataset including the same 41 SSA countries. An average measure of fragility over 1999–2007 is regressed over average values of the regressors for 1960–98. Over a world sample, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022343312452420">Vallings &amp; Moreno-Torres (2005)</xref> also reach similar conclusions on the basis of Polity IV data on political institutions. On the other hand, again for a world sample, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022343312452420">Carment, Samy &amp; Prest (2008)</xref> find that a lower per-capita income level appears to be associated with higher fragility, while all other potential determinants lose significance once reverse causality is controlled for. This difference can be explained by several factors. First, they focus on 156 countries rather than on SSA. Second, they employ different sample periods and estimation techniques. Namely, they rely on a cross-sectional sample over the 1999–2005 period, while we employ a panel over 1999–2007. Moreover, they use the indicator of Failed &amp; Fragile States provided by Country Indicators for Foreign Policy, rather than the CPIA-based indicators we use. The fact that they report a positive coefficient (i.e. a higher chance of fragility) for a SSA dummy suggests that our radically different conclusions are mainly to be attributed to the specificity of the African region. Thus, a comparison between the two studies highlights the fact that the peculiar characteristics of this region deserve specific attention, since conclusions derived on the basis of a wider world sample would lead to misleading implications for Africa.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>With a focus on sub-Saharan Africa, we have explored the determinants of fragility by considering a wide array of potential factors. Besides economic and institutional determinants, we have also considered the unique role of the history and geography of the area. Our findings suggest that contemporary institutions prevail as the central drivers of fragility in Africa.</p>
<p>Even if we find a limited role for colonial history, we cannot exclude the possibility that institutional variables themselves may still be affected by long-term factors that can even predate colonial dominations, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022343312452420">Herbst (2000)</xref>, who focuses on the underdevelopment of precolonial polities as an explanation of the weakness of postcolonial states. Along the same lines, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022343312452420">Bockstette, Chanda &amp; Putterman (2002)</xref> observe that state antiquity, a measure of the depth of experience with state-level institutions, is positively correlated with institutional quality, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022343312452420">Gennaioli &amp; Rainer (2007)</xref> uncover for Africa a positive association between stronger precolonial political institutions and public goods provision. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022343312452420">Nunn (2008)</xref> finds that weakened and fragmented states may be the result of the slave trades. Since these long-term factors may represent an alternative driver of current fragility, further empirical research is needed on this issue.</p>
<p>While the literature we have surveyed is mostly empirical, theoretical models of fragility have recently been proposed, mainly with a focus on the related fiscal concept of state capacity. Building on these contributions could yield a dynamic political-economy model of fragility, which can explain not only the empirical links we have highlighted but also the complex process through which the condition of fragility is reached, or abandoned. This is in our agenda for future research.</p>

<p>An unreported variant of the same regression, which includes an interaction between investment and civil liberties, shows a negative effect for investment and a positive effect for the interaction, suggesting that the impact of investment on fragility may turn positive only in countries with bad institutions, which are the majority in the sample.</p>

<p>Due to our sample size, where the number of countries is much larger than the number of periods, we cannot run regressions with fixed effects at the country level, since they would induce a loss of degrees of freedom and the danger of multicollinearity.

<p>The impact of these covariates can be explained by the fact that British domination brought to its colonies a common law legal system, rather than the civil law system as under French and Portuguese domination (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022343312452420">La Porta et al., 1998</xref>).</p>

<p>An IV probit regression including settler mortality cannot be estimated because of a reduction of the number of observations to 48. In a 2SLS specification settler mortality is insignificant.</p>

<p>When each of these variables is added to a parsimonious specification, they both show a significantly positive impact. This suggests that there may be a link between geography and fragility that runs through a wide array of channels. As in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022343312452420">Fearon &amp; Laitin (2003)</xref> we also experiment with alternative geographic variables such as mountainousness and elevation.
