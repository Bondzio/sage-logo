<abstract>
<p><bold>Objective</bold>: Children with ADHD and comorbid disorders display poorer overall functioning compared with children with ADHD alone, though little research has examined the differential impact of externalizing versus internalizing comorbidities. <bold>Method</bold>: This study examined the impact of internalizing and externalizing comorbidities on the academic and social functioning of 416 children with ADHD. <bold>Results</bold>: Children with ADHD and a comorbid externalizing disorder (with or without a concomitant internalizing comorbidity) displayed poorer social skills than those with ADHD alone. Children with ADHD and both an externalizing and internalizing comorbidity exhibited greater homework problems than their ADHD peers with fewer than two types of comorbidity. In addition, older children displayed significantly poorer social skills and greater homework problems than younger children. There was no interaction between comorbid status and age for any measure of academic or social functioning. <bold>Conclusion</bold>: Results underscore the need for early interventions to address social skills and homework difficulties for children with ADHD and comorbid externalizing disorders.</p>

<body>
<p>ADHD is characterized by symptoms of impulsivity, inattentiveness, and/or hyperactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054710383239">American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2000</xref>) and is found in approximately 3% to 10% of school-aged children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054710383239">Barkley, 2006</xref>). Along with impairments in academic and social functioning, children with ADHD are at risk for the development of comorbid psychiatric disorders, as research indicates that 29% to 50% of children with ADHD will also meet criteria for another disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1087054710383239">Spencer, Biederman, &amp; Mick, 2007</xref>). These comorbidities may include externalizing disorders, such as oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD), as well as internalizing disorders, such as anxiety and mood disorders.</p>

<sec id="section2-1087054710383239">
<title>Academic performance</title>
<p>Results from the existing literature regarding the effects of comorbid disorders on the academic performance of children with ADHD are mixed. Some research suggests that children with comorbid disorders show lower academic performance and greater homework problems than children with ADHD alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054710383239">Karustis, Power, Rescorla, Eiraldi, &amp; Gallegher, 2000</xref>; Monteaux, Faraone, Groww, &amp; Biederman, 2007), whereas other researchers have not found differences between comorbid groups on measures of self-reported academic competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054710383239">Blackman, Ostrander, &amp; Herman, 2005</xref>) or standardized measures of achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054710383239">Blackman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054710383239">Drabick, Gadow, &amp; Sprafkin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054710383239">Karustis et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1087054710383239">
<title>Social performance</title>
<p>In contrast to the mixed findings regarding academic performance, the literature generally suggests that children with ADHD and comorbid disorders show greater deficits in social performance compared with those with ADHD alone. Specifically, parents and teachers of children with ADHD and comorbid internalizing symptoms report significantly greater social problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054710383239">Blackman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054710383239">Drabic et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054710383239">Karustis et al., 2000</xref>). Similarly, children with ADHD and ODD/CD are reportedly more disliked, get into more fights, and have poorer overall social functioning than those with ADHD only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087054710383239">Ostrander, Crystal, &amp; August, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Unique Contributions of Comorbid Categories</title>
<p>Despite the growing evidence that comorbid conditions may affect the academic and social functioning of children with ADHD, it is unclear whether different types of comorbid conditions (e.g., internalizing vs. externalizing conditions) have unique effects. Until now, very few studies have examined whether children with internalizing comorbidities differ significantly from those with comorbid externalizing disorders in terms of their academic and social functioning. Researchers from the multimodal treatment of ADHD (MTA) studies, for example, found that children who met <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed., Text Revision, <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic>) criteria for comorbid ODD/CD had significantly higher math and spelling achievement test scores than children with a comorbid anxiety disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054710383239">Jensen et al., 2001</xref>). No differences between these comorbid groups, however, were found for parent or teacher reports of social performance. Another study that used MTA data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087054710383239">Abikoff et al., 2002</xref>) found that children with ADHD and ODD/CD engaged in significantly more off-task and aggressive behaviors than those without a comorbid disruptive behavior disorder. However, no significant differences were found between those children with and without an anxiety disorder.</p>
<p>More recently, a longitudinal study examining children with ADHD found that the presence of both a comorbid anxiety and CD in childhood significantly predicted social problems in adolescence. Interestingly, although neither disorder significantly predicted adolescent social problems, having both a CD and anxiety diagnosis uniquely explained nearly 18% of the variance in parent-reported social problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1087054710383239">Newcorn et al., 2004</xref>). Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054710383239">Humphrey, Storch, and Geffken (2007)</xref> examined parent reports of peer victimization in children with ADHD (ages 4-18) and found that those with comorbid externalizing psychiatric diagnoses had higher rates of peer victimization than those with a comorbid internalizing disorder. This finding must be interpreted with caution, however, because of a relatively small sample (<italic>N</italic> = 116) and unspecified diagnostic criteria.</p>
<p>Although these studies represent important progress in understanding the differential impact of internalizing and externalizing disorders, there are significant limitations that make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions from extant findings. First, only two of the studies included children with comorbid mood disorders in the comparison with children with comorbid externalizing disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087054710383239">Abikoff et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054710383239">Jensen et al., 2001</xref>). Second, only two of these four studies included children with predominantly inattentive type, and those that did had small overall sample sizes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1087054710383239">Newcorn and colleagues (2004)</xref>, for example, used an all male sample (<italic>n</italic> = 32) and did not report the number of children who met criteria for each ADHD subtype. Similarly, only 12.9% of the 116 children in the study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054710383239">Humphrey and colleagues (2007)</xref> were classified as having predominantly inattentive type, and it is unclear what diagnostic criteria were used. The inclusion of children with predominantly inattentive type is important because children with different ADHD subtypes may have different comorbid profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087054710383239">Eiraldi, Power, &amp; Nezu, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, these studies examined a restricted age range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087054710383239">Abikoff et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054710383239">Jensen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1087054710383239">Newcorn et al., 2004</xref>) or neglected to examine the potential interactions between age and comorbid status with regard to functional impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054710383239">Humphrey et al., 2007</xref>). Although research suggests that ADHD symptom severity declines with chronological age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054710383239">Biederman, Mick, &amp; Faraone, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087054710383239">Langberg, Epstein, Altaye, et al., 2008</xref>), few studies have systematically examined potential age differences in the social and academic difficulties associated with a diagnosis of ADHD.</p>

<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The present study attempted to extend the research examining the effects of different comorbid disorders on the academic and social functioning of children with ADHD. This study used <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria as assessed through a structured diagnostic interview to establish the presence of clinically significant comorbid disorders. The study is unique in that it examined differences in homework problems in addition to academic achievement and attempted to elucidate the relative effects of having a comorbid internalizing disorder as opposed to a comorbid externalizing disorder, or both internalizing and externalizing comorbidities. In addition, it is the first study to examine potential interactions between comorbid status and age.</p>
<p>Specifically, this study explored the following research questions:</p>

<title>Participants and Setting</title>
<p>The participating sample of children and adolescents were derived from a database of 1,722 consecutive referrals to an ADHD evaluation and treatment center based in a tertiary-care pediatric hospital located in a large city in the Northeastern section of the United States. Children were referred to the ADHD center by parents, teachers, or primary care physicians. Typical reasons for referral included excessive hyperactivity, inattention, impulsivity, noncompliance, conduct problems, and academic difficulties. Fourteen percent of this pool of potential participants was African American or biracial, 2% Hispanic, 1% Asian, and 82% White. The socioeconomic status (SES) of this pool, as determined by the Four-Factor Index of the Social Status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087054710383239">Hollingshead, 1975</xref>), was as follows: 1% in Category I (laborers), 7% in Category II (machine operators), 22% in Category III (skilled craftsman, clerical, and sales workers), 28% in Category IV (small business owners and technicians), and 42% in Category V (major business owners and professionals). A total of 74% of the sample pool was male.</p>
<sec id="section8-1087054710383239">
<title>Inclusion criteria</title>
<p>Participants from this pool were selected for the current study based on the following inclusion criteria: (a) between the age of 5 and 16 and (b) met <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria for ADHD combined (ADHD/COM) or predominantly inattentive type (ADHD/I) based on parent reports from the Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents–Revised Parent Version (DICA-R-P; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1087054710383239">Reich, Leacock, &amp; Shanfeld, 1995</xref>) and teacher ratings on the ADHD Rating Scale-IV–Teacher Version (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087054710383239">DuPaul, Power, Anastopoulos, &amp; Reid, 1998</xref>). Children with predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type were excluded from this study because they comprised less than 5% of the sample of children with ADHD (<italic>n</italic> = 33).</p>
<p>Stringent diagnostic procedures were used to identify children with ADHD to minimize the inclusion of borderline cases (e.g., cases just failing to reach criteria on the structured interview or cases in which there was a discrepancy between structured interview and teacher-rating scale data). The following criteria was used to diagnose ADHD/COM: (a) parent report on the DICA-R-P met criteria for ADHD/COM and (b) teacher ratings on the ADHD Rating Scale-IV were at or above the 80th percentile for age and gender on either the inattentive or the hyperactivity-impulsivity factors. The following criteria were used to diagnose ADHD/I: (a) parent report on the DICA-R-P met criteria for ADHD/I and the parent endorsed four or fewer symptoms of H-I on the DICA-R-P, and (b) teacher ratings on the ADHD Rating Scale-IV were at or above the 80th percentile for age and gender on either the inattentive or the hyperactivity-impulsivity factors. Thus, children must have demonstrated significant ADHD symptoms across home and school settings with parent interview responses used to identify the specific ADHD subtype. Teacher ratings of symptoms were included to ensure problems across settings and because previous research indicates that combined informant methods are optimal for positively diagnosing ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087054710383239">Power et al., 1998</xref>). The clinical cutoff of 80th percentile was selected to ensure a reasonably large sample size and because ratings below the 80th percentile have been shown to rule out ADHD/I and ADHD/COM with reasonable level of specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087054710383239">Power et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Data from the following measures were required for inclusion in this study: (a) DICA-R-P; (b) ADHD Rating Scale-IV, Teacher Version; (c) Behavior Assessment System for Children–Parent and Teacher Rating Scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054710383239">Reynolds &amp; Kamphaus, 1992</xref>); (d) Wechsler Individual Achievement Test (WIAT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1087054710383239">Wechsler, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087054710383239">2001</xref>); (e) the homework problems checklist (HPC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054710383239">Anesko, Schoiock, Ramirez, &amp; Levine, 1987</xref>); and (f) the Four-Factor Index of the Social Status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087054710383239">Hollingshead, 1975</xref>). Of the 1,722 potentially eligible children, 696 (40%) were within the age range specified for this study and met the stringent criteria for ADHD/COM or ADHD/I, and 416 (24% of the total sample pool) also had data on each of the measures to be used in this study. A previous power analyses using an alpha of .01 and power of .80 indicated that this sample size is sufficient to detect a moderate effect size (i.e., required sample size = 320). Chi-square analyses and <italic>t</italic> tests revealed no statistically significant differences between children included in this study (<italic>n</italic> = 416) and those with missing data (<italic>n</italic> = 280) with regard to the following variables: gender, comorbid status, and ethnicity. Children with complete data were, however, significantly older than those not included in this study because of missing information (<italic>M</italic> age in months for those with complete data = 9 years 6 months, <italic>M</italic> age for those with missing data = 9 years 2 months; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Overall, 84% of the study sample was of grade-school age (i.e., 5 to 11 years old).</p>
<p>Demographic information for the children included in this study is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1087054710383239">Table 1</xref>. Data regarding medication status and treatment history were available for 65% of the selected sample. On the basis of the parent report, 13% of these children were currently prescribed a psychostimulant medication, and 14% had been treated with psychostimulant medication in the past.</p>

<title>Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents–Revised Parent Version</title>
<p>The DICA-R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1087054710383239">Reich et al., 1995</xref>) is a structured diagnostic interview designed to evaluate symptoms of child psychopathology using <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria. In the current study, the parent version of this measure was administered to determine diagnostic status. Specifically, sections pertaining to ADHD, ODD, CD, all anxiety disorders (ANX), bipolar disorder, major depression (MD), and dysthymia were used. The interview procedure for this measure accounts for level of functional impairment, age of onset, and number of symptoms in determining the child’s diagnostic status based on <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria. Doctoral-level psychologists and advanced doctoral students in psychology trained in the administration of the DICA-R-P administered this measure, and each interview was audiotaped. Approximately, 20% of the total sample pool (i.e., 346 audiotapes) were randomly selected and scored by another trained clinician to determine interclinician agreement, which was determined by whether the two raters agreed on diagnostic status. The kappa coefficients for parent-structured interviews were as follows: ADHD/COM = .89, ADHD/H-I = .68, ADHD/I = .82, ODD = .84, CD = .77, major depressive disorder = .82, dysthymic disorder = .73, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) = .83, separation anxiety disorder (SAD) = .87, and specific phobia = .61.

<title>ADHD Rating Scale-IV, Teacher Version</title>
<p>The teacher version of the ADHD-IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087054710383239">DuPaul et al., 1998</xref>) was used as a secondary diagnostic measure to confirm that children demonstrated problems related to ADHD in the school setting. This measure includes 18 items adapted from the symptom list for ADHD delineated in the <italic>DSM-IV</italic>, and factor analytic studies have indicated that the nine-item inattention factor and the nine-item hyperactivity-impulsivity factor of this measure closely correspond to the two-dimensional structure in the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054710383239">DuPaul et al., 1997</xref>).

<title>Behavior assessment system for children</title>
<p>The behavior assessment system for children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054710383239">Reynolds &amp; Kamphaus, 1992</xref>) is a multiaxial behavioral assessment procedure designed to assist in the evaluation of children’s emotional and behavioral functioning, and was standardized with a population that closely reflects U.S. population estimates for race and ethnicity. Both parent Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC-PRS) and teacher Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC-TRS) rating scales were used as dependent measures in the current project. Specifically, standard scores from the social skills subscales from the BASC-PRS and BASC-TRS were used as a measure of children’s social performance. The social skills assessed by the BASC include prosocial behaviors such as offering to help other children, saying <italic>please</italic> and <italic>thank you</italic>, and showing interest in others’ ideas, rather than popularity among peers. Standard scores from the learning problems and study skills subscales from the BASC-TRS were used to assess teacher perceptions of academic performance. This measurement system has preschool (2-5 years), child (6-11 years), and adolescent (12-18 years) versions to facilitate the assessment of children across a wide age range. The factor composition of this measure is identical across the three versions, although the item content of factors differs to be responsive to developmental variations in children’s behavior across the ages represented. Importantly, the BASC has shown adequate internal consistency (α = .96 to .89 for parent social skills, .89 to .93 for teacher social skills, .84 to .90 for learning problems, .92 to .94 for study skills), test–retest reliability (<italic>r</italic> = .65 to .91 for parent social skills, .78 to .91 for teacher social skills, .88 to .93 for learning problems, .89 to .93 for study skills), and criterion-related validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054710383239">Reynolds &amp; Kamphaus, 1992</xref>).</p>

<title>WIAT</title>
<p>Basic reading and math skills were assessed using standard scores from two subtests of the WIAT.

The basic reading and numerical operations subtests from the first iteration of the WIAT, or the word reading and numerical operations subtests from the WIAT-II, were used to assess academic performance. Importantly, these corresponding subtests of the WIAT and the WIAT-II are strongly correlated (more than .80; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087054710383239">Wechsler, 2001</xref>), and minimal changes were made to the two subtests that assess basic reading and math calculation skills.

<title>HPC</title>
<p>The HPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054710383239">Anesko et al., 1987</xref>) was used to provide information regarding parents’ perceptions of their children’s homework-related problems. The HPC is a 20-item checklist that requires parents to rate the presence and severity of homework problems and has high internal consistency (α = .91; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054710383239">Anesko et al., 1987</xref>). Although the measure was developed for use within the general education population, it has been shown to be reliable for students with behavioral disorders (α = .76; Foley &amp; Epstein, 1993). The HPC has been shown to have a moderate to high correlation with parent ratings of inattention (BASC-PRS) but low correlations with teacher reports of inattention, learning problems, and study skills (BASC-TRS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087054710383239">Power, Werba, Watkins, Angelucci, &amp; Eiraldi, 2006</xref>).

<title>Procedures</title>
<p>The current project used data from an existing database derived from psychological assessments for children referred to an ADHD evaluation and treatment center due to concerns about attention, learning, and behavior problems. Data were collected from 1998 to 2005, and informed consent from parents, and child assent, were obtained for all participants. All research procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the pediatric hospital. Questionnaire packets, including the ADHD-IV, BASC, and HPC, were mailed to parents and teachers several weeks before the family’s appointment at the clinic. At the clinic visit, one member of the team administered the DICA-R-P, whereas another clinician administered the child measures (e.g., cognitive and achievement testing).</p>

<sec id="section16-1087054710383239">
<title>Data Analyses</title>
<p>To control for potential differences among the groups that could be attributed to demographic characteristics, Pearson’s correlations between (a) all independent or dependent variables and (b) gender, SES, and ethnicity were examined. The variable SES met the following criteria and therefore was included as a covariate in the analyses: (a) The correlation between the potential covariate and the independent or dependent variable was significant and greater than or equal to .25 and (b) the assumptions of linearity, homogeneity of regression, and homogeneity of variance were met (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1087054710383239">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Before examining group differences in functional impairment, a principal component analysis (PCA) using an orthogonal rotation procedure was conducted to determine whether the five measures of academic performance (TRS Study Skills subscale, TRS Learning Problems subscale, WIAT word reading, WIAT numerical operations, and HPC) represented a single construct. A two-factor solution best met the following retention criteria: (a) eigenvalues of the unrotated factors were greater than or equal to 1, (b) the rotated factor solution met criteria for Cattell’s (1966) scree test, (c) each factor accounted for greater than 5% of the total variance, and (d) the final-factor solution minimized intercorrelation of retained unit-weighted factors and items with appreciable loadings on more than one factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087054710383239">Fabrigar, Wegener, MacCallum, &amp; Strahan, 1999</xref>). TRS Study Skills, TRS Learning Problems, WIAT word reading, and WIAT numerical operations loaded appreciably (&gt;.50) on one factor and the HPC loaded on a second factor (.723). The two components explained 42% and 22% of the variance, respectively. As a result, group differences on the HPC were examined separately from measures of academic performance.</p>
<p>These data were analyzed using two 2 (age group) × 4 (comorbidity group) factorial MANCOVAs to determine whether there were significant differences between diagnostic subgroups (i.e., ADHD only, ADHD + INT, ADHD + EXT, and ADHD + INT + EXT) or age group (i.e., between the ages of 5 and 11 or between the ages of 12 and 16) and their combination in terms of children’s (a) academic performance (as measured by the WIAT and BASC) or (b) social functioning, after controlling for age and SES. Follow-up ANCOVA were used to evaluate group differences for any statistically significant MANCOVAs (evaluated using Wilks’s Lambda). Tukey’s honestly significant differences (HSD) was used to evaluate differences between comorbid groups. Although the four measures of academic performance (TRS Study Skills, TRS Learning Problems, WIAT word reading, and WIAT numerical operations) loaded appreciably on a single factor in the PCA, they were each entered as separate dependent variables in the MANCOVAs because potential differences between math, reading, and study skills were viewed as clinically meaningful. A separate 2 (age group) × 4 (comorbidity group) ANCOVA was conducted to determine whether there were significant differences between diagnostic subgroups or age groups and their combination with regard to children’s homework problems (as measured by the HPC), after controlling for SES. The Bonferroni correction was used to control for multiple analyses, alpha was set to .01, and Tukey’s HSD was used to evaluate differences between comorbid groups. Effect sizes for main effects were determined using partial eta squared. Cutoffs for small, medium, and large effect sizes that use partial eta squared are as follows: .02, .15, and .35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054710383239">Cohen, 1992</xref>).

<p>As a preliminary step, we conducted two MANCOVAs to determine whether there were significant differences between ADHD subtypes in terms of children’s (a) academic performance (as measured by the WIAT and BASC) or (b) social functioning, after controlling for age and SES. A separate ANCOVA was conducted to examine potential differences in parent-reported homework problems between ADHD subtypes. Results revealed no significant differences between subtypes with regard to academic performance, <italic>F</italic>(4, 409) = 1.176, <italic>p</italic> = .321, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .011; homework problems, <italic>F</italic>(1, 412) = .285, <italic>p</italic> = .594, partial η = .001; or teacher-reported social skills, <italic>F</italic>(1, 412) = 1.218, <italic>p</italic> = .270, partial η = .003.

<p>These results suggested that children with ADHD + INT + EXT displayed the highest levels of homework problems whereas relatively small differences were observed among the other three groups. In an effort to further examine the expectation that children with ADHD + INT + EXT showed greater impairment than children with fewer than two types of comorbidities, these three groups (ADHD only, ADHD + INT, and ADHD + EXT) were collapsed into a single group of children with ADHD and one or fewer types of comorbidity (ADHD ≤ 1 COM TYPE). However, it should be noted that children in this group could have more than one comorbidity (e.g., both a mood and an anxiety disorder). An ANCOVA was used to compare children with ADHD + INT + EXT and those with ADHD ≤ 1 COM TYPE. SES was entered as a covariate and alpha was set to .01 to control for multiple comparisons. Results from this ANCOVA revealed that parents of children with ADHD + INT + EXT reported significantly more homework problems than parents of children with ADHD ≤ 1 COM TYPE—<italic>F</italic>(1, 413) = 12.40, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001; <italic>M</italic> ADHD ≤ 1 COM TYPE = 32.06, <italic>SD</italic> = 10.85; <italic>M</italic> ADHD + EXT + INT = 38.29, <italic>SD</italic> = 10.84—indicating a moderate effect size (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.57).</p>

<title>Comorbidity and Age Effects on Social Impairment</title>
<p>The results of the 2 (age) × 4 (comorbid status) MANCOVA examining social skills revealed a statistically significant main effect for both comorbid status, <italic>F</italic>(6, 812) = 5.73, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, partial η = .041, and age, <italic>F</italic>(2, 406) = 3.22, <italic>p</italic> = .041, partial η = .016. Follow-up univariate tests indicated significant differences between comorbid and age groups with regard to parent reports of social skills on the BASC—comorbid groups: <italic>F</italic>(3, 407) = 9.92, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, partial η = .068 and age groups: <italic>F</italic>(1, 407) = 5.10, <italic>p</italic> = .024, partial η = .012—whereas teacher reports were statistically significant for comorbid status only—comorbid groups: <italic>F</italic>(3, 407) = 3.85, <italic>p</italic> = .01, partial η = .028 and age groups: <italic>F</italic>(1, 407) = 2.62, <italic>p</italic> = .11, partial η = .006.

<title>Academic Impairment</title>
<p>This present study examined the relationship of comorbid status and age with the functional impairment of children with ADHD. With regard to academic functioning, parents of children with ADHD and both internalizing and externalizing comorbidities reported significantly more homework problems than parents of children with ADHD alone with a moderate effect size (<italic>d</italic> = 0.67). Although small effect sizes were also found for differences in parent reports of homework problems between those with ADHD and both internalizing and externalizing comorbidities and those with one type of comorbid disorder (<italic>d</italic> = 0.40 to 0.49), the trend for children with ADHD and both internalizing and externalizing comorbidities to have greater problems was not statistically significant. When the groups were collapsed, however, parents of children with ADHD and both internalizing and externalizing comorbidities reported significantly more homework problems than parents of children with fewer than two types of comorbidity, indicating a moderate effect size (<italic>d</italic> = 0.57). In addition to differences between comorbid groups, parents of older children (i.e., ages 12-16) reported significantly greater homework problems than those of younger children, indicating a moderate effect size (<italic>d</italic> = 0.60). Direct measures of academic performance and teacher reports of study skills and learning problems did not reveal any significant differences between comorbid or age groups, and no interaction effects were found between age and comorbid groups.</p>
<p>Results from this current study regarding academic performance are consistent with the studies suggesting a lack of difference between comorbid groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054710383239">Blackman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054710383239">Drabick et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054710383239">Karustis et al., 2000</xref>) but in contrast to other research that has revealed group differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054710383239">Jensen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087054710383239">Kuhne, Schachar, &amp; Tannock, 1997</xref>). There are several possible explanations for these discrepancies. First, collapsing the diagnostic groups may have obscured differences between diagnoses within internalizing and externalizing categories (e.g., between children with anxiety and depression or between those with ODD and CD). Second, this current study used basic measures of academic performance, which may not reflect differences in more complex academic skills such as applied mathematics and reading comprehension.</p>
<p>Although, surprisingly, little research has examined the effect of ADHD and comorbid symptoms on children’s ability to complete homework assignments, findings from this current study provide additional support for a higher level of homework problems among children with ADHD and internalizing symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054710383239">Karustis et al., 2000</xref>). However, in this current study, internalizing comorbidities only contributed to homework problems in the presence of an additional externalizing disorder. Because <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054710383239">Karustis and colleagues (2000)</xref> did not explicitly examine the effect of both internalizing and externalizing symptoms, it is impossible to determine whether noncompliant behaviors and conduct problems contributed to the effect of internalizing symptoms in their study.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that the HPC did not load with other measures of academic performance on the PCA. These findings suggest that, rather than measuring a child’s academic skills, the HPC may reflect behavioral or psychosocial problems that impede a child’s ability to complete homework assignments effectively. Such findings are consistent with previous research indicating low correlations between the HPC and teacher reports of learning problems and study skills but moderate to high correlations with parent ratings of inattention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087054710383239">Power, et al., 2006</xref>). As such, the increases in homework difficulties found in children with both internalizing and externalizing problems may relate to the increased behavioral deficits associated with having multiple psychiatric symptoms. In addition to difficulties with attention, motivation, and compliance, children with additional internalizing comorbidities may struggle with performance anxiety, hopelessness, or anhedonia. The behavioral strategies that work to address difficulties associated with symptoms of externalizing disorders, therefore, may not address the specific needs of children with additional internalizing problems.</p>
<p>Results from this study also suggest that homework difficulties may increase as children enter middle and high school. This is consistent with the increase in cognitive demands associated with the transition to middle school and the requirement to function with more independence both at home and school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087054710383239">DuPaul &amp; Stoner, 2003</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section24-1087054710383239">
<title>Social Impairment</title>
<p>In terms of social functioning, parents and teachers of children with ADHD only reported significantly better developed social skills than children with ADHD and a comorbid externalizing disorder and children with ADHD and both internalizing and externalizing comorbidities, indicating small to large effect sizes (parent <italic>d</italic> = 0.77, teacher <italic>d</italic> = 0.29 and parent <italic>d</italic> = 1.06, teacher <italic>d</italic> = 0.38, respectively). No significant differences were found between other ADHD groups. These results suggest that it was the presence of a comorbid externalizing disorder that specifically contributed to increased social problems among children with ADHD. Parents of younger children (i.e., ages 5-11) also reported significantly better social skills than older children, indicating a small effect size (<italic>d</italic> = 0.20). Although teacher reports indicated a similar pattern, age differences were not statistically significant. No interaction effects between age and comorbid status were found for either parent or teacher reports of social skills.</p>
<p>These findings provide additional support to the literature documenting social deficits in children with ADHD and comorbid externalizing disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087054710383239">Kuhne et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087054710383239">Ostrander et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, results from the current study suggest that the presence of a comorbid externalizing disorder, and not a comorbid internalizing disorder, uniquely contributes to social difficulties in children with ADHD. These findings are inconsistent with the literature suggesting that internalizing symptoms significantly predict social difficulties in children with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054710383239">Drabic, Gadow, &amp; Sprafkin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054710383239">Karustis et al., 2000</xref>). It is noteworthy, however, that the current study used a categorical measure of diagnostic status rather than a continuous measure of internalizing symptoms (as were used by the studies noted earlier). Symptom severity, therefore, may explain the discrepant findings.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section25-1087054710383239">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>A number of limitations related to measurement and design must also be acknowledged. First, the study used standardized measures of academic achievement (WIAT basic reading and math subtests) that may not have been sensitive to differences in more complex academic skills such as reading comprehension and applied mathematics. Similarly, reliance on a single measure of social functioning (the social skills subscale on the BASC) may have contributed to the absence of significant differences. Second, many significant results were based on parent report (homework problems, social skills deficits, and comorbid status). As a result, these findings may be related to source variance. The use of alternative measures of data collection such as the direct observation of social skills would have strengthened the findings. We also did not control for severity of ADHD symptoms in our analyses. It is possible that symptom severity, rather than the presence of comorbid disorders, may account for differences in homework problems and social performance. The current clinical sample consisting of mostly White, male, middle-class children may also be more homogeneous and severely impaired than the general community, and the generalizability of the results to community samples may be limited. Finally, it must be noted that the current study did not screen for developmental or autism spectrum disorders.</p>

<title>Implications for Research and Practice</title>
<p>The present study provides further evidence of the impact of comorbid disorders on the social problems and homework difficulties of children with ADHD. Although current results suggest that externalizing comorbidities specifically contribute to social deficits, these findings are in contrast with other research documenting social difficulties in children with ADHD and elevated levels of internalizing symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054710383239">Blackman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054710383239">Drabic et al., 2006</xref>). Future research could clarify these relationships by examining differences between anxiety and mood comorbidities as well as gender differences and the impact of internalizing symptom severity in relation to children’s social functioning. Similarly, it is possible that children with certain internalizing comorbidities (such as specific phobia) may exhibit functional impairments in isolated settings (i.e., in the presence of the feared stimulus). These children, therefore, may display lower levels of overall symptom severity than children with more pervasive disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder and MD. Given the current findings, it would be interesting to examine whether high levels of internalizing symptoms are necessary to affect the social functioning of children with ADHD. Future research should use direct observations of social skills and parent–child interactions during homework time as well as curriculum-based measures of academic performance.</p>
<p>This study, and the growing body of literature examining the association between additional externalizing comorbid conditions in children with ADHD and increased social difficulties, underscores the need for awareness of and screening for ODD and CD in children with ADHD. This may be especially relevant because the majority of children with mental health difficulties are treated by primary care physicians or school professionals who may not have a specialized knowledge of the assessment and treatment of children with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087054710383239">Paternite, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1087054710383239">U.S. Public Health Service, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Current findings also emphasize the need for an increased focus on homework difficulties in children with ADHD. Recent work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054710383239">Langberg, Epstein, Urbanowicz, Simon, and Graham (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087054710383239">Meyer and Kelley (2007)</xref> illustrates the importance of homework intervention for children with ADHD but focuses primarily on organization and/or self-monitoring. Given that the current study suggests that the presence of two types of comorbidities specifically contributes to increased homework problems in children with ADHD, these children may be in need of additional intervention. More comprehensive programs such as those described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087054710383239">Power, Karustis, and Habboushe (2001)</xref> that include a focus on improving the parent–child relationship and increasing positive attending may be needed to address the homework problems associated with the presence of two comorbidities.</p>
<p>In addition to a need for targeted interventions, results from the present study suggest that the functional impact of having ADHD, regardless of comorbid status, increases with age and underscores the need for early intervention. Results also suggest that continued, intensive intervention throughout the adolescent years may be appropriate for children with social and homework difficulties. This is especially important as recent results form the National Institute for Mental Health (NIMH) Collaborative Multisite Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD suggest that children who receive behavioral and medication treatment in childhood continue to show significant impairment in adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054710383239">Molina et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, the present study provides evidence that children with ADHD and a comorbid externalizing disorder exhibit greater social difficulties than those without comorbid ODD or CD. In addition, children with both internalizing and externalizing comorbidities demonstrate more homework problems than children with ADHD and one or no comorbidities. Finally, older children with ADHD display significantly greater social and homework problems than younger children. Although more research is clearly needed, this investigation extends the current literature regarding ADHD, comorbidities, and functional impairments and suggests several possible avenues for further study and intervention.</p>
