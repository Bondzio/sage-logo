<p>A <italic>bricoleur</italic> is a resource person enlisted when conventional procedures in daily life fail to work, and who utilizes whatever is at hand in the given situation to effect a solution. The psychologist-<italic>cum-bricoleur</italic> relies on three sources of knowledge: what we all know about being human because we are human, what we know about some others because we participate in particular shared meaning systems (language and culture), and what we know about unique persons. Psychological treatment is seen as composed of three interacting part projects, namely building trust between psychologist and client, modifying the client’s behavior, and modifying the client’s surroundings. Actual interventions are formed by the concrete treatment situations. Finally, the differences between the <italic>bricoleur</italic> model and the standard scientist-practitioner model are examined.</p>

<p>This article is the second part of a trilogy. The first part describes the difficulties of generalizing empirical psychological findings, owing to the nature of psychological phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959354312441277">Smedslund, 2009</xref>). The third part attempts to describe what we all know a priori about human beings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959354312441277">Smedslund, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, I present a view of psychological <italic>practice</italic> as based on a priori knowledge of the general characteristics of persons, on familiarity with the relevant language and culture, and on acquaintance with unique individuals in their unique life-situations, and as conducted in interaction with persons in concrete situations. It is presented as an alternative to the currently dominant scientist-practitioner position, well described, for example, by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959354312441277">Baker, McFall, and Shoham (2009)</xref>, which emphasizes that practice should be as much as possible based on outcomes of empirical research. The present article is also presented in support of those clinicians who profess to be unable to profit from the ordinary type of group-based and statistically analyzed scientific findings. The <italic>bricoleur</italic> model involves a practice that may not deviate very much from what some clinicians actually do, but is intended to clarify why they <italic>are justified</italic> working in this way.</p>
<p>The term <italic>bricoleur</italic> is borrowed from Lévi-Strauss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959354312441277">1962/1966</xref>, pp.16–36), who used it to describe a way of thinking that he also called “a science of the concrete.” The activity of a <italic>bricoleur</italic> is called <italic>bricolage</italic>. A <italic>bricoleur</italic> is a resource person who is enlisted when ordinary established procedures in daily life fail to work, and who utilizes whatever is at hand in the given situations to effect a solution. As a <italic>bricoleur</italic>, the psychologist is one who works in innovative ways with people in their life-situations, relying on knowledge of human nature, language and culture, and specific individuals. The analogy to Lévi-Strauss’s thinking is only partial. Although a psychologist-<italic>bricoleur</italic> relies on his or her concrete knowledge, he or she may also share the attitude of what Lévi-Strauss called the “engineer” or “scientist,” in attempting to formulate a systematic conceptual framework for describing and understanding what goes on in actual treatments. For reasons to be presented, empirically based theories and generalizations from controlled studies cannot contribute much to this form of practice.</p>
<p>In what follows, I first describe the meta-theoretical status of the view to be presented. After that, I briefly describe the suggested form of practice, and, finally, compare it to the standard scientist-practitioner model.</p>
<sec id="section1-0959354312441277">
<title>Some meta-theoretical considerations</title>
<p>In a previous article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959354312441277">Smedslund, 2009</xref>), I have argued that the search for a limited number of general and empirically based regularities (laws) in psychology cannot succeed because of four characteristics of persons: (a) they are influenced by an indefinitely high number of factors; (b) they remember outcomes (what happened after an act or a perception) and, hence, are always changeable; (c) the regularities that can, nevertheless, be found, stem from participation in shared particular meaning systems (language and culture), already implicitly familiar to the observer and, hence, not requiring empirical research; and (d) persons are also unique, partly because so much of what they have experienced and learned from has involved fortuitous events. In view of the difficulties of building a psychology based only on generalization from empirical research, let us explore the possibility of finding non-empirical bases of psychology.</p>
<p>Can we have knowledge of some general characteristics of persons that is not based on experience? Do there exist psychological propositions which, “by virtue of the fact that they need not be true in other possible worlds, are contingent; and which, by virtue of the fact that we can argue for their truth without ever stirring from our armchairs … can be known to be a priori?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959354312441277">Bradley &amp; Swartz, 1979</xref>, p. 159).</p>
<p>In contemporary psychological literature, researchers usually take the position that scientific knowledge is empirical and contingent, as in the natural sciences. In the area of clinical psychology, only a very few writers, among them <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959354312441277">O’Donohue (1989)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959354312441277">Bergner (2006)</xref>, diverge from this dominant tradition and argue for the existence and value of a priori, contingent, clinically relevant knowledge. Such knowledge involves some general presuppositions about persons that we <italic>must</italic> make, because denying them makes no sense, given what we otherwise take for granted. They reflect that we are predisposed to conceive of human beings just as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959354312441277">Shepard (1984)</xref> has shown that we are predisposed to conceive of the physical environment. We may know something about general features of other persons a priori: that is, independently of experience. One line of argument for the existence of contingent a priori psychological knowledge has been pursued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959354312441277">Kukla (2001)</xref>, who writes: “How much can psychology hope to establish by this analytical route? … [I]t is prima facie possible that a fairly detailed picture of our mental (and social) life can be deduced from the very existence of the scientific enterprise” (p. 233). What human characteristics <italic>must</italic> be assumed in order to be able to understand the behavior of scientists? If this is a legitimate question, one may extend it by asking: How much of psychology can be derived from the existence of some features of professional psychological practice, and, even more generally, what can be inferred about psychology from the very existence of many features of our ordinary daily life?</p>
<p>Let me use the following proposition to exemplify an a priori assumption: <italic>Person P encounters a person O for the first time, and is entirely unfamiliar with O’s language and culture. P knows a priori that what O says and does is purposive</italic> (in the sense of being directed at a goal or involving a preference). Situations like this have been encountered and described by many early explorers in different parts of the world. General characteristics of members of the human species seem to be taken for granted.</p>
<p>Knowledge is a priori if it is not based on experience, and it is contingent if it engenders predictions. We appear to have valid knowledge about certain very general characteristics of other humans, one of which is “purposiveness,” simply by virtue of being human. In an evolutionary perspective this makes sense. To deny that this knowledge is a priori leads to great difficulties, because an alternative explanation in terms of learning from experience must always presuppose some organization of this experience into categories. One cannot learn that “green” is always followed by “red,” if one does not have the categories “red” and “green.” The hunter in the wilderness cannot follow a track unless he distinguishes between signs in the forest that are “unordered” and signs that are “ordered.” He must discriminate between distributions of broken twigs in a line (indicating someone going in a direction towards a goal) and unordered distributions of broken twigs just lying around. In terms used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959354312441277">Piaget (1950)</xref>, we cannot accommodate to what we have not assimilated. In still other words, one cannot experience and learn an empirical relation between two phenomena unless they can be distinguished and recognized: that is, unless they are already incorporated in two categories. The assumption of “purposiveness” is a categorization that is a priori. One cannot learn that a person is trying to reach a particular goal unless one already has a category of purposiveness available. If any specific predictions derived from this general presupposition are falsified, they are attributed to failure of one or more auxiliary hypotheses embedded in the methods of obtaining and interpreting the data. One cannot interpret an observation as indicating that what a person does is not related to anything that he or she wants (and to how he or she understands the situation). We must explain a failure to predict a particular behavior by assuming that the person must have wanted something else and/or must have thought differently about the situation. We seem almost always to presuppose that persons want something: that is, that they are purposive. Our observations are organized according to this concept.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether this assumption of purposiveness is taken to be a priori or not, one must certainly be able to ask how one determines <italic>what</italic> is wanted in concrete instances. One obvious distinction here is between when someone just wants something <italic>without</italic> knowing <italic>that</italic> he or she wants it (and therefore cannot talk about the want), and when someone wants something and knows it (and therefore is able to talk about it). Since what goes on in humans is sometimes not known to them, it follows that what someone wants is sometimes unconscious (unreflective) and can be determined only indirectly from complex and numerous observations of what the person does.</p>
<p>It is possible that, at least, parts of what can be said about psychological phenomena involve contingent and valid a priori knowledge. This seems to be the case with the category of <italic>wanting</italic>, which appears to be universally present in humans. Everyone always <italic>wants</italic> something. Hence, it should be possible to develop a general psychology, by way of explicating what we already know a priori also with respect to other basic concepts than <italic>want</italic>. This is attempted in the last part of this trilogy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959354312441277">Smedslund, 2012</xref>). The existence of shared a priori assumptions can only be decided by consensus. If everyone agrees that human behavior is nearly always purposive, so be it, until something convinces us of the contrary. (For a summary of a number of studies of consensus about some of our contingent a priori psychological knowledge, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959354312441277">Smedslund, 2002</xref>. The results generally show close approximations to complete consensus.)</p>
<p>Another problem that should be mentioned has to do with the meaning of the term <italic>know</italic>. On the one hand, philosophers tend to regard this as a complex and difficult concept. On the other hand, the tradition from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959354312441277">Wierzbicka (1996)</xref> treats the term <italic>know</italic> as a <italic>semantic primitive</italic>, and, hence, only circularly definable. The detailed problems involved cannot be pursued here. However, the reader is reminded that <italic>know</italic> is used at two levels in this article. On the one hand, it is used as a semantic primitive, as in “I <italic>know</italic> that she has two children.” This refers to a <italic>conviction</italic> that something really is the case, and therefore can be taken for granted. However, it does not strictly imply that what one knows really is the case. On the other hand, the term to <italic>know</italic> is used at the meta-level, for example in “<italic>a priori</italic> knowledge.” Here the term not only indicates that someone has such knowledge, but also that this knowledge is valid.</p>
<p>Mainstream psychologists typically assume or hope that the results from their empirical studies can be generalized and applied to practice, disregarding the already-mentioned features of psychological processes, notably that they are context-sensitive and irreversible. “Context-sensitive” means that a psychological process is influenced by the indefinitely complex surroundings, and “irreversible” means that one can never return to an earlier state. What is learned cannot be completely undone. Therefore, processes postulated by psychologists are different from processes postulated by natural scientists. A physical regularity is such that A is always followed by B, given a context consisting of a small number of variables, whereas a psychological regularity exists only as long as an indefinitely complex context is unchanged, and as long as what happens after an act is the same. Therefore, in psychology, even exactly the same momentary conditions may lead to two different acts because of a difference in what has happened before. This, again, means that the prospects of generalization in psychology are, in principle, uncertain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959354312441277">Smedslund, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The preceding considerations lead to an apparent dilemma. If there are no fixed laws that determine how a person behaves under given conditions, how can one state anything with any degree of certainty in psychological practice? The answer is that this can happen only within concrete situations where a psychologist can rely on extensive knowledge of the current state of specific individuals and situations, in addition to the general knowledge about human nature and the given language and culture. The knowledge about human nature is not about details of how people behave, but about the kind of beings they are. One cannot know a priori what a person will want, think, feel, and do in a given situation, but only that he or she always will want, think, feel, and do something. Predictability is limited also because, not only do people change because of what they experience, but what they experience is composed partly of events that, being fortuitous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959354312441277">Bandura, 1982</xref>), are simply unpredictable.</p>
<p>Psychological practice must be informed by this knowledge. When encountering a new client, the psychologist knows that it is, in principle, impossible to know anything detailed about the person in advance, except for what follows from being human, and except for his or her presumed mastery of a certain language and a certain culture. When encountering people from an unknown culture and with an unknown language, only the general knowledge about human beings can be taken for granted. Mastery of culture and language is also a necessary condition for interacting and communicating with a client. In order to learn about the client’s problems and situation, the psychologist, consequently, must enter interaction with the client without too many preconceptions about what might be discovered. In summary, the psychologist always has to work with new people and environments, and there are no prospects of accumulating useful knowledge, except in a limited and transitory sense, relating to language, culture, local conditions, and specific individuals and their surroundings as they are at a given time.</p>
<p>Before proceeding, it is finally necessary to comment briefly on a question concerning the relation of language to reality that pertains to the present approach. Many psychologists may regard psychological terms as polysemous and incapable of generally acceptable definition. The tradition from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959354312441277">Wierzbicka (1996)</xref> denies this and states that all ordinary words are ultimately composed of semantic primitives and are definable in terms of these. I have discussed this problem elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959354312441277">Smedslund, 2011</xref>). Let me just repeat here that, on the one hand, it is hard to understand the utility of words unless they carry a fixed meaning-component. On the other hand, it is easy to accept that word meaning is also immensely variable, according to context. From a theoretical point of view, this age-old problem can be resolved if we accept that ordinary words <italic>do</italic> have a fixed meaning, but that this meaning <italic>cannot</italic> be stated in words. We know when a word applies, but we do not always know why. From a practical point of view, one can either simply accept that words cannot be defined (what does it mean to use the same word “beauty” about a woman and a flower?), or one can escape from ordinary language into a technical psychological one, where words <italic>are</italic> explicitly defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959354312441277">Parrott &amp; Harré, 1991</xref>). The latter alternative is chosen here and, generally, in <italic>psycho-logic</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959354312441277">Smedslund, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>I have now described a meta-theoretical view that I take to be necessary for understanding psychological practice. It differs from the traditional view in psychological textbooks in that it emphasizes the existence of some a priori and contingent general knowledge about persons, and also that psychological processes are context-sensitive and irreversible, purposive, and influenced by chance events. Even given the general knowledge of humans, and the knowledge of the relevant language and culture, effective prediction and control at the individual level are only possible with concrete, unique persons in their concrete, unique life-situations. In this sense, psychology may indeed be what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959354312441277">Lévi-Strauss (1962/1966)</xref> called “a science of the concrete.”</p>
<p>What we all know about being human is described in some detail in the third part of this trilogy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959354312441277">Smedslund, 2012</xref>), in the form of an axiomatic system (<italic>psycho-logic</italic>). This is a system that can be briefly characterized as a proposal (hence, normative) to rely on a set of axioms, and a technical psychological language, ultimately based on allegedly primitive semantic universals. The specific content of the psychologist’s knowledge of a (natural) language, a culture, and specific individuals naturally cannot be captured in a general summary. Therefore, it only remains here to state what can, nevertheless, be said in general terms about the <italic>practice</italic> entailed by the <italic>bricoleur</italic> model. It differs from varieties of already ongoing practice mainly by what is presupposed and acknowledged, and is intended to remove the stigma of being “unscientific” from those who do not embrace the currently dominant scientist-practitioner model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959354312441277">Baker et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0959354312441277">
<title>Characterization of psychological treatment</title>
<p>Above, I have described the a priori contingent epistemological status of what we know about persons in general, and also mentioned the other two sources of knowledge that the practitioner can draw on, namely knowledge of a specific language and culture, and of individual cases. I have also described the limits to predictability that arise because people are context-sensitive, because they constantly learn, and because of the fortuitous nature of what they learn about.</p>
<p>I now turn to a brief overview of the professional work of the psychologist-<italic>bricoleur</italic>, with some emphasis on what distinguishes it from many other practices. After that, I describe the three main projects that can be seen as embedded in all psychological practice. In what follows, I have, with some hesitation, chosen to use the more general term “client” rather than the term “patient,” since this article is intended to cover also those parts of psychological practice that are not directly concerned with individuals, but with, for example, organizational problems, negotiations, and policy making. It will be noted that there is much overlap between what a <italic>bricoleur</italic> does and what many practitioners are already doing, because they, without being clearly aware of it, have also recognized the limitations of predictability already described. However, the <italic>bricoleur</italic> model makes explicit why one <italic>must</italic> work in certain ways.</p>
<p>People seek assistance from psychologists when confronted with problems of living that they have been unable to overcome. In general, this means that conventional corrective methods have not worked. Reassurance has not eliminated anxiety, consolation has not cured depression, admonition has not restored self-control, and instruction has not led to learning. Hence, the psychologist-<italic>bricoleur</italic> must resort to more elaborate and sometimes unconventional procedures.</p>
<p>Although the unconventional, prima facie, cannot be reduced to any definite rules, it is, nevertheless, possible to discern some general features also in the work of a <italic>bricoleur</italic>. A person wants to be accepted as a member of a social group. People who seek psychological help almost always have persistent problems in their social life, and, therefore, experience uncertainty and concern about their membership and position in their group. This also includes a threatened self-esteem. In order to ease the problems of the client, the psychologist must usually pursue three tightly interrelated projects, namely building a trusting relation with the client, helping to modify the client’s ways, and helping to modify the client’s surroundings.</p>
<p>How should the practitioner proceed when encountering a new client? In daily life, when we encounter new persons and new situations, we normally attempt to capitalize on previous experience. This means assigning the person and the situation to types and categories and trying to apply well-known procedures and strategies. This may distort the process of getting to know the individual person and the unique circumstances in sufficient detail for the professional purpose. In mainstream clinical psychology, the everyday approach is merely further developed by relying on tests and treatment manuals. These may also distort the picture of the individual client by simplifying it and by ignoring the detailed special circumstances. These features of mainstream practice result from our engrained predilection to generalize from earlier experience, but this collides with the stubborn fact that the unique simply cannot be anticipated. The prominent role of the unique in psychology stems from the fact that people learn from experiences filled with fortuitous events (and also that they are constituted by a fortuitous mixture of genetic dispositions). Hence, the practitioner <italic>must</italic> rely on a strategy of taking as little as possible for granted, and retain a maximal openness and sensitivity to what is encountered in talking with the client and with important surrounding persons. Patience is also required in order to let the new impressions organize into a coherent picture. As is known from everyday life, humans are endowed both with an ability to get to know unique individuals and circumstances, and with an ability, and a predilection, to try to transcend the single case, and look for relatively context-free or abstract knowledge. Both abilities are probably valuable from an evolutionary perspective. However, in the case of psychological practice, one works with behavior that often does <italic>not</italic> fit into one’s general categories, and where there is <italic>no</italic> generally valid method of solution.</p>
<p>The strategy of the psychologist-<italic>bricoleur</italic> is an adaptation to this special work situation. The only way to get to know a unique client is to enter interaction with him or her with an open, maximally unprejudiced attitude. Relevant knowledge cannot be achieved without personal interaction, because a person is also a socially interacting entity. A person is partly constituted by the way he or she interacts with others. This means that passive observation and registration (testing) cannot yield sufficient understanding, and that the psychologist must be active in order to get to understand the client. At the same time the psychologist must establish him- or herself as a person who can be trusted by the client: that is, as caring, respectful, understanding, as well as being independent, having self-control, and having relevant know-how. These appear to be the necessary, and jointly sufficient, conditions of personal trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959354312441277">Smedslund, 1997</xref>). Achieving this creates a safe interpersonal situation where the client can proceed to explore alternative ways and means. All the time, the psychologist must maintain a professional attitude, which simply means trying to help the client, and not letting other considerations or personal interests interfere.</p>
<p>How to get the client to experience the psychologist as reliable and professional cannot be generally formulated. Neither can the actual interaction be subsumed under simple categories. All levels of information are taken in—what is said, how it is said, what is not said, what is non-verbally expressed, what is not non-verbally expressed, how the psychologist really feels, what kind of personal relation is beginning to grow, what the meaning of the exchanges is, and so on. Uniqueness is important since it determines how one can get to know and treat a person. The special characteristics and circumstances that make a difference in the client’s life-situation and problems need to be noticed and taken into account.</p>
<p>A number of general aspects of the treatment process could also have been discussed here—for example, the central role of <italic>wondering</italic>, the reluctance to give <italic>advice</italic>, and many others—but this would transcend the available space. Finally it should be mentioned that, irrespective of how the dialogue unfolds, the psychologist can occasionally become the target of anger, ridicule, and rejection. How this is handled, again, influences the development of the relation and the building of trust.</p>
<p>In the complex and often confusing treatment process one can, nevertheless, always discern these three projects: trust-building, modification of the client’s behavior, and modification of the client’s surroundings. These are not exclusive to the <italic>bricoleur</italic> model, but the ways in which they are executed are influenced by the model.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0959354312441277">
<title>Working to build trust</title>
<p>According to analyses of the conditions of trust already mentioned here, and reported in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959354312441277">Smedslund, 1997</xref>), the psychologist should be <italic>caring, understanding, respectful</italic>, and have <italic>own-control</italic> (independence), <italic>self-control</italic>, and relevant <italic>know-how</italic>. All these can be shown to be <italic>logically necessary</italic> for the achievement of trust, given a definition of trust as “<italic>P trusts O, if, and only if, P thinks that O will avoid doing anything bad to P</italic>,” given definitions of all the other terms involved, and given the axiom “<italic>P thinks that O can do something bad to P</italic>.”</p>
<p>Psychologists must also be able to trust their clients, and this raises related questions. The psychologist must not be too personally uncertain. He or she needs to remain open and confident and to tolerate rejection. These, and more detailed, analyses of trust can be derived from psycho-logic, which is an attempt to summarize our knowledge of humans in general, and hence is an integral part of the <italic>bricoleur</italic> model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959354312441277">Smedslund, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Most clients can be expected to behave in socially acceptable ways and treat their therapist with some care, understanding, and respect. However, since the nature of the task (determining and solving the problem) requires the psychologist to interact with the client, he or she must be prepared to be disliked and verbally attacked, and even become a victim of rumors, or sued for malpractice. In subtle ways, a client may also show that he/she is not impressed with and touched by the therapist’s efforts. The client may also be moved by the treatment situation to pretend this. In both cases it may provoke a potentially disturbing fear in the psychologist of being rejected as a professional and as a person. This is a possibility in all therapies, even though, superficially, psychologists may appear to be protected by high professional status and by being exempted from insight into their private lives.</p>
<p>The preceding illuminates that the building of mutual trust cannot be understood as a matter of applying impersonal technical rules. The <italic>bricoleur</italic> model entails interaction with clients and, therefore, the predilections and limitations of therapists inevitably become important. Psychological practice is personal, and it follows that the education of psychologists cannot be a matter of reading and technical training alone.</p>
<p>The status of the project of establishing trust can be stated as follows: Establishing a trusting relationship between psychologist and client appears to be a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for successful treatment. It is necessary because, if the client does not trust the psychologist, the client will be preoccupied with attempting to avoid being harmed by the psychologist, notably by avoiding difficult matters and by not daring to try out new thoughts and behaviors. However, not to learn anything new also means no change. Therefore, the client must trust the psychologist in order to learn. Conversely, if the psychologist does not trust the client, the psychologist may become preoccupied with attempting to avoid being harmed by the client, for example by hiding behind his or her professional status, and thereby not being able to pursue the treatment with engagement and concentration. The establishment of mutual trust, often called “therapeutic alliance,” is a subtle and multifaceted, but necessary process.</p>
<p>The different specific reasons for mistrust on both sides all have a widespread effect. This is the case because keeping track of <italic>when</italic>, and <italic>if</italic>, the other person is really caring, understanding, and so on, is nearly impossible, since it presupposes that one can keep track of the other person’s state at every moment. This is probably never the case. Therefore, trust in this context must always be a relatively generalized and stable state.</p>
<p>Mutual trust, although necessary, is not a sufficient condition for successful treatment because it does not ensure (a) that ways of modifying the client’s behavior can be found and implemented and (b) that a changed behavior in the treatment situation can be transferred to, and maintained in, the outside world.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0959354312441277">
<title>Modification of the client’s way of functioning</title>
<p>The second general project embedded in the treatment process is the modification of the client’s behavior. In parallel to building trust, the psychologist attempts to instigate change. Although the work may proceed in indefinitely many ways, the starting point is nearly always this: The client is situated in a difficult subjective life-situation with no visible exit and the psychologist must attempt to understand the exact content of this, in order to fully grasp the client’s dilemma in all its ramifications. The psychologist listens carefully, and, by gentle and tentative <italic>wondering</italic>, invites the client to formulate and think about the possibilities that successively emerge from the ongoing dialogue. The wondering should be non-directive in the sense that it should reflect openness to how the client perceives and evaluates the alternatives, and a recognition that only the client is able to fully sense what is at the moment possible and impossible. The status of this strategy can be formulated as follows: <italic>Non-directive wondering about meanings and outcomes is likely to be a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for successful treatment</italic>. If the psychologist does <italic>not</italic> contribute by wondering about meanings and outcomes, he or she does not provide the client with new opportunities for discovering ways out of a stalemated position, and therefore the treatment is less likely to be successful. If the psychologist is <italic>directive—</italic>that is, prescribes or advocates solutions—the client may be left with ways of perceiving and acting ultimately based on the psychologist’s rather than the client’s own view of the situation. This type of intervention cannot provide an adequate foundation for how to proceed, because it is almost impossible to tailor a suggested change to fit the client’s total and complex subjective situation. It is also very hard to manage new, finely tuned social interactions by following another person’s instructions. Finally, clients often have low self-esteem, and this may become even lower in directive therapy, both because the psychologist’s advice and directions imply that the psychologist knows better, and that the client is incompetent, and because, as already suggested, the client is quite likely to fail and be hurt.</p>
<p>The psychologist’s non-directive wondering about alternatives invites exploration and discussion and may encourage new possibilities. It acknowledges that the therapist cannot know the client well enough to see all possible roads ahead and every possible obstacle. It continuously affirms that the client is the best expert on him- or herself. Only in very simple non-social conditions, such as treatment of snake or spider phobias, is it possible to be directive and authoritative without likely detrimental side-effects on the client’s self-esteem.</p>
<p>By a persistent gentle, honest, and respectful wondering one may engage the client in thinking about his or her situation in possible new ways. There seem to be few alternatives to this approach because authoritative or confronting strategies can and do place clients in unacceptable or ultimately unmanageable situations, and can be disastrous to their self-esteem. Such strategies may also represent hubris on part of the psychologist.</p>
<p>The wondering includes a good portion of creativity on the part of the psychologist, inspired by the unique situation, and unbounded by diagnostic tests and treatment manuals. This corresponds to Lévi-Strauss’s original <italic>bricoleur</italic> letting his eyes rove around the barn and discovering a possible object suitable for the technical problem at hand. The difference is that, in psychological treatment, the creativity is equally on the side of the client, and the psychologist’s ideas are of value only when they trigger or nourish the client’s imagination. The process can only be understood as one of collaboration and mutual inspiration rather than a one-way simple influence on a passive recipient.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0959354312441277">
<title>Modification of the client’s surroundings</title>
<p>We now turn to a third project potentially present in nearly every treatment, namely modification of the surrounding system of which the client is a part. Persons are socialized into linguistic and cultural groups and function in interaction with other persons in these groups. When people consult a psychologist, it is very frequently because they have not been able to cope with living in their current social surroundings. This means that the problems of the client often mirror features of the particular circumstances they have been subjected to, and live in. The status of this part-project in the treatment process can be stated as follows: <italic>Ensuring that the client’s surroundings can sustain a client’s improved personal functioning is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for successful treatment</italic>. If the client’s surroundings turn out <italic>not</italic> to sustain the client’s improved personal functioning in the treatment situation, the treatment has not been successful. Hence, this is a necessary condition. Examples of this kind of intervention are abundant in child psychology, when family therapy, or transfer to a new school, or a foster home, can have discernible effects. However, also in adults, changes in situation can be useful. An example is the case of a young man who developed paranoid delusions from living in almost total isolation because he had rotting teeth and a dentist phobia. He was provided with new teeth, which ended the isolation, and also the delusions.</p>
<p>However, optimal social conditions outside a treatment situation are not a sufficient condition for success. This is shown when the psychologist fails to find ways to modify the client’s behavior. Then no change occurs, even though the surroundings outside the treatment situation are potentially favorable to improved functioning. There may also be cases where the client has come to function better in the treatment situation, but does not manage to transfer this to ordinary situations in the outside world.</p>
<p>The lack of suitable post-treatment environments is a generally recognized problem in the treatment of children, refugees, and addicts, but it is also a relevant concern in other treatments. Establishment of trust between a child and the psychologist is to little avail if the family situation is detrimental to any trusting relations. Even in adults, individual treatment may have limited or no success if the marital or other personal relations are too unfavorable. It follows that a successful treatment can come about only if a client manages to change his or her social life in desired directions.</p>
<p>Modification of the client’s surroundings is one example of the freedom offered by the <italic>bricoleur</italic> model. The psychologist may discover a way of achieving the goal of the treatment without the conventional isolated focus on the client. This is illustrated by the case mentioned above of the young man with delusions and rotting teeth. This was an example of where the <italic>bricoleur</italic> approach differs from many other models of treatment.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The <italic>bricoleur</italic> model is an attempt to describe how psychologists must practice, given that they, all the time, are confronted with new unique persons in unique life contexts. The complexity and unpredictability of human beings and their circumstances, in my view, discourages attempts to apply diagnostic systems and standard techniques.</p>
<p>The reader will recognize that I have described general features of how many psychologists today actually practice, while not taking into account research findings arrived at by statistical methods, diagnostic tests, and therapeutic manuals. My main purpose has been to show why these practitioners should continue to do what they do, and why they need not feel guilty of being “unscientific.”</p>
<p>The thinking presented here differs in the following five points from the currently dominant scientist-practitioner view of clinical psychology well described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959354312441277">Baker et al. (2009)</xref>:</p>
<list id="list1-0959354312441277" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Researchers relying on RCT (randomized control tests) present themselves as representing a scientific approach, and their opponents as less scientific. They take an exclusively empiricist position and do not recognize that the domain of psychological phenomena may be quite inhospitable to empirical generalization, and that natural science methods may not be very suitable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959354312441277">Smedslund, 2009</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The general non-empirical (a priori, contingent) knowledge, as well as the concrete knowledge about persons and circumstances, that we rely on in working with people is rarely mentioned in mainstream literature, including the literature pertaining specifically to clinical psychology. Among the few exceptions in the latter area are <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959354312441277">O’Donohue (1989)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959354312441277">Bergner (2006)</xref>. Most authors write as if what we all know implicitly about human behavior is of no scientific interest and value. Only if it is empirically tested in controlled studies does it, in their view, achieve the status of scientific knowledge. But an empirical test of, for example, the assumption that all persons who trust someone think that this other person understands them cannot strengthen or weaken this assumption, since it is necessarily true, and outcomes can merely show that the methods used are, or are not, reliable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959354312441277">Smedslund, 1997</xref>, p. 70). If the predictions were not verified, and it were found that people mostly tend to trust persons they think <italic>don’t</italic> understand them, we would not accept the findings, and would look for weaknesses in the procedure. This and numerous other connections are not empirical, but conceptual.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The specific characteristics of psychological phenomena that make them relatively inhospitable to empirical generalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959354312441277">Smedslund, 2009</xref>) are also rarely mentioned. Persons are open, irreversible systems, and hence do not function according to general laws. They repeat a performance only as long as it leads to the same outcome and as long as they want that outcome, which means as long as the relevant context is unchanged. The idea of a cumulative empirical science is implicitly based on taking for granted that relevant contexts are stable. Hence, many average results may, for example, hold up only as long as the data continue to be produced by American undergraduate college students confronted with the usual type of standardized materials and procedures, or come from similar environments and populations in other countries. However, such results do not reflect a truly accumulating knowledge basis, but only the relative stability of human shared meaning systems. Already the first experimental work by Ebbinghaus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959354312441277">1885/1983</xref>) revealed the indefinitely high number of factors potentially capable of influencing the results, and the unsolvable problem of keeping everything constant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354312441277">Smedslund, 1987</xref>). The impression of a cumulative science is maintained only by keeping the populations and conditions within certain limits. Even within these limits, there has been some recognition that generalizations fail because of the number of influential factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959354312441277">Roediger, 2008</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It is seldom recognized that the modest statistical regularities that can be found mostly stem from people’s participation in shared meaning systems (language and culture). These regularities that follow from the meanings of the terms involved, and from necessary general assumptions, are already implicitly known to all participants in a given meaning system and, hence, research on them is <italic>pseudo-empirical</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959354312441277">Smedslund, 1991</xref>). This means that although the researchers think they are doing empirical work, their main hypotheses are actually derived from the shared meaning system and cannot be false. The researchers select hypotheses because they think they are true. The large majority of verified hypotheses in published studies also accord with this, and falsifications are rarely published because they are explained by the failure of some local auxiliary hypotheses (about procedure and/or context). General psychological theories also tend to be pseudo-empirical and can be shown to follow logically from the shared meanings of words and self-evident general premises. Bandura’s theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354312441277">Smedslund, 1978</xref>) is a typical example of this. (Reviews of the literature indicating an occurrence of pseudo-empirical studies can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959354312441277">Smedslund, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959354312441277">2002</xref>.)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Statistics are not only seen as supporting theories and hypotheses, but are also thought to be valuable in guiding practical interventions. One appears to rely heavily on an analogy to medicine, since medicines are recommended when treatments show statistically better results than control groups, and one does not mention that the number and changeability of relevant factors are much larger in psychology than in medicine. In medicine, one can often prescribe a particular medication after considering only a moderate number of clearly defined and possibly relevant factors. In psychology, one must establish a working alliance with a person in a life-situation consisting of an indefinite number of unique and complexly structured circumstances. The difference in complexity of the foundations for an intervention in the two disciplines is not merely a matter of degree, but, in my view, necessitates a difference in strategy. Consider the three-part projects of psychological treatment: establishing an alliance (trust), discovering effective ways to modify the individual’s functioning, and discovering effective ways to modify the surroundings. In medicine, achieving a working alliance may be important as a context, but in psychology it is frequently an integral and even central part of the treatment itself. In medicine, discovering effective ways of treatment is often a matter of selection from a relatively limited number of well-defined and empirically supported options. In psychology, the indefinite variability of persons and situations requires indefinitely variable interventions, since the interventions must be tailored to the individual case, to a much larger extent than in medicine. Finally, the modification of the surroundings, although relevant in both areas, is much more complicated in psychology.</p></list-item>

<p>In this article, I have expressed and argued for my belief that in psychological practice we are partly relying on some knowledge that is not empirically based and yet valid. We know much about other human beings by virtue of being human, and attempts to deny or even question this knowledge make little sense. It must be taken to be self-evident. Taking into account the general functions of human beings and their linguistic and cultural context, the psychologist must work with the unique and fortuitous, and this challenge can only be met with a maximally open and maximally creative attitude.</p>
<p>Formulations of what is obviously true can be assembled into an explicit system, in order to be of predictive use and to allow us to discover less obvious connections. Among the first psychologists to undertake the project of explaining the obvious (common sense) was Fritz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959354312441277">Heider (1958)</xref>, and his work is continued in <italic>psycho-logic</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959354312441277">Smedslund, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959354312441277">1997</xref>). However, most of the practical work dealing with unique individuals in unique situations cannot be generally characterized, and must be the subject of creative <italic>bricolage</italic>.</p>
<p>The call for “evidence-based practice” (Baker et al., 2006) has brought to light deep problems that have been too long ignored. We can now recognize, and must investigate, the chasm between an RCT-centered academic psychology and practitioners who must be psychologist-<italic>bricoleurs</italic> because of the nature of the task, and who are searching for a different kind of scientific understanding.</p>
