<p>An effective strategy was developed to fabricate a supramolecular hydrogel with the complexation of α-cyclodextrins (α-CDs) and monoend-functionalized low molecular weight methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG, Mn=2000) micelles. Hydrophobic cinnamic acid was immobilized on methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) via L-lysine as linker to prepare amphiphilic mPEG. The monoend-functionalized mPEG self-assembled micelles in aqueous solution. The size and size distribution of the micelles were tested by dynamic laser scattering (DLS). The morphology of the micelles was observed by SEM, TEM and AFM. The critical micelle concentration (CMC) was tested and it was 42.5 mg/L. The monodisperse micelles had core-shell structure and the mean diameter was around 40 nanometers. α-cyclodextrins were added in the suspension of micelles to form supramolecular hydrogel with the polypseudorotaxanes complexation. Hydrophilic drug doxorubicin hydrochloride was used as model drug to study the release profile. The results showed that the hydrogel was a promising carrier for drug delivery.</p>

<p>In recent years, supramolecular hydrogels have attracted considerable attention because of their potential applications in drug delivery and tissue engineering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328211405246">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211405246"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328211405246"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328211405246"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328211405246"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328211405246"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328211405246">7</xref>]. Design and construction of supramolecular hydrogels systems through host–guest interaction have been extensively studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328211405246">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328211405246"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328211405246"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328211405246"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328211405246">12</xref>]. Cyclodextrins (CDs) are widely-recognized as hosts to form inclusion complex with guest molecules via non-covalent interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328211405246">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328211405246"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328211405246"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328211405246"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328211405246"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328211405246">18</xref>]. The driven forces for the complexation were considered as intermolecular hydrogen bonding between neighboring CDs as well as steric compatibility and hydrophobic interactions between host and guest molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328211405246">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885328211405246"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328211405246"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328211405246">22</xref>]. The inclusion complexes composed of CDs and polymers were called polypseudorotaxanes or polyrotaxanes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328211405246">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885328211405246">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328211405246"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885328211405246"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328211405246"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328211405246">27</xref>]. The complexation could be used to fabricate supramolecular hydrogels for medical applications. Yui et al. synthesized PEG/α-CD polyrotaxanes capped with amino acids, polypeptides and oligopeptides, which were used as biodegradable drug carriers or stimuli responsive hydrogels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885328211405246">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885328211405246">29</xref>]. Huh et al. prepared the graft copolymers containing dextran as backbones and PEG or PPG as side chains, while the CDs were threaded into PEG or PPG chains to form hydrogel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0885328211405246">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0885328211405246">31</xref>]. PEG with high molecular weight was considered as a necessity for the formation of stable hydrogels. Li and coworkers firstly reported the sol-gel transition during complex formation between α-CD and high molecular weight PEG in aqueous solution in 1994 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0885328211405246">32</xref>]. A thermo-reversible polyrotaxane hydrogel containing high molecular weight PEG and methylated α-CD was studied by Kataoka et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0885328211405246">33</xref>]. It was known that PEG with high molecular weight (normally Mn&gt;10K) was unfavorable for ﬁltration through the human kidney membrane due to their large hydrodynamic radius and easiness of forming crystals of stoichiometric complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0885328211405246">34</xref>]. Therefore, low molecular weight PEG based supramolecular hydrogels were desirable for pharmaceutical or medicinal applications. Jiang and coworkers utilized micelle-hydrogel transition approach to fabricate supramolecular hydrogel. The micelles of inclusion complex of adamantane and monoend-functionalized PEG were transited to hydrogel with the addition of α-cyclodextrins. Low molecular weight PEG of Mn=2000 was used in the transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0885328211405246">35</xref>].</p>
<p>In our previous work, polypseudorotaxane based supramolecular hydrogel containing mPEG grafted (Mn=750 and 2000) poly(L-malic acid) with comb-like architecture and α-cyclodextrins were prepared and used for anti-tumor drug delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0885328211405246">36</xref>]. In the present work, a new supramolecular hydrogel was reported using micelle-hydrogel transition approach. Hydrophobic moiety cinnamic acid was connected to mPEG2000 using L-lysine as linkers. The amphiphilic mPEG spontaneously self-assembled into micelles in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) solution. With the addition of α-cyclodextrins, the micelles were transited to hydrogel. The structures and properties of micelles and the hydrogel were characterized. Preliminary investigations of cytotoxicity and release profile of the hydrogel for drug delivery were also reported.</p>

(Chengdu, China). All the solvents were used without further purification except DMF and CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>Characterizations. <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance II NMR spectrometer at 400 MHz using CDCl<sub>3</sub> and DMSO as solvents with 0.5% tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. The CMC of the amphiphilic mPEG was determined with fluorescence spectroscopy (F-7000, Hitachi). The dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were performed at 25 °C on a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS at the scattering angle θ=90°. The morphology observation of the micelles was performed by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) (MFP-3D-BIO, Asylum Research), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) (S-4800, HITACHI), and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) (H-600 Electron Microscope). A drop of micelle solution (0.1 mg/mL) was deposited onto mica and copper grids to prepare the specimens for AFM, SEM and TEM. The specimens were air-dried. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out in dynamic nitrogen atmosphere using the Netzsch STA499C system. The heating temperature was programmed from 35 to 600°C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed on TA DSC Q2000 Differential Scanning Calorimeter. The measurement procedure was as follows: the samples were heated from room temperature to 150°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min and kept at 150°C for 2 min (to eliminate the thermal history). The samples were then cooled to −90°C with a cooling rate of 10°C/min. After remaining for 2 min, the samples were heated to 150°C again at a heating rate of 10°C/min. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out on Philips X’ Pert pro MPD with Cu Kα (ν=0.154nm) radiation source, the supplied voltage and current were set to 40 KV and 25 mA, respectively. The samples were mounted on a sample holder and scanned from 2° to 50° at a step size of 0.02°. Turbidity measurements were carried out on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 650S UV-vis spectrophotometer at a ﬁxed wavelength of 550 nm at room temperature. For the SEM observations, the specimens were freeze dried under vacuum. The dried specimens were coated with gold vapor and analyzed on a Hitachi S-4800 electron microscope.</p>
<p>Synthesis of Methyl L-lysinate dihydrochloride (Lys-OMe·2HCl)·L-Lysine dihydrochloride (5 g, 27 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (50 mL) and the solution was cooled in an ice bath.

After 12 hours’ stirring, the mixture was concentrated in vacuum system, and precipitated in excess cold diethyl ether. The product was separated by filtration and dried at room temperature in vacuum overnight.</p>
<p>Synthesis of Double-Cinnamic Methyl L-lysine Lys-OMe·2HCl (10 mmol), Cinnamic acid (40 mmol), HOBT (20 mmol) and HBTU (20 mmol) were dissolved in 40 mL DMF and the solution was cooled in an ice bath. Subsequently, DIEA (0.1 mol) was added dropwise into the solution under stirring. After stirred at room temperature for 24 hours, the solvent was removed by rotatory evaporator. The crude product was dissolved in 50 mL CHCl<sub>3</sub> and then washed with saturated NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, NaHSO<sub>4</sub>, brine solutions, respectively. After being dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, the product was evaporated to pale yellow oil. The crude product was purified by column chromatography. The product was then precipitated in excess cold diethyl ether, collected by filtration and vacuum-dried. <sup>1</sup>H NMR (DMSO, δ): 8.49 (d, 1H, 8’), 8.14 (t, 1H, 8), 6.73 (d, 1H, 7’), 6.60 (d, 1H, 7), 4.36 (q, 1H, 5), 3.65 (s, 3H, -COOCH<sub>3</sub>).

<p>Deprotection of the Methyl groups on was dissolved in methanol (2 mL) and the solution was cooled in an ice bath. Subsequently, 1M NaOH aqueous solution (2 mL) was added dropwise into the mixture and stirred at room temperature for 12 hours. Methanol in the mixture was removed using rotatory evaporator. 1M HCl was then added into the aqueous solution under stirring to maintain the pH at 2. White powder was separated by filtration and washed with deionized water. Finally, the powder was dried at room temperature in vacuum overnight. <sup>1</sup>H NMR (DMSO, δ): 12.61 (brs, 1H, -COOH), 8.36 (d, 1H, 8’), 8.12 (t, 1H, 8), 6.75 (d, 1H, 7’), 6.61 (d, 1H, 7), 4.32 (q, 1H, 5).

<p>Synthesis of DCIN-Lys-mPEG2000. DCC (0.111 g, 0.54 mmol) was added in the dichloromethane (CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mL) solution containing alpha-methoxy-ω-amino-poly(ethylene glycol) (mPEGNH<sub>2</sub>, Mw: 2000 g/mol) (0.6g, 0.3mmol), 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) (0.02 g, 0.18 mmol) and DCIN-Lys (0.18 g, 0.36 mmol). The mixture was stirred under nitrogen at room temperature for 24 h. The reaction was stopped by addition of deionized water (0.5 mL). After the removal of solvent, the residual oil was poured into anhydrous diethyl ether. The white precipitate was filtered and washed with diethyl ether. The product was recrystallized in ethanol and vacuum-dried. The product was dissolved in deionized water and dialyzed against deionized water using a dialysis membrane (MWCO 2000). After three days’ dialysis, the solution inside the membrane was freeze-dried (yield=90%). <sup>1</sup>H NMR (CDCl<sub>3</sub>, δ): 7.64 (d, 1H, 8’), 7.61 (t, 1H, 8), 6.60 (d, 1H, 7’), 6.52 (d, 1H, 7), 4.54 (q, 1H, 5), 3.38 (s, 3H, -OCH<sub>3</sub>). The number like 8’ was on behalf of the protons as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328211405246">Figure 1</xref>.</p>
<p>Formation of Hydrogels. General process for the hydrogel formation is as follows: 1 mL aqueous solution of α-CD (200 mg/mL) was added in 1 mL 50 mg/mL aqueous solution of DCIN-Lys-mPEG2000. The gelation was accelerated by sonication.</p>
<p>Cytotoxicity Tests. Mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts NIH/3T3 were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM; Gibco) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco). The cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 95% air at 37°C. Extracts for indirect tests were prepared in accordance with International Organization for Standardization (ISO) tests (ISO 10993-5). The hydrogels were extracted using complete culture medium at 37°C for 24 h. The complete culture medium was used as control. The extracts from 0.15, 0.10, and 0.05 g/mL dilutions were added to NIH/3T3 cells that seeded in 96-multiwell plates. After incubated for 24 h, the cultures were evaluated for cell viability by MTT assay. The culture medium was replaced with 0.1 mL/well of MTT solution (1 mg/mL). After 3 h of incubation at 37°C, the solution was removed and 0.1 mL/well of DMSO was added. The absorbance of the formazan product was then measured at a wavelength of 492 nm.</p>
<p><italic>In vitro</italic> drug release. The <italic>In vitro</italic> release profile was performed in a similar manner as reported by Jeong et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0885328211405246">37</xref>]. Briefly, 12.5 mg DCIN-Lys-mPEG2000 was dissolved in 0.25 mL 0.2 mg/mL DOX·HCl PBS solution (pH=7.4), 50 mg α-CD was dissolved in 0.25 mL PBS solution (pH=7.4). The gelation was occurred within several minutes after mixing in screw-capped test tubes. The hydrogel was stood in refrigerator overnight, and then 5 mL PBS was introduced and the tubes were incubated at 37°C. At regular intervals, 1 mL supernatant liquid was withdrawn and replenished with 1 mL fresh PBS. Absorbance of the released DOX·HCl was read at 480 nm in fluorescence spectroscopy (F-7000, Hitachi). All experiments were done in triplicate.</p>
<p>Statistical Analysis. All experiments were conducted in triplicate. Single factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s HSD (honestly significantly different) multiple comparison tests were used to determine statistical significance of results with a 95% confidence interval (α=0.05). The results are reported as means±standard deviation.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0885328211405246" sec-type="results"><title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>Amphiphilic block copolymers were intensively studied to fabricate micelles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0885328211405246">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0885328211405246"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0885328211405246">40</xref>], the balance between hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity was important to the formation of micelles. Unlike traditional polymeric micelles, a new micelles containing amphiphilic PEG with mono-end hydrophobic moiety was synthesized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0885328211405246">scheme 1</xref>). L-lysine was used as linker to connect methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG) and hydrophobic cinnamic acid. Two cinnamic acid molecules were immobilized on the amino groups of L-lysine. The amphiphilic mPEG self-assembled into micelles with cinnamate as hydrophobic core and mPEG as hydrophilic shell.
<fig id="fig14-0885328211405246" position="float"><label>Scheme 1.</label><caption><p>The synthesis and self-assembly of DCIN-Lys-mPEG2000.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0885328211405246-fig14.tif"/></fig>
</p>
<p>The <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra of the amphiphilic PEG were presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328211405246">Figure 1</xref>. In the spectra of DCIN-Lys-OMe, it was noteworthy that the chemical shift of the protons in methyl ester (6, COOC<italic>H</italic><sub>3</sub>) appeared at δ=3.65 ppm. The chemical shifts of protons in L-lysine were around δ=4.36 ppm (5, C<italic>H</italic>COOCH<sub>3</sub>), 3.17 ppm (1, CONHC<italic>H</italic><sub>2</sub>) and 1.35-1.72 ppm (2, 3, 4, C<italic>H</italic><sub>2</sub>C<italic>H</italic><sub>2</sub>C<italic>H</italic><sub>2</sub>). The protons in cinnamate were localized from δ=6 to 9 ppm. The signals of protons in C<italic>H</italic>=C<italic>H</italic> split four peaks. The signals of the protons connected to benzenewere were around δ=8.49 ppm (8’) and 8.14 ppm (8) and the others were around δ=6.73 ppm (7’) and 6.60 ppm (7). The chemical shift of protons in the benzene ring appeared in two sites. The peak at δ=7.55 ppm was attributed to the protons in the <italic>ortho</italic> position, while the protons in the <italic>meta</italic> and <italic>para</italic> position were at δ=7.38 ppm. According to the integrities of the L-lysine units and cinnamate groups, the ratio of lysine/cinnamic was 1/2, which indicated that two cinnamic acid molecules were immobilized on L-lysine.</p>
<p>In the spectra of DCIN-Lys, it was noteworthy that the broad single peak at δ=12.61 ppm was corresponded to the proton in carboxyl group (COO<italic>H</italic>). The protons in methyl ester (6, COOC<italic>H</italic><sub>3</sub>) at δ=3.65 ppm disappeared. It implied that the deprotection was successful. The signal at δ=8.36 ppm was the protons of 8’ which shifted from 8.49 ppm (in the spectrum of DCIN-Lys-OMe) to 8.36 ppm. The proton 5 was shifted from δ=4.36 ppm to 4.32 ppm. The other peaks were not obviously changed.</p>
<p>In the spectra of DCIN-Lys-mPEG2000, the protons of 14 and 15 (C<italic>H</italic><sub>2</sub>C<italic>H</italic><sub>2</sub>O) in the PEG chain appeared at δ=3.68 ppm. The chemical shift of the protons in the terminal C<italic>H</italic><sub>3</sub> (16) groups was at δ=3.38 ppm. Because of the solvent change, the chemical shift the protons in C<italic>H</italic>=C<italic>H</italic> was changed dramatically, for example, the shift of the proton 8’ was shifted from δ=8.36 ppm to 7.64 ppm, and that of proton 8 was changed from δ=8.12 ppm to 7.61 ppm. The chemical shift of the proton 7’ and 7 appeared at δ=6.60 ppm and 6.52 ppm, respectively. Protons 5 located at δ=4.54 ppm. The chemical shift of protons in the benzene ring still appeared in two peaks, which appeared at δ=7.46 ppm for <italic>ortho</italic> position and δ=7.32 ppm for <italic>meta</italic> and <italic>para</italic> positions.</p>

The micelles in the photographs were spherical nanoparticles, the sizes of the micelles were different.

<p>As we known, α-CD and low molecular weight PEG could not form homogeneous hydrogel but precipitate which actually comprised crystalline complexes of the PEG/α-CD polypseudorotaxanes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0885328211405246">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0885328211405246">35</xref>]. Two strategies were carried out to prepare a homogeneous hydrogel of α-CD and low molecular weight PEG. One was to reduce the amount of the threaded CDs to avoid the formation of inclusion complex precipitate, and the other was to end-functionalize mPEG to form micelles as the guests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0885328211405246">35</xref>].</p>
<p>The supramolecular hydrogel was obtained after the aqueous solutions of α-cyclodextrins and DCIN-Lys-mPEG2000 micelles were mixed together. The hydrogel was illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0885328211405246">Figure 5</xref>. Sonication could accelerate the gelation process during the hydrogel formation. It was reported that the driving forces for this type hydrogel were the combination of the inclusion complexation between α-CD and PEG chains as well as the aggregation of the hydrophobic moieties in the amphiphilic polymers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328211405246">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328211405246">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0885328211405246">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0885328211405246">42</xref>]. Therefore, the gelation of DCIN-Lys-mPEG2000 micelles and α-CDs was induced by both the microcrystalline domains of the α-CD/PEG inclusion complex and the hydrophobic aggregation domains of cinnamate groups (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0885328211405246">Scheme 2</xref>). Jiang and coworkers reported the similar approach to prepare supramolecular hydrogel, which was called supra-crosslink [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0885328211405246">35</xref>]. With the comparison of Jiang’s approach of adamantane monoend-functionalized low-molecular-weight PEG, DCIN-Lys-mPEG2000 micelles had lower CMC and they were more convenient to form supramolecular hydrogel.

The Td value for α-CDs was 316 °C, while it was 389 °C for DCIN-Lys-mPEG2000. Moreover, the end temperatures of the decomposition were 332 °C and 425 °C.

However, no endothermal peak for DCIN-Lys-mPEG2000 was observed in the heating scan of freeze-dried hydrogel (C), it suggested that the crystallization of PEG was severely limited in the α-CD cavity. In the second heating scan DSC curves, no obvious glass transition was founded, and the glass transitions of PEG became indistinct after the IC formation with α-CD. It could be deduced that the segmental mobility of the guest molecular chain was completely suppressed in the α-CD cavity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328211405246">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328211405246">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328211405246">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0885328211405246">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0885328211405246"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0885328211405246"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0885328211405246">50</xref>].

<p>This work presented a simple and effective approach to prepare supramolecular hydrogel with cinnamate monoend-functionalized low molecular weight mPEG micelles and α-CDs. The critical micelle concentration of amphiphilic mPEG micelles was 42.5 mg/mL. The micelles had core-shell structure and were monodispersed in water. The hydrogel was formed with the addition of α-cyclodextrins. The driving forces for the gelation were both the microcrystalline domains inclusion complexes and the hydrophobic aggregation of cinnamate moieties. The hydrogel was non-toxic and doxorubicin hydrochloride could persistently release from the hydrogel. Thus, the hydrogel is a promising injectable hydrogel used for in-situ therapeutics.</p>
