<abstract>
<p>Embryonal (undifferentiated) sarcoma of the liver (ESL) is a rare malignant neoplasm composed of undifferentiated sarcomatous tissue. We are presenting a case of a 74-year-old woman diagnosed with an ESL arising from a mesenchymal hamartoma of the liver (MHL). Both lesions occur typically in childhood, with only rare reported cases in adults. Histologically, the mass consisted primarily of loose myxoid stroma admixed with bland spindle cells and extensive, cystic (lymphangioma-like) degeneration. However, also present peripherally were markedly atypical cells (including multi-nucleated forms) and hyaline globules. Additionally, atypical cells with a sinusoid tectorial growth pattern were identified, which were positive for CD31, CD34 and Factor VIII. The tumor cells of ESL are classically described as being negative for tissue-specific immunohistochemical markers. However our case demonstrated focal positivity for vascular markers CD31, CD34 and Factor VIII and this along with the sinusoidal tectorial growth pattern, mimicked an angiosarcoma.</p>

<body>
<p>A 74-year-old woman presented with a several-week history of abdominal fullness and abdominal and back pain. A computed tomography scan demonstrated a complex cystic mass arising from the left lobe of the liver measuring 18 × 15 × 13 cm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896911424899">Figure 1</xref>). The radiologic differential diagnosis included cystadenoma, cystadenocarcinoma, and a cystic metastasis. Laboratory testing included serum markers for hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic>, which were negative, and tumor markers for AFP, CA 19-9, and CEA, which were within normal limits. Because of the patient’s abdominal discomfort, a left hepatectomy was performed. The surgical specimen weighed 2080 g and demonstrated a well-delineated but unencapsulated cystic mass measuring 15.0 cm in greatest dimension. The cysts varied in size with the largest cysts measuring up to 7.0 cm in greatest diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1066896911424899">Figure 2</xref>). The cyst lining also varied from translucent to fibrous, with hemorrhagic, clear, and gelatinous cystic contents. A small rim of compressed hepatic parenchyma was visible grossly. Histologically, the bulk of the mass consisted of loose myxoid stroma with admixed bland spindle cells and extensive, cystic (lymphangioma-like) degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1066896911424899">Figure 3</xref>). However, also present, particularly at the interface between the bland mesenchymal mass and residual hepatic rim, were markedly atypical cells that focally invaded the adjacent hepatic parenchyma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1066896911424899">Figure 4</xref>). The cells were hyperchromatic, both epithelioid and spindled, with multinucleated forms also identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1066896911424899">Figure 4</xref>). Numerous intracellular and extracellular PAS+/diastase-resistant hyaline globules of various sizes were distributed throughout the lesion, which were positive by α-1 antitrypsin staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1066896911424899">Figure 5</xref>). Extramedullary hematopiesis was focally present. Additionally, a notable finding at the periphery of the mass was atypical cells identified within sinusoidal spaces in a tectorial growth pattern adjacent to atrophic liver cell plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1066896911424899">Figure 6</xref>). These foci were positive focally for CD31, CD34, and factor VIII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1066896911424899">Figure 7</xref>). All tumor cells were negative for S100, keratin AE1/AE3, and HepPar1. The overall findings were interpreted as an embryonal (undifferentiated) sarcoma of the liver (ESL) with focal angiosarcoma differentiation arising in a mesenchymal hamartoma. The patient was not treated with adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy, but has been undergoing follow-up at short intervals, and in the 9 months since the lesion was resected, there is no evidence of recurrence.</p>

<p>Mesenchymal hamartoma of the liver (MHL) is a rare, benign hamartomatous growth of mesenchymal tissue in the liver that classically presents as a cystic mass. It commonly occurs in children less than 2 years of age with a median age of 10 months. However, 31 cases of mesenchymal hamartomas in adults have been reported in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911424899">1</xref></sup> The clinical presentation of an MHL in an adult is often diffuse abdominal pain, similar to the clinical history of our patient. Yesim et al found that 10 out of 17 adult cases reviewed were symptomatic with abdominal pain at presentation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911424899">2</xref></sup> Although MHL is primarily found in the right lobe in the pediatric population, in adults 40% of cases occurred in the left lobe, as in the present case.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911424899">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>ESL arising from an MHL is an exceptionally rare entity. Like MHL, this lesion occurs most commonly in children and teenagers. We are presenting an ESL that arose in the background of an MHL in a 74-year-old woman. In the past several years, the relationship between ESL and MHL has been further elucidated, with morphologic and genetic similarities between the 2 lesions suggesting a malignant progression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911424899">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911424899">4</xref></sup> It is important to note that these tumors may demonstrate focal histologic and immunohistochemical profiles suggestive of some degree of differentiation, such as angiosarcoma (CD34, CD31, and factor VIII immunoreactivity, as in our case) or α-smooth muscle actin or myogenin immunoreactivity as demonstrated by Zheng et al wherein it was most commonly seen in recurrent tumors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896911424899">5</xref></sup> There have been 2 reported cases of hepatic angiosarcomas arising from an adult MHL, one based on biopsy sampling alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911424899">6</xref></sup> In addition, the resection-based case report documents both bizarre giant cells and eosinophilic globules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896911424899">7</xref></sup> Therefore, it could be argued that these cases may actually represent embryonal (undifferentiated) sarcoma focal with angiosarcoma differentiation. There can be significant overlap between the morphologic and immunohistochemical features of an angiosarcoma and an ESL, as in our case. The pluripotent nature of the malignant cells of ESL may account for the partial vascular/endothelial differentiation demonstrated in these tumors.</p>
