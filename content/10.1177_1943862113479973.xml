<abstract>
<p>Improved childhood cancer survival rates are associated with increasing numbers of patients with neurocognitive impairment. Detrimental cancer treatment effects include declines in IQ, attention, executive function, processing speed, memory, visuospatial, and visuomotor skills, reducing patients’ quality of life and the potential to achieve key life milestones. Music training can improve intelligence, attention, and memory as well as provide a medium for interaction, coping, stress reduction, and improved self-esteem. Given the crossover between the domains impaired by childhood cancer treatment, and improved through music training, there is potential for music-based interventions to minimize detrimental treatment effects. This article reviews the neurocognitive effects of childhood cancer and its treatment, provides a theoretical rationale for offering children with cancer music-based interventions, and suggests strategies that carers may use to extend their intellectual potential and quality of life.</p>

<p>Advances in the treatment of childhood cancer have improved the 5-year survivorship from 59.9% in 1975 to more than 82.7% in 2004.<sup>

</sup> However, with 50% to 60% of survivors at risk of adverse neurocognitive effects related to the treatment or disease, interventions to limit negative effects are important.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1943862113479973">2</xref>
</sup> Similarly, interventions to improve children’s quality of life are also imperative as they can experience disrupted development associated with anxiety, isolation, embarrassment,<sup>

</sup> This article reviews how cancer and its treatment can affect children’s neurodevelopment and cognition, examines the potential for music-based interventions to minimize cognitive impairments, and suggests how professional and family carers may ameliorate cancer’s neurocognitive and psychosocial effects in children.</p>
<sec id="section1-1943862113479973">
<title>Childhood Cancer and Neurocognitive Impairment</title>
<p>The incidence of childhood cancer is increasing, with 12 060 American children younger than 15 years expected to be diagnosed in 2012.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1943862113479973">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1943862113479973">14</xref>
</sup> Approximately one-third are diagnosed with leukemias, most commonly acute lymphocytic leukemia, and one-fifth are diagnosed with central nervous system (CNS) tumors. Treatment for these cancers involves therapies, including cranial radiation therapy (CRT), chemotherapy, and surgery, which can cause neurocognitive impairment. The scope of impairment varies from subclinical to severe.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1943862113479973">15</xref>
</sup> Solid tumors can also directly impact upon adjacent structures impairing function.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1943862113479973">15</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Cranial radiation therapy is particularly associated with declines in IQ and attention.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1943862113479973">16</xref>
</sup> The effects are more severe the younger the patient is. Mulhern et al found that patients treated under the age of 5 had an average IQ of 72, while those treated between the ages of 6 and 11 had an average IQ of 93. The decline in IQ following CRT is also dose dependent, with larger doses causing greater declines.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1943862113479973">17</xref>
</sup> Chemotherapy can cause adverse neurocognitive effects but is less harmful than CRT.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1943862113479973">18</xref>
</sup> However, chemotherapy (methotrexate) and CRT can also act synergistically, causing more harm in young children when given concurrently and leading to IQ declines of 25 to 29 points greater in girls younger than 5 years compared with those who received methotrexate preirradiation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1943862113479973">19</xref>
</sup> The damage caused by chemotherapy and CRT is located principally in the white matter, with volume loss thought to be due to vascular impairment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1943862113479973">18</xref>
</sup> This white matter consists of axons insulated by a myelin sheath produced by oligodendrocytes and continues to develop into a person’s 20s, with the myelination of the frontal lobes completing this process.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1943862113479973">20</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The neurocognitive effects of childhood cancer treatment include deficits in attention, executive function, processing speed, memory, and visuospatial and visuomotor skills. Further details outlined by Nathan et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1943862113479973">15</xref>

</sup> are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1943862113479973">Table 1</xref>. Several treatment strategies have been employed in an attempt to minimize late neurocognitive effects in childhood cancer survivors, including reducing the radiation dosage in CRT, fractionating CRT (using repeated smaller doses), conforming CRT (reducing radiation exposure to normal tissue), and substituting CRT with chemotherapy and posttreatment interventions including pharmacological therapies and cognitive remediation programs.<sup>

<p>Butler and colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1943862113479973">23</xref>
</sup> devised a 3-part cognitive remediation program for childhood cancer survivors, which focused on brain injury rehabilitation, including attention training exercises; educational psychology, including metacognitive strategies assisting participants to prepare, monitor, and evaluate performance; and clinical psychology approaches to promote positive frames of mind. An evaluation study found modest improvements in academic achievement and parent-reported attention; however, the program was unlikely to return the children to their prior functional capacity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1943862113479973">23</xref>
</sup> Methylphenidate hydrochloride, used in the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, has also improved attention and processing speed in some childhood cancer survivors, with better responses in males and older, more intelligent patients.<sup>

<p>The decline in intellectual function, as time since treatment progresses, is “usually related to a reduced rate of skill acquisition rather than a loss of previously learned information”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1943862113479973">15</xref>
</sup> and can be explained by the impacts of decreased attention and memory on the uptake of new information and skills. Patients of lower socioeconomic status also generally have poorer outcomes, possibly related to their parents’ and schools’ lesser abilities to meet the children’s additional academic needs.<sup>

<title>The Relevance of Research on Music Training, the Brain, and Intelligence for Children With Cancer</title>
<p>Since the “discovery” of the Mozart effect in 1993, there has been considerable interest in how passive music listening can enhance intelligence in children.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1943862113479973">25</xref>
</sup> The brief (10-15 minutes) improvement in spatial task performance found when listening to Mozart’s Sonata for 2 Pianos (K448) has since been attributed to arousal and mood effects on task performance and found to be noncomposer specific.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1943862113479973">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1943862113479973">27</xref>
</sup> Beneficial effects of music lessons on intelligence are evident and include improvements in IQ, memory, language, spatial, mathematical, and nonverbal performance.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1943862113479973">28</xref>
</sup> A review of research by Hallam<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1943862113479973">29</xref>
</sup> found that music training was positively associated with improvements in perceptual and language skills, literacy, numeracy, and intellect. Only 3 trials examining causal relationships were found. In a randomized controlled trial of 144 6-year-old children, those who had 36 weeks of music training at the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto showed a mean improvement of 2.7 IQ points greater than the controls (control mean improvement 4.3, standard deviation [SD] = 7.3; music group mean improvement 7.0, SD 8.6).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1943862113479973">8</xref>
</sup> Elsewhere, 2 years of an extended music curriculum led to improvements in children’s visual and auditory memory significantly greater than a no music curriculum control group.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1943862113479973">30</xref>
</sup> Another trial compared children who received 20 one-hour sessions of music listening activities (which included training in rhythm, pitch, melody, and vocal tasks) with children who received a visual arts skill development program. Verbal intelligence scores significantly improved in the music group (more than 90% showed improvements), whereas there was no improvement in the visual arts group.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1943862113479973">31</xref>
</sup> The music listening group also showed improvement in executive function, with corresponding changes in event-related potential analysis before and after the music listening program in the P2 component, thereby providing evidence of music-induced brain plasticity. All of these findings demonstrate a transfer of skills derived from music training to other domains of intelligence.</p>
<p>Music training’s effects upon intelligence are dose dependent and long lasting, with Schellenberg postulating that the improvements in intelligence could be due to the “schooling” that accompanies music training, including the involvement of focused attention, concentration, memorization, reading, and fine motor skills.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1943862113479973">26</xref>
</sup> Music training can also induce structural changes in the brain. Neuroplasticity refers to the brain’s ability to adapt to environmental influences and insults, and this is greatest during early childhood.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1943862113479973">32</xref>
</sup> Magnetic resonance imaging studies revealed larger cortical areas devoted to the left little finger in violinists and increased gray matter in professional keyboard players compared to amateurs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1943862113479973">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1943862113479973">34</xref>
</sup> The corpus callosum is also larger in musicians compared to nonmusicians; however, this occurs only when music training begins before 7 years of age.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1943862113479973">35</xref>
</sup> The notion of a birth to 7-year-old critical period with regard to neurocognitive changes derived from music training is further supported by evidence showing that perfect pitch was only found in musicians who commenced training before the age of seven. These musicians showed changes in their right planum temporale.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1943862113479973">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1943862113479973">37</xref>
</sup> Also, a sample of 5- to 7-year-olds, who practiced music for more than 2 hours a week for 29 months, had an increase in the proportional size of corpus callosum area 3, potentially due to increased myelination and axon size or the formation of collateral or transcallosal fibers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1943862113479973">38</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The research examining music training’s effects on the brain and learning suggests that, in “normal” children, music training has the potential to improve intellectual function, with those who have the greatest involvement showing the most improvement. Given the crossover of some of the neuropsychological domains that music training strengthens and childhood cancer treatment negatively affects (including IQ, memory, visual spatial skills, and potentially executive function), there clearly is potential for music-based interventions to help alleviate some of the neurocognitive effects of cancer treatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1943862113479973">
<title>Ameliorating Neurocognitive Effects Through Music</title>
<p>Varied music training, activity based, and communication strategies, informed by research and theoretical evidence, are suggested for the maintenance and amelioration of cognitive abilities in children with cancer. Health and family carers and educators need to tailor strategies according to the children’s abilities, and neuropsychological assessments may inform realistic therapeutic and educational aims. Music training, music therapy, and associated strategies are ideal for children of almost any age, as they are accessible, often enjoyable, and can encourage the use and development of complex skills involving simultaneous perception of sensory modalities, even when lacking in energy and bedbound.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1943862113479973">6</xref>
</sup> <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1943862113479973">Table 2</xref> offers suggestions for how parents and health professionals can use music to assist children neurocognitively affected by cancer based on the available work of music therapists, radiation therapists, and music educators. There is no evidence, however, that music training directly counters the generalized white matter loss associated with CNS cancer therapy and therefore cognitive improvements may be mediated though separate processes.</p>

For example, children can display musical talents acquired and song compositions created during treatment when returning to school. Involvement in a personalized audiovisual product, created during radiation treatment, has also reduced school bullying of a pediatric patient with cancer.<sup>

<p>Quantitative research examining the effect of music-based strategies on cognition would need to address design issues that include minimizing recall bias when ascertaining prior musical learning; structured interventions that children are likely to complete, given the cancer-related circumstances (eg, fatigue); blinding of outcome assessors to treatment group allocation; and trial-size calculations that take account of the increased likelihood of both contamination of the control group by seeking music lessons and dropout from both groups. Furthermore, withholding music-based training and care from control groups in pediatric cancer studies is arguably unethical. Perhaps it is more appropriate and meaningful to provide musical care to children with cancer informed by therapists’ rich practice wisdom,<sup>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Survivors of childhood cancers are less likely than their siblings to be employed or married and are at a greater risk of chronic disease and poor academic achievement.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1943862113479973">50</xref>
</sup> Ameliorative strategies should be offered to maximize patients’ cognitive capacities and quality of life. Indeed many of the benefits that patients and survivors derive from music therapy, music training, and related activities are social, psychological, and life enriching.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1943862113479973">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1943862113479973">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1943862113479973">48</xref>
</sup> Arguably, this is enough to warrant substantive investment in music-based strategies for young patients with cancer and cancer survivors. The likely cognitive benefits from music-related training and activity, through attention, motivational, and intellectual effects, render music-based care an imperative for children with cancer. Two authors of this article are music therapists, a profession that receives university training in child development, human psychobiological functioning, neural correlates of music, performance skills, and therapeutic applications of music. It is suggested that this profession has much to offer children neurocognitively affected by cancer through direct service delivery or as consultants to families, teachers, and other health carers wanting to help children reach their potential through music. Other health carers and educationalists also clearly have much to offer this field (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1943862113479973">Table 2</xref>), and it is hoped all involved in pediatric oncology further explore, share, and hopefully research ways in which music-based care can improve the neuropsychobiological and social lives of young patients with cancer.</p>
