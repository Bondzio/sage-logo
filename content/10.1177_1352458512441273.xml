<p>Telemedicine has been described as ‘the use of communication technologies to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions through the transmission of data between two different physical locations.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512441273">1</xref></sup> Clinical applications include telephone advice lines, tele-consultations, video link consultations, clinical decision-making support software and vital sign monitoring services. Over the years, the name has evolved from ‘Telemedicine’ to ‘Telecare’ to reflect the multidisciplinary, integrated nature of modern health and social services. Programmes of telemedicine date back to the 1960s, coinciding with the development of the telecommunications industry. Early pioneering programs were restricted by technological challenges, high costs and lack of evidence on efficacy. In the past decade, new telecommunication technologies have created an explosive growth worldwide. Telecare is now well-established and has many mature applications, although global exploitation of the potential benefits remains fragmented.</p>
<p>Spain, Italy, France, Norway, Switzerland, Scotland, Japan, USA and Australia are world leaders in the adoption of telecare.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512441273">2</xref></sup> These leading countries have employed radical approaches to ensure that telecare is an essential part of service redesign, or is incorporated into preventive and self-care agendas. Other countries are now beginning to realise that scaling telecare within a whole systems approach may radically improve health outcomes. This approach has been endorsed by the European Parliament, which concluded that ‘Telemedicine will only realise its full potential if Member States engage actively in integrating it into their health care systems.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512441273">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Governmental support for telecare may reflect the growing realisation that many countries struggle to meet the ever-increasing demand for healthcare by people with long-term conditions. The escalation in numbers of people living with long-term diseases coupled with a global recession mean that health systems are under huge pressure to embrace new ways of working. In particular, there is a move away from a largely reactive approach towards integrated systems that enable people to self-manage and make choices.</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom (UK), the Department of Health has funded a large-scale randomised controlled trial that cost more than £30m to test the capability of new technologies to support the remote management of over 6000 people with long-term conditions. The trial, known as the Whole System Demonstrator Programme, has recently published preliminary results. The headline findings show that if used correctly, telehealth applications can deliver a 45% reduction in mortality rates, a 20% reduction in emergency hospital admissions, a 14% reduction in elective admissions, a 14% reduction in bed days and an 8% reduction in tariff costs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512441273">4</xref></sup> The full trial results are due to be published in March 2012.</p>
<p>As a chronic, long-term neurological condition, the management of multiple sclerosis (MS) could potentially benefit from telecare pathways. The fluctuating nature of MS means that timely assessment is essential; however, this is often difficult for health organisations to deliver. It is not unusual for MS clinics to be based within specialist tertiary care units, which means that people often have to make long journeys in order to access advice. In addition, mobility, cognitive, sensory and other physical disabilities that are associated with MS may restrict a person’s ability to attend and actively participate in clinic appointments.</p>
<p>Despite the obvious potential advantages of applying telecare within the field of MS, its adoption has been slow. This may reflect a sluggish uptake within neurology in general, confusion over cost and reimbursement plans, and the absence of a robust scientific evidence base. Although anecdotal and quasi-experimental studies support the use of telemedicine, few high-quality studies exist. A systematic review of 1323 telemedicine papers identified many methodological flaws, including the fact that less than 5% of the studies reviewed had used a valid comparison group and few had follow-up data on clinical outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512441273">5</xref></sup> The poor quality of the majority of research to date may be a consequence of the lack of funding in this area. Clinical sources of funding often deem telecare developments as research, while research funders often categorise telecare as clinical. This division can prove very challenging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512441273">6</xref></sup> One way forward may be to commission research projects that improve practice in relation to the organisation and delivery of healthcare, such that they build capability and capacity skills amongst those who manage, organise and deliver services.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512441273">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The pilot study by Zissman et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512441273">8</xref></sup> published in this issue of <italic>Multiple Sclerosis Journal</italic> assessed the value of telemedicine in MS within a specialised MS centre. The findings suggest that people who are supported by a home telecare model experienced improvements in their level of symptom severity, lower medical costs and a high level of care satisfaction when compared to a control group of MS patients who received the standard care. The authors argue that home telecare offers an added value level of support. However, the absence of a clinical activity narrative and clinical protocol descriptions limits clinical interpretation.</p>
<p>A novel component of the research was the application of the Clinical Value Compass domains of Clinical, Functional, Satisfaction and Costs as a framework. The Clinical Value Compass can be used to ascertain if a healthcare system is providing high-quality, high-value care to patients and populations. In this small study, the researchers may not have benefited from the unique ability of the compass to clarify and quantify the aims of their health system, measure the value of what it produced and represent the main interest of different stakeholders. The Institute of Medicine (of the National Academies, USA) framework domains of Quality, Access, Acceptability and Cost may have provided greater clarity in measuring what matters when implementing this type of telecare service.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that neurology has been slow in adopting telecare in comparison with other specialities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458512441273">9</xref></sup> Where telecare has been adopted, there is evidence that it can improve the efficiency or effectiveness of existing Parkinson’s disease, neurorehabilitation, epilepsy and general neurology services.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512441273">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458512441273">13</xref></sup> Worldwide, telecare has demonstrated benefits in the management of stroke when a video link to a neurologist is the only feasible way a person with acute stroke in a rural area can receive timely intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458512441273">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458512441273">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the MS arena, the Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) Centre of Excellence leads the use of telecare. Their services are delivered in three stands: real-time telehealth, home telehealth, and store and forward telehealth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458512441273">17</xref></sup> They have produced a wealth of evidence covering both the clinical and cost effectiveness of telecare interventions in long-term conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458512441273">18</xref></sup> The Cleveland Clinic (US) carried out a randomised controlled trial that assessed an internet-based self-management system, which utilized an electronic patient-held record (e-PHR) system, to determine the impact on self-assessed well-being, clinician-assessed well-being, and healthcare utilization versus usual care via a secure Web-based messaging system. They concluded that there was no evidence that an e-PHR–enabled self-management system improved multidisciplinary MS centre-based care, although the differences between interventions may not have been large enough to demonstrate a level of superiority between the trial arms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458512441273">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Further studies of internet portal use should prove useful, as this is an area of rapid technological growth. There is evidence from the US that people with MS use the internet more than the general population. A study of portal usage identified these users as young professionals with minimal disability. The most frequent portal use was the secure patient-physician messaging system. It is suggested that usage could be higher if technological adaptations such as voice-activated commands and easy font size adjustments were used to maximise access for those with advancing physical disability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1352458512441273">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The delivery of care to people with MS by telephone has been assessed in a number of trials. A meta-analysis evaluation of the impact of telephone-administered psychological interventions on the psychosocial functioning of adults with an acquired physical disability, including people with MS, suggests that telecounseling is an effective treatment modality for adults who are adjusting to a physical disability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458512441273">21</xref></sup> A secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial in depression examined the efficacy of telephone-administered cognitive-behavioural therapy (T-CBT) and telephone-administered supportive emotion-focused therapy (T-SEFT) in reducing disability among disabled patients with MS and depression. The results show that patients in both treatment arms showed significant improvements in disability and fatigue, and that T-CBT produced significantly greater decreases in disability and fatigue, as compared with T-SEFT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1352458512441273">22</xref></sup> A telephone study on the delivery of an energy conservation program demonstrated significant improvement in patients in a number of areas, including pain, fatigue and general health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458512441273">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Telecare offers real potential to improve clinical pathways in MS management. We should expect rapid growth in telecare as consumers demand improved access, communication and responses in their health care similar to services they receive from their banking, leisure and commercial providers. The question the MS health service community faces today is not whether we embrace telecare, but how to do so and at what pace?</p>
<p>Opportunities to build on the evidence base through robust research programmes need to be realised. Service pathway redesign must also be prioritised; however, it is critically important that developments are user- and service-led, and not technology-driven. Telecare models must enhance rather than replace best practice. Telecare programmes that do not incorporate appropriate clinical services offer little or no value, or more worryingly could potentially cause harm. The need for robust clinical, financial and information technology governance cannot be underestimated and due diligence must be performed to establish the appropriate ethical, financial and clinical arrangements. Other considerations should include appropriate education and training so that the MS workforce is enabled to deliver safe, clinically expert and cost-effective care within an environment of technological transformation.</p>
<p>Good practice in service redesign should include making sure that the patient is at the heart of the pathway. Evaluation frameworks using the Institute of Medicine domains of Quality, Access, Acceptability and Cost could be used to design and measure effectiveness. The core factors of patient experience and clinical engagement will need to be addressed; otherwise a glass ceiling is reached and the only thing that will be achieved is the introduction of an additional layer of service complexity that would make little or no impact upon the quality of life for people living with MS.</p>
