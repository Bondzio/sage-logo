      <abstract>
        <p>The segment of the biblical history of the monarchy which narrates events leading to the
          succession of Solomon to the throne of David in 1 Kings 2, known as the Succession
          Narrative or Court History, continues to generate inconclusive debate as to its extent,
          its relation to the historical work of which it is a part, and its ideology. On this last
          point, its characterization of the principal actors and its realistic narration of events
          have led some commentators to conclude that its author is expressing a basically negative
          view of David, Solomon, and the institution of monarchy. After arguing for limiting the
          extent of the Succession Narrative to 2 Samuel 11–20 and 1 Kings 1–2, the present article
          disputes two of the most prominent interpretations of the text: that of W. Dietrich, who
          reads it as containing a basically negative <italic>Grundschrift</italic> of early date
          rewritten some two centuries later to present a favourable view of the principals; and
          that of J. Van Seters, for whom it is a late post-exilic composition, informed by an
          anti-messianic ideology and inserted into the Deuteronomistic History to present a
          decidedly negative view of David and Solomon. This article concludes that the Succession
          Narrative is a homogeneous and coherent text and that it is in no sense an indictment of
          David, Solomon, and monarchy in general.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Few topics have led to so prolonged, inconclusive, and at times testy discussion among
        biblical scholars as the existence and—granted its existence—the extent, theme, ideology,
        and date of composition of the segment of the history dealing with the succession of Solomon
        to the throne of David known as the Court History or the Succession Narrative or, more
        fully, the History of the Succession to the Throne of David
          (<italic>Thronnachfolgegeschichte Davids</italic>). Also subject to debate is the question
        whether this text was incorporated into the Deuteronomistic History (Dtr) as a source
        anterior to it or was subsequently added to it. The debate, which shows no signs of arriving
        at a consensus, covers a broad range of methods, approaches and topics. My contribution will
        be limited to one aspect of the ideology of the text, namely, its attitude to David,
        Solomon, and the Judaean monarchy, whether negative, positive, or non-committal. But before
        this issue can be addressed, it will be necessary to state what I take to be the extent,
        structure and essential contours of the text in question.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2-0309089213492811">
      <title>2. Literary Structure, Extent, Theme</title>
      <p>I begin with the proposition that in all serious literary productions, especially ancient
        literary productions, narrative structure at both the macro and micro level is of decisive
        importance as a vector of meaning and a way of directing the attention of the reader to the
        text's central concerns and themes. In dealing with the subject in hand, therefore, one
        should begin by identifying structural features which help in determining the boundaries of
        the text. Such elements include formulaic introductions and conclusions
          (<italic>incipits</italic> and <italic>excipits</italic>), repetitions,
          <italic>inclusios</italic>, ring arrangements, parallel constructions and the like, which
        serve to organize the narrative as a cohesive whole. We find such a structural feature at
        once in the segment of 2 Samuel in which the text in question is situated, namely, the
        Bathsheba episode (2 Sam. 11.1b–12.25), which is framed by the account of the conclusion of
        Joab's Ammonite campaign, the capture and sack of Rabbah, the Ammonite capital (11.1a;
        12.26–31). In keeping with the common practice of a resumptive sentence
          (<italic>Wiederaufnahme</italic>) following an interpolation, 12.26 takes up again the
        account interrupted at 11.1a: ‘They besieged Rabbah… and Joab fought against Rabbah of the
        Ammonites’. The siege and capture of the city concludes the account of the campaign which
        opens in 2 Sam. 10.1 with the same vague temporal marker
            <italic>way<sup>e</sup>hîʾaḥ<sup>a</sup>rě-kēn</italic> (‘some time afterwards’) as
        serves to introduce other narrative segments: the account of David's conquests (2 Sam. 8.1),
        his encounter with Mephibaal (dysphemistically Mephibosheth, 2 Sam. 9.1)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0309089213492811">1</xref></sup> which precedes it, and the two
        episodes of unequal length which follow, dealing with the elimination respectively of Amnon
        and Absalom (2 Sam. 13.1; 15.1).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0309089213492811">2</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The story of adultery, murder, repentance and forgiveness concluding with the birth of
        Solomon is therefore a distinct narrative unit, a <italic>texte en soi</italic>, of as yet
        uncertain date and provenance, which has been inserted at some point into Dtr. It can
        therefore serve as a firm starting point for further enquiry into structure and theme. But
        there arises at once the question whether it is just one of a series of isolated incidents
        in David's career or part of a more extensive but independent and coherent narrative
        complex. To begin with what is most obvious: the principal characters in 2 Sam. 11.1b–12.25
        apart from David—Bathsheba, Nathan and Solomon—all appear and are active in 1 Kings 1–2 but
        are completely absent from the intermediate episodes dealing with the elimination of Amnon,
        the first son and therefore crown-prince, and Absalom, next in line (2 Sam.
            13–20).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0309089213492811">3</xref></sup> This
        arrangement can no doubt be explained in different ways, but if it came about by design
        rather than chance, which seems to be the case, it may be explained as follows: we leave
        Solomon as an infant at the end of the first episode, and during the intervening years, as
        he reaches his majority,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0309089213492811">4</xref></sup>
        two of the three principal claimants to the succession among David's sons are eliminated,
        leaving him with the task of disposing of Adonijah, the third and last rival, with the
        active support of Bathsheba and Nathan.</p>
      <p>At the same time, this last episode (1 Kgs 1–2) has enough in common, stylistically,
        thematically and even verbally, with the intermediate accounts in 2 Samuel 13–20 to permit
        the conclusion that it belongs integrally with them in one continuous and coherent
        narrative. The lesser cast of actors in 2 Samuel 13–20—Joab, Abiathar with his son Jonathan,
        Zadok, Barzillai, Benaiah with his mercenaries—reappears in 1 Kings 1–2. The fate of Shimei
        the Benjaminite who cursed David during Absalom's revolt is sealed in this last episode (1
        Kgs 2.36–46a; cf. 2 Sam. 16.5–14), and Abiathar is spared on account of his association with
        the holy ark (1 Kgs 2.26–27; cf. 2 Sam. 15.24–29). Adonijah follows the example of Absalom
        in procuring for himself ‘chariots, horsemen, and fifty men to run in front of him’ (1 Kgs
        1.5; cf. 2 Sam. 15.1), and like Absalom, he invites the other sons of David to a sacrifice
        and feast with a hidden agenda (1 Kgs 1.9, 25–26; cf. 2 Sam. 15.7–12). Narrative motifs
        which occur in the preceding episodes reappear in this final denouement, for example, the
        personal beauty of David's sons (1 Kgs 1.6; cf. 2 Sam. 14.25) and the messenger who is
        expected to bring good news but brings bad news instead (1 Kgs 1.42–48; cf. 2 Sam.
        18.19–32). A final example: like the fictitious son of the wise woman of Tekoa, Adonijah is
        assured that, if he proves to be compliant, ‘not one hair of his head will fall to the
        ground’ (1 Kgs 1.52; cf. 2 Sam. 14.11).</p>
      <p>The Bathsheba episode also anticipates the later course of this contentious family history.
        In condemning David's crime, Nathan predicts trouble from within David's household,
        referring specifically to Absalom's appropriation of his father's harem, the point of no
        return in the rebellion (2 Sam. 12.10–12; 23.34). There is therefore no reason to doubt that
        the Bathsheba episode, while possessing its own narrative integrity, is an integral part of
        a larger work which addresses and answers the question: Which son of David will succeed him
        and perpetuate the dynasty? This work may therefore bear the title ‘Succession Narrative’
        (SN) and will be referred to as such in what follows.</p>
      <p>It will be objected at this point that some of the most prominent defenders of a Succession
        Narrative, or Court History, or History of the Succession to the Throne
          (<italic>Thronnachfolgegeschichte</italic>) have identified 2 Sam. 9.1–13, David's
        dealings with Saul's grandson Mephibaal, as the beginning of this narrative or at least of
        its core segment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0309089213492811">5</xref></sup> The
        reason alleged for this decision is that, without this encounter between David and
        Mephibaal, the (possibly mendacious) accusation by Ziba that his master Mephibaal planned to
        profit by Absalom's rebellion to restore the Saul dynasty (2 Sam. 16.1–4), followed by the
        submission of Mephibaal to David (2 Sam. 19.24–30), would remain without explanation. To
        this it may be objected that the incidents involving Mephibaal are among several in SN which
        follow from information provided in the preceding account of David's rise to power. One
        example: the <italic>ḥesed</italic> between David and Jonathan which inspired David to a
        benevolent attitude to his son Mephibaal follows from David's covenant with Jonathan
        confirmed by an oath in 1 Sam. 20.14–17 in which this term features prominently.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0309089213492811">6</xref></sup> The problem with backtracking
        through the David story in search of displaced fragments of SN is illustrated by Rost
        himself, <italic>primus inter pares</italic> among commentators on the text in question, and
        has caused other commentators a lot of trouble. In addition to the Mephibaal chapter (2 Sam.
        9), Rost took 2 Sam. 6.16, 20–23, describing the reaction of Michal, David's wife, to his
        dancing before the ark, and her consequent childlessness, as the beginning of the Succession
        story, which admittedly would have made a less objectionable beginning than David's adultery
        with Bathsheba.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0309089213492811">7</xref></sup> For Rost,
        the <italic>Thronnachfolgegeschichte</italic> also had to take in the core statement in
        Nathan's oracle containing the promise of a perpetual dynasty (2 Sam. 7.11b, 16).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0309089213492811">8</xref></sup> This procedure illustrates the
        problems involved in deciding what does or does not belong to one and the same text purely
        on the basis of content or theme without regard to structure. I suggest, on the contrary,
        that theme and structure are inseparably and synergistically constitutive of texts, and
        therefore both must be taken into account.</p>
      <p>A careful reading of SN reveals a much more thorough integration into the Dtr context than
        we would suspect from Rost's retrospective additions. Many of the cast of characters in the
        account of David's struggle with Saul and rise to power reappear in it, including Joab,
        Abishai, Abiathar and the Cherethite and Pelethite mercenaries. The author of SN knows that
        Abiathar was the bearer of the holy ark (1 Kgs 2.26–27; cf. 2 Sam. 15.24, 29), he is
        familiar with the prophecy against Shiloh and the house of Eli (1 Kgs 2.27; cf. 1 Sam.
        2.27–36), and with the murders committed by the odious Joab (1 Kgs 2.5–6, 31–33; cf. 2 Sam.
        3.27; 20.8–10). A possible source of danger to David from Mephibaal, Saul's grandson, first
        mentioned at 2 Sam. 4.4, was neutralized by sequestering this hapless individual at court,
        an offer he was in no position to refuse (2 Sam. 9.1–13). He is told insistently that he is
        to eat at the royal table (vv. 7, 10, 11, 13), which may be understood as a euphemism for
        being placed under surveillance; compare Saul's anxiety and anger at finding David's place
        at the royal table empty (1 Sam. 20.18, 24–34). Then there are the significant allusions to
        Nathan's oracle with the promise to David of a ‘house’ (i.e. a dynasty) in 1 Kgs 2.15, 24,
        33 noted by Rost. But rather than feeling obliged to agglomerate these episodes to SN, a
        process which ends by totally undermining its structure and identity, we would be better
        advised to regard them as evidence of the editorial accommodation of this large insertion
        and its incorporation into the host text. Michal's reaction to David's dancing before the
        ark leading to her childlessness (2 Sam. 6.16, 20–23), the immolation of Saul's seven sons
        (21.1–14), and David's dealings with Mephibaal (9.1–13) belong to a different narrative
        cycle, the final phase in David's elimination of potential danger from the house of Saul. To
        that extent they open the way for the narrator to turn to the thematically and structurally
        quite distinct issue of the struggles within David's own family.</p>
      <p>The process by which SN was inserted into its broader historical context is also apparent
        in additions, of a more programmatic kind, from a Deuteronomistic hand. The clearest
        instance is David's final admonition addressed to Solomon, already on the throne (1 Kgs
        2.1–4). It is generally recognized that the language used here is transparently
        Deuteronomistic. The initial exhortation, <italic>hāzaqtā w<sup>e</sup>hāyîtā
          l<sup>e</sup>ʾîš</italic> (‘be strong, be courageous’) reproduces Moses’ exhortation to
        Joshua about to lead the Israelites across the Jordan (Deut. 31.7, 23; cf. Josh. 1.1–9), and
        the injunction to ‘keep the charge (<italic>mišmeret</italic>) of Yahweh your God’ is also
        characteristically Deuteronomistic (Deut. 11.1; cf. Josh. 22.3). Fulfilment of the statutes,
        commandments, ordinances and testimonies of the law with all one's heart and soul as the
        essential condition for success is, of course, one of the most frequently occurring
          <italic>leitmotifs</italic> in Deuteronomy (6.5; 10.12; 30.2, etc.). In 1 Kgs 2.10–12, the
        same Deuteronomistic scribe, or one of his colleagues, has rounded out David's reign with an
        annalistic summary similar to those found throughout Dtr (1 Kgs 2.10–12).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0309089213492811">9</xref></sup> But especially significant is
        the final statement of this last segment of SN. The account ends with the words: ‘So the
        kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon'—the somewhat literal NRSV translation of 1
        Kgs 2.46b. This concluding statement echoes once again, and finally, Nathan's promise, and
        it does so in practically identical terms (cf. 2 Sam. 7.12b). The wording (same verb and
        substantive) implies that now, after many vicissitudes, the future predicted by Nathan has
        come to pass with Solomon on the throne. Without being part of SN, <italic>pace</italic>
        Leonhard Rost, the Nathan oracle can now be seen retrospectively as the point of departure
        and the initial impulse for the insertion of SN into the host text.</p>
      <p>Another problem relative to the extent of the text calls for attention. Several
        commentators have questioned whether 2 Samuel 20, narrating the failed attempt at secession
        by the Benjaminite Sheba ben Bikri, belongs to the Succession History. He is neither a
        member of David's family nor a candidate for the throne, and his revolt, if it can be called
        that, does not bear, at any rate directly, on the issue of the succession.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0309089213492811">10</xref></sup> But on closer inspection his
        call to secede from Judah follows without a break on the dispute immediately preceding
        between Israelites and Judaeans, at which, we are told, he was himself present (2 Sam.
        19.41–43). His call to the central and northern tribesmen to secede can therefore be seen as
        either a continuation or a renewed outbreak of the recently suppressed revolt. In the course
        of that revolt David was opposed by another Benjaminite, Shimei ben Gera (2 Sam. 16.5–14),
        who was later to make his submission together with a thousand of his fellow-Benjaminites (2
        Sam. 19.16) only to be executed by Solomon at a later point in the story (1 Kgs 2.36–46a).
        There were also allegations that Mephibaal entertained hopes of profiting by Absalom's
        rebellion to re-establish his grandfather's dynasty (2 Sam. 16.1–4). It is hardly
        surprisingly that Absalom's revolt should win strong support from the northern and central
        tribesmen, including Benjaminites,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0309089213492811">11</xref></sup> and we may detect here an anticipation of the disconnect between Judah
        and Benjamin immediately preceding and subsequent to the disaster of 586 <sc>bce</sc>.
        Continuity of theme between 2 Samuel 15–19 and 20 is also accompanied by continuity of
          <italic>dramatis personae</italic>, including Joab, Amasa, Abishai, and the ubiquitous
        Cherethites and Pelethites. The treacherous murder of Amasa by Joab (2 Sam. 20.8–10) is
        explained by David's replacement of Joab by Amasa during the revolt (2 Sam. 17.25;
        19.13–14). David's sequestration of his women (2 Sam. 20.3) is the outcome of Absalom's
        appropriation and violation of the royal harem which set the revolt in motion (2 Sam.
        16.20–22). The wise woman of Abel Beth-Maacah is the counterpart to the wise woman of
        Tekoa—both anonymous, both persuasive speakers (14.1–20; 20.16–20). Finally, the list of
        officials which concludes the Sheba ben Bichri episode (2 Sam. 20.23–26), a variant of the
        list which concludes the account of David's conquests (8.15–18), is structurally significant
        in linking the Sheba episode with what precedes (2 Sam. 11–19) rather than with what follows
        (2 Sam. 21–24).</p>

      <title>3. The Succession Narrative, a Homogeneous and Coherent Text</title>
      <p>The ideology issue will naturally look very different and call for a different approach if
        it is held that SN, whatever its extent, is a conflation of two or more narrative strands
        with contrasting assessments of David and Solomon; for example, a later narrative strand
        expanding and radically altering an earlier one; or if it were to be shown that the text as
        a whole was written to refute an earlier assessment of the origins of the Judaean monarchy
        and the moral character of David and Solomon. In this section and the one following I raise
        questions about both of these readings of our text. Rather than attempting an overview of
        the many contributions bearing on these different approaches, a lengthy and probably tedious
            undertaking,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0309089213492811">12</xref></sup> I
        confine my remarks to the most prominent exponents of the two views in question,
        respectively Professors Walter Dietrich and John Van Seters, both of whom have expounded
        their positions on the issue on several occasions over a period of about four decades. While
        in some respects overlapping, these two positions illustrate how far we are from a consensus
        on these issues. For the most part Dietrich concentrates on Solomon's accession to the
        throne in 2 Samuel 11–12 and 1 Kings 1–2, and even denies the existence of a Succession
        Narrative as an independent text.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0309089213492811">13</xref></sup> For Van Seters, however, the Court History—his preferred designation—is
        part of a more extensive account of the origins of the Israelite (Judaean) monarchy which he
        calls ‘the David Saga'.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0309089213492811">14</xref></sup>
        While Dietrich believes he can identify in these chapters an early version hostile to David
        and Solomon, rewritten at a later time with a view to presenting a sanitized view of both,
        for Van Seters the earlier version, that of Dtr, is positive, but is countered in the late
        Persian period by the Court History, a major insertion into Dtr, containing a decidedly
        negative assessment of David, Solomon, and monarchy in general.</p>
      <p>To begin with the first of these two interpretations of our text: Dietrich<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0309089213492811">15</xref></sup> reads 2 Samuel 11–12 + 1 Kings
        1–2 as a drama in which Solomon is the principal actor. It is laid out in three acts: how he
        came into the world (2 Sam. 11–12), how he succeeded against the odds to the throne of David
        (1 Kgs 1), and how he eliminated his rivals and opponents (1 Kgs 2). This history turns out
        to be composite rather than homogeneous, a combination of two narrative strands with starkly
        opposing views of David, Solomon, and kingship in general. The base narrative
          (<italic>Grundschrift</italic>) consists in a version of the history composed during
        Solomon's reign, and therefore close to the events described,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0309089213492811">16</xref></sup> which reflects a decidedly negative judgment
        on the two principal actors in the drama and, by implication, on some of the supporting cast
        as well. It begins by narrating how Solomon was born of an adulterous union followed by the
        murder of the unsuspecting husband, and it ends with Solomon eliminating all opposition,
        actual or potential, in the manner of a typical oriental potentate. The story therefore
        begins with bloodshed and ends with bloodshed. Dietrich suggests that two or three centuries
        later, some time after the fall of the Kingdom of Samaria, this negative assessment of David
        and Solomon underwent a radical ‘redimensioning’
            (<italic>Redimensionierung</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0309089213492811">17</xref></sup> as part of a larger chronicle of the early monarchy which antedates
        Dtr. The polemical intent behind this rewritten version was to sanitize the image of David
        and Solomon depicted in the base narrative and to present a positive image of the Judaean
        monarchy. What Dietrich suggests is that, given the situation after the liquidation of the
        Kingdom of Samaria by the Assyrians in 722 <sc>bce</sc>, the immediate intent may have been
        to reassure survivors and refugees from that disaster that they could accept life under the
        rule of a Judaean monarch, successor to David.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0309089213492811">18</xref></sup></p>
      <p>These two strands in the story of the transition from David to Solomon are identified by a
        meticulous process of picking the text apart, paragraph-by-paragraph, verse-by-verse, one
        part of a verse from another. The principal criterion, indeed practically the only
        criterion, for separating out the two strands, is the moral evaluation of David and Solomon,
        negative in the base narrative, positive in the rewritten version. Without engaging in a
        detailed, point-by-point critique of Dietrich's scrupulously close reading of these four
        chapters, some of its major features may be mentioned. The account of David's adultery with
        Bathsheba, followed by the murder of Uriah and the transfer of Bathsheba to the royal palace
        (2 Sam. 11.2–27a), belongs to the base narrative, while the intervention of Nathan which
        follows, beginning with the statement ‘the thing that David had done was displeasing to
        Yahweh’ (11.27b), does not.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0309089213492811">19</xref></sup> Also absent from the account of Solomon's birth at the end of the first
        act (12.24–25) is the assurance that Yahweh loved him, confirmed by the name Jedidiah
        (‘Yahweh's Beloved’).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0309089213492811">20</xref></sup> 2
        Samuel 12.24abβ and 25aβb therefore belong to the rewritten version.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0309089213492811">21</xref></sup> Throughout this section of the Solomonic
        drama the fact that Yahweh is conspicuously absent from the earlier text is seen as a
        further indication of moral failure. The animus against Solomon continues in the reading of
        the base narrative in 1–2 Kings. Anything that might be taken to reflect well on Solomon
        belongs to the later, pro-Solomonic version. This includes David's declaration that Solomon
        is to reign ‘in his place’ (1 Kgs 1.35), the pious (and surely disingenuous) aspiration of
        the executioner Benaiah for a divine blessing on Solomon (1 Kgs 1.36–37), and the abject
        collapse of the anti-Solomon party (1.41b-49a). David's justification for ordering the
        execution of Joab (1 Kgs 2.5–6) and Shimei (2.8–9) cannot be part of the base narrative, nor
        can Adonijah's admission that Solomon's success was willed by God (2.15b). For the same
        reason, all the explanations and justifications for Solomon's actions with respect to
        Abiathar (2.26b), Joab (2.31b-33) and Shimei (2.44–45) are assigned to the rewritten version
        composed <italic>in majorem gloriam Salomonis</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0309089213492811">22</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The following remarks about the method employed by Dietrich, and certainly not by him
            alone,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0309089213492811">23</xref></sup> seem to be in
        order.</p>
      <p>(1) It would be helpful to take into account the technical process by which, in eighth- or
        seventh-century <sc>bce</sc> Judah, the rewritten text would have come into existence.
        Nowadays, rewriting a draft of a text requiring many small-scale corrections and additions
        can be done longhand or, given a minimum level of competence, on a computer. In eighth- or
        seventh-century <sc>bce</sc> Judah, however, a papyrus scroll would have had space only for
        the occasional marginal gloss. Hence the <italic>Grundschrift</italic> would have had to be
        transcribed <italic>in toto</italic> on a new and considerably longer scroll, and the
        alterations and additions put in at the appropriate places.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0309089213492811">24</xref></sup> But the question must be asked whether there
        is any evidence from the time of the Judaean monarchy for the kind of scribal activity
        required by Dietrich's reading of SN. Additions to Jeremiah's prophecies of the
        Deuteronomistic type, or those sayings in the expansive <sc>mt</sc> version over against the
        shorter <sc>lxx</sc> text, are in the form of blocks or units of text, supplementing and
        expanding the existing text and generally congruent with it. The second edition of
        Jeremiah's oracles dictated to Baruch consisted in ‘many similar words’ added to the output
        of the previous 23 years (Jer. 36.32). To take just one example: Jer. 33.14–26, absent from
          <sc>lxx</sc>, is an expanded version of Jer. 23.5–6 which reinforces the prediction of a
        permanent Davidic dynasty while introducing a new but not incongruent element, the Levitical
        priesthood alongside the monarchy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0309089213492811">25</xref></sup> Expansions are also identifiable by stylistic features: for example,
        comments in prose attached to oracles in verse. The same could be said, <italic>mutatis
          mutandis</italic>, for the two or more successive editions of Dtr. In sum, the kind of
        redactional activity required by Dietrich's method in dealing with sections of SN seems
        foreign to anything we know about scribal procedures in ancient Israel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0309089213492811">26</xref></sup> It seems rather to be a more
        intense and microscopic form of academic source analysis of texts which became widespread in
        the late eighteenth century in both classical and biblical studies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0309089213492811">27</xref></sup></p>
      <p>(2) We cannot assume that the author of the rewritten version was responsible for omissions
        as well as additions since, on Dietrich's hypothesis, the additions were intended to
        mitigate or ameliorate a situation which otherwise would tell against David's reputation. On
        this assumption, it would not be surprising if members of the scribal school in Jerusalem,
        faced with the proposal of one of their colleagues to rewrite 2 Samuel 11–12 in the way
        Dietrich proposes, leaving its graphic description of the adultery and murder in place,
        would have wondered whether this was the most effective way of recommending David, Solomon,
        and the dynasty to the readers. Or, to take this a step further, we ourselves cannot help
        wondering why anyone at that time would have gone to the trouble to sanitize an old record
        in this painfully detailed manner, a manner otherwise unattested at that time, rather than
        just writing a positive appraisal of the early monarchic period; or why, to make an end, the
        putative author of the rewrtten <italic>Grundschrift</italic>, or of the edition of Dtr of
        which it was a part, did not simply omit the entire Bathsheba episode as the Chronicler
        would do some centuries later.</p>
      <p>(3) In attempting to assess the point of view and the moral orientation and viewpoint of a
        text like SN, it may be difficult to leave aside one's own quite legitimate moral
        sensitivities. Like other ancient texts, however, SN is the product of a moral universe
        different in important ways from ours, and its moral outlook may be generated by quite
        different criteria from those of the contemporary reader. In Dtr, for example, practically
        all rulers in both kingdoms are assessed not on personal moral conduct, as we might assume
        after reading the laws and moral exhortation in Deuteronomy, but almost exclusively on
        fidelity to the cult of Yahweh and the rejection of all other religious practices. The only
        exception is in the summary of the reign of Abijam son of Rehoboam where David is commended
        for having done what was right in the sight of Yahweh ‘except in the matter of Uriah the
        Hittite’ (1 Kgs 15.5). The qualification is, however, lacking in <sc>lxx</sc> and
        practically all commentators take it to be a post-Dtr gloss.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0309089213492811">28</xref></sup></p>
      <p>In the first scene (2 Sam. 11–12), what is stated explicitly, and therefore should be
        considered as of primary importance, is that David confesses his sin and is forgiven, and
        that in consequence Yahweh accepts and loves the child of the penitent king.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0309089213492811">29</xref></sup> There is no reason to question
        that this is integral to the narrative and consonant with everything we learn about David in
        relation to Yahweh in what follows, and therefore there is absolutely no need to ascribe it
        to a later editorial hand. The reader may disapprove of the author's treatment of David—the
        ready pardoning, the death of the first child—but that is beside the point. The task is to
        determine what the biblical author intends to convey, and for the biblical author the
        ultimate stamp of approval is the forgiveness and the love of God. It will suffice to
        contrast the positive and explicit statements of approval of David in this episode with the
        equally explicit and repeated divine reprobation of Saul, also mediated by a
            prophet.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0309089213492811">30</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Quite apart from this explicitly stated approbation of David, the sections of the
        Succession Narrative discussed by Dietrich, and in fact the entire text inclusive of the
        intermediate episodes in 2 Samuel 13–20, reveal to the sensitive reader—especially through
        the use of dialogue and interior monologue<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0309089213492811">31</xref></sup>—a psychological profundity, subtlety, and
        nuance which cannot be reduced to sorting out in a straightforward manner the morally good
        bits from the bad. Take David's anticipated <italic>shiva</italic> for his sick and dying
        child (2 Sam. 12.15b-23), or his inconsolable grief for the loss of the son who had driven
        him out of his city and would no doubt have put him to death if his rebellion had succeeded
        (2 Sam. 19.1–5). Just as it is impossible to believe that the author of these incidents
        could have been hostile to David, so we may read them as consistent and instinctive with the
        rendering in SN of David's admittedly flawed character as a whole.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0309089213492811">32</xref></sup></p>
      <p>To conclude: there should be no doubt about the legitimacy of diachronic readings of texts
        in general, essential as it is for tracing political, cultural, and religious developments.
        But faced with a text like SN, diachronic analysis should not be the first option, and
        should not be at the expense of the integrity of the text to be interpreted. As a prisoner
        at the mercy of the critic, the text should be considered innocent until proved guilty,
        which is to say, it should be regarded as homogeneous and indivisible until proved by
        rigorous argument to be composite and thus subject to dismemberment. <italic>Pace</italic>
        Dietrich, this is not the case with SN.</p>

      <title>4. The Succession Narrative Is Not an Indictment of David</title>
      <p>Dietrich, therefore, attempted to demonstrate the existence of an early strand in SN
        contemporaneous with and critical of Solomon and, by implication, David. This narrative was
        later edited and expanded with a view to projecting a positive image of the beginnings of
        the Judaean monarchy and the character of both rulers. Much more venturesome is the thesis
        of Van Seters, for whom the entire Court History (CH), his preferred title, originated in
        ‘an anti-messianic tendency in certain Jewish circles’ some time in the post-exilic
            period,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0309089213492811">33</xref></sup> composed to
        discredit David, Solomon, and the royal messianism associated with the Davidic dynasty. Van
        Seter's CH follows Rost, von Rad, Noth and others fairly closely with regard to the core of
        the narrative (2 Sam. 9–20; 1 Kgs 1.1–52; 2.5–9, 13–46), but with the addition of 2 Sam.
        2.8–4.12, dealing with David's conflict with Ishbaal, Saul's son and successor. This
        somewhat expanded CH is, however, part of an even larger narrative complex with the title
        ‘The Saga of King David’, which includes a rewritten version of David's struggle with Saul
        and his rise to power, comprising the entire section from 1 Samuel 16, Samuel's decision to
        seek a replacement for Saul,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0309089213492811">34</xref></sup> to 1 Kings 2 omitting 2 Samuel 21–24, a collection of appendices to 1–2
        Samuel. This large narrative corpus, ostensibly history but in reality fiction,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0309089213492811">35</xref></sup> and in part even satirical and
        parodic fiction, was inserted into Dtr with the intent of countering the latter's positive
        assessment of the Davidic monarchy.</p>
      <p>Van Seters’ reconstruction is therefore, <italic>in this respect</italic>, the precise
        opposite of that of Dietrich, for whom the base text is negative and the rewritten version
        positive. In other respects the views of these two scholars differ considerably. Dietrich
        holds that the author was close to events and personalities he describes, while on literary
        and archaeological grounds Van Seters rules out the possibility of a tenth-century
          <sc>bce</sc> origin, and therefore the necessity and feasibility of appealing to
            redactors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0309089213492811">36</xref></sup> There was
        no United Monarchy, and David operated in a different region from that of Saul and had no
        contact with him. CH is a literary creation, not an exercise in historiography, and those
        features in it which others have attributed to oral tradition are strictly literary
        conventions not derivative from oral tradition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0309089213492811">37</xref></sup> He therefore takes issue with Gunkel's
        insistence on the oral-traditional basis of much biblical narrative and, more specifically,
        with recent readings of CH along the same lines.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0309089213492811">38</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Van Seters pays special attention to the issue of genre.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0309089213492811">39</xref></sup> Beginning with Bernhard Luther, Wilhelm
        Caspari, and Hugo Gressmann in the early years of the last century, many interpreters of SN
        assigned the individual scenes in CH to the genre of the novella (German
          <italic>Novelle</italic>), a literary type which has proved hard to pin down, as we may
        deduce from the <italic>OED</italic> definition of novella as ‘a short fictional prose
        narrative, a short novel, a long short story'. Gressmann distinguished the novella from
        historiography by virtue of its greater emotional intensity, its striking use of detail and
        avoidance of generalization, and its capacity to reveal the inner life of its characters.
        Also, unlike most historical writing, its actors play out their parts as much in the private
        as in the public sphere.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0309089213492811">40</xref></sup>
        It is such characteristics as these which permit the reader more easily to distinguish SN
        and other narrative cycles (e.g. those dealing with Elijah and Elisha) from the more
        annalistic and programmatic style of Dtr. Also characteristic of the novella is the use of
        traditional <italic>topoi</italic> which appear in different cultures with local variations,
        often drawing on oral tradition. Gressmann cites as an example the topos of the man who
        unknowingly bears the letter containing his own death sentence to his executioner.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0309089213492811">41</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Due to the influence of Gressmann in particular, it has become common to assign the
        individual episodes in SN to the genre of the novella, but Van Seters is unenthusiastic
        about this line of enquiry. His preference is for saga, but not as the equivalent of the
        German term <italic>Sage</italic>, which he finds too closely tied to oral tradition, and
        not at all in the sense in which Gunkel referred to <italic>die Sagen der Genesis</italic>
        in his monograph published in 1901 and his famous Genesis commentary.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0309089213492811">42</xref></sup> The term is to be taken,
        rather, in the sense in which it is used with reference to the Icelandic and Norse sagas,
        especially those composed in mediaeval Iceland dealing with the ‘heroic age’ of national and
        ethnic origins in the tenth and early eleventh centuries. He summarizes what he takes to be
        the features of this narrative genre most relevant for his purpose.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0309089213492811">43</xref></sup> The saga deals with families and heroic
        figures from the founding age; it is based on historical records embellished with fictional
        detail; it makes use of genealogies, chronology, and toponyms which serve as sites of memory
        to give a semblance of historicity, but its main purpose is to provide ‘serious
        entertainment'; it employs a variety of literary conventions; and it will sometimes do so in
        order to parody and subvert those conventions and the image of the ‘heroic age’ which they
        serve to represent.</p>
      <p>The following remarks about Van Seters' interpretation of the Succession Narrative/Court
        History seem to be in order.</p>
      <p>(1) The hypothesis of the origin of SN in anti-messianic Jewish circles in the late Persian
            period<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0309089213492811">44</xref></sup> would have
        been more persuasive, or at least would have appeared less arbitrary, if some attempt had
        been made to identify these circles. Additions to prophetic books are notoriously difficult
        to date, but by that time, the late Persian period, the Davidicmessianic movement had
        reached a mature stage of literary expression.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0309089213492811">45</xref></sup> Later developments include the portrayal of
        David as penitent and Solomon as sinner, punished and forgiven, in Sir. 47.1–22; messianic
        allusions in <sc>lxx</sc>; events in David's life referred to in notations at the head of
        several psalms;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0309089213492811">46</xref></sup> and the
        tradition about David as prophet and liturgical musician in the formation of the psalm
        collection as it eventuated in Qumran (e.g. 11QPs<sup>a</sup>) and early Christianity (e.g.
        Acts 2.25–28). In none of these, and in none of the many other allusions to David in later
        post-exilic writings, do we find anything remotely similar to the portrait of David which
        Van Seters extracts from SN.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0309089213492811">47</xref></sup> Throughout the Second Temple period, attempts were made to come to terms
        with the eclipse of the Davidic dynasty and work out some accommodation with imperial rule.
        The polarity between theocracy and eschatology, including messianic eschatology, on which
        much has been written, is also a factor,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0309089213492811">48</xref></sup> suggesting an increasing emphasis on temple and priesthood at that time
        and a consequent de-emphasis on messianism. The theocracy–eschatology duality is perhaps
        useful as a guide to certain tendencies during the time of the Second Temple, but it can be
        misleading if understood too categorically. Chronicles, for example, is thoroughly
        theocratic yet assigns transcendent importance to David and is not hostile to monarchy. The
        existence of an anti-Davidic and anti-Solomonic movement in the late Persian period
        therefore still awaits demonstration.</p>
      <p>(2) In reading what Van Seters has to say about genre, what seems most important for him is
        to exclude the possibility of oral tradition as a source for SN—understandably in view of
        his theory about its purpose in relation to Dtr. He therefore rejects the designation
        ‘traditional story’ in his discussion of Gunn, Culley, and other contributors to the debate,
        and opts for the Icelandic sagas as the most promising comparative material. He cites the
        early Icelandic historian Ari Thorgilssen as a source for the authors of the sagas, but the
        fact that Thorgilssen depended on and cited oral sources considerably reduces the force of
        the argument.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0309089213492811">49</xref></sup> What both
        Thorgilssen and the sagas have in common is dependence on a strong story-telling oral
        tradition, parallel to the early oral stage in the development of the Icelandic legal
        tradition. It is this tradition of oral story-telling that explains the formal
        characteristics, the limited patterns of expression, and the literary ‘grammar’ of the
        sagas, giving them a character which, on the whole, is quite different from SN.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0309089213492811">50</xref></sup> The word ‘saga’, cognate with
        German <italic>sagen</italic> and English ‘say’, means, after all, ‘something said or told'.
        The sagas are also much longer—the Njáls Saga, for example, has 158 chapters, each with
        about sixty to eighty lines—and length is a not insignificant feature of any literary
            work.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0309089213492811">51</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Other problems arise when one proposes the saga for purposes of comparison while failing to
        take into account the ethos and moral world displayed in these records of the heroic age of
        Iceland. Van Seters accuses David, on his deathbed, of refusing to forgive Shimei ben Gera
        (1 Kgs 2.8–9; cf. 2 Sam. 16.5–14),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0309089213492811">52</xref></sup> but that is precisely what was called for according to the ethos and
        code of honour of the heroic age, whether in Iceland or Greece or Israel. Who ever forgives
        in the Iliad?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0309089213492811">53</xref></sup> In this
        respect, the situation is no different in biblical narrative where the standard term for
        ‘forgive’ (<italic>slḥ</italic>), with its corresponding substantive
          (<italic>s<sup>e</sup>lîḥâ</italic>), occurs about fifty times, but never of one person
        forgiving another. Only God forgives, or occasionally refuses to do so. According to the
        unwritten honour code of heroic-age cultures, well represented in the sagas, it was a moral
        requirement to repair self-esteem damaged by hostile action, as David commanded Solomon to
        do with respect to Shimei who cursed him (1 Kgs 2.8–9; 2 Sam. 16.5–14). Another strike
        against David according to Van Seters is that he failed to make restitution to the
        Philistines for spoil taken from them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0309089213492811">54</xref></sup> This would have sounded absurd and incomprehensible to Hauskuld, Hrut,
        Njál, or any of these heroes of old. As in ancient Greece and ancient Israel, war booty was
        a major incentive to warfare and an essential element in the economy. This is not to say
        that we, the readers, must accept and condone what is recorded as done in keeping with that
        ethos, but if we wish to understand the text in front of us we need to maintain some
        distance between our own moral criteria and those of the world, historical or fictional,
        described in the sagas and in the biblical text.</p>
      <p>In spite of the author's defence of his choice, and notwithstanding the presence of motifs
        which the sagas share with SN as well as with many other compositions, one cannot help
        wondering why Van Seters would choose for purposes of comparison texts composed in
        mediaeval, Christianized Iceland when others much closer in time, culture, and narrative
        theme are available. If one is looking for vivid narratives involving vacillating male
        weaklings, strong, decisive women, transgressive sexuality, murder and mayhem, there is
        Herodotus writing at the time Van Seters assigns to his CH.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0309089213492811">55</xref></sup> Other options among the Greek historians
        include Xenophon (<italic>Cyropaedia, Hellenica, Anabasis</italic>) and Ctesias, physician
        to Artaxerxes II Mnemon, familiar with palace intrigues, feuds, attempted coups, and court
        behaviour in general. These authors, much closer to the time and culture of late Second
        Temple Judaism, provide an abundance of vignettes and novellas comparable to scenes in Van
        Seters’ CH.</p>
      <p>(3) In both sections of Van Seters’ Saga of King David, he portrays David in relentlessly
        negative terms. In total contrast to the righteous and just ruler depicted in Dtr, the David
        of CH has absolutely no redeeming features. In his relations with his sons and his generals
        he shows himself to be ‘a moral and spiritual weakling'.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0309089213492811">56</xref></sup> In spite of being ‘a conquering despot’ who
        gains control by violence, scheming and assassination, he is often politically inept, for
        example in unleashing a civil war because of his failure to control his sons.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0309089213492811">57</xref></sup> In his relations with members
        of his entourage he acts in a contemptible, duplicitous, and disloyal manner. Unlike the
        David of Dtr, he never leads his troops in battle but lets others do the fighting for
            him.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0309089213492811">58</xref></sup> He refuses to
        forgive Shimei, shows no tenderness towards the lame Mephibaal, cares nothing for either
        Michal or Bathsheba, and shows no concern either for dishonoured Tamar or for his ten
        concubines left behind in Jerusalem during the rebellion. In being influenced by the wise
        woman's flattery, he shows himself to be stupid as well as unjust (2 Sam. 14.20).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0309089213492811">59</xref></sup> This list of moral
        indictments, by no means exhaustive, is part of an argument which is essentially circular.
        Its purpose is to show that the author of CH intended to undermine the favourable view of
        David in Dtr, but on Van Seters’ reading the Dtr in question is what is left of 1 Samuel 16
        to 2 Samuel 8 after he has picked out the parts he assigns to his David Saga, the parts in
        which he finds the negative assessment of David. Apart from that, the verdict on the kings
        of Judah in Dtr, as noted earlier, compares them, favourably or unfavourably, with David on
        the basis not of moral character and moral behaviour but of their fidelity to the exclusive
        cult of Yahweh. There is nothing in the Court History/Succession History to contradict this
        Dtr criterion. The David of CH worships in ‘the house of Yahweh’ (2 Sam. 12.20), confesses
        that he has sinned against Yahweh (2 Sam. 12.13, 16, 22), and is resigned to the will of
        Yahweh at the outset of Absalom's rebellion (15.25).</p>

      <title>5. Conclusion</title>
      <p>Beginning with the Bathsheba incident as a distinctive text bracketed within the account of
        the last phase of the Ammonite campaign (2 Sam. 11–12), we can trace thematic links with the
        final episode (1 Kgs 1–2) which provides the key to the sequence of events in 2 Samuel 11–12
        with the accession to the throne of Solomon–Jedidiah. The two intermediate sections of
        unequal length (2 Sam. 13–14 and 15–20) tell a dark tale of rape, treachery, murder, and
        rebellion cryptically foretold in the first episode (2 Sam. 12.10–12). These narratives are
        shaped around the first of two fratricides, that of Amnon by Absalom, skilfully mirrored in
        the <italic>récit à cadre</italic> or ‘story within the story’ told by the Tekoan woman (2
        Sam. 14.4–7). The second fratricide, that of Adonijah put to death by Solomon (1 Kgs
        2.19–25), closes out the Succession Narrative with Solomon firmly established as David's
        successor. The concluding statement, ‘So the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon’
        (1 Kgs 2.46b), is the final touch of the scribe responsible for the insertion into Dtr of
        this complex and carefully structured narrative, a statement which justifies the insertion,
        using practically identical language, with reference to the prediction of the prophet Nathan
        (2 Sam. 7.12); another example, therefore, of the prophecy–fulfillment pattern recurrent
        throughout Dtr.</p>
      <p>The proposal therefore is to read 2 Samuel 11–20 + 1 Kings 1–2 as structurally and
        thematically one coherent narrative. As such, it is one of several fairly extensive
        sources—another would be the collection of prophetic <italic>legenda</italic> between 1
        Kings 17 and 2 Kings 13—incorporated into the historical record at some point in its
        formation. About the date of composition of SN there is no consensus. Since it contains no
        hint of a post-disaster situation, an educated guess would place it during the later period
        of the Judaean monarchy, perhaps during the reign of Hezekiah, the first Judaean king since
        Solomon to rule without a counterpart in the tribal territory to the north.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0309089213492811">61</xref></sup> But what is beyond doubt is
        its technical and dramatic brilliance and profundity as one of the great masterpieces of
        ancient Hebrew narrative.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0309089213492811">62</xref></sup> All of this is, as I have argued, needlessly lost sight of in the
        redactional and reductionist approaches represented, respectively, by the studies of
        Professors Dietrich and Van Seters.</p>

        <p>The subject of the verb <italic>wayyišlaḥ</italic> (2 Sam. 12.25) is not stated. If it
          was David rather than Yahweh who assigned the name Jedidiah and conveyed it to Bathsheba
          by means of Nathan, it may have been an additional sobriquet, or a throne name, expressive
          of the love of Yahweh for the child stated in the previous verse. Steven McKenzie,
          ‘Jedidyah’, in C. Lichtert and D. Nocquet (eds.), <italic>Le Roi Salomon: un héritage en
            question. Hommage à Jacques Vermeylen</italic> (Brussels: Lessius, 2008), pp. 87–97,
          explains the nonappearance of the name elsewhere by appealing, ill-advisedly in my
          opinion, to the elaborate stratification theory of Veijola according to which 2 Sam.
          12.24–25 would belong to the latest, post-Dtr stratum of 2 Sam. 11–12.</p>

        <p>An example from the first pages of his <italic>History</italic> (I.8–13) tells how
          Candaules, king of Lydia, was so proud of his wife's beauty that he coerced Gyges, his
          bodyguard, to hide in his bedchamber and view her naked. Unfortunately for Candaules,
          however, the queen discovered what he had done, and confronted Gyges with the choice of
          killing her husband or being himself killed on the spot. The outcome was that Gyges ended
          up king of Lydia in the place of Candaules.</p>

        <p>Biblical tradition attributes to Hezekiah the composition of a psalm (Isa. 38.9) and to
          ‘Hezekiah's men’ the collecting, copying, and composition of proverbs (Prov. 25.1).
          According to <italic>b. B. Bat</italic>. 15a, Hezekiah and his helpers wrote (copied?)
          Proverbs, the Canticle, Qoheleth and the book of Isaiah. This appears to have been a time
          of state consolidation, pride in the national dynasty, and considerable scribal activity.
          Solomon's role as founder and role model for scribes and sages could also have been a
          factor at that time. See David W. Jamieson-Drake, <italic>Scribes and Schools in Monarchic
            Judah: A Socio-Archeological Approach</italic> (Sheffield: Almond Press, 1991), and my
            <italic>Sage, Priest, Prophet: Religious and Intellectual Leadership in Ancient
            Israel</italic> (Louisville, KY: Westminster/John Knox Press, 1995), pp. 32–37.</p>

        <p>In agreement with R.N. Whybray, <italic>The Succession Narrative: A Study of II Sam. 9–20
            and I Kings 1 and 2</italic> (London: SCM Press, 1968), p. 115: ‘The Succession
          Narrative is immeasurably superior in conception, in technique and in psychological
          insight to any of its Hebrew predecessors, or indeed to its successors'. Whybray, however,
          read it as a product of the ‘Solomonic enlightenment’ following the lead of Gerhard von
          Rad, ‘Die Weisheit Salomos',’, <italic>TLZ</italic> 76 (1951), cols. 139–44; <italic>idem,
