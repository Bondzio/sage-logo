<p><bold>The Problem.</bold></p>
<p>Universities struggle to create cultures that provide a welcoming home for women and underrepresented minorities. Department chairs often emerge reluctantly from among the faculty and are ill prepared to engage faculty and staff to achieve deep culture change, yet their role is vital if such change is to occur.</p>
<p><bold>The Solution.</bold></p>
<p>Recognizing a need for a completely new type of leader, Ohio State created the President and Provost’s Leadership Institute (PPLI) to develop a pool of women and underrepresented minority faculty who might move into leadership positions.</p>
<p><bold>The Stakeholders.</bold></p>
<p>The PPLI can provide a useful template for HRD practitioners who wish to tailor leadership development and succession planning strategies to address higher education’s unique culture and leadership pool challenges. For institutions interested in broadening the diversity of individuals prepared to lead, and developing leaders prepared to lead change, the PPLI is an example of one successful approach.</p>

<p>Higher education is ill prepared to navigate the pace and significance of change in the 21st century. Leaders are pulled from among the faculty who generally resist being led anywhere; leading faculty is often referred to as <italic>herding cats</italic> and faculty training often does not provide support for those thrust into leadership roles. Universities struggle with developing a welcoming and engaging culture for women and underrepresented minority faculty. Recognizing that department chairs play a vital role leading culture change, facilitating inclusive and supportive environments, and supporting faculty success, Ohio State created the PPLI to develop a pool of women and underrepresented minority faculty who might move into leadership positions. Our purpose is to share what we learned through developing, implementing, and evaluating the PPLI to contribute to the growing practice of leadership development and succession planning in higher education, with special attention to women and underrepresented minorities.</p>

<title>Women and Leadership Development in Higher Education</title>
<p>Although the proportion of women faculty has increased in recent decades, women still comprise the minority of tenured and tenure-track faculty in higher education institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1523422311428758">West &amp; Curtis, 2006</xref>). Women continue to be underrepresented in academic leadership positions in higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1523422311428758">Niemeier &amp; González, 2004</xref>). Women faculty often report feeling unwelcome or marginalized in academic departments, and higher education institutions struggle to improve department climates so as to welcome women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1523422311428758">MIT Committee on Women Faculty, 1999</xref>). Women department chairs report that the “culture they inherited was portrayed as having been problem-ridden and ineffectual” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1523422311428758">Mullen, 2009</xref>, p. 3). Numerous authors have identified the key role that department chairs play creating a constructive department climate and faculty job satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1523422311428758">August &amp; Waltman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1523422311428758">Ellingson, Reichers, Molloy, &amp; Sutton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1523422311428758">Wergin, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In her review of the literature, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1523422311428758">Kloot (2004)</xref> identified a variety of schools of thought as to why women faculty were not advancing in the leadership ranks at universities, including an inadequate pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1523422311428758">Sinclair, 1998</xref>), women’s experience being devalued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1523422311428758">Bailyn, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1523422311428758">Benschop &amp; Brouns, 2003</xref>), institutional discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1523422311428758">Bailyn, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1523422311428758">MIT Committee on Women Faculty, 1999</xref>), desire for work-life balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1523422311428758">Morley, Bellamy, Jackson, &amp; O’Neill, 2002</xref>), leadership conceptualized as a function of masculine characteristics, and differences between women’s and men’s goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1523422311428758">Gilligan, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1523422311428758">Sinclair, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1523422311428758">Sagaria, Pruit, and Gagne (1992)</xref> found that women and minority candidates for leadership positions at Ohio State were subjected to additional filters that debased and discounted their previous experience.</p>
<p>The role of academic leaders has changed over the past two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1523422311428758">Barden, 2009</xref>) from manager to leader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422311428758">Lucas, 2000</xref>), demanding skills in conflict negotiation and resolution, influencing without formal authority, coaching, problem solving, communication, change management, and community development. Leadership-development opportunities need to follow suit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1523422311428758">Bowman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1523422311428758">Hecht, Higgerson, Gmelch, &amp; Tucker, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1523422311428758">Hill, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>HRD is concerned with leadership development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1523422311428758">AHRD, 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1523422311428758">Burgoyne, Mackness, and Williams (2009)</xref> found that leadership development in higher education institutions was increasing in importance, reporting that “Top aims concerning individuals were to develop capacity for future roles . . .” (p. 5) and recommending that leadership development be integrated with culture change initiatives and succession planning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1523422311428758">Clunies (2004)</xref> suggests that succession planning might be more palatable in higher education if it focuses on creating pools of qualified individuals rather than identifying the next occupant of a president, provost, or dean position; and that deans and other leaders be involved in identifying high-potential individuals.</p>

<title>History and Institutional Context</title>
<p>The Ohio State University is a public research university with 56,064 students on the Columbus campus and 64,077 on all campuses. Ohio State employs 3,794 faculty (2,982 regular, 720 clinical, 92 research), 2,226 auxiliary faculty, 22,323 staff, and 14,027 student employees. As of autumn 2010, it is the third largest U.S. university by enrollment. The institution has 170 undergraduate majors; 143 master’s, 106 doctoral, seven professional degree programs; and offers approximately 12,000 courses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1523422311428758">The Ohio State University Statistical Summary, 2010</xref>). Leading change in an institution of this size, or in higher educational generally, is an enormous undertaking that demands talent and focus. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1523422311428758">Gee (2009)</xref> likens it to “changing an elephant to a ballerina” (p. 11).</p>
<p>The Women’s Place (TWP) was established in 1999 at Ohio State to serve as a catalyst for institutional change to expand opportunities for women’s growth, leadership, and power in an inclusive, supportive, and safe university environment. An early TWP project was the Faculty Cohort Study, which examined why more women than men faculty voluntarily resigned from the university prior to the tenure decision. The study followed women faculty hired in 2001 with the goal of understanding the factors that led women to stay or resign from the university. Two important findings were the significance of the department’s culture in the retention of women faculty, and the department chair’s key role in creating that culture. The study concluded that if the university hoped to retain greater numbers of women faculty, it needed to reassess who it selected for department chair roles and how it trained them to be leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1523422311428758">Ellingson et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The Women’s Place also conducts an annual data analysis to track the status of women at Ohio State. The data analysis done while the Faculty Cohort Study was in process showed that beginning in the late 1990s, even though the numbers of women faculty had slowly increased, the number of women in department chair positions had declined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1523422311428758">President’s Council on Women’s Issues, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The Women’s Place partnered with the Office of Human Resources to offer the PPLI in 2005. Its purpose was to address the decline in women department chairs by creating a pool of women who were prepared and willing to move into the positions. The focus was also to be on creating a new kind of leader—one that could lead departments’ transformations into inclusive and supportive environments in which all could contribute their best work.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1523422311428758">
<title>PPLI Design Process</title>
<p>In 2004, a needs assessment was conducted to identify the content of a leadership development series geared toward developing tenured faculty into academic leaders. Individual interviews were conducted with approximately nine deans and 12 department chairs. The interviews focused on the skills, knowledge, and understandings that the deans and chairs (a) wish they had before they assumed a formal leadership position and (b) would like individuals they might appoint to such positions to have. The most common and strongest response was solid skills at conflict management and having difficult conversations. In addition to identifying its future content, one of the best outcomes of the interviews was support for the institute among the deans and chairs.</p>
<p>Group interviews were held with women faculty who had served as chairs or associate deans or who been sponsored to participate in a significant academic leadership development experience such as the Higher Education Resource Services (HERS) Bryn Mawr Summer Institute or the Committee on Institutional Cooperation’s (CIC) Academic Leadership Program. The focus of the interviews was the same as that with the deans and chairs.</p>
<p>The proposed PPLI curriculum was drafted based on a review of the topics taught at the CIC and HERS programs and the interview results. The curriculum was shared for feedback with the interviewed deans and chairs, and then reviewed by the provost, vice president for human resources, and council of deans, with feedback integrated at each step in the process. As a result of the assessment and development process, the PPLI enjoyed support at all levels of the university when announced in 2005.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1523422311428758">
<title>Institute Goals, Philosophy, and Curriculum</title>
<p>The PPLI has been a 2-year leadership training program for tenure or clinical-track faculty. The goal has been to create and expand a pool of potential leaders from groups that have traditionally been underrepresented in academic leadership, to encourage deans to appoint more women to department chair positions, to encourage women to undertake formal leadership roles, and to provide future leaders with the development they need to create a culture that is hospitable and supportive of all.</p>
<p>The PPLI is unique in that it provides faculty with formal development prior to assuming formal leadership positions; it serves as a quasi-succession planning program. Additionally, it focuses on how to create inclusive, supportive and hospitable climates, as opposed to the nuts-and-bolts training provided by many academic (chair) leadership-development programs.</p>
<p>The PPLI consists of individual assessments; workshops, many with accompanying books; lunch presentations/discussions with university and community leaders; and out of the classroom development experiences, different for each cohort. For a complete list, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1523422311428758">Figure 1</xref>. Participants developed leadership networks with each other and leaders who were lunch guests. Workshops provided opportunities for participants to understand themselves, how they interact with others, and to learn and practice skills in technical (e.g., budget system) and professional areas (e.g., handling difficult conversations, conflict). The PPLI is unusual in its emphasis on people skills and helping people learn how to create inclusive, supportive, and hospitable climates.</p>

<sec id="section5-1523422311428758">
<title>Institute Participants</title>
<p>Four cohorts have completed the institute, and the fifth will begin in the 2011-2012 academic year. Women and members of underrepresented minorities have made up approximately 85% of the participants. Because both male and female leaders need to create a hospitable and supportive culture, majority males have been welcome. Deans select the participants and are asked to select faculty who have potential to assume formal leadership positions at the university within 2 to 5 years. The usual cohort size has been 24. Each cohort met together at least monthly for 2 years. A significant number of participants have entered into formal leadership positions, including vice provost, associate provost, department chair, associate dean, and dean; this data is reported in the Numbers in Leadership Positions section later in this article.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1523422311428758">
<title>Evaluation Process and Data</title>
<p>Our research used a mixed-methods approach, built on a variety of data sources collected as a part of the evaluation of the PPLI after the completion of the fourth cohort. We conducted two focus groups to which PPLI alumni were invited; outcomes were checked against the results of two focus groups conducted during the institute’s second year. We interviewed nearly all deans, asking for impressions and suggestions regarding the PPLI, and conducted an on-line survey of PPLI alumni. We analyzed a list of faculty members in formal administrative positions obtained from the Office of Human Resources for data on PPLI graduates who have taken formal administrative posts. Finally, several Institute graduates, department chairs, and others volunteered comments and suggestions in a less formal way; these are not reported separately but rather are integrated throughout the section and noted when reported.</p>
<sec id="section7-1523422311428758">
<title>Focus Groups With Participants</title>
<p>Two focus groups were conducted with PPLI graduates, conducted by an organization development consultant from the Office of Human Resources. Institute coordinators did not participate to ensure that alumni could voice honest opinions. There was strong support for continuing the PPLI. As one said, 90% of the program is wonderful and the rest just needs minor changes. When asked what impact PPLI had on people and what skills they acquired, answers included connecting and networking (with the wish that the groups could get back together and/or keep informed of each others’ activities); better perspective; how to run meetings; and broadening the idea of <italic>leadership—</italic>as one person put it, they learned the “skills to make the workplace better.” Some participants determined that they did <italic>not</italic> want to be administrators, and agreed that they had more appreciation of those who are good administrators. Handling difficult conversations was reported as a key skill gained through the Institute. Participants were positive about the individual assessments and reported using their increased understanding of self and others to help them work with more productively. Lunches with leaders were appreciated.</p>
<p>There was strong support for continuing the PPLI along with suggestions for improvements. The idea of purpose was raised several times with people suggesting that we determine whether the PPLI is intended to create department chairs or to develop leaders more broadly. Some confusion between PPLI and Academic Leader Development (Ohio State’s leadership development program for current deans and chairs) reflects the same issue. Additional topics that participants suggested be added include time management, delegation, saying no, the upside of leadership (many leaders focused on the challenges), and leading change. Career mapping and working with a career coach were suggested by several. Focus-group participants were very positive and had recommended the PPLI to others.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1523422311428758">
<title>Individual Interviews With Deans</title>
<p>The Director of The Women’s Place met with 19 deans individually throughout 2010. As part of those meetings she asked about the PPLI and the faculty their college had sent. Most deans were able to name the PPLI participants or quickly recognized them on a list. One dean was a graduate of the PPLI and credited it with being the reason he was in the position. In three cases, the dean had intentionally used a PPLI graduate in a position such as assistant or associate dean. Graduates had also taken positions such as unit head; center director; or curriculum committee, graduate committee, or search committee chair. The deans remarked on specific graduates with comments such as “PPLI really elevated her into a leadership role” or on seeing a “new willingness to stretch.” Another graduate’s development was described as “really remarkable.” This was a person whose work had always been good, but the dean described in detail significant advances in the ability to see larger university issues and to bring her own staff along in an effort to transform their culture.</p>
<p>The deans also discussed broader leadership issues that they felt PPLI addressed. One noted that “leadership is an integral part of academic life” and several talked about the importance of PPLI as training for leaders. One dean noted with frustration that academic leadership at universities tends to remain heavily male whereas administrative leadership tends to have better representation of women. This dean hoped that PPLI graduates would play a role in changing this balance at Ohio State. Several deans noted that if a faculty member found that administration was not for her or him that was a good outcome too; one dean disagreed. The PPLI allowed the person to make that discovery without wasting time in an administrative position. It was also seen to foster empathy for administrative leaders and create better university citizens. One dean described the program as helping each person to “find their own voice.” An interesting take on this theme came from a dean of a professional college who noted that the PPLI had been especially helpful in socializing faculty from that college into how academic faculty (as opposed to practicing professionals) should behave.</p>
<p>Several deans also discussed the importance of PPLI as a help to succession planning. One relatively new dean felt that Ohio State has a weakness in succession planning and that there were not enough people ready to step into leadership roles or even to help lead departments in difficult conversations about leadership. He suggested that PPLI graduates should be in good positions to undertake these discussions. The notion of significant numbers of retirements of senior faculty and leaders at the university also came up from the deans and PPLI was seen as providing a talent pool to help fill the gap that those retirees will leave.</p>
<p>At least one dean was disappointed with people who decided against administrative roles. He asked that we emphasize the importance of PPLI graduates being willing to take on leadership roles. For him, the choice to <italic>not</italic> lead was not acceptable. Some newer deans suggested that they might have chosen different individuals than the previous person in their position. This difference of opinion could help explain why some PPLI graduates are not finding the leadership positions they had hoped for. It also reiterates the importance of careful selection of candidates for the Institute.</p>
<p>All deans interviewed were positive about the Institute, what it covers, and most of its graduates. Those who had used PPLI graduates in leadership positions were pleased with their growth and abilities. No dean suggested ending the program, and the only changes suggested were the emphasis on the responsibility of those who receive the training and the need to select participants carefully.</p>
<p>The deans and graduates agree that the PPLI had a significant role in the personal development of the graduates and in their ability to be good university citizens. The deans discussed broader policy issues more often, which may have reflected both their position in the university and the setting in which they were asked for feedback—individual interviews rather than focus groups or surveys. In most cases, it appears that both the administrator who paid for the program and the person who went through the program felt it was a worthwhile endeavor for the individual and the university.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1523422311428758">
<title>On-Line Survey</title>
<p>An on-line survey was administered by the Office of Human Resources to all PPLI graduates still at Ohio State in March of 2010. Although different numbers of people answered different questions, there were a total of 57 respondents, an overall response rate of 63%. The survey included open- and closed-ended questions. Much of the survey was aimed at finding out how graduates would change specific aspects of the Institute, and several questions were aimed at the broader evaluation. The latter group will be covered in this section.</p>
<p>The first series of questions asked how satisfied participants were with specific aspects of the PPLI such as developing a better understanding of one’s strengths and areas for growth and understanding personal style. Most aspects received positive reactions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1523422311428758">Figure 2</xref>). Only the item Making Sense of Budget and Finance Information had a majority of respondents dissatisfied.</p>

</fig>
<p>In open-ended questions, participants were asked what changes in perspective were triggered by their participation. The 51 responses to this question largely centered on increased perspective and self-control. Also reported was an increased sense of being part of a team and a realization of their importance to the university. Cynicism declined and appreciation of and respect for the work of administrators and of colleagues with different styles increased. Many reported gaining a greater appreciation for diversity—especially diversity of personality, work types, and personal style.</p>
<p>Participants were asked whether they had achieved what they wanted from the PPLI. Of 52 responses, only six were anything but positive. These six mentioned feeling that there was no role in leadership for them at Ohio State, having had inflated expectations for the program, the program emphasizing administrative positions as markers of leadership, and personal circumstances that took too much attention at the time. One noted that the respondent found the PPLI useful and valuable but that it did not resolve a major conflict this faculty member sees—the tension between academic rank and leadership position selection. The respondent noted a number of associate professors who want to move into leadership positions and may or may not be interested in promotion to full professor. The respondent felt that these people are automatically barred from formal leadership positions because they are not full professors, whether or not the leadership position involves overseeing faculty. This concern relates to a larger university discussion about associate professors and alternative career paths to promotion.</p>
<p>Respondents raised interesting issues about the nature of leadership versus administration. One participant asked whether (s)he became a “better me, a better leader or a better leader at OSU?” Many gained confidence in their abilities and most reported learning a great deal. The few critical comments ranged from personal issues (personal circumstances demanding attention) to structural issues with their particular part of the university that would keep them from leadership roles. Another felt that PPLI focused too much on formal administrative positions rather than leadership in general.</p>
<p>The survey also asked whether the value of the PPLI to the participant and to the institution was worth the cost of the program in terms of money and time. Of 52 respondents, only five people said anything other than “absolutely,” “yes,” or the equivalent. These five responded “I have no idea what it costs” (two people), “It depends on the success rate of graduates,” “probably,” or “cannot answer.” Some additional responses to this question were as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-1523422311428758" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Having some formal education in leadership will pay dividends in numerous ways to our own careers and to our contributions to the university.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I think this kind of program is crucial. I just hope that the university doesn’t allow its PPLI “graduates” to simply return to their departments without asking that they participate in some kind of leadership activities.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>. . . some of the longer term gains are subtle and difficult to gauge in the short term. I am definitely more engaged in University leadership and administration . . . I’ve benefited from the relationships that I developed with colleagues who I never would have met otherwise. Those relationships facilitate cross-campus engagement and collaboration which move us toward the One University vision. . . . My less cynical view of administrators makes more cooperative and understanding as a faculty member which ultimately helps the university grow and respond swiftly to challenges.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I was skeptical at first but I was quickly convinced that I made an excellent choice to take this opportunity.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I feel it was a great bargain. I don’t know of anything else in my academic career that made such a big difference to me.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I believe that nearly all faculty should be exposed to the concepts that we covered. I realize that this would be prohibitively expensive, but I feel that even if I never officially take on an official leadership position, that the lessons I learned will serve me well as an ordinary professor. . . . OSU as a whole would benefit from having faculty (at all levels) that are skilled in communication, negotiation and have a greater understanding of the “bigger picture.”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Yes, absolutely—in fact the institution should do more to invest in its faculty.</p></list-item></list>

<title>Numbers in Leadership Positions</title>
<p>The PPLI was not intended to train administrators as much as to train leaders. From that perspective, the program would be successful if its graduates became better departmental citizens, committee members, committee chairs or informal leaders. It was hoped that understanding leadership and their own capacity for leadership would help graduates move into and excel at administrative positions as well. The tenure initiating unit (TIU) head (chair/director) is seen as a key position in terms of changing department and university culture and retaining women faculty.</p>
<p>According to records provided by the Office of Human Resources, 19 unique individuals out of the 90 who have completed the PPLI and remain at Ohio State have held formal administrative positions between the end of their training and the Institute evaluation. These positions include five department chairs, one dean, seven associate deans, four directors, one associate director, one assistant dean, one vice provost, one associate provost, and one faculty fellow. Over two/thirds of these individuals were in the first cohort of the PPLI. These individuals are between three and four years post completion, so we would expect that they would be moving into administrative positions. Five PPLI graduates have left Ohio State, two for academic leadership positions.</p>
<p>Graduates of the PPLI are going into formal administrative posts at Ohio State at a high rate (20%) and becoming TIU heads at a higher rate than would be possible for all Ohio State faculty. Tenure initiating unit heads came from the first, third, and fourth cohorts, with the fourth cohort having the most (three). Chairs from the fourth cohort appear to have already been chairs or to have become chairs shortly after starting the PPLI. Other PPLI alumni have not yet taken formal posts, which may reflect the relatively short time since they completed the Institute.</p>
<p>The survey results indicate significant leadership by graduates of the PPLI in ways that are not captured by the Human Resource Information System. Of the 48 participants who responded to this question on the survey, 15 listed additional major responsibilities in their departments, including vice or associate chair, undergraduate studies chair, graduate studies chair, search committee chair, and so forth. Nine listed significant new college service including chairing task forces or committees, chairing the college faculty council, or directing a center. Eight cited new university level roles including senate committee chair. Seven reported additional responsibilities in national professional associations and several noted significant leadership roles in community service.</p>
<p>One cautionary note arises from the answers to this survey question, focus group comments, and personal conversations. A few participants have great interest in leadership positions and feel that they are cut off from access to these positions at Ohio State. One respondent said “I don’t think I will [have a leadership opportunity] unless I move to another position somewhere else . . . there is no opportunity on campus, and I do not think our leaders recognize the amount of learning an individual has as a result of this program.” Another said “This is a negative issue for me. I am now focusing on my research so I can pursue a leadership role at another institution.” A third participant expressed surprise, in a private conversation, at having no leadership opportunities offered to her. The focus groups noted that deans do not always know what skills the PPLI graduate has and that the university does not leverage the graduates to the extent that it could.</p>
<p>There are several possible interpretations of these issues. One is that the right opportunity has not yet appeared for some participants and that these opportunities will emerge over time. Alternatively decision makers may not perceive some of the graduates to have leadership potential. There were few respondents who cited this issue, and it is worth noting as a potential result of the Institute. Deans need to carefully select individuals they would actually consider employing in leadership positions for the Institute. It does little good to put unsuitable faculty into the PPLI, which can lead to problems in cohorts (some graduates reported such difficulties) and frustration for individuals who feel ignored after graduating. These comments also point to the need to ensure that graduates understand that they should proactively seek and accept leadership positions.</p>
<p>A few participants determined that formal leadership positions were not what they wanted after they had been through the PPLI. This new self-awareness is a worthwhile outcome; individuals and departments often suffer when faculty move into administrative leadership positions and discover after the fact that they do not desire, enjoy, or have the capacity to perform well in the position. Another small group noted that at the moment they had other priorities but planned to move into leadership roles later.</p>

<sec id="section11-1523422311428758">
<title>Changes to the Institute Based on the Evaluation</title>
<p>The evaluation of the PPLI leaves us with three main outcomes. First, the institute has been very successful by any measure and should be continued. Second, it is important that deans select participants that they plan to use for administrative roles. This matters to the success of each individual cohort’s experience and to the long-term satisfaction of the graduates and deans. Third, the PPLI’s purpose reflects a tension between broad leadership training and focused administrative training. In part, this results from the initial desire to develop a pool of potential TIU heads and the interaction of that goal over time with the PPLI graduates’ career positions, interests, and opportunities. The results of our analyses indicate that participants entered the PPLI experience with different needs and at different stages in their academic careers. Some were ready to take on administrative and leadership roles, others were still exploring or at life-cycle stages where administration would be difficult, and some were simply unsure of what they wanted. The institute’s purpose has gradually shifted to being primarily about creating faculty leaders, who then form a pool of individuals, among others, available for administrative positions.</p>
<p>Given these outcomes, we have concluded that the overarching purpose of the PPLI should be to improve participants’ leadership abilities in the broadest sense. The PPLI will run for 18 months and will focus on faculty members with leadership ambitions who need to develop depth and seasoning in personal and interpersonal skills. They will complete a similar curriculum to the original PPLI, with the exception of the budget and finance workshops, which are being discontinued. They will also take more time for reading, discussion, reflection, and networking as part of their work. They will be invited to participate in a selection of Ohio State’s Academic Leadership Development program offerings, which are aimed at sitting chairs and deans and provide nuts and bolts administration training.</p>
<p>Bringing faculty members together for this training is an investment in faculty careers, helps to break down silos, and will help provide a supportive environment in which all community members can thrive and do their best work. Continuing the institute will also contribute to the ongoing effort to improve the culture at Ohio State, providing academic leaders who understand the importance of a supportive and inclusive institutional culture to faculty success.</p>

<title>Implications for Higher Education Institutions</title>
<p>HRD and leadership development practitioners and scholars should be concerned about and can contribute effective approaches to the challenges faced by leaders in higher education. Given the current economic and political climate, higher education will continue to be under the microscope for the foreseeable future. Leaders must be able to create and solidify a vision, engage faculty and staff, and inspire them to move the department and institution to that vision more quickly than ever before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1523422311428758">Lucas, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422311428758">2000</xref>). Our past practices of rotating reluctant faculty members into a department chair position or selecting the most productive researcher/scientist to head the department cannot continue. We can neither afford for academic leadership positions to be viewed with distain by faculty and tolerated by staff. Nor can we afford to underutilize women as full members of our community of scholars and as potential academic leaders. Rather, we must reposition the view of academic leaders to encompass scholars who inspire departments, colleges, and institutions to greatness. And we must develop communities that inspire and value the contributions of women. To accomplish this, colleges and universities must do the following:</p>
<list id="list2-1523422311428758" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Orient faculty emphasizing institutional values and their membership in and responsibilities toward department and institutional communities.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Develop all faculty as leaders, and value them for leading in a variety of contexts, such as department chair, laboratory supervisor, research team lead, committee chair, and so on.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Select formal academic leaders on their leadership competencies rather than on their scholarship or their position in an artificial rotation.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1523422311428758">
<title>Lessons Learned</title>
<p>Higher education institutions offer particular challenges for HRD practitioners regarding leadership development and succession planning. As early as 1920, the American Association of University Professors called for faculty to be involved in the selection of administrators and other personnel decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1523422311428758">American Association of University Professors, 2011</xref>). Given the emphasis on shared governance in higher education, using a traditional approach to succession planning for academic leaders might well fail; many faculty would object to their leaders being predetermined through succession planning. Using the PPLI as a model, colleges and universities can proactively create pools of diverse individuals who are prepared to assume formal and informal leadership roles. When creating these pools, institutions need to plan how they will be used as positions and roles become available and need to be filled. Leaders who nominate or sponsor participants of such programs must take the nomination process seriously and recommend only those individuals they would be interested in placing in a formal or informal leadership position. To do otherwise invites resentment and hurts the program and institution in the long run.</p>
<p>Expanding the institution’s view of what constitutes leadership to include chairing major committees or leading university initiatives enables more faculty members to engage in meaningful ways that propel the institution toward its goals. Acknowledging that the discovery that one does not want to be an administrative leader (chair/dean) is a legitimate outcome can pave the way to increase the number of faculty who are effective followers/department members and also provide a cadre of individuals who can effectively take on the myriad of less formal leadership roles in the university.</p>
<p>It is difficult to find a large organization that is not engaged in some change effort. Linking leadership development and succession planning programs to change initiatives will help focus both the content and process of the program. Since its inception, the PPLI has been explicitly tied to change at Ohio State. Explicitly linking the institute to change encourages a needs assessment that examines change needs of the institution. This can and will focus the curriculum in areas that will advance institutional change goals as well as develop effective leaders. It can likewise identify practices that the organization desires to encourage in their leaders, such as action learning, coaching and feedback, or mentoring. Involving current leaders in the needs assessment and subsequent curriculum-design process can increase their engagement with and support of the program.</p>
<p>PPLI participants are nominated and sponsored by their current dean. We discovered that leaders need guidance from leadership development professionals about what to look for in a potential leader, how to communicate the nomination to the participant, and what specific steps the leader can take to support the participant throughout the program. Some supports that should be provided by the sponsoring leader are release time from specific job responsibilities, stretch assignments throughout the program to encourage the participant to apply what she is learning, and a commitment to regular interaction between the participant and the nominating leader.</p>
<p>Continuing opportunities for PPLI cohorts to interact among themselves and with each other provide networking opportunities that are beneficial to both the participants and the university. These opportunities can be workshops, social interactions, or service activities, among other things. Ensuring ongoing interactions among participants as they lead across the university could pay dividends in terms of (a) continuing their professional growth as leaders, (b) providing a network of women and minority leaders prepared to support each other, and (c) reinforcing aspects of leadership that contribute to culture change.</p>

<title>Implications for Future Research</title>
<p>With the increasing demands of higher education and the need to accelerate the pace of change within institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1523422311428758">Gee, 2009</xref>), academic leaders must be prepared to inspire a vision of the future and lead departments toward a different future. Given this need, greater attention needs to be paid toward the competencies that department chairs and other academic leaders need as well as what methods of learning net the most meaningful changes in leadership performance. Relevant and informative questions for future research include the following:</p>
<list id="list3-1523422311428758" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>What is the best mix of formal and informal learning opportunities for department chairs?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What principles of executive leadership development best transfer to higher education?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How can institutions best create, maintain, and develop pools of faculty with leadership potential?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How can we influence the acculturation of faculty to be more amenable to a shared departmental vision, collective effort, and department leadership?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What type of leader and leadership approaches most successfully lead the transformation of department and institutional culture?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What should be the focus of academic leader search process so as to net the most effective leader?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Department chairs and other university administrators play crucial roles creating the climate that leads to productive faculty lives for all. These leaders are pulled from the ranks of the faculty and few have had any training or mentoring in how to do the job well. Given the importance of employing faculty as academic leaders and the challenges currently facing higher education, it is crucial that we develop better ways to (a) help faculty members determine if they want to undertake leadership in advance of accepting such roles, and (b) train faculty members who want to accept the challenge of leadership so that they have the skills and background to be successful. HRD and leadership professionals can play an important role in leading these efforts within higher education settings. Well-trained leaders will be better able to create a welcoming environment and to establish a culture that can change quickly and display the resilience needed in our current environment.</p>
