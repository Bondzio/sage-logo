<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A major document about policy for English schools issued by the then recently installed Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government in 2010 included this statement: ‘… [T]he features of the strongest education systems combine autonomy (e.g. over staffing powers at school level) with accountability (e.g. systematic and external pupil-level assessments)’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741143212451171">DfE 2010</xref>: para. 5.1). This was not a new focus. In 1975, the fourth Annual Conference of the British Educational Administration Society (BEAS, now BELMAS) had as its theme ‘Autonomy and Accountability in Educational Administration’. The published Proceedings were edited by Meredydd Hughes and John Richards, and in their concluding comments they wrote: ‘Our concern has been with accountability and autonomy, not as alternatives, but as significant and meaningful concepts which need to be better understood in relation to each other, having regard to specific organisational settings’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741143212451171">Hughes and Richards, 1975</xref>: 50). This is the same connection that the 2010 government document made 35 years later, and the emphasis on this theme persisted and indeed grew sharply throughout this period. In this article I will briefly outline this trajectory but my main intention will be to analyse the forces underlying what has become a preoccupation in English schools policy, making some reference to international evidence and practice. I will argue that the last six words of the quote above from Hughes and Richards’s 1975 conclusion, ‘having regard to specific organisational settings’ were particularly significant and are highly relevant to an explanation of the staying power of these concepts.</p>
<p>BELMAS has not published proceedings of its annual conferences for many years. In sharp contrast to practice in later years, in the early conferences keynote addresses given in plenary session were a dominant part of the programme and the vast majority of participants were UK based.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1741143212451171">1</xref>
</sup> Out of 115 participants at the 1975 conference, only 12 were from outside the UK: half of these were from Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741143212451171">Hughes and Richards, 1975</xref>). Consequently the keynotes published in the proceedings concentrated on the British – and very largely the English – scene.</p>

<title>A Brief Note on the Context</title>
<p>Only the briefest sketch of the 1970s context is possible here. Reviewing the governance of education in England in the post-war period, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1741143212451171">Manzer (1970</xref>) identified what he called an ‘education sub-government’ in which the central education department, the associations representing the local education authorities and the teachers’ unions consulted and negotiated until a consensus emerged. Much of the discussion took place privately between officials of the various bodies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1741143212451171">Judge (1977</xref>: 96) called this arrangement a ‘friendly conspiracy’ which broke down under ideological and economic pressures. The liberal and optimistic mood of the 1960s gave way to a ‘battle for ideas’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1741143212451171">Riley 1998</xref>: 19) epitomized by the series of ‘Black Papers’, the first of which was published in 1969 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741143212451171">Cox and Dyson, 1969</xref>). These attacked, for example, progressive teaching methods and perceived egalitarianism in education and sanctified the language of educational ‘standards’ that became conventional usage in educational rhetoric from the 1990s onwards. The rise in oil prices and recession of the early 1970s that prompted massive cuts in the education budget also contributed to the breakdown of the ‘fragile consensus’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1741143212451171">Tomlinson, 2001</xref>: 19).</p>

<title>The Annual Conference of 1975</title>
<p>These trends were already under way when BEAS met at University College, Cardiff in early October 1975. One consequence was a pressure to bring citizens including parents more strongly into the governance of schools. The government had recently set up the Taylor Committee to review the composition and functions of school governing bodies. Seven members of the Committee including its secretary attended the conference, though Professor George Baron, a co-founder of BEAS and vice chairman at the time as well as being a member of the Taylor Committee was not present.</p>
<p>The first keynote was given by J.R. Boynton, Chief Executive of Cheshire County Council. The education service was gripped by the fear of ‘corporate management’, a large-scale attempt to integrate services and centralize power within local authorities, which was threatening to reduce its prime and powerful position: some in local government described education as ‘the cuckoo in the nest’. Boynton tried to reassure participants about the beneficent intentions of those in the increasingly dominant position of council chief executive. He maintained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741143212451171">1975</xref>: 6) that ‘A strong and vigorous local government is a good corner stone for any truly democratic system’ while warning education that there were other legitimate calls on resources: ‘If we are in for a time of recession, then we cannot afford to run down the forces of law and order. There may be unemployed roaming the streets’ (1975: 7), a prophetic warning in the light of the summer riots in English cities in 2011. He was prophetic too in proposing that more resources should be devolved to schools and that heads should have to set objectives and become more accountable for the use of resources. In the event the fear of excessive corporate management appears to have been unjustified. For example a report by a committee of Members of Parliament in 2011 found little evidence of pressure to integrate public services at local level and concluded that central government had become too intrusive: ‘The Government will have to resist temptation to intervene in local affairs – a measure of restraint for which ministers have shown worryingly little appetite thus far’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741143212451171">House of Commons, 2011</xref>: 5).</p>
<p>The first respondent to Boynton was E. Currie-Jones, Chairman of South Glamorgan Education Committee. He gave a guarded welcome to a corporate approach, believing it could facilitate integrated and focused solutions to the problems of deprived areas. At the time, the English and Welsh school systems were closely aligned but since 1999 political devolution has set the two systems on divergent paths. The systems in Scotland and Northern Ireland have historically been distinct from that of England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741143212451171">Croxford, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The other respondent was Alan Barnes, Head of Ruffwood School in Liverpool, president of the Headmasters Association and later chairman of BEMAS (as BEAS became in the 1980s with ‘management’ included in the title). He felt corporate management in local government was leading to too much centralization and interference in professional decisions, for example over staff recruitment. On measuring performance he thought assessing the success of a school or a teacher was ‘a subtle business’ that needed to take account of non-quantifiable achievements and it would be wise to ‘back HMI [Her Majesty’s Inspectors] against the computer’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741143212451171">Barnes, 1975</xref>: 12–13). He thought a different structure for schools, outside the local government system, should be considered. He suggested (1975: 15) either a move to more central direction including the specification of minimum national standards, or if this was thought too dangerous ‘a separate locally based system for education in the widest sense’. The latter suggestion clearly in principle paralleled the US local school board system which, somewhat ironically in the context of this discussion, appears currently in some areas to be under pressure to cede power to wider local government structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1741143212451171">Wong, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The second keynote was given by Professor Maurice Kogan, Head of the Department of Government Studies and Law at Brunel University. He had moved into academia from the civil service, having been secretary to the Plowden Committee on primary education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741143212451171">DES, 1967</xref>), which is often regarded by both supporters and detractors of progressive education as its most iconic official document. He began by reminding participants that control by the<italic> institution </italic>– whether school, college or university – of its own work was a ‘leading assumption of British educational governance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1741143212451171">Kogan, 1975</xref>: 20). In other words, to use a modern metaphor, institutional autonomy was built into the system’s DNA. Nonetheless, he believed (1975:20) that at least three levels of analysis should be distinguished – that of the individual practitioner or role holder, the institution and the total governing system – ‘[a]nd they interfold with each other like one of those wooden Russian dolls.’ He then conducted an analysis in terms of a concept of ‘prime institution’ (1975: 21), posing the question: at what level is there sufficient authority to carry out the core activities without recourse to a higher level ‘except for the most general prescription’. He concluded that, despite a variety of limitations, which he specified, in primary and secondary education the prime institution was the school whereas in further and higher education it was the department.</p>
<p>Revisiting this terrain more than a quarter of a century later, in an article to which we will return, he came to a starkly different conclusion. Whereas in the 1970s and 1980s schools had been, by world comparisons, ‘the freest anywhere to make their curricula, within the broadest of policy steers, and the resources made available by the LEAs [local education authorities]’ at the turn of the millennium he identified instead a ‘compliance society’ in which ‘the initiatives mainly rest with a remotely accountable and technocratic centre’ and ‘relationships are those of dependency and compliance, rather than interaction, negotiation and mutual respect’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1741143212451171">Kogan, 2002</xref>: 333, 340).</p>
<p>Responding to Kogan’s conference address Anita Ellis, Deputy Head of Hartcliffe Comprehensive School in Bristol and a member of BEAS Council, contended that secondary heads and their staff had much more autonomy than their US or French counterparts. She suggested that there was an unwillingness to acknowledge this for fear of stimulating fresh accountability measures. In her view also the accountability of teachers and schools had for a long time essentially rested on the examination results they secured. Many would argue that this is even more strongly the case today.</p>
<p>In his summing-up Kogan advanced a conceptual distinction between accountability and ‘the general responsibility that any worker feels, or should feel, towards those affected by his work’. His definition of accountability was reported as ‘the duty to render account of work performed to a body that has authority to modify that performance, by the use of sanctions or reward’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741143212451171">Hughes and Richards, 1975</xref>: 36).</p>
<p>Meredydd Hughes, a former headteacher who was at the time Senior Lecturer in Education at University College Cardiff and went on to become Professor of Educational Administration at the University of Birmingham, Chairman of BEAS and President of the Commonwealth Council on Educational Administration (CCEA), then presented participants with a simulation exercise on ‘The Specifics of Autonomy and Accountability’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1741143212451171">Hughes, 1975b</xref>). They were asked to assume the identity of a recently appointed secondary school head dealing with a range of more or less testing items of correspondence in his ‘intray’ (‘inbox’ in the digital age!) and to indicate, in a discussion group setting, how and why they would respond to each item.</p>
<p>In their brief concluding comments, the editors remarked that no-one at the conference seriously advocated that there should be no accountability. The challenge was to find a format that promoted rather than inhibited educational aims and avoided the reductive and spuriously objective style of the ‘scientific management’ tradition: ‘the logical outcome of such approaches is a progressive diminution of areas of discretion, personal judgement and autonomy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741143212451171">Hughes and Richards, 1975</xref>: 50). The reader obtains no sense from these Proceedings that autonomy, whether professional or institutional, had in the past been perceived as unduly constrained but rather that, at the time of the conference, in a telling phrase from the conclusion, educational institutions were beginning to ‘come to terms with a measure of external prescription’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741143212451171">Hughes and Richards, 1975</xref>: 50).</p>

<sec id="section4-1741143212451171">
<title>The Reform Trajectory 1975–2011 in Brief</title>
<p>The momentum towards what became labelled as educational reform did not gather force until the late 1980s though there were earlier indications of what might be to come, for example Labour Prime Minister James Callaghan’s speech at Ruskin College Oxford in 1976 attacking current educational standards and calling for a ‘Great Debate’. Especially significant was a reinforcement of the political campaign begun by the ‘Black Paper’ series mentioned earlier. For example, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1741143212451171">No Turning Back (1985</xref>) group of 13 right-wing Conservative MPs called for a more radical approach embracing choice, diversity and competition in education and other areas, ideas that soon became mainstream in government. A particular focus of hostility was the local education authorities (LEAs), which had been the centre of much debate at the 1975 conference. They were part of wider elected authorities and had a range of functions including responsibility for strategic planning and resource allocation to schools. Margaret Thatcher’s government abolished the largest of these, the single-purpose Inner London Education Authority (ILEA), and handed its functions to much smaller, more local councils. An influential commentator published a pamphlet with the self-explanatory title ‘Away with LEAs: ILEA abolition as a pilot’, which held that LEAs continued to ‘control the life of individual schools through their extensive bureaucracy and support services’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1741143212451171">Lawlor, 1988</xref>: 5), a description that some school practitioners might have accepted but arguably more would have rejected.</p>
<p>The most significant piece of legislation in the entire period was the Education Reform Act (ERA) 1988 which followed Thatcher’s third election victory. It gave greatly increased powers to schools over resource allocation but introduced a prescriptive and detailed national curriculum and regular assessment of pupils. It linked the funding of schools quite closely to pupil numbers with provisions for open enrolment thus promoting a competitive market. Some schools could obtain significantly enhanced autonomy either as ‘grant maintained schools’ or sponsored City Technology Colleges. Reflecting many years later on the great change in relation to the curriculum, the former education secretary Shirley (now Baroness) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1741143212451171">Williams (2009</xref>) has commented that it represented ‘a lurch from one extreme to the other, from too much autonomy to virtually none. It is the heavy price England pays for a highly politicised system’.</p>
<p>The same year saw the publication of what has possibly been the closest thing to an international bestseller in educational administration: <italic>The Self-Managing School </italic>by two Australians, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741143212451171">Brian Caldwell and Jim Spinks (1988)</xref>. This book was extremely influential in many countries and in England appeared to support the emphasis on school autonomy in the ERA though the authors conceived it in terms of enhancing school effectiveness: the link in the Act to choice and competition was entirely absent from the book. Twenty years later, in an issue of this journal marking the Act’s anniversary, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741143212451171">Caldwell (2008</xref>: 250) argued that the claims of the proponents for what school autonomy would achieve had been ‘extravagant’. In his view research had not uncovered a clear evidential link between autonomy and educational outcomes.</p>
<p>The annual publication of schools’ examination and test results for secondary schools began in 1992 and a year later the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted) was established: this used a slimmed-down corps of HMIs to contract private inspection teams to carry out regular school inspections and supervise them. One significant critique of the array of reform measures introduced was that, particularly in weakening the power of local government in education, the process was actually one of nationalization which was making schools more uniform rather than of decentralization leading to greater diversity. Thus a prominent commentator Simon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1741143212451171">Jenkins (1995</xref>: 134) held that ‘the Thatcher and Major governments centralized power over the content and organisation of education in a way that seemed the antithesis of everything for which Conservatives traditionally stood’ and they had used draconian powers to do so. Education was but one of many areas that had experienced the centralizing trend.</p>
<p>The Labour government, which was elected in 1997 and held office until 2010, introduced some modifications to the approach of its predecessors, for example projects designed to give extra support to schools in disadvantaged urban areas and a new emphasis on cooperation to balance competition, but a consensus would be that the continuities were more pronounced than the discontinuities. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1741143212451171">Whitty (2008</xref>: 171) remarked in the issue of this journal marking 20 years since the ERA, Labour ‘… seems to have gone further down the market route, and much further down the privatization route, than the Conservatives ever achieved, as well as increasing central steerage of the system through such initiatives as the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategies’. A particular feature was the emphasis on diversity of school provision, originally through huge expansion of the programme of specialist schools which had been initiated by the Conservatives, whereby secondary schools obtained extra funding for specializing in one or two of a range of specified curriculum areas – most schools eventually had at least one specialism. A more significant development was the introduction of academies in 2000. These were sponsored schools operating as charities on the basis of a ‘funding agreement’ with the central education department and having no formal connection with the local authority. The vast bulk of the funding was provided by the government with generally a small contribution required from the sponsor. They were regarded as largely autonomous and described by government ministers as ‘independent state schools’. Most but not all academies were set up in deprived areas sometimes replacing schools in difficulty.</p>
<p>This model was seized upon and developed by the incoming Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition in 2010. Schools that had excellent inspection reports, often in prosperous areas, could also become academies – these did not require a sponsor. As under Labour’s programme, a sum calculated to be the amount that the local authority would have received for oversight and support of that school was transferred to the academy following its conversion, with obvious implications for the capacity of the local authority to fulfil its functions in respect of its remaining schools and the school-age children in its area. Whereas under Labour 203 schools became academies, after little over a year into the new government’s life (September 2011) the figure had risen to 1300, more than 40 per cent of all secondary schools, and hundreds more were said to be ‘in the pipeline’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741143212451171">DfE, 2011a</xref>). Another new category of school – so-called ‘free schools’ established by parents, teachers or other groups and funded by the government – were also brought into the academy framework. Twenty-four such schools had opened by late 2011 although many more applications are thought to have been received and to have gone through ‘a robust process’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741143212451171">DfE, 2011b</xref>). The new types of school, added to a variety of faith and specialist schools, created a bewildering array and a ‘liquorice allsorts’ system according to the reported comments of a well-known researcher and commentator Professor Alan Smithers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741143212451171">Garner, 2011a</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1741143212451171">
<title>Assessing Autonomy</title>
<p>A paradox of the current position is that despite the persistent and growing emphasis on autonomy most school practitioners consider themselves significantly constrained by government requirements to an extent that is undoubtedly far greater than their forbears in 1975 would have done.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1741143212451171">2</xref>
</sup> The last quarter century in particular has been a time of continuous policy change, a situation paralleled in other major areas, such as the National Health Service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1741143212451171">Hunter, 2006</xref>). Yet performance by international benchmarks has been variable particularly in relation to equity. According to the OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) ‘in the United Kingdom, both the within and between school impact of socio-economic background are well above the OECD average. Indeed, the United Kingdom stands in second place after Luxembourg in terms of the between-school performance variance explained by the socio-economic intake of schools’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1741143212451171">OECD, 2010a</xref>: para. 23).</p>
<p>The degree of autonomy being established for a substantial number of schools (‘academies’) in England appears to be far greater than has been sought in any other country of significant size. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741143212451171">Caldwell (2008</xref>) noted in the references above there is no convincing evidence that increasing school autonomy has the large impact on outcomes that its advocates have claimed. In England a major 5-year study of the early academies commissioned by the previous Labour government concluded that ‘There is insufficient evidence to make a judgement about the Academies as a model for school improvement’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1741143212451171">PriceWaterhouseCoopers [PwC], 2008</xref>: para. 10.5) and more recent official reports have raised serious doubts about the sustainability of the current government’s plans in this regard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1741143212451171">NAO, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1741143212451171">PAC, 2011</xref>). An OECD study of leadership development indicated that at least two conditions were required for autonomy to have beneficial effects: the core responsibilities of leaders must be focused on educational matters to avoid the role overload that autonomy tends to generate, and there needs to be adequate support including relevant forms of training and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1741143212451171">Punt et al., 2008</xref>). The latest PISA findings suggested that the degree of curricular autonomy a school system offers its schools is positively related to the system’s performance but the relationship is less clear in regard to autonomy over staffing and budgetary decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1741143212451171">OECD, 2010b</xref>). It is difficult to apply such findings to particular national contexts because of sharply different traditions: for example one European study has commented that, on the continent, apart from Belgium and The Netherlands, ‘school autonomy is not a European tradition. Historically, schools have not had much freedom of movement in defining the curriculum and setting teaching objectives or in the management of finance and human resources’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741143212451171">Eurydice, 2007</xref>: 7). As indicated previously this is in sharp contrast to the English tradition, particularly with regard to curriculum and teaching decisions.</p>
<p>These considerations indicate that autonomy is a subtle and relative concept, varying in nature and degree by context, activity (such as curriculum, assessment, resource management) and level. For example an earlier international study of 11 countries found that when school systems were decentralized institutional leaders tended to enjoy more autonomy but the impact on teaching and support staff was questionable as concerns about their job security increased and there was no clear evidence about gains in autonomy for learners. ‘As with so much change, benefits for one group can create problems for others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741143212451171">Bullock and Thomas, 1997</xref>: 116).</p>
<p>Judgements about autonomy in England are complicated by at least two other factors. First, the English system tends to foster enhanced autonomy (over areas such as admissions and the curriculum) and special funding for particular categories of publicly funded school. The rationale for such differential autonomy is generally hard to discern and conferring this kind of privileged status may reinforce the ‘tiering’ which is already a sharp feature of the system and could accentuate stratification based on social factors and academic ability, particularly in the context of a competitive market. Assessments of the impact of autonomy need therefore to be made on a system-wide rather than individual school basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741143212451171">Glatter, 2009</xref>). Second, there has recently been a significant development of school ‘chains’, particularly in the context of academies, with more than one and sometimes several schools being governed by a single (so far only not-for-profit) organization, controlled for instance by a wealthy business person or religious body. The analogy is with chains of retail outlets where all key decisions are generally taken at head office (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741143212451171">Hill, 2010</xref>). The largest of these at the time of writing is United Learning Trust, which is linked to the Church of England and has 20 schools in the chain but another body, E-ACT, reportedly has plans for a ‘super-chain’ of up to 250 schools within five years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1741143212451171">Marley, 2011</xref>). While this type of development may provide significant benefits of a kind that local authorities have hitherto offered such as common services, it also raises major issues relating to the governance of publicly funded schools, not least concerning autonomy. It has been argued that ‘Schools in chains are not independent, they just have different masters’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741143212451171">Glatter, 2010</xref>: 20).</p>
<p>Despite this and the ever-growing power of central government the dominant rhetoric has been about autonomy, independence and liberation from bureaucracy (meaning of local authorities). This focus (and the resultant translation into policy) has persisted and grown stronger over the years. Three of the factors that appear to account for this are:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>the commitment over the past quarter century to free market ideology;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the peculiar constitutional arrangements under which England is governed; and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the symbolic power of the elite independent school sector.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Regarding the first, the resistance to the integration of school provision has deep historical roots. In the 19th century state education developed in England much later than on the continent. ‘The dominant tradition that remained was a voluntary system characterised by great diversity of schools and a lack of integration between them’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1741143212451171">Wiborg, 2009</xref>: 40; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741143212451171">Ball, 2008</xref>). The Labour governments of the 1960s and 1970s attempted comprehensive reform but in a way that was ‘half-hearted and partial’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1741143212451171">Wiborg, 2009</xref>: 230) and the Thatcher government and all its successors have sought to re-establish key features of the earlier arrangements. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1741143212451171">Tomlinson (2001</xref>: 27) has noted: ‘… the vision underpinning the British Conservative government reforms was that of a nineteenth century liberal individualism, in which ostensibly free consumers embraced the laws of the market and the values of self interest and personal and familial profit’. The results have been a complex patchwork of schools and school types with strong local hierarchies that has been very difficult for families, particularly those with limited educational background, to navigate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1741143212451171">West et al., 2009</xref>) and much greater public debate about the problems of parental choice and school admissions than is common in developed countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741143212451171">Green and Janmaat, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Some of these features are increasingly found elsewhere as a result of the spread of policies based on school choice and competition. However a major review by the OECD of more than 200 research studies on markets in school education concluded that the effects of introducing market mechanisms as reported in empirical research were ‘modest to say the least’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1741143212451171">Waslander et al., 2010</xref>: para. 56), that they did not tend to generate innovation, they could increase social segregation and that the evidence showed no link to improved teaching and learning. There was no indication that private providers did better than traditional ones. According to the study an important reason for markets not working in school education in a way that its advocates expect is that both demand and supply are rather inelastic: the market’s corrective mechanisms are not as responsive as they are elsewhere. By contrast some economists such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741143212451171">Allen and Burgess (2010</xref>) believe competition can be made to work effectively in school education in England by improving the incentives and the monitoring and regulatory mechanisms to promote fair but strong competition, including allowing private, for-profit schools into the system and sharpening up the procedure for closing ‘failing’ schools.</p>
<p>On the second factor, the constitutional framework provides unusually limited checks and balances. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1741143212451171">Pollitt (2007</xref>) has commented, in England there has been serial, breathless restructuring, especially in education and health: comparative studies show the UK to have been the most activist, hard-driving of comparable countries with regard to public management reform. In his view a major contributory factor to Westminster’s capacity for rapid organizational change, even in the face of political opposition, is the relative absence of constitutional constraints such as federal structures, the effective separation of powers between the executive and the legislature or proportional voting systems which exist elsewhere. (It should be noted too that, unlike the position in other EU states, local government enjoys no constitutional protection: see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741143212451171">Cox [2010]</xref>	.) As a result ‘the British system maximizes the temptation to reorganize but minimizes political penalties for so doing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1741143212451171">Pollitt, 2007</xref>: 534). As Pollitt indicates there are so many interlocking changes that evaluation is hardly possible but overall there is a striking lack of convincing evidence of the effectiveness of the approach either in England or elsewhere. As well as the substantial transition costs which are rarely made explicit there are huge unknown costs relating to disruption, distraction, the loss of organizational memory and so on – what Pollitt calls the ‘dark side’ of reform which for obvious reasons is hard to research and illuminate.</p>
<p>From an international perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1741143212451171">Levin and Fullan (2008</xref>) have strongly criticized the approach exemplified in the ERA and subsequent reforms. They argue that an emphasis on choice and competition as the drivers of improvement has not been shown to work in England or elsewhere and that the most successful countries tend to have less differentiated systems. In their view changing structures such as governance and accountability does not yield better results for students. They (2008: 291) advocate a ‘whole system’ approach in which ‘The heart of improvement lies in changing teaching and learning practices in thousands and thousands of classrooms, and this requires focused and sustained effort by all parts of the education system and its partners.’ A key element of this is an emphasis on capacity building to promote shared knowledge and understanding. A similar critique has been offered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1741143212451171">Wiliam (2010</xref>). He argues that, since individual teacher quality has a much greater impact on student achievement than have differences between schools our focus should be on leadership and teacher development rather than structural change. A successful example of the type of systemic approach advocated by these writers was the programme of intensive support to schools known as London Challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1741143212451171">Ofsted, 2010</xref>) which was shown to promote significant school improvement and was later extended to other urban areas.</p>
<p>I have suggested that two of the forces driving the focus on school autonomy in England have been free market (often referred to as ‘neoliberal’) thinking and aspects of the constitutional framework. Another very significant force, though rarely acknowledged, is the highly distinctive private school sector. Although private schools<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1741143212451171">3</xref>
</sup> educate only about 7 per cent of the pupil population and most of them are established as not-for-profit charities, their fees are much higher than the per-pupil spend on publicly funded schools, which are free. They employ around twice as many teachers as would be expected from their proportion of pupils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1741143212451171">Smithers and Tracey, 2003</xref>) and their average class size in 2009 at secondary level (10.5) was exactly half that in state schools (21.0) which itself was <italic>below</italic> the OECD average of 23.5. Furthermore the private school average of 10.5 was less than half the OECD average for independent private institutions which was 21.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1741143212451171">OECD, 2011</xref>: table D2.1). This illustrates how the private school sector in England is much more distinct from publicly provided schooling than it is in most countries (see, for example, Australia: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1741143212451171">Ryan and Sibieta, 2010</xref>). Yet its reach is extensive: ‘Although only 7% of the population attend independent schools, well over half of many professionals have done so. For example, 75% of judges, 70% of finance directors, 45% of top civil servants, and 32% of MPs [Members of Parliament] were independently schooled’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1741143212451171">Panel on Fair Access to the Professions, 2009</xref>: 12). Students from independent schools are far more likely to go to a top university than comprehensive school students and the gap is extremely marked in relation to Oxford and Cambridge entry from the most prestigious private schools such as Eton, Westminster and St Paul’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1741143212451171">Sutton Trust, 2011</xref>). However pupils from comprehensive schools on average do better than those from independents once at university (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741143212451171">Kirkup and Morrison, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>A research report prepared for the body representing the most prestigious private schools concluded that the key freedom of fully independent schools ‘is being able to anticipate and respond to parent and pupil needs through the market rather than having to take direction from central government’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1741143212451171">Smithers and Robinson, 2008</xref>: para. 8.10). This is the central claim underlying the ever-increasing emphasis on school autonomy in the state sector in England, and it derives from the country’s unique experience regarding independent education. In fact academies, the most developed form of autonomous publicly funded school, are in law not state schools but independent schools and the statutory provisions applying to state (‘maintained’) schools mostly do not apply to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1741143212451171">Wolfe, 2011</xref>). They operate through a type of contract with central government known as a funding agreement. The political attraction of the ‘school autonomy’ emphasis may derive from a perception of the popular appeal of the private schools in the light of the benefits they bestow on their pupils. There is some evidence to support this, for example in one poll almost one-half (49 per cent) of the respondents said they would choose to send their child to private school if it were financially viable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741143212451171">Eaton, 2011</xref>). Conversely, there is clear evidence of overall parental satisfaction with the state schools their children attend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1741143212451171">Roberts, 2010</xref>) and a recent British Social Attitudes survey report records a substantial increase in public satisfaction with state secondary schooling between 1997 and 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1741143212451171">National Centre for Social Research, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The thesis that the key to the achievements of private school pupils is the schools’ independence rather than their advantages in terms of resources or access and that therefore enabling publicly funded schools to mimic their structural arrangements will transform the outcomes of the latter is unproven to say the least. The head of one of the leading private schools, Wellington College, has suggested that three factors account for the superior academic performance of independent schools in England: a far higher ratio of subject specialists; much smaller class sizes; and higher parental expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1741143212451171">Seldon, 2009</xref>). None of these factors is to do with the form of governance, specifically the schools’ independence, or with a transferable ethos. There are also fundamental questions about the ownership of publicly provided assets. To whom do – and should – schools funded by the public purse belong? Private schools are responsible to their owners or trustees whereas publicly provided schools have a much wider set of responsibilities including the taxpayers and indeed the whole citizenry, as well as to their local community in the broadest sense. Finally how feasible is the chosen direction of travel? As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741143212451171">Allen and Burgess (2011</xref>: 7) have observed: ‘Currently the person immediately responsible for failing academies is the Secretary of State, a level of almost Napoleonic centralisation.’</p>

<title>Accountability in Question</title>
<p>Autonomy is exercised within a high stakes accountability framework driven by the centre including, most prominently, national inspections by Ofsted (giving the school just a few days’ notice) the reports of which are available online, along with published test and examination results. In principle other levels including local authorities and school governing bodies with staff, parent and community representatives have a part to play in holding schools to account and the ‘market’ is supposed to exercise a key influence but its limitations in regard to school education have already been mentioned. How far there is true market accountability in specific cases depends on a range of contextual factors including the geographic and socioeconomic character of the area in question and the nature and strength of the local hierarchy of schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1741143212451171">Waslander et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The dominant focus of accountability in England today is central government through its range of instruments of control. A decade ago Kogan, who as mentioned earlier had been a keynote speaker at the 1975 conference, referred to ‘an enormous superstructure of monitoring and inspection’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1741143212451171">Kogan, 2002</xref>: 338). A key element in the range of instruments was performance indicators, such as published examination results, which the media convert into school ‘league tables’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1741143212451171">Kogan (2002</xref>: 338) contrasted this type of information with the ‘hot knowledge’ that practitioners generate every day: ‘Hot knowledge grows cold when far away from its point of origin. The knowledge which takes pride of place in official thinking is very cold indeed … Performance indicators are prime examples of decontextualised and cold knowledge … They have the advantage of producing easily comparable data whereas everything we know suggests that the components of school performance include subtle and complex processes and contextual factors’. In the same year the philosopher Onora O’Neill gave the prestigious Reith Lectures which are broadcast nationally and criticized the entire approach to public service accountability. Performance indicators are ‘chosen for ease of measurement and control rather than because they measure performance accurately’ and ‘the new culture of accountability provides incentives for arbitrary and unprofessional choices’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1741143212451171">O’Neill, 2002</xref>: 54, 56). A culture of intelligent, less distorting forms of accountability was needed which focused on good governance and enabled professionals and public servants ‘to serve the public rather than their paymasters’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1741143212451171">O’Neill, 2002</xref>: 59). Her theme was taken up in a significant policy paper by one of the main professional bodies of school leaders, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1741143212451171">Secondary Heads Association (2003</xref>),<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1741143212451171">4</xref>
</sup> but their numerous proposals aimed at securing a slimmer but robust ‘intelligent’ accountability regime met with little response from government.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that systems with better educational outcomes (such as Finland, see, for example, Garner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741143212451171">2011b</xref>]) often have considerably less demanding forms of accountability. In general, as a McKinsey report on improving school systems has indicated, heavily prescriptive approaches are not associated with high levels of performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1741143212451171">Mourshed et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In the period since those assessments were made there have been changes in the control instruments but the strength of central direction appears largely undiminished despite the continued and even increased emphasis on institutional autonomy. Indeed, since the coalition government came to power in 2010, there has been more pronounced targeting, notably through revised examination incentives, on traditional academic programmes, potentially to the further disadvantage of ‘the forgotten half’ of school students – those who do not go to university (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741143212451171">Birdwell et al., 2011</xref>), a group whose interests have been insufficiently addressed in English education despite the recognition long ago that they represented ‘half our future’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1741143212451171">Ministry of Education, 1963</xref>).</p>
<p>Regarding school ‘league tables’, the editors of a recent series of research papers have pointed out that they are used for two distinct purposes, accountability and school choice. They believe that work is needed to assess how far schools and teachers respond to the accountability pressures by ‘gaming’ the system. ‘For example, are students taking inappropriate curriculum options to maximise their test scores for their schools’ benefit rather than their own?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741143212451171">Dearden and Vignoles, 2011</xref>: 186). They also think broader outcome measures could be employed in order to minimize gaming and encourage schools to give more attention to non-cognitive skills. The previous government intended to introduce a ‘Report Card’ approach to give a more rounded assessment of school performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741143212451171">DCSF, 2009</xref>) but this was dropped by its successor.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741143212451171">Dyson et al. (2010</xref>: para. 2.3.5) have argued that accountability mechanisms should become ‘more explicitly multidimensional, allowing for dialogue between all levels of the system and the interests of widely varying stakeholders’. This, they say, would require processes of bottom-up and horizontal as well as top-down accountability. One notable development in this direction is the rapid increase in the number of Co-operative school trusts promoted by the Co-operative movement, an attempt to spread ownership to parents, pupils, staff and the wider community including local business (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1741143212451171">Mansell, 2011</xref>). The growth rate has been impressive, from no schools at all to more than 150 in less than 4 years. This may well be a more appealing option to many schools than becoming an academy, particularly as part of a chain with a remote head office and senior management.</p>

<sec id="section7-1741143212451171">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Although there are striking similarities between some of the language used in the 1975 conference and at the present time, the current framework is almost unrecognizable from that of the earlier period. Schools have acquired far more responsibilities and the centre has been transformed from a trusting referee and resource provider to a demanding and impatient managing director with frequently changing identity and priorities. In some respects this reflects the paradox of ‘decentralized centralism’ that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1741143212451171">Karlsen (2000</xref>) suggests has become a feature of many countries. However in England, a moderately large country of over 50 million people, there is a distinctive element – the gradual defenestration of the intermediate tier of government with an apparent goal of having just two significant layers of governance: the individual school operating in a competitive local market and a distant central government and its agencies as the sole political authority.</p>
<p>If this framework turns out to be viable and effective it could prove a very attractive model for other countries to emulate. It may however emerge as too unstable and be seen to marginalize the community and local dimension excessively so that a more robust arrangement appears called for. On the supply side there are already indications that many schools find the ‘stand-alone’ model uncomfortable and are clustering together in various formations, perhaps partly for protection. I have mentioned here academy chains and Co-operative trusts but there are also other cluster arrangements such as federations and collegiates. This is leading to a highly complex and variable patchwork of provision. From the point of view of pupils and their families the likely collapse of any remaining local strategic coordination of provision and community-wide governance could have serious consequences. A major review of 14–19 education and training concluded that fashioning a ‘strongly collaborative local learning system’ was essential to building coherent provision for this age group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1741143212451171">Nuffield Review, 2009</xref>), but current policy is moving further away from this position. There are also of course major questions of democratic legitimacy in vesting all significant political power at central level. Somewhat ironically Lord Baker, who as Kenneth Baker was the Secretary of State responsible for the ERA that laid the foundations of the current framework more than 20 years ago, reportedly told the House of Lords in 2011 that the government would come to realize there was a need for intermediate bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741143212451171">Coryton, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The case of England raises wider issues, illustrating how policy developments and school system changes reflect unique histories and cultures as much as international trends. For example in England the long-standing resistance to the creation of connectedness within the education system, a tendency by policymakers (though not practitioners) to value independence more than interdependence in the governance of schools, has powerfully shaped the policy discourse and the character of provision. The case also acts as a warning about the application of concepts to different contexts. For example ‘autonomy’ has a significantly different connotation in a system in which schools have traditionally had little discretion than in one where they have been used to considerable freedoms. There is a need for comparative research on understandings of autonomy and accountability in different national contexts and their determinants. For example, how far are these understandings reflective of wider characteristics of each society, such as the distinctive ‘regimes of social cohesion’ identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741143212451171">Green and Janmaat (2011</xref>) on the basis of their statistical analysis of key variables? They contrast ‘liberal’ or more individualistic traditions in the UK and the USA with more solidaristic ‘social market’ and ‘social democratic’ orientations in parts of continental Europe. The comment by Hughes and Richards in 1975 quoted in the opening paragraph of this article about the need to understand these concepts ‘having regard to specific organisational settings’ was arguably highly apposite.</p>
<p>Finally this discussion has relevance for research on leadership, which has often been too generic so that ‘Generalisations are frequently made about the features associated with effective school leadership without taking into account the specific and diverse frameworks of policy and governance within which it is exercised’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741143212451171">Glatter 2002</xref>: 236; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741143212451171">Glatter, 1980</xref>). There are welcome signs that this is starting to change, within BELMAS and elsewhere, and we may be seeing, at least, the development advocated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1741143212451171">Leithwood (2001</xref>: 230) ‘of a distinct sub-field of leadership research closely aligned with the content and methods of policy analysis’.</p>
