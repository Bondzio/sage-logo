<abstract>
<p>The author of <italic>4 Ezra</italic> makes significant and repeated use of several motifs related to birth, including barrenness, pregnancy, the womb, miscarriage, birth itself, fetuses, and lactation. These motifs have myriad pedagogical functions in the text, including imparting instruction about personal, national and cosmic matters. Most importantly, the birth of the city from Mother Zion that Ezra witnesses and the anticipated rebirth of the dead from Mother Earth experientially resolve Ezra's earlier theological concerns, which could previously not be solved rationally. Finally, based on ritual studies (Turner and Van Gennep), the article suggests that elements in the structure of episodes four to seven reveal that the author of 4 Ezra likely had familiarity with a potent rite of passage or transformation that he/she in turn expressed through imagery of birthing and death.</p>

<body>
<p>The author of <italic>4 Ezra</italic> makes significant and repeated use of a constellation of natal images, including motifs of barrenness, pregnancy, the womb, miscarriage, birth, fetuses, and lactation. These birthing images function in several ways throughout the text. First, the motif of the maternal body, in various stages of pregnancy and birth, serves as a pedagogical tool for imparting a sweeping array of revelations, including the nature of the present temporal age, the character and arrival of the eschatological age, the present and future state of Israel, and the fate of humans after death. Second, Uriel presents the experiences of the pregnant, maternal body as a source of wisdom that can teach Israel patience. Throughout his anguish-ridden time, Ezra is instructed to ‘Go, ask a woman's womb’, to receive answers to his questions. Third, the character Ezra's own meditations on birth play a major role in articulating his existential state and his view on the state of humankind in general. Out of despair for himself and other humans, Ezra wishes for unsuccessful birth (barrenness and miscarriage), while in hopeful moments he gives thanks for God's aid in successful birthing, all the way from conception to lactation. Fourth, in Episode Four (<italic>4 Ezra</italic> 9.26–10.59),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0951820712439829">1</xref></sup> personal, national, and cosmic concerns intertwine through the layering of images of mourning mothers who have lost those whom they bore: a woman who lost her first-born son, Mother Zion who lost her children the Jews, and Mother Earth who lost her progeny, humankind. As the figures of the mothers connate, their agonies are addressed through a potent, often misconstrued, scene in which a City is birthed from the womb of the earth. Finally, drawing on ritual studies, I also argue that Ezra's own transformation is expressed in terms of the somatic images of death and birth and mystical rites of passage. Hence, the author of <italic>4 Ezra</italic> repeatedly uses birthing tropes to express both plight and solution, significantly structuring the content as well as the receipt of revelation and wisdom in terms of the maternal body and birth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0951820712439829">2</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section1-0951820712439829">
<title>1. Birth Imagery as Pedagogical Tool for Imparting Revelation</title>
<p>Images of pregnancy and birthing abound in <italic>4 Ezra</italic> to a greater extent than one may first realize. Uriel uses the theme of birth to convey the text's deepest revelations to Ezra (and the audience). Early on, the angel articulates the quality of pre- and post-eschatological temporal reality in terms of perverted and idealized birth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0951820712439829">3</xref></sup> Unnatural birth is a sign of the evil age: ‘Menstrous women will bring forth monsters’ (5.9).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0951820712439829">4</xref></sup> Especially for audience members sharing the priestly concerns that are clearly evident in <italic>4 Ezra</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0951820712439829">5</xref></sup> this image would signify that the present age is a time of impurity and a transgression of the regular state of nature. By contrast, preternaturally auspicious birth is a sign of the new age to come. Women with child will give birth to children at just three to four months term; while this normally would result in miscarriage, these extraordinary babies ‘live and dance’ as fully born children (6.22). Such easy, short pregnancies seem to reverse the curse placed on Eve in Gen. 3.16. Thus, it is an unusual, auspicious manner of birth that marks a new eschatological age, which returns humankind in some way to their paradisiacal state.</p>
<p>The angel Uriel also employs imagery of a pregnant body and birth to explain to Ezra the nature of the arrival of the eschaton and the experience and fate of Israel in this present age and the next. Uriel likens the end of the present age and the beginning of the eschatological age to Jacob/Israel holding the heel of Esau as he attempts to be born. The image conveys that it is Jacob who will be birthed first, as the age of Israel supplants that of the Gentiles (6.9–10). The womb is therefore equated with the present age, and birth with the eschaton. This makes sense of Uriel's proclamation to Ezra, ‘between the heel and the hand seek for nothing else!’ Theologically, this statement indicates that this present era is a struggle between nations at the very threshold of the birth of the new age: no other nation will follow Rome before Israel triumphs. What I wish to point out is the way in which the text articulates the experience of the present age as the painful and inevitably short-lived war between two babies in the womb, just as they are both about to be birthed. To be blunt, Israel is fighting to get out.</p>
<p>The womb also serves to instruct humans about their own births and deaths through revelation about ‘the womb of the earth’ (5.48).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0951820712439829">6</xref></sup> According to Uriel, the earth itself is a mother who has ‘birthed Adam’ (7.116; cf. 3.5). In part, this explains the phrase ‘the womb of the earth’ (5.48), but there is more to this image. Since <italic>adam</italic> is the only human who came directly from <italic>adamah</italic>, the womb of the earth is not gestating first-time humans any more, yet it is still the mother of all humans.</p>
<p>Mother Earth, according to Uriel, holds the righteous dead inside her womb like fetuses: ‘Even so have I given the womb of the earth to those who from time to time are sown in it’ (5.48). Their first birth was from a human mother, but this time they will be borne from the earth, as Uriel or Jeremiel, explains: ‘In Hades <italic>the chambers of the souls are like the womb</italic>. For just as a woman who is in travail makes haste to escape the pangs of birth, so also do these places hasten to give back those things that were committed to them…’ (5.42). Thus, the dead must wait in the womb of the earth, Hades, until the time is right for them to be born for a second time, as Mother Earth is eager to make possible.</p>
<p>The passage about the ‘Man from the Sea’ further clarifies the exact nature of the future birthing from the earth. After the messianic reign, all humans will die and the earth will revert to primeval silence (7.30–31). After a period of seven days, ‘that which is corruptible shall perish. And the earth shall give up those who are asleep in it; and the chambers shall <italic>give up</italic> (<italic>reddet</italic>) the souls which have been committed to them’ (7.32). Since the ‘chambers of the souls’ are said to be in Hades in 5.42, then Hades is a tomb as well as the womb that births all souls as incorruptible in the second creation (7.32). This new incorruptibility implies a physical change as profound as the knitting together of a baby within the maternal body. The earth/Hades shall ‘give up’ (Lat. <italic>reddet</italic>, Syr. <italic>ttl</italic> for <italic>yhv</italic>, 7.32) these souls in the same manner, and with the same verb, in which ‘the womb <italic>gives up again</italic> (Lat. <italic>iterum reddit;</italic> Syr. <italic>yhv twv</italic>) what has been created in it…’ (8.9). It is the rebirth of humankind.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0951820712439829">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The image of a womb giving birth therefore significantly structures several revelations in <italic>4 Ezra</italic>. The womb signifies temporal transformation of the present age and the inevitability of the eschaton. Abnormal monstrous birth is a sign of the present evil age; and successful, blissful birth characterizes the age to come. The state of struggle within the womb marks the experience of the present struggle between Israel and the Gentile nations, which will inevitably and swiftly give way to Israel's emergence as the dominant one in the new age. The womb of the earth gave rise to Adam and presently and soon it will hold the souls of all the dead (7.32). Just as a fetus must gestate before it is actually a living baby, there is a physical transformation that will occur as the souls of the dead are reborn from the earth in an incorruptible, revivified state (7.32).</p>

<sec id="section2-0951820712439829">
<title>2. The Maternal Body as Source of Wisdom</title>
<p>Throughout <italic>4 Ezra</italic>, Uriel also presents the pregnant, maternal body as a source of wisdom that teaches patience and fortitude. When Ezra repeatedly laments over temporal matters, asking how long we must wait for the endtime and wondering why we could not all be born at once, the angel Uriel answers no fewer than three times with the advice, ‘Go, ask a woman's womb’ (5.46) and ‘Ask a woman with child’ (4.40; 5.51). After nine months, can the womb keep the child? (4.40). ‘No!’ a pregnant woman would say, and similarly Ezra should know that, like pregnancy, the present age is a temporary condition. Suddenly, the eschaton will happen; it cannot be held back. Can a woman bear all her children at once? ‘No!’ any mother would say, and Ezra must similarly grasp that this is why we were not created all at once, and why, by implication, we must be patient over the course of the times for a certain number of persons to be born (5.51). Thus, it is not just the metaphor of the womb, but also general human familiarity with the experiences of pregnancy and birth that teach Ezra and the audience about the nature of the present age and imminence of the eschaton, providing a kind of maternal wisdom and patience.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0951820712439829">
<title>3. The Character Ezra's Experience of Birth</title>
<p>The womb and birth also seem to be personally meaningful images for the character Ezra. Several times during Episodes One through Three (3.1–9.25), Ezra experiences great depression, despair, and ignorance, and he expresses this through wishes for barrenness or miscarriage. Like Jeremiah, he cries out, ‘Why wasn't my mother's womb (<italic>mrb 'h</italic>) my grave?’ (5.35). Later, he projects his personal angst onto all of humankind, wishing the same fate had occurred for Adam: ‘It would have been better if the earth had not produced (<italic>ttlywhy</italic> [from <italic>hwy</italic>, ‘to birth’]) Adam…’ (7.116; cf. 7.62).</p>
<p>However, as Ezra slowly gains answers to his questions about Israel and the fate of the world through the questions and answers of the first three episodes, he also becomes more optimistic about his own birth. While in his early ignorance and confusion he wished for his mother's barrenness or miscarriage, in his growing knowledge he prays a prayer of gratitude, framing his new-found hope in terms of <italic>womb and birth</italic> imagery. Speaking to his soul, he notes ‘you did not come into the world of your own will’ (8.5). He extends his new optimism to assert that God is with humans in the womb:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>You give life to the body which is now fashioned <italic>in the womb (bmrb</italic>'‘)…</p>
<p>For nine months the womb that you have fashioned bears your creation…</p>
<p>You keep/sustain the womb and the life in it. (8.8–9)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Ezra then goes on to praise God for being with humans after birth: ‘… When the womb gives up (<italic>reddet; yhv twv</italic>) what was been created, you sustain it then by commanding the breast to give milk’ (8.9–10).</p>
<p>What Ezra has come to understand is viscerally drawn in terms of the female body. God's power, whether for good or for ill, is manifest through activity within the womb, and control over birth and then lactation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0951820712439829">8</xref></sup> When Ezra is comforted, he no longer wishes his mother had miscarried, but feels grateful that God was with him in the womb; similarly, he no longer wishes the earth had miscarried Adam, but asserts God's care for all of humankind in their birth. The parallels between Ezra's birth experiences with Adam/humankind's birth experiences are typical of the way in which the author layers personal and universal experiences in an analogical manner. These levels of experience, along with a national concern for Israel, merge fully in Episode Four.</p>

<sec id="section4-0951820712439829">
<title>4. The Birth of the City in Episode Four</title>
<p>Although scholars differ on the structure of <italic>4 Ezra</italic> and its unity, all seem to agree that Episode Four (9.26–10.59) constitutes a turning point in the text.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0951820712439829">9</xref></sup> Along with Stone,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0951820712439829">10</xref></sup> I have argued that what moves Ezra is not the sort of intellectual argumentation in which he has participated in the first three episodes, but the <italic>experience</italic> of the City that he tours, which conveys a wisdom beyond ordinary sense perception: ‘as far as possible for your eyes to see it…as much as your ears can hear’ (10.56–57).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0951820712439829">11</xref></sup> As Stone says, ‘…entry into the City means experience of the Godhead… Ezra has achieved a new level of revelation, the experience of the divine presence.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0951820712439829">12</xref></sup> Here I want to stress that this marvelous City comes from, <italic>and indeed is borne from</italic>, Mother Earth fairly literally (10.7, 25).</p>
<p>To understand this dense image, it is necessary to recognize how the text layers personal, national, and universal/cosmological experience. Uriel explicitly identifies the mourning woman who grieves over her lost son as Mother Zion (10.7–8). The earth is also a mourning mother, since Ezra admonishes the woman, saying: ‘Now, ask the earth, and she will tell you that it is she who ought to mourn over so many who have come into being upon her’ (10.9). Ezra further tells the woman: ‘But if you say to me, “My lamentation is not like the earth's, for I have lost the fruit of my womb”, then I say to you, “As you brought forth in sorrow, so the earth also has from the beginning given her fruit, that is, man”’ (10.14). Hence, there are three mourning mothers in the story: the woman who lost her son, Mother Zion, and Mother Earth. Ezra's assurance to the woman that ‘you will receive your son back in due time’ (10.16) therefore suggests multiple layers of meaning that unfold in subsequent revelation: the woman's son will be resurrected, Mother Zion will receive back her children, and the earth will bear resurrected humans in the eschaton (5.42; 7.32). Grasping the analogic layering of mothers in this episode also sheds light on the transformation of the woman into Mother Zion, which is clarified through a new reading of the Syriac text.</p>
<p>In the pertinent passage, the face of the woman/Mother Zion changes and flashes like lightning, whereupon:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>…she cried (<italic>q ‘t</italic>) in a high voice (<italic>bql' rm'</italic>) and (<italic>wdhyl</italic>') [<italic>meaning to be determined</italic>]. Like (<italic>'yk</italic>) an earthquaking (<italic>dtzw'</italic>), all of the earth (<italic>klh ‘r’'</italic>) from (<italic>mn</italic>) her voice (<italic>qlh</italic>)… (10.26)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0951820712439829">13</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Metzger translates <italic>wdḥyl'</italic> as an adjective of ‘voice’, parallel to ‘high’, which would mean it was from <italic>dḥyl</italic>, ‘fearfully, terribly’, with an emphatic final aleph. Thus, Metzger has ‘she uttered a loud and fearful cry’. But since dalad is also an inseparable particle, the Syriac equivalent of <italic>'šr</italic>, then <italic>wdḥyl'</italic> could also be read as ‘so there was, so that there was (<italic>wd</italic>)' plus the noun <italic>ḥyl'</italic>. If <italic>ḥyl’</italic> is meant to be a noun, there are two possibilities. There is <italic>ḥyl</italic> as ‘force, power, might, strength’ to which must be added the emphatic final aleph, giving ‘She screamed in a high voice, and <italic>there was a powerful force</italic>, and all of the earth was quaking’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0951820712439829">14</xref></sup> The range of meaning may have been greater, however, since the Hebrew cognate <italic>ḥîl</italic> means ‘writhing, anguish’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0951820712439829">15</xref></sup> from the verb <italic>ḥûl</italic>, ‘twist, writhe, in pain, esp. childbirth (Is 23.4)’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0951820712439829">16</xref></sup> This reading gives ‘She screamed in a high voice, and there was immense writhing/pain [as in childbirth], and all of the earth was quaking’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0951820712439829">17</xref></sup> This reading suggests that just as the chambers of Hades, the womb of the earth, will give birth to souls in the age to come, so is the City dramatically, forcibly, painfully, and fairly literally, born from Mother Zion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0951820712439829">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>While in the past I myself have used language of the ‘heavenly Temple/Zion descending’ into this field, I now think this image is inappropriate and projected into the text.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0951820712439829">19</xref></sup> Rather, it seems this Mother Zion/Mother Earth bears ‘her son’, this eschatological City, just as the earth's womb/Hades’ womb will bear all incorruptible souls of humanity in the age to come. Still, the City is certainly divine and not simply the earthly Jerusalem that will be built by human hands (10.54),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0951820712439829">20</xref></sup> but the manner in which the text layers the mourning woman, Mother Zion, and Mother Earth warns against distinguishing it too sharply from other realia. This City has a different locus than the heavenly Jerusalem of Revelation and other texts, and instead is much more consonant with the earth-bound location of the chambers of the dead and of earthly, Edenic Jerusalem found in ‘The Book of the Watchers’ (<italic>1 En</italic>. 25.1–7; 32.6). Ezra can now fully understand and believe Uriel's revelation that the womb of the earth/Hades will <italic>again give back (iterum reddet</italic>), or in the Syriac, <italic>give up (ttl</italic> from <italic>yhv</italic>, ‘to give, bear, yield’)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0951820712439829">21</xref></sup> humans in the eschaton (7.32), for he has seen how it will occur.</p>
<p>Subsequent to Ezra's tour of the City, Ezra exudes relative confidence for the rest of the narrative. As Stone has shown, Ezra's demeanor changes dramatically after Episode Four, so that at the end of his symbolic dream episodes he ‘arose and walked in the field, giving great glory and praise to the Most High’ (13.57).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0951820712439829">22</xref></sup> Stone considers Ezra's psychology and notes the intensity of the experience and its uniqueness in all of the apocalypses. He further suggests it is akin to a ‘conversion’ experience in its intense feeling, and that ‘the wondrous city is the place of revelations that transcend human measure’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0951820712439829">23</xref></sup> I agree, but further suggest that Ezra's transformation results from his intimate exposure to the City in part because he finally grasps—not through rational processes, but through visionary experience—how the anguish of all the mothers in the passage will be resolved. While earlier he had counseled the mourning woman, saying ‘you will receive your son back in due time’ (10.16), his speech is clearly marked by anger and frustration, since he begins his speech of ‘comfort’ by saying ‘You most foolish of women’ (10.6)! He may have presented the woman with the idea of resurrection as an ideal, but he is far from feeling assured himself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0951820712439829">24</xref></sup> After witnessing the dramatic birth of the City, however, Ezra now truly knows what before he had only professed: the son of the mourning mother will someday be resurrected, just as Mother Zion will give birth to a new City, and as Mother Earth will give birth again to the humans who have died.</p>

<sec id="section5-0951820712439829">
<title>5. A Ritual Studies Interpretation of Ezra's Transition</title>
<p>Over the course of the text, Ezra's change is not only psychological, it is ontological:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0951820712439829">25</xref></sup> he is a mere mortal at the commencement of the text, but by the text's end he will clearly ascend to heaven and not die (14.9; cf. 6.26).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0951820712439829">26</xref></sup> Uriel calls such persons by the label ‘the men who were taken up, who <italic>from their birth</italic> have not tasted death’ (6.26). That is, a select few persons are born once and achieve an incorruptible state in their lifetimes.</p>
<p>For the majority of regular humans, the text establishes the following life pattern: they are born from the earth (3.5; 7.62) and their mothers' wombs (5.35, 46, 51; 8.8), they live and then die (8.8–9), they are housed in the womb of the earth (4.42; 7.32), and they are reborn in an incorruptible state by the earth in the eschaton (7.32). Schematically, their life path looks like this:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>gestation → birth → death = gestation in the earth's womb → rebirth in eschaton</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned already, they change from mortality to immortality in the earth-womb, undergoing an ontological change: <italic>‘that which is corruptible shall perish</italic>. And the earth shall give up those who are asleep in it and the chambers shall <italic>give up (reddet</italic>) the souls’ (7.32).</p>
<p>By contrast, a select few such as Ezra are born from their mothers' wombs but never die (6.26); thus their life path looks something like this:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>gestation → birth → rebirth in immortal form</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Rare persons such as Ezra, Enoch, and Elijah, and probably Moses (cf. 14.9), thus experience birth once, while the rest of us, according to <italic>4 Ezra</italic>, will be born twice.</p>
<p>Ezra attains immortality differently, by skipping the period in which other people die and gestate in the earth's womb. However, Ezra does experience something transformational that is akin to death. In the fourth episode, directly in response to the extraordinary birth of the City, Ezra declares: ‘<italic>I lay there like a corpse</italic> and was deprived of my understanding’ (10.30). Given overwhelming cross-cultural ethnographic evidence, it is fair to say that pregnancy/birth and death are the quintessential human moments marked by ritual, especially rites of passage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0951820712439829">27</xref></sup> Victor Turner notes that rites of passage are often expressed in symbolic terms of birth and death: ‘Moreover, the symbols in which these properties are manifested and embodied are manifold and various, and <italic>often relate to the physiological processes of death and birth</italic>, anabolism and katabolism’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0951820712439829">28</xref></sup> The linking of Ezra's experience of death just after the City's birth ties together the two most powerful rites of passage in human experience and signifies Ezra's rite of passage, or rite of transition, from the regular human life path to that of a mystic.</p>
<p>Van Gennep delineated three phases that structure rites of passage: separation (<italic>séparation</italic>), transition (<italic>marge</italic>), and incorporation (<italic>aggrégation</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0951820712439829">29</xref></sup> For Ezra, Episodes One through Three (4.1–9.25) involved rituals of mourning, prayer, and fasting that occurred in his bedroom, that is, within the spatial environs of his society. When Uriel sends Ezra away to the field called Arpad,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0951820712439829">30</xref></sup> outside of the City at the start of Episode Four (9.26), it is a clear <italic>separation</italic> from society, since ‘no work of human construction could endure in a place where the City of the Most High was to be revealed’ (10.54). In fact, when the people come from the City to the field after Episode Four (13.40–50), Ezra refuses them and sends them away, saying: ‘go, every one of you to his house, and after these days I will come to you’ (13.50). Thus, Ezra engages in the physical <italic>separation</italic> from society that, according to Van Gennep, marks the initiation of a rite of passage or transition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0951820712439829">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>After Ezra has experienced two vivid symbolic dreams in the same field, he walks around joyfully in the field (13.57) and finally returns to society to address the people, his temporary <italic>incorporation</italic> or re-aggregation back into his human community (14.23, 27). Thus, Ezra's sojourn in the field would constitute the <italic>transition</italic> period in a rite of passage. His deathlike experience marks the middle of a rite of passage, or a rite of transition, which takes place in an unusual space.</p>
<p>Van Gennep had noted that when the transition period is sufficiently extended it forms ‘a liminal period’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0951820712439829">32</xref></sup>—a concept greatly elaborated by Victor Turner.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0951820712439829">33</xref></sup> Although Turner was mostly interested in societal structures and the contrast between liminality and the status system, the basic characteristics of the liminal state that he mentions include: sacredness, sacred instruction, and acceptance of pain and suffering.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0951820712439829">34</xref></sup> Certainly, all of these conditions pertain to Ezra's stay in the sacred field, in which he sees the birth of the City and receives sacred instruction from touring it: ‘Go in and see the splendor and the vastness of the building, as far as it is possible for your eyes to see it, and afterward you will hear as much as your ears can hear’ (10.55–56). As Stone notes, it is revealed knowledge ‘beyond human ken’ and beyond rational discourse.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0951820712439829">35</xref></sup> The period is also marked by Turner's third characteristic, pain and suffering. Ezra struggles to bear his own suffering, while exhorting the mourning mother and mourning Mother Zion to do the same:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>It is most appropriate to mourn now, because we are all mourning, and to be sorrowful, because we are all sorrowing; you are sorrowing for one son, but we, the whole world, for our mother…bear bravely the troubles that have come upon you. (10.8, 17)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thus, both in structure (sandwiched between <italic>separation</italic> and <italic>incorporation</italic>) and in content (sacredness, sacred instruction and acceptance of pain and suffering), Ezra's sojourn in the field fits the description of the <italic>liminal</italic> phase, or <italic>transition</italic> period, of an actual rite of passage.</p>
<p>Viewed as a rite of passage, Ezra's transformation in the field of Arpad moves him from rationality to mysticism, the latter state being associated with his ‘death’ and rebirth. Prior to Ezra's rite of passage he often engages in rational argumentation with Uriel in Episodes One to Three (4.1–9.25). Although Uriel repeatedly imparts revelation to him, it leaves him depressed and anxious, as he said ‘my heart was troubled again as it was before’ (9.27). In his <italic>liminal visionary</italic> period, Episodes Four to Six (9.26–13.56), he speaks with the mourning woman,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0951820712439829">36</xref></sup> sees the birth of the City, lays himself down like a corpse, arises and tours the City, and takes in profound revelation (10.55–56).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0951820712439829">37</xref></sup> Ezra has changed, in part because of his new, deep understanding of the eschatological realities of rebirth for humankind and the birth of the City. After even more revelation in the form of two more symbolic dream visions (11.1–13.56) that leave him joyous (13.57), Ezra gathers the people, a <italic>temporary incorporation</italic> back into society (14.23).</p>
<p>After all of this, Ezra undergoes another rite of passage that mirrors the first, except that it occurs at an even more profound mystical level. Once again he undergoes a <italic>separation</italic>, leaving the people and sojourning in the field of Arpad, but this time with five sacred scribes (14.37, 23). The <italic>liminal</italic> phase that ensues consists of the most sacred instruction, which Turner identifies as a peak characteristic of liminality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0951820712439829">38</xref></sup> Ezra is now the instructor, and his transformation is marked by his ingestion of the fiery drink that enables him to pour forth the Torah and seventy secret books (14.37–47). Beyond metaphor, in this text fire expresses theophany (8.22; 13.11; cf. <italic>1 En</italic>. 14.8), and Ezra's incorporation of the substance into his own body signifies a complete change in ontology like that of the angels who transform into fire (8.22).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0951820712439829">39</xref></sup> Finally, Ezra receives <italic>permanent incorporation</italic>, not into his earthly community, but into his heavenly one, and he ascends to heaven (14.9, 49–50 <italic>Syr</italic>.).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0951820712439829">40</xref></sup> Akin to a full rebirth in an incorruptible state, there he will join those who ‘since birth have not tasted death’ (6.26; 14.9).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0951820712439829">41</xref></sup> In his own mystical fashion, in the field of Arpad, Ezra has experienced death and rebirth in immortal form. For the rest of the righteous among humankind, this comes only in the eschaton.</p>

<title>6. Implications</title>
<p>Bourdieu argued that we are ‘durably installed’ into our cultural processes; he saw phenomena that are embodied through ritual and bodily experience as being ‘placed beyond the grasp of consciousness’, so that they ‘hence cannot be touched by voluntary, deliberate transformation, cannot even be made explicit’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0951820712439829">42</xref></sup> According to him, bodily experiences are ‘ineffable, incommunicable, and inimitable’ and there is nothing ‘more precious than the values given body, made body by the transubstantiation achieved by the hidden persuasion of an implicit pedagogy’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0951820712439829">43</xref></sup> <italic>4 Ezra</italic> speaks to such an embodied pedagogy, in which the receipt of wisdom is expressed in somatic, ritual processes: by fasting, by dream visions, by a ‘deathlike’ trance, by lying in a sacred field for some weeks, and by analogy with the human experience of pregnancy and birthing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0951820712439829">44</xref></sup> Indeed, Ezra has ‘searched out the Law’, but his <italic>rational</italic> inquiry provided no meaningful answers (9.27; 14.55). Ezra's personal, mystical transformation has been so powerful that the most suitable forms of expression are death and birth.</p>
<p>Several commentators have argued that the author identifies strongly with the character Ezra.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0951820712439829">45</xref></sup> Most consistently, Stone has strenuously argued that the pseudepigraphic Ezra's experience mirrors that of the author, stating of Episode Four in particular:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Whoever composed this vision had direct knowledge of the psychological and ecstatic dynamics described, either through personal experience or by immersion in a tradition in which such descriptions, based on real experiences, were current. The sophistication of the descriptions here admits no other explanation.'<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0951820712439829">46</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>I have shown that the unfolding of Ezra's experiences in Episodes Four to Seven do mirror the structure of real rites of passage, suggesting at least the author's familiarity with ritual. I would suggest that, in highly stylized, literary form, we have authorial allusion to real visionary ritual, understood as separating, transitioning and then incorporating ritual experts into a heavenly community. In this case, the ritual event made such an impact that it is expressed in terms of the most potent of human experiences, death and birth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0951820712439829">47</xref></sup></p>

By the seventh episode, Ezra is a supra-human being who can ingest the fiery liquid of wisdom, which is more than simply symbolic (14.37–40), given that throughout <italic>4 Ezra</italic>, light and fire are divine realities. The angels themselves are transformed into fire at the Lord's command (8.22). Ezra is able to imbibe something like a fiery liquid and it changes his very heart: ‘my heart poured forth understanding’ (14.40). The ontological problem of Adam's ‘evil heart’ mentioned so frequently has been overcome; Ezra pours forth Scripture and ascends to heaven, having completed his transformation.</p></fn>
