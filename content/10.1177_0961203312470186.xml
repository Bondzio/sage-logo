<p>Herpes zoster (HZ) is the painful reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus infection. The incidence of HZ may be increased in some autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We examined the incidence and risk factors for HZ in a prospective cohort of patients with physician-diagnosed SLE compared to those diagnosed with non-inflammatory musculoskeletal conditions (MSK). After excluding participants with a history of prior HZ at enrollment, we followed 1485 SLE patients and 2775 MSK with semi-annual mailed questionnaires for incident HZ between 2001 and 2010. Age-adjusted incidences were calculated for each group and Cox proportional hazard models were used to identify predictors of HZ. Zostavax® vaccination rates were compared between groups.</p>
<p>Participants had a mean age of 60 years at enrollment, with 13.9 years of disease. SLE patients had more HZ at all ages, with an age-adjusted incidence of 12.0/1000 person-years compared to MSK (8.7/1000 person-years) and a hazard ratio of 1.7 (95% CI 1.08–2.71) for SLE. Increasing age and reduced functional status were independent predictors of HZ. In SLE, prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil use conferred additional risk. SLE had the lowest HZ vaccination rates among age-eligible subjects.</p>

<p>Herpes zoster (zoster, shingles) (HZ) is caused by reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus (VZV) that occurs decades following initial exposure. Approximately 98% of the adult population in the United States (US) has serologic evidence of primary infection with varicella, and is therefore at risk for the later development of HZ. Clinically, HZ typically presents as a unilateral vesicular rash limited to one or two dermatomes in the thoracic, cervical, and ophthalmologic regions. The rash usually lasts seven to 10 days, during which the virus may be transmissible through airborne particles. Complications of HZ include post-herpetic neuralgia, bacterial superinfection, and disseminated zoster with meningoencephalitis. The incidence of HZ increases with age, presumably as cell-mediated immunity (CMI) wanes with advancing age. Studies of VZV-CMI in unvaccinated individuals estimate an approximate 2.7%–3.9% decrease with each year of age after 60, whereas VZV-specific antibody levels remain essentially unchanged.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312470186">1</xref></sup> Two recent population-based studies of HZ in the US have found an age-adjusted incidence of zoster in the past decade to be between 3.4 to 4.4 per 1000 person-years, with estimates approaching eight to 11 per 1000 person-years among people over age 65.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312470186">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312470186">3</xref></sup> For unclear reasons, the incidence of HZ appears to have increased for all age groups over the past 15 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312470186">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312470186">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several studies have suggested that HZ is more common among immunocompromised patients in comparison to the general population, including those with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) receiving various degrees of immunosuppressive medications. Most incidence estimates of HZ in SLE have been derived from retrospective single-center studies. Studies have estimated the annual incidence of HZ to range from 6.4 to 32.5/1000 person-years in SLE patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203312470186">4</xref>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312470186">6</xref></sup> This is nearly two- to 10-fold above the estimated rate of HZ in the general population of 3.4 to 4.4/1000 person-years. More recent studies from Japan and Taiwan have found an incidence of HZ among SLE patients to be 37.7–53.7 per 1000 person-years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203312470186">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203312470186">8</xref></sup> In juvenile-onset SLE, estimates approach 58.7/1000 patient years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203312470186">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Studies are mixed regarding relative roles of disease activity and immunosuppressive medications in increasing risk of HZ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312470186">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203312470186">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203312470186">11</xref></sup> Some studies have suggested that HZ episodes occur during periods of low disease activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312470186">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312470186">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203312470186">10</xref></sup> or near the time of SLE diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203312470186">9</xref></sup> Similarly, many studies have implicated higher doses of immunosuppression,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312470186">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203312470186">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203312470186">11</xref></sup> while others have found that HZ occurs in patients who were not receiving corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203312470186">9</xref></sup> This is possibly because of an inherent deficiency in CMI or other immunity associated with the SLE itself that may be separate from or in addition to that imposed by immunosuppressant medications.</p>
<p>The HZ vaccine (Zostavax®, Merck) is a live, attenuated version of the Oka/Merck strain of VZV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203312470186">12</xref></sup> It has at least 14 times the potency of Varivax® (the vaccine licensed for the prevention of primary varicella infection). Zostavax was licensed in the US on May 25, 2006, as a single dose for immunocompetent adults aged ≥60 years based on a large phase III clinical trial that showed a reduction in the incidence of HZ by 51.3% and post-herpetic neuralgia of 66.5%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203312470186">13</xref></sup> Although Zostavax vaccination is very recently approved and available for people aged 50 years and older, the safety and efficacy is unknown among immunocompromised individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203312470186">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203312470186">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>We hypothesized that participants with SLE will have increased incidence of HZ at all ages when compared to patients without chronic autoimmune diseases, and that immunosuppressive agents may further increase risk. In this study, we sought to evaluate the incidence of and identify potential risk factors for the development of HZ in a large, prospective cohort of subjects with physician-diagnosed SLE compared to a cohort without underlying autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. Additionally, we were interested in comparing HZ vaccination rates between diagnosis groups in subjects aged ≥60 years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0961203312470186" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>Patients in this study were participants in the National Data Bank for Rheumatic Diseases (NDB) longitudinal study of rheumatic disease outcomes. NDB participants are recruited on an ongoing basis from the practices of US rheumatologists, and are followed prospectively with semi-annual, detailed, 28-page questionnaires, as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203312470186">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203312470186">16</xref></sup> Referrals to the NDB were made from the practices of 995 US rheumatologists. All cases had physician-confirmed diagnoses. In this report we studied SLE patients who had completed semi-annual questionnaires during the period between Jan. 1, 2001, and Dec. 31, 2009. Because the NDB does not contain a population representative of the “general population,” we also studied patients who did not have SLE, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or other inflammatory disorders as a comparator group. These participants have been diagnosed with non-inflammatory musculoskeletal disorders (MSK), including those diagnosed with osteoarthritis, back pain syndromes, and similar disorders. These subjects completed identical questionnaires as participants with SLE at all time points. To avoid the possibility of misclassification due to over reporting, we excluded patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia.</p>
<p>The presence of HZ was assessed in questions regarding previous and current HZ. At the time of enrollment in the study, patients reported whether they had ever been diagnosed with HZ. For analysis of incident cases, all subjects with a prior history of HZ at enrollment were excluded. New cases of HZ were identified by patient self-report during each six-month follow-up questionnaire. The specific question asked was, “Did you have or were you treated for shingles (herpes zoster) between… (dates of the six-month period prior to questionnaire administration were inserted here)?” Cases were validated by contacting patients and inquiring about a physician diagnosis of HZ. Cases that could not be validated were not considered to be true cases. Prior cases of HZ reported at the enrollment questionnaire were not followed up for validation purposes as they were not the focus of this analysis.</p>
<p>At each questionnaire assessment, we recorded socioeconomic and demographic variables as well as treatments and comorbid conditions. Treatments of interest included immunosuppressant medications including corticosteroids. Comorbid conditions included diabetes, malignancy, asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and renal problems. Participants also reported functional status using the Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index (HAQ).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203312470186">17</xref></sup> The HAQ measures functional impairment related to illness severity, and it is correlated with treatment choice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203312470186">18</xref></sup> It is commonly used in clinical studies of arthritis and healthy aging, and scores range from 0 (no disability) to 3 (severe disability with extreme difficulty performing even simple tasks) and has been correlated with accumulating comorbidities, health care utilization, and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203312470186">17</xref></sup> The HAQ was assessed at the end of each six-month period during which a case of HZ may have been reported.</p>
<p>Crude and age- and sex-adjusted incidence of HZ by 1000 person-years with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was estimated for each diagnosis group using survival-time data analysis. Age-adjusted incidence of HZ was determined by age standardization to the US population in 2005. Subsequent reports of HZ were not included in the analysis. Age- and sex-adjusted predictive values and 95% CIs were calculated by 10-year age increments for each disease group.</p>
<p>Predictors of HZ in the entire cohort, including diagnosis group, age, and sex were examined with Cox proportional hazard regression models. Because the HAQ is assessed at the end of the six-month period during which HZ may have been reported, the HAQ may incorporate changes in functional status that result from HZ. Therefore, HAQ data was lagged by six months to better represent functional status prior to any episode of HZ. Prior HAQ values were not available in &lt;5% of observations. In those instances we used current rather than prior HAQ values.</p>
<p>Specific predictors of HZ among SLE patients were further analyzed using only Cox regression models. Because initial symptoms of HZ may be confused with SLE flares or providers may use corticosteroids to reduce inflammation caused by HZ, use of prednisone was lagged so use in the previous six-month period was used to predict HZ in the following six-month period. We assumed that immunosuppressant medications including mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), cyclophosphamide, or azathioprine would not be initiated in the immediate period following a diagnosis of zoster, so use of these medications were not lagged by any time period. Data were analyzed using Stata (College Station, TX, USA) version 12. The proportional hazards assumption was satisfied in all Cox proportional hazards models. Statistical significance was set at the 0.05 level, CIs were established at 95%, and all tests were two tailed.</p>
<p>Beginning in 2006, when the Zostavax vaccine became commercially available and licensed for individuals ≥60 years old, participants were asked whether they received the HZ vaccine at each semi-annual questionnaire. Since licensing of Zostavax for individuals aged 50–59 did not occur until 2011, the denominator for each diagnosis was the number of participants ≥60 years old who provided a yes or no answer to the question about HZ vaccination within the previous six months. Cumulative vaccination rates among individuals ≥60 years old were tabulated and compared between SLE and MSK using Chi square tests.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0961203312470186" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>Of 5068 participants available during the study period, 808 (15.9%) reported a history of HZ prior to enrollment and were excluded from further study, leaving 4260 participants at risk for incident HZ available for analysis (1485 SLE; 2775 MSK). Overall, the cohort was predominately female, Caucasian, and middle aged, with at least a high school education. Mean age at enrollment was 60 years for the cohort overall, but differed by diagnosis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961203312470186">Table 1</xref>). Reflective of a general younger age at disease onset, participants with SLE were youngest at enrollment, with a mean age of 48 years. Subjects with MSK were, on average, 65 years old at enrollment. Mean disease duration at enrollment was approximately 13.5 years, and was similar across all diagnoses. A total of 1056 new cases of HZ were reported during the period of observation: 409 SLE and 647 MSK.

<p>In order to estimate the effect of age and sex in the relative risk of developing incident HZ by diagnosis, we constructed multivariable Cox proportional hazard models including age, sex, and HAQ as covariates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0961203312470186">Table 2</xref>). After adjustment for confounding variables including age, sex, and functional status, SLE patients had a 70% increased risk of developing HZ (HR 1.71, 95% CI 1.08–2.71) compared to participants without inflammatory disease. As expected, age was an independent predictor of HZ, increasing by 1% per year. Similarly, worsening overall physical function assessed by the HAQ had a modest effect on HZ.

<p>Given that SLE carries a higher risk of HZ, we sought to better understand predictors for incident HZ that may be unique to SLE, with particular attention to use of immunosuppressant medications. Limiting the analysis to SLE patients only, Cox proportional hazard models were created to evaluate the role of age, sex, immunosuppressant medication use, prednisone use in the six months prior to reporting, and functional status (HAQ) assessed six months prior to reporting. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0961203312470186">Table 3</xref> displays the results of the survival analysis. In this model, only prednisone or MMF use was predictive of incident HZ. The interaction term of MMF and prednisone did not confer additional risk. Functional ability, as measured by the HAQ, was not significantly associated with increased risk of HZ among SLE patients in this model. Other measures of immunosuppression, including presence of diabetes mellitus or renal disease, were not significantly associated with HZ in univariate or multivariate models (data not shown).

<p>Data on HZ vaccination since vaccine licensure in 2006 were available for 1601 participants ≥60 years old. Overall, 186 (11.6%) of participants reported vaccination, which is higher than the 6.7% rate reported in a 2008 general population-based survey.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203312470186">19</xref></sup> However, vaccination rates differed significantly by diagnosis, with 7.1% of age-eligible SLE patients reporting vaccination compared to 13% for those with MSK disorders (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001). Mean age at vaccination was 70 years for SLE and 74 years for MSK. Numbers of vaccinated individuals were too small to perform meaningful subanalyses.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0961203312470186" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>This is among the first studies to evaluate incidence and risk factors for HZ in a prospective, longitudinal cohort of SLE patients in comparison to those with MSK. Akin to retrospective studies of adult SLE patients performed at single centers, we found an increased incidence of HZ across all ages, with a 70% increased risk after controlling for age, sex, and disability.</p>
<p>Age-adjusted incidence of HZ in SLE in this cohort (12.0/1000 person-years) is consistent with other studies of adult lupus cohorts, with incidence estimates ranging from 6.4 to 58.7/1000 person years,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203312470186">4</xref>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312470186">6</xref></sup> all of which are significantly higher than the 3.2/1000 person years incidence seen in the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312470186">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312470186">3</xref></sup> Our data show that the increased risk of HZ is observed across all age groups, and may even be increasing among older populations. Among SLE patients, we identified prednisone and MMF use as additional risk factors for the development of HZ. Associations between corticosteroid use and HZ have been described in SLE and in other rheumatic diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312470186">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312470186">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961203312470186">20</xref></sup> Our observation of an additional risk of HZ conferred by use of MMF has had clinical suspicion but little formal documentation. MMF was licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1998 for the prevention of acute kidney transplant rejection. Widespread use for the treatment and maintenance of lupus nephritis as well as moderate to severe non-renal manifestations to SLE increased in the 2000s, based on demonstrated and perceived efficacy as well as an improved safety profile in comparison to cyclophosphamide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961203312470186">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961203312470186">22</xref></sup> The availability of generic MMF will increase access to treatment by increasing numbers of patients, making studies of adverse events or associated comorbidities important. Our study encompasses the time period of increasing MMF use, so our results are applicable to contemporary prescribing practices for the treatment of SLE. It is somewhat surprising that associations between cyclophosphamide use and HZ were not seen. However, this result may be a function of insufficient power due to inadequate numbers of cyclophosphamide exposure; less than 1% of participants were receiving cyclophosphamide during the period of observation, leading to too few participants at risk to derive meaningful estimates in this cohort. Similarly, use of azathioprine was low in this cohort of SLE patients during the period of observation.</p>
<p>Incidence of HZ for participants with MSK remains higher than rates reported in the general population. This is somewhat curious in subjects without chronic inflammation and who are not receiving any immunosuppressive therapy. Because the NDB does not contain a true “control” group representative of the general population, we used subjects with non-inflammatory diseases as a reference for comparative studies of outcomes. However, NDB participants with MSK may not be truly representative of the general population, with lower health status as evidenced by the HAQ. The HAQ at enrollment for MSK subjects was 0.89, which is only slightly lower than enrollment disability among the cohort of SLE (0.92, <italic>p</italic> = 0.18), and is strikingly higher than normative values of HAQ in the general healthy population of 0.18 (95% CI 0.14–0.23) or among healthy women aged 65–69 (HAQ = 0.33).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961203312470186">23</xref></sup> Given that HAQ was an independent risk factor for HZ in this cohort, we believe that health status as estimated by the HAQ may explain some of the discrepancy between HZ incidence among MSK subjects compared to incidence estimates reported for the general healthy population. This raises the possibility that relative hazards for HZ among SLE patients found in this study may underestimate true differences when compared to healthy individuals.</p>
<p>Although rates of vaccination with the HZ vaccine, Zostavax, are higher than rates reported in the general population, they remain low in age-eligible subjects in the entire cohort and are significantly lower for patients with SLE despite increased risk of HZ. Nationally, Zostavax vaccination rates are low even in the general population, and this is likely a function of lack of awareness of vaccine availability, concern about risks associated with live-attenuated vaccines, and the cost of vaccination. Experts disagree on the safety of the use of Zostavax in individuals with autoimmune diseases, particularly those receiving immunosuppressive medications. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC)-published guidelines for Zostavax suggest vaccination may be safe in patients taking low to moderate doses of prednisone, methotrexate, and azathioprine; however, this is based on expert recommendation rather than epidemiologic or experimental data. There are no data available on the use or safety of Zostavax vaccination among SLE patients irrespective of immunosuppressive therapy, and it is not surprising that rates remain low.</p>
<p>The strengths of this study include the large sample size and longitudinal follow-up of this cohort. This allows for prospective reporting of HZ with the ability to validate cases, thus reducing recall bias of events that may have occurred years to decades prior to enrollment. Additionally, medication exposure at the time of HZ is collected prospectively. Because the NDB primarily utilizes mailed questionnaires, participants are not geographically restricted, and consist of patients with SLE and RA who are followed by community rheumatologists in addition to tertiary-care referral centers.</p>
<p>An important limitation of this study is the lack of physician- or laboratory-derived data on disease activity among SLE patients. Because data are collected by participant self-report, data are not available on acute-phase reactants, proteinuria, hematologic abnormalities, and other specific manifestations of disease; therefore, measures of disease activity (SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) or British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG)) were not ascertained. This limits our ability to evaluate associations between disease activity and risk of HZ. While imperfect, we do utilize data on surrogates of overall disease activity, including use of immunosuppressive medications to control active disease as well as measures of global health status and disability including the HAQ.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this prospective longitudinal cohort study demonstrates increased incidence of HZ among SLE patients at all ages, indicating that risks are increased with worsening physical function, age, and use of prednisone or MMF. Vaccination rates remain very low among age-eligible SLE patients. Better understanding of the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of Zostavax in this population may help mitigate risk of future HZ in high-risk individuals.</p>
