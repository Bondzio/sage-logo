<abstract>
<p>A human physiological study was performed to verify the claim that the structure of a layer, without a change in the component materials, can reduce condensation in a multilayered cold weather clothing ensemble. Two five-layered clothing ensembles were constructed using different array types: an all-separated type and a combined type in which the final insulating layer was mechanically attached to a jacket without an air gap. The materials in the two arrays were identical and 100% polyester. The results showed that the combined type produced significantly less sweat (33.8%), displayed 31.3% improved vapor permeability, and had 25.0% lower sweat accumulation compared to the separated type (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Following exercise, the all-separated type displayed up to a 74% greater cooling rate of skin temperature compared to the combined-type ensemble. There was a tendency to note a warmer, drier, and less clammy condition in the combined clothing ensemble by participants. The results were in good agreement with the simulator results, and suggest that an appropriate layer arrangement, in addition to material selection, should be considered for the design of novel functional clothing for cold conditions.</p>

<body>
<p>A common strategy for protecting humans from cold is the prevention of cooling and the maintenance of heat balance at acceptable temperature levels. However, the complexity involved in protecting humans against low temperatures increases when excess body heat is produced during high levels of activity when the clothing insulation is designed for no or low work intensity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0040517512438123">1</xref></sup> A garment designed for cold protection generally consists of several layers of highly insulating textiles and a waterproof fabric for an outer shell; accordingly, the clothing system has very low vapor permeability and is susceptible to overheating due to the high insulation, which can cause sweating. Therefore, when the heat production level of the wearer increases due to the physical activity, sweat accumulation/condensation takes place throughout the layers of the cold protective clothing system. Condensation within a cold protective garment deteriorates the insulation and moisture management function of the clothing system, resulting in serious thermo-physiological health problems and discomfort. When using cold protective clothing in a low temperature environment, therefore, the accumulation of moisture within the clothing system has been a major problem, especially when the wearer is exposed to a prolonged period of recess after physical activity, such as winter outdoor sports or military-type exercises.</p>
<p>Condensation takes place somewhere in the clothing system where the vapor concentration is increased to the point of saturation. In cold conditions, therefore, condensation generally takes place where the temperature gradient or the permeability of the clothing drops.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0040517512438123">2</xref></sup> For this reason, attention has been focused on the performance of the textile material, especially on waterproof breathable fabrics as the outermost layer of cold protective ensembles under various temperatures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0040517512438123">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0040517512438123">4</xref></sup> This has also been assessed by different test methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0040517512438123">5</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0040517512438123">7</xref></sup> Ren and Ruckman<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0040517512438123">8</xref></sup> suggested a method of reducing condensation on waterproof breathable fabric by changing its hydrophilicity, and Rossi and Gross<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0040517512438123">9</xref></sup> examined the effect of a hydrophilic layer underneath the outer shell on the liquid moisture transfer properties. On the other hand, Bakkevig and Nielsen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0040517512438123">1</xref></sup> investigated the performance of various types of underwear in relation to sweat accumulation and the activity level. Few studies have explored the effect of a layer array method in a multilayer clothing system on the vapor permeability and condensation, although very recently an attempt was made using a simulator assessment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0040517512438123">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>To understand the condensation phenomena in the clothing system, considerable effort has been made using numerical prediction models of coupled heat and moisture transfer and condensation through the clothing system under various circumstances.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0040517512438123">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0040517512438123">11</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0040517512438123">13</xref></sup> These researchers worked on the determining factors for the prediction of a heat and moisture transfer mechanism when condensation exists at a high level. Because textile materials are a complex body of air and fibers and because they are constructed by diverse methods, the variables are often too subtle to predict clearly. Moreover, regarding the clothing system, the prediction model should include many more variables, such as the clothing design, the interactions between the layers caused by the fit and body movement, and the physiological reaction from the human body, which is not always constant.</p>
<p>To offset the limitations of the models, instruments have been developed to simulate heat and sweat production from the body, the entire clothing system, and designated ambient conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0040517512438123">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0040517512438123">14</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0040517512438123">17</xref></sup> The use of these methods is much simpler than the use of a thermal sweating manikin in terms of sample preparation and operation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517512438123">16</xref></sup> With the advantages of using the Human-Clothing-Environment (HCE) simulator, we already reported that the layer arrangement of a multiplayer clothing system could alter not only the heat and moisture transfer properties, but also the condensation profile of the clothing system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0040517512438123">10</xref></sup> The findings, however, will be much more likely to be useful for functional clothing designers and customers after physiological validation via human wear trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0040517512438123">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0040517512438123">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Therefore, the goal of the present investigation is to verify the effects of the layer array method of the multilayer cold protective clothing using full-size garments and human participants by analyzing the following: (a) physiological data (the sweat amount produced and accumulated in the clothing; the microclimate temperature and humidity within the garment); and (b) perceptual data (perceived thermal and moisture sensation). In addition, the paper discusses the influence of the estimation method for vapor transfer performance of the clothing system in a physiological study. The simulator results mentioned in this study are all from the work of Yoo and Kim,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0040517512438123">10</xref></sup> unless otherwise noted; some of the data may be included in the present analysis if needed.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0040517512438123"><title>Test garments</title>
<p>Five layers of garments were constructed in two different arrays, the all-separated type (array A) and the combined type (array C), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0040517512438123">Figure 1</xref>. Sleeveless polyester knit underwear and three long-sleeved polyester fleece shirts of identical design were worn in order. Over these layers, an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membrane laminated waterproof breathable jacket was worn as an outer shell. The major difference between the two array types was whether the last insulating fleece was separated from or combined into the outer shell. For array C, the outmost fleece layer was attached to the jacket using hook-and-loop fasteners. They were connected at several positions, including the sleeve, armhole, neckline, and along the hemlines. Clothing fabrics were the same materials used in the simulator test.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0040517512438123">10</xref></sup> Their physical properties are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0040517512438123">Table 1</xref>. Materials were deliberately selected from non-hygroscopic materials to prevent the influence of heat absorption of the fibers; the heat is considerable and sufficient to alter the condensation mechanism as well as the heat and moisture transfer characteristics of the clothing system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0040517512438123">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0040517512438123">21</xref></sup> Before any testing was conducted, all of the test garments except the jacket were laundered and air dried to remove any finishing chemicals in the textiles. After each trial, the garments were laundered and stored in a conditioned room (<italic>t<sub>a</sub></italic> = 25 ± 2°C, <italic>rh</italic> = 50 ± 5%) for the next trial. Besides test garments, identical cold protective slacks, socks, gloves, and ear protectors were provided to the participants for the test. Participants were allowed to wear their own boxers and athletic type footwear.

Participants were non-smokers and were instructed against the use of alcohol the day before the test, and against the ingestion of food and caffeine two hours before the test.

<sec id="sec4-0040517512438123"><title>Test procedure</title>
<p>Each participant wore each test ensemble once (seven single tests per test garment) and went through the test protocols for 70 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0040517512438123">Figure 2</xref>). The participants were tested at the same time of day to avoid an influence of the circadian rhythm in their physiological responses, and two tests were scheduled for each participant so as not to exceed a three-day interval to minimize variations due to time. Prior to the test, the participants were guided to drink 400 ml of lukewarm water and were stabilized in a conditioned room (<italic>t<sub>a</sub></italic> = 25 ± 2°C, <italic>rh</italic> = 50 ± 5%) for 30 minutes and weighed (<italic>W<sub>s</sub></italic><sub>1</sub>). After they were equipped with the test garments and sensors, the participants were weighed again (<italic>W<sub>t</sub></italic><sub>1</sub>) and stayed another 10 minutes in the room. Subsequently, they entered a cold chamber (EBL-5HW2P3A-22, 5120 mm × 2200 mm × 2200 mm, TABAI Espec®, Japan) set at −15°C and were seated upright there for 10 minutes. After the 10 minutes rest, they went through a 20-minute treadmill exercise (J4F, Tunturi®, speed = 7 km/hr, no incline). After the exercise session, the participants remained seated upright in the cold chamber for another 40 minutes. As soon as the test ended, the participants left the test chamber for the final weight measurements (<italic>W<sub>t</sub></italic><sub>2</sub> and <italic>W<sub>s</sub></italic><sub>2</sub>).

<p>To investigate the influence of the method of evaporation assessment, vapor permeability was calculated using two different methods: <italic>WVT</italic><sub>(</sub><italic><sub>wt</sub></italic><sub>)</sub> by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula5-0040517512438123">Equation (5)</xref> and <italic>WVT</italic><sub>(</sub><italic><sub>at</sub></italic><sub>)</sub> by Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula6-0040517512438123">6</xref>).

<p>For the evaporation assessment, <italic>WVT</italic><sub>(</sub><italic><sub>at</sub></italic><sub>)</sub> followed an identical procedure to that applied in the simulator test, based on the calculated differences between the supplied and accumulated moisture. In the majority of cases, this is the method of choice for evaporation assessment through a clothing system. However, when measuring sweat accumulation from each garment, the inclusion of more complex variables than those used in the instrumental test, such as the removal of wet garments and sensors from the participants, is required. During these procedures, unintended moisture loss can occur. As these values may not be included in the sweat accumulation measurements on the garment, evaporation (<italic>M<sub>e.at</sub></italic>) can be overestimated in human wear trial tests when applying this method. For this reason, <italic>WVT</italic><sub>(</sub><italic><sub>at</sub></italic><sub>)</sub> displayed larger values than <italic>WVT</italic><sub>(</sub><italic><sub>simulator</sub></italic><sub>)</sub>. An evaporation estimate based on the total weight loss assessment (<italic>M<sub>e</sub>.<sub>wt</sub></italic>) requires a simple weighing procedure. Hence, <italic>WVT</italic><sub>(</sub><italic><sub>wt</sub></italic><sub>)</sub> was deemed more plausible. The results show that the method of evaporation assessment in human wear trial tests is an influential factor when estimating the vapor transfer performance of a clothing system when condensation occurs.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec14-0040517512438123"><title>Accumulated sweat (<italic>M<sub>a</sub></italic>)</title>
<p>The absolute values of total moisture accumulation significantly differed between the types of clothing ensembles, with significantly less sweat accumulating in the combined ensemble (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) (array C: 8.5 ± 5.4 g; array A: 12.9 ± 9.0 g). When analyzing the individual layers (<italic>M<sub>ai</sub></italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517512438123">Figure 4</xref>), the layers within type A showed significantly greater sweat accumulation. The accumulation of sweat occurred primarily in the third fleece layer: 35–39% of the total accumulation occurred in the third fleece, while only 13% accumulated in the outer jacket. The condensation profile for each garment layer agreed with the results obtained from the drying stage of the simulator test; the third fleece layer accumulated more moisture compared to the other layers. As the material characteristics of the garment layers were identical in both tested ensembles, it is apparent that the layer array method influenced the condensation characteristics. When the outermost insulating fabric was combined with the waterproof breathable jacket without an air gap, a lower level of condensation occurred. However, as no condensation differences were evident at the underwear layer, the advantages of the combined clothing ensemble (array C) due to its lower condensation levels may not be clearly identified by the participants.

<sec id="sec15-0040517512438123"><title>Skin temperature and microclimate temperature profiles across the ensemble</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0040517512438123">Figure 5</xref> demonstrates the changes of skin temperature over time. After entering the cold chamber, the skin temperature decreased rapidly while the participants were seated for the first 10 minutes. During this period, the lowest temperature remained above 33°C, indicating that the test ensemble provided sufficient insulation. During the exercise session, the skin temperature initially increased moderately, and then decreased for both clothing ensembles 5 minutes after the end of the activity. Owing to the differences in construction, the separated clothing ensemble provided a more effective air layer (array A), as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0040517512438123">Figure 1</xref>.
<fig id="fig5-0040517512438123" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Skin temperature profiles over time for cold protective ensembles constructed by two different layer array methods.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0040517512438123-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>As a result, a slightly higher skin temperature was observed in array A before and during the exercise session. When the skin temperature started to drop during the rest period after running, however, the decrease was more rapid in array A than in the combined type (array C). After a 15-minute rest under cold conditions after the exercise session, the rate of decrease was greater in array A than in array C. Specifically, a 74% greater cooling rate was observed in 55–80 minutes. This finding indicates that when the wearer is exposed to cold after sweat-producing activities, such as winter sports or military-type exercises, a combined ensemble (array C) provides better thermo-physiological protection.</p>

Accordingly, ▪ and • denote the microclimate temperatures measured during the sweating session, in which condensation occurred in both the human and simulator tests, and □ and ○ denote the cooling-down or drying sessions. The thickness was estimated from the differences between the girths of the garment layers. A linear temperature profile was estimated based on the temperature gradients between the skin and the environment (solid line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0040517512438123">Figure 6</xref>). During sweating sessions (▪ and •), the measured temperatures were higher than the linear profile. During the cooling-down or drying period at the end of the test (□ and ○), the measured temperature distribution followed a theoretical linear profile. The temperature profiles assessed in the human tests were in good agreement with the results from the simulator in both types of clothing arrays.

<p>The vapor concentration in the microclimate across the garment layers was assessed to investigate the condensation distribution in each layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0040517512438123">Figure 7</xref>). The saturation lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0040517512438123">28</xref></sup> of the vapor concentrations were calculated for both exercise (solid line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0040517512438123">Figure 7</xref>) and cooling-down sessions (broken line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0040517512438123">Figure 7</xref>). As the microclimate temperatures changed over time, the saturation line during the exercise session was moderately higher than during the cooling-down session. The vapor concentration between the skin and underwear during the exercise session (▪, 0–5 mm from the skin) did not reach the saturation line (solid line). During the cooling-down period, the vapor concentration between the skin and underwear (□, 0–5 mm from the skin) fell below the saturation line (broken line). Consequently, little condensation was expected to occur at the underwear layer during both exercise and cooling-down sessions (circled area in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0040517512438123">Figure 7</xref>). The separated clothing ensemble displayed similar results.

<sec id="sec17-0040517512438123"><title>Subjective thermal and moisture perception</title>
<p>The perceived thermal and moisture sensations for the two clothing ensembles were compared to examine whether the differences in condensation and vapor permeability influenced the participants’ perception (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0040517512438123">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0040517512438123">10</xref>). The thermal sensation for the combined clothing ensemble generally scored higher than the separated type. Twenty minutes after the exercise session, the combined type (array C) received a significantly higher (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) rating score of thermal perception compared to array A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0040517512438123">Figure 9</xref>). This was the period when the skin temperature of array A began to drop below that of array C (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0040517512438123">Figure 5</xref>). Regarding the moisture and clammy sensations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0040517512438123">Figure 10</xref>), there was a tendency to note a drier and less clammy condition in the combined clothing ensemble (array C), but these differences were not prominent. A significant difference was observed 10 minutes after exercise for the moisture sensation (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). As discussed, the clear effects of the array method on the condensation were primarily observed in the outer layers (the third fleece and the outer jacket, see the ‘Accumulated sweat (<italic>M<sub>a</sub></italic>)’ section). Near the skin area, where the participants perceived the sensations, a relatively small variation in the levels of moisture accumulation and vapor pressure were observed between the two types of clothing ensembles. For this reason, the differences in subjective perception may not be as large as when compared to those of an objective assessment. As the difference in the condensation and vapor permeability were apparent for the two types of clothing ensembles, a test protocol with heavier exercise and a prolonged cooling period may manifest in more distinct perception from the participants.

<sec id="sec18-0040517512438123"><title>Summary and conclusions</title>
<p>The claim that the layer array method of the multilayer cold weather clothing systems can affect the moisture transfer and condensation profiles was verified with full-size garment wear trials using human participants. A physiological analysis revealed that, when multiple insulation layers are involved, the combined construction of an outer insulating garment and waterproof breathable jacket enhanced the moisture transfer performance through the ensemble. The combined construction also diminished the accumulation of moisture within the clothing system, providing improved thermo-physiological and moisture comfort for the wearer under subzero conditions. The results from this study confirmed the findings from the simulator test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0040517512438123">10</xref></sup> performed at the fabric level.</p>
<p>The participants produced 33.8% less sweat with a clothing array type of insulating layer combined with a waterproof breathable outer jacket compared to a separated clothing ensemble. The combined-type ensemble also provided 31.3% better water vapor transfer and 25.0% lower total sweat accumulation within the ensemble. The majority of the moisture accumulated on the outermost insulating garment and jacket. As the vapor concentration near the skin did not reach the saturation line, only a small level of moisture accumulated in the underwear. Regarding the subjective perceptions, the participants noted that the combined clothing ensemble provided better thermal insulation and a drier and less clammy condition, although the differences were not prominent.</p>
<p>In addition, we found that the vapor permeability function of cold weather protective clothing systems can be overestimated when determined using the difference between produced and accumulated sweat. By assessing the difference in total weight (human, clothing, and sensors) before and after the test, the vapor permeability of the clothing systems was more plausible and comparable to the simulator test results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0040517512438123">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Consequently, when the outermost insulating fabric is combined with a waterproof breathable jacket without an air gap, the wearer produces significantly less sweat, and stays drier due to the improved vapor permeation and lower amount of condensation under subzero conditions. These results provide a practical insight into the novel product design of multilayered functional clothing systems for cold/sweating conditions, such as winter active sports and/or military service.</p>
<p>The conclusions were based on the assumption that the total thickness of the two array types was similar because the size of the outer garment (total volume) and the component layers (same <italic>R<sub>ct</sub></italic> and <italic>R<sub>et</sub></italic>) were identical. Accordingly, the enhancement of moisture transfer of the combined-type structure was attributed to the differences of the ensemble structure. However, the sustained air layer during movement may have differed for the two array types because the construction of the air layer within the ensemble was different. Measuring precise thermal resistance and evaporative resistance of two arrangements using a sweating thermal manikin with walking motion could provide valuable information for an in-depth discussion. In the current study, however, we could not conduct the thermal manikin test. It is a limitation of this study and should be a topic for further research.</p>
<p>The tests described in this study are short-term tests; the results were obtained from trials lasting only an hour. A prolonged period of trials and/or heavier sweat rates should also be considered, improving the applicability of the results to real-use situations.</p></sec>
