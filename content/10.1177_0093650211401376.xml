<abstract>
<p>A longitudinal panel survey of 396 White and Black preadolescent boys and girls was conducted to assess the long-term effects of television consumption on global self-esteem. The results revealed television exposure, after controlling for age, body satisfaction, and baseline self-esteem, was significantly related to children’s self-esteem. Specifically, television exposure predicted a decrease in self-esteem for White and Black girls and Black boys, and an increase in self-esteem among White boys. The findings are discussed in terms of cultivation theory and social identity theory.</p>

<p>Global self-esteem, generally defined as a feeling of self-worth and fundamental respect for oneself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0093650211401376">Rosenberg, 1972</xref>), is recognized for the significant role it plays in mental health and behavioral disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0093650211401376">McGee &amp; Williams, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0093650211401376">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2009</xref>). Known predictors of self-esteem include peer influences (e.g., peer acceptance, popularity) and family relationships (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0093650211401376">Harter, 1999</xref> for review). Researchers also have begun to examine the contemporary influences of the media on self-esteem because of established relationships between media exposure and other psychological variables such as attitudes and beliefs. For example, media exposure is correlated with the endorsement of gender stereotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093650211401376">Herrett-Skjellum &amp; Allen, 1996</xref>), real-world perceptions of racial and ethnic minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093650211401376">Mastro &amp; Kopacz, 2006</xref>), and body dissatisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093650211401376">Dohnt &amp; Tiggemann, 2006</xref>). Given these relationships, it is widely believed that the media play an important role in shaping self-conceptions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0093650211401376">Sahlstein &amp; Allen, 2002</xref>). Yet this assumption has rarely been tested with global self-esteem, particularly in samples of preadolescent children when self-esteem is just beginning to develop. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation is to examine whether media consumption is related to children’s self-esteem by means of a longitudinal panel survey. Furthermore, because media may not affect all children in the same way, differences by gender and racial/ethnic background are examined.</p>

<title>The Importance of Self-Esteem</title>
<p>Self-esteem is an important construct with significant behavioral and emotional ramifications, particularly for children. Research has shown that high self-esteem is correlated with student motivation, persistence, and academic achievement (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0093650211401376">Baumeister, Campbell, Krueger, &amp; Vohs, 2003</xref>). Research also indicates that high self-esteem among elementary school children is related to the health of their peer relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0093650211401376">Berndt, 2002</xref>). In contrast, youth with low self-esteem are at risk for adopting health-compromising behaviors, such as alcohol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0093650211401376">Scheirer, Botvin, Griffin, &amp; Diaz, 2000</xref>) and drug abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0093650211401376">Howard &amp; Jenson, 1999</xref>). Low self-esteem has also been linked to other health-risk behaviors such as disordered eating and suicidal ideation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0093650211401376">McGee &amp; Williams, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0093650211401376">Wilburn &amp; Smith, 2005</xref>). Researchers have argued that youth with low self-esteem are at risk for adopting such behaviors because these actions are regarded as the only means available for coping with feelings of low self-worth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0093650211401376">Baumeister, 1999</xref>) or because these youth are more likely to succumb to peer pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0093650211401376">McGee &amp; Williams, 2000</xref>). In accord, many advocacy groups have created programs to increase self-esteem in students, under the assumption that grade point averages would increase and delinquency would decrease, thereby leading to happier and more successful lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0093650211401376">National Association for Self-Esteem, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Media Exposure and Self-Esteem</title>
<p>According to a recent national survey of over 2,000 children aged 8 to 18 years, the typical American child spends an average of 7 hours per day with entertainment media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0093650211401376">Rideout, Foehr, &amp; Roberts, 2010</xref>). Given the sheer amount of time that children and adolescents spend with the media, researchers are interested in the role that the media play in children’s development and mental health. Recent evidence indicates that television viewing displaces one-on-one communication with parents and caregivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0093650211401376">Christakis et al., 2009</xref>). For example, one small laboratory-based study found that parents interacted less with their children when the television set was turned on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0093650211401376">Tanimura, Okuma, &amp; Kyoshima, 2007</xref>). Researchers argue that not only are these interactions crucial to children’s language development, but screen time is associated with less opportunities for children to engage in activities that have been shown to nurture self-esteem such as reading, athletics, and hobbies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093650211401376">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The extant research that has focused on the impact of the media on children’s health has focused on body image and eating disorders. Indeed, content analyses demonstrate that females in the media are growing thinner over time (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0093650211401376">Spitzer, Henderson, &amp; Zivian, 1999</xref>) and are underweight compared to females in the U.S. population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093650211401376">Greenberg, Eastin, Hofschire, Lachlan, &amp; Brownell, 2003</xref>). Research also supports that girl’s exposure to these images results in lower body satisfaction in the long term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0093650211401376">Harrison &amp; Hefner, 2006</xref>). Moreover, boys are not immune to these effects. Like female bodies, content analyses have shown that males in the media are underweight compared to the U.S. population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093650211401376">Greenberg, et al., 2003</xref>) and that exposure to media featuring the muscular male body can result in an increase in depression and muscle dissatisfaction among boys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0093650211401376">Harrison &amp; Bond, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet the focus on body satisfaction, or appearance esteem, ignores the notion that self-esteem is a multidimensional construct. Global self-esteem includes cognitive, social, and physical appearance dimensions that combine to create an overall self-evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0093650211401376">Sahlstein &amp; Allen, 2002</xref>). Given the media’s effect on physical appearance, it seems reasonable to presume that the media influence these other dimensions of self-esteem as well. Undeniably, media personalities promote more than unrealistic body ideals. The characters featured on television are also successful and powerful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0093650211401376">Signorielli, 1993</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0093650211401376">Signorielli and Kahlenberg (2001)</xref> content analyzed 11 one-week samples of prime-time television dramas between fall 1990 and spring 1998 for characters’ marital status, race, and occupations. The results revealed that White collar jobs occupied by men were overrepresented on television compared to actual U.S. labor force statistics (35% vs. 17%), leading the authors to conclude that television programs place a large emphasis on prestigious and glamorous occupations.</p>
<p>Prestigious and glamorous occupations are also associated with affluent lifestyles. Research supports that adolescents’ exposure to programs that place a large emphasis on prestige and affluence is related to their tendency to overestimate other people’s affluence. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0093650211401376">Potter (1991)</xref> found that television viewing was positively correlated with adolescents’ agreement with perceptions of the normality of affluence such as “most people have enough money to live a very good life” in his sample of youth in Grades 8 through 12. The relationship remained significant even when controlling for demographics, information processing ability, and information-seeking variables. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0093650211401376">Signorielli (1993)</xref> found that television exposure was related to adolescents’ wanting high status jobs that would earn them money but also be relatively easy and allow them to take long vacations. These images, then, may result in unrealistic assumptions about the real world. When these expectations about the real world are not realized, the evaluation may result in unhappiness and dissatisfaction with one’s life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0093650211401376">Buijzen &amp; Valkenburg, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The amount of time children spend with the media has led researchers to call for further investigation into the relationship between media exposure and global self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0093650211401376">Polce-Lynch, Myers, Kliewer, &amp; Kilmartin, 2001</xref>). Despite this call for research, little work has directly tested this relationship, particularly in the long run and with ethnically diverse samples of children. The scant research that has linked media exposure to children’s self-esteem has done so in studies where body-change strategies (e.g., lose weight, increase muscle mass) are the outcomes of interest. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0093650211401376">Ricciardelli and McCabe (2001)</xref> examined the moderating role of self-esteem in the relationship between sociocultural influences (e.g., media exposure, peer teasing, parent comments) and drive for muscularity in a sample of 587 boys aged 11 to 15. Results revealed a significant interaction, such that the relationship between media exposure and drive for muscularity was stronger for boys with low rather than high self-esteem.</p>
<p>In studies where the relationship between media exposure and self-esteem has been directly tested, few have done so with samples of children. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0093650211401376">Wiggins (1987)</xref> found no relationship between self-esteem and television use in his sample of 490 children in Grades 4 through 12. One possible explanation for this null finding is that Wiggins asked children to report the amount of television they watched during the week, but not on the weekend when they have more time to devote to television viewing. Thus, artificially low weekly viewing scores could have reduced the variance necessary to find a significant relationship. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0093650211401376">Stroman (1986)</xref> examined the relationship between television viewing and self-concepts in Black children in Grades 3 through 6. She found a positive relationship between television viewing and self-concept for girls but not for boys. However, it is challenging to compare the findings of these two studies because Stroman studied self-esteem in Black children. Thus, the limited collection of research on media exposure and children’s self-esteem has used different racial groups making generalization difficult.</p>

<title>Theoretical Approaches RegardingSelf-Esteem and Media Exposure</title>
<p>Assuming self-esteem is in fact related to media exposure, what are some theoretical explanations for this relationship? One possible mechanism is cultivation theory, which posits that people’s view of social reality is modeled by the media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0093650211401376">Gerbner, Gross, Signorielli, Morgan, &amp; Shanahan, 2002</xref>). One of the assumptions of cultivation theory is that certain common features of the television landscape pervade all forms of programming. Cultivation theory offers an explanation for how white collar jobs, the thin ideal, power, and wealth may come to be perceived as commonplace and easily achievable. In support of this theoretical model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0093650211401376">Cheung and Chan (1996)</xref> found that extensive television viewing was positively associated with the endorsement of materialistic values in their large sample of adolescents in Hong Kong. The authors reasoned that this finding was due to television’s emphasis on fine clothes, extravagant cars, and luxurious homes.</p>
<p>Cultivation analysis has been criticized for assuming that the television landscape is relatively homogenous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0093650211401376">Hawkins &amp; Pingree, 1981</xref>). Indeed, there are studies that have found that exposure to certain genres, but not television viewing overall, significantly predicted the outcome variable of interest (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0093650211401376">Shrum, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0093650211401376">Wilson, Martins, &amp; Marske, 2005</xref>). Although this is an important point to make, we would be remiss to deem that overall time spent with the media is not important. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093650211401376">Harrison (2006)</xref> addressed this very idea with her scope of self-theory. She argues that heavy television viewers allow television to displace the real-life experiences that might build self-complexity and resilience. That is, television’s messages may encourage a narrow-minded view of the self, because the time demands of a heavy television diet limit adolescents’ opportunities to take part in the real-world experiences that would otherwise broaden and add complexity to their self-definition.</p>
<p>If media messages are cultivating unrealistic expectations for the real world that result in self-esteem being affected beyond body esteem, then an adequate test of these processes should rule out alternative explanations for effects. One such explanation is that individuals who exhibit low self-esteem also suffer from lower body esteem. That is, any relationship we may find between television exposure and self-esteem may be explained by the shared variance between body esteem and self-esteem. We argue that body esteem may explain some portion of the relationship between television exposure and self-esteem but not all of it. Even when controlling for body esteem, lower self-esteem should be more pronounced among children reporting higher television exposure. Thus, we predict:</p>
<list id="list1-0093650211401376" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Television viewing will significantly predict lower self-esteem, independent of body esteem.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>A second theoretical approach that may explain a relationship between self-esteem and media exposure is social identity theory. Tajfel’s social identity theory proposes that people are motivated to maintain a positive self-concept by comparing favorable characteristics of their in-group with parallel unfavorable characteristics of the relevant outgroup (Taijfel, 1978; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0093650211401376">Turner, 1982</xref>). Individuals perceived to be similar on salient dimensions, such as gender or race/ethnicity, are identified as in-group members and those considered dissimilar are identified as outgroup members. Once these classifications have been made, comparison strategies are used to help protect the self-concept by evaluating those who are similar to themselves as <italic>better than</italic> those in the pertinent outgroup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0093650211401376">Abrams &amp; Hogg, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Research demonstrates that not only are young children able to make simple in-group/outgroup distinctions based on gender and race, but children also attach favorable evaluations to in-group members presumably to maintain their self-concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0093650211401376">Corenblum &amp; Annis, 1993</xref>). In their classic study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0093650211401376">Kuhn and colleagues (1978)</xref> found that 2-and-3-year-olds tended to attribute positive characteristics to their own sex and negative characteristics to the other. In terms of race, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093650211401376">Kowalski (2003)</xref>, assessed in-group and outgroup attitudes among a diverse sample of preschool children. As predicted, preschoolers in the study displayed a positive bias (e.g. smart, friendly, nice, clean) toward their own racial or ethnic group. Yet the sources for comparison may not be based in reality. Instead, these comparisons may be derived from the mass media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0093650211401376">Hogg, Terry, &amp; White, 1995</xref>). Given the ubiquitous nature of media in the lives of children, the potential is high for media content to influence children’s self-esteem because these messages may provide a comparative basis for positive in-group evaluations. Thus, the impact these comparisons may have on self-esteem depend on what media messages are made available.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0093650211401376">
<title>Gender Differences</title>
<p>The representation of males and females on television has been the subject of many studies over the past half century. Several studies have demonstrated that on television, men appear twice as frequently as women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0093650211401376">Signorielli, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0093650211401376">Signorielli, McLoud, &amp; Healy, 1994</xref>). This underrepresentation is exacerbated in children’s television programming, with male characters appearing up to four times more frequently in children’s Saturday morning programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0093650211401376">Calvert, 1999</xref>). When females are featured, they are typically portrayed in a stereotypical way. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0093650211401376">Thompson and Zerbinos (1997)</xref> showed that male characters were more likely than female characters to be portrayed as independent and assertive, whereas female characters were more likely than male characters to be portrayed as emotional, warm, and affectionate.</p>
<p>What kind of effect, then, will exposure to these types of portrayals have on boys’ and girls’ self-esteem? Surprisingly, there is little research that has explored the role of the media in gender differences in children’s self-esteem. However, both cultivation theory and social identity theory would predict that exposure to these images may serve to increase the self-esteem among boys. Cultivation research contends that children (especially heavy viewers) will likely adopt the belief that boys are dominant, assertive, and powerful because these are the perspectives most frequently seen on television. Social identity theory would predict that boys would use these characteristics, then, as a basis of comparison to maintain their self-concept. In contrast, we should expect that self-esteem will decrease among girls. Heavy-viewing television viewers may be more likely to believe that girls are passive, weak, and insignificant. These stereotypic media portrayals provide comparative elements that may result in a negative self-evaluation among girls. Based on cultivation and social identity theory, we predicted:</p>
<list id="list1-0093650211401376" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Television viewing will significantly predict higher boys’ self-esteem, but lower girls’ self-esteem.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0093650211401376">
<title>Racial Differences</title>
<p>The case can be made that Black youth are particularly at risk for developing low self-esteem. Cultivation theory predicts that the consequences of television exposure are most pronounced for its most frequent viewers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0093650211401376">Gerbner et al., 2002</xref>); and in fact, African American children have been found to consume more media than Whites or other minority groups (Roberts et. al., 2010). Social identity theory predicts that efforts to maintain or bolster one’s self-concept are dependent on the types of comparison that are made available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0093650211401376">Fryberg, 2003</xref>). Unfortunately for African American children, the majority of comparisons available in the television world consist of characters who are unprofessional and provocatively dressed compared to White counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093650211401376">Mastro &amp; Greenberg, 2000</xref>). In addition, children who watch television news will witness a world where Blacks are more likely to be shown as perpetrators of crime than Whites (Dixon &amp; Linz, 2000). Thus, frequent exposure to stereotypical images that portray Blacks as unprofessional and criminal may lead viewers to believe that these are true characteristics of Blacks in the real world. In this way, it is believed that frequent media use may negatively influence the evaluations among African American youth, thereby leading to lower self-esteem.</p>
<p>Despite this concern, evidence to support low self-esteem among African Americans is limited. Although African American youth watch more television, Black youth report higher self-esteem than non-Black youth. In their meta-analytic synthesis of 261 studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0093650211401376">Gray-Little and Hafdahl (2000)</xref> found higher self-esteem scores for Black children, teens, and young adults than for White participants. An explanation for this finding could be that African Americans do not turn to the larger White society, and mainstream media, as their reference points, but turn instead to the Black community as their source of support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0093650211401376">Gray-Little &amp; Hafdahl, 2000</xref>). By drawing mostly in-group comparisons and by attributing negative feedback to prejudice against the group (not the self), African Americans may buffer their self-esteem from the media’s often one-dimensional images. Yet this explanation does not account for the mix of positive and null relationships reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0093650211401376">Stroman, 1986</xref>). In accord, our first research question asks:</p>
<list id="list1-0093650211401376" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1</italic>: Is there a racial difference in the relationship between television exposure and subsequent self-esteem?</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0093650211401376">
<title>Sex, Race, and Television Exposure?</title>
<p>Hypothesis 2 and Research Question 1 concern whether gender and race moderate the relationship between television exposure and self-esteem. Considering these two variables, we extend our inquiry by investigating whether sex and race of the child modifies the extent to which television exposure influences self-esteem. Reviewing previous studies that have examined sex and race differences in self-esteem reveals that they did not look at diverse samples together, calling into question the need for the present study. Thus, the final research question asks:</p>

<p>In summary, available evidence suggests that a relationship between television exposure and self-esteem may exist among young children of both genders. What is still unclear is the causal direction of this relationship and whether the same relationship exists among African Americans. Although a longitudinal design does not provide an airtight demonstration of causality, it goes much further than cross-sectional designs toward demonstrating causality by fulfilling the temporal-order requirement of causal order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0093650211401376">Davis, 1985</xref>). A longitudinal design also allows for the control of key variables that could put research participants at risk for lowered self-esteem independent of their television exposure, including baseline self-esteem and baseline body satisfaction.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section8-0093650211401376">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>A sample of elementary school children participated in a multiyear panel study in schools situated in three lower-middle to upper middle-class communities in the Midwestern United States. Because one of the goals of the study was to test race as a moderator, schools were preselected on the basis of racial diversity. The first two waves of data collection, which took place 1 year apart, were the focus of analysis. Thirty-four participants were unable or unwilling to report their race/ethnicity; of those who did report their race/ethnicity, the majority identified themselves as Black or African American (<italic>N</italic> = 235), followed by White or European American (<italic>N</italic> = 194); due to the small number of participants reporting a race other than White or Black, we chose to focus only on White and Black participants in our analyses (<italic>N</italic> = 429). The number of girls who participated in both waves was 223 and the number of boys who participated in both waves was 206. At baseline, 136(28%) were second graders, 162 (37%) were third graders, and 131 (31%) were fourth graders. Ages ranged from 7 to 12 (<italic>M</italic> = 8.72, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.02) at baseline to 8 to 13 (<italic>M</italic> = 9.75, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.03) at follow-up.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0093650211401376">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>All participants obtained parental consent and signed their own assent forms at the start of testing. Trained male and female undergraduate research assistants administered the questionnaires to groups of two to five boys and girls (with female assistants working with the girls and male assistants working with the boys), separated by gender and separated from one another by barriers so their responses would remain private. The research assistant sat opposite each group of children and read each item out loud, pointing to the questionnaire to indicate the appropriate item along with the response options. To reduce primacy and recency effects, the order of response options was alternated across questionnaires, and <italic>t</italic> tests were used to compare responses across the different questionnaire versions. There were no effects of order. Participants received self-esteem and body satisfaction measures first, followed by television exposure measures, followed by demographic measures. When they finished completing their questionnaires, children received a novelty pencil in thanks for their participation and were escorted back to their classrooms. The same procedure was followed for both baseline and follow-up questionnaires.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section11-0093650211401376">
<title>Television exposure</title>
<p>We measured television exposure according to the procedure outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093650211401376">Harrison (2000)</xref>. Participants were asked to report how many hours of television they watched the preceding weekday (a) in the morning before school, (b) during school, (c) after school before dinner, and (d) after dinner before bed. Participants were then asked how many hours of television they watched on a typical Saturday and Sunday (a) in the morning before lunch, (b) in the afternoon before dinner, and (c) after dinner before bed. For each item, the response options ranged from 0 to 5 hours. A weekly television viewing index was created by multiplying the number of hours reported for the preceding weekday by 5 and adding it to the number of Saturday and Sunday hours. A histogram of the television viewing variables revealed that the distributions were normal until the 85-hour point (approximately 12 hours of viewing per day), after which it was positively skewed, with 3 participants reporting viewing an average of more than 15 hours per day. Due to the strong possibility that their responses to the rest of the measures would be unreliable, the participants who reported viewing an average of more than 85 hours of television per week at either wave of data collection were dropped from further analyses, which reduced the sample to <italic>N</italic> = 396.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0093650211401376">
<title>Self-esteem</title>
<p>Participants completed the 11-item Lawrence Self-Esteem Questionnaire (LSEQ, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0093650211401376">Lawrence, 1981</xref>) as a measure of overall feeling of self-worth (i.e., global self-esteem). This scale is based on the definition that self-esteem is the “the child’s affective evaluation of the sum total of his or her characteristics both mental and physical” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0093650211401376">Lawrence, 1981</xref>, p. 246). This scale has been validated for children in this age group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0093650211401376">Hart, 1985</xref>) and has been included in several large-scale studies with children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0093650211401376">Viner &amp; Cole, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0093650211401376">Williams &amp; Currie, 2000</xref>). This is an ideal measure to use for two reasons. First, the instrument includes several items to assess the behavior of the child and the child’s perceptions of others concerning their behavior which are important indicators of self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0093650211401376">Coopersmith, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0093650211401376">Harter, 1999</xref>). Moreover, the measure does not contain items that relate to body shape or body satisfaction, allowing us to examine the relationship between television viewing and self-esteem independently of body esteem. Second, when measures are developed for young children, a number of difficulties are encountered, such as their cognitive ability, language development, and short attention spans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0093650211401376">Hughes, 1984</xref>). Thus, the LSEQ is ideal because the questions and the response items are appropriate for the developmental level of the children in this study. Sample items include “When you want to tell a teacher something, do you usually feel foolish?” and “Are there lots of things about yourself you would like to change?” Response options are: 0 (<italic>never</italic>), 1 (<italic>not sure</italic>), and 2 (<italic>always</italic>). Responses to these questions were reverse coded such that higher scores were indicative of higher self-esteem. Scale reliability estimates were α = .71 at baseline and α = .79 at follow-up. The reliability estimates are consistent with other samples of the same age (α = .76, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0093650211401376">Williams &amp; Currie, 2000</xref>) and ethnicity (α = .70, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093650211401376">Martins, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0093650211401376">
<title>Race/ethnicity and gender</title>
<p>On the last page of the questionnaire, participants were asked to report their race/ethnicity and their gender. The race/ethnicity question was open ended. Response options were recorded by the research assistant and later coded according to U.S. census categories. In cases where multiple ethnicities were listed (e.g., “I am Black and White”) the non-White category was given preference to avoid undercounting participants of color.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0093650211401376">
<title>Control variables</title>
<p>The <italic>age of the child</italic> was used as a covariate in these analyses. We chose to control for age because the distribution of ages across the sample was relatively narrow, making meaningful developmental predictions with regard to age differences difficult.</p>
<p>Recall that global self-esteem, not just body esteem, is of concern here. Because one could argue that any relationship we may find between television exposure and self-esteem may be explained by the shared variance between body esteem and self-esteem, body esteem must be controlled to assess whether television exposure predicts global self-esteem above and beyond body perceptions. Therefore, <italic>satisfaction with perceived body shape</italic> was measured and used as a control variable. Perceived body shape was measured by administering a pictorial scale featuring line drawings of prepubescent children, with boys viewing a scale of male figures and girls viewing a scale with female figures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0093650211401376">Tiggemann &amp; Wilson-Barrett, 1998</xref>). Each scale featured seven bodies ranging from markedly thin to markedly fat. We measured participants’ perceived body shape by showing them the child figure drawings and directing them to “Circle the picture that shows how YOU look.” Next, we asked participants to “Circle the picture that shows how you WANT to look.” Satisfaction with perceived body shape was calculated as the ideal minus the current figure rating. Thus, negative scores indicated a desire to be thinner. Good test-retest reliability has been found for such figure-rating scales with young children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0093650211401376">Collins, 1991</xref>).</p>

<title>Preliminary Analyses</title>
<p>Preliminary analyses tested for attrition biases that might have compromised the generalizibility of the findings. The attrition rate of White and Black children in this study was 15% and was primarily due to students moving out of the school district or absenteeism. Participants who provided complete data did not differ significantly from those who did not on any of the variables assessed in Wave 1.</p>

In particular, the data revealed that higher scores on the self-esteem measure were significantly correlated with hours of television watched per week for all children in both waves. At baseline, self-esteem was significantly correlated with body satisfaction, but this finding was not significant at follow-up.</p>

<title>Hypothesis and Research Questions</title>
<p>To test our hypotheses and answer our research questions, we conducted a hierarchical multiple regression analysis. Self-esteem assessed at the baseline was entered on Step 1. Control variables were entered on Step 2: age, baseline body esteem, and Time 2 TV viewing; Time 1 TV viewing, race, and gender were entered on Step 3; interaction terms for Time 1 TV viewing by race, Time 1 TV viewing by gender, and race by gender were entered on Step 4; and the three-way interaction term representing the Time 1 TV viewing by race by gender was entered on the last step. Our outcome of interest was children’s self-esteem at follow-up. To reduce problems with multicollinearity, continuous predictor variables were mean centered prior to creating the polynomial term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0093650211401376">Aiken &amp; West, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>The results of the analysis revealed that Time 1 self-esteem was a marginal predictor of Time 2 self-esteem scores. Baseline self-esteem accounted for 9% of the variance in children’s self-esteem at follow-up, <italic>F</italic><sub>change</sub>(1, 394) = 3.43, <italic>p</italic> = .06. The control variables, as a set, did not significantly account for additional variance in children’s self-esteem, <italic>F</italic><sub>change</sub>(1, 391) = .19, <italic>p</italic> = <italic>ns</italic>. Baseline television viewing failed to predict self-esteem at follow-up (β = .00, <italic>t</italic> = 1.30, <italic>p</italic> = <italic>ns</italic>). The models containing the interaction terms also failed to account for additional variance in children’s self-esteem at follow-up.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0093650211401376">Cohen, Cohen, Aiken, and West (2003)</xref> acknowledge that the analysis proposed above is often the “simplest” model for examining the relationship between a given <italic>X</italic> and <italic>Y</italic> in two-wave longitudinal data sets. This model, however, raises the question as to what the optimal interval should be for examining causal effects of one variable on another. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093650211401376">McArdle and Woodcock (1997)</xref> point out, consideration of the timing of effects is a theoretical task rarely addressed in the social sciences. Consequently, if the effects of baseline television viewing on self-esteem take place over a much shorter period of time than is represented by the interval between study waves, then <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0093650211401376">Cohen et al. (2003)</xref> caution that employing <italic>X1</italic>, (baseline television viewing in this case) may “lead to a serious underestimate of its impact” (p. 573). Under these circumstances, then, using <italic>X2</italic> (Time 2 TV viewing) in predicting self-esteem at follow-up may provide a truer estimate of the longitudinal impact of television viewing on self-esteem.</p>
<p>Given the null findings reported above, it appears as though we may have such a circumstance. In accord with Cohen and colleagues’ (2003) recommendation, we decided to employ a “quick acting effects approach” (p. 573) where Time 2 television viewing was used to predict Time 2 self-esteem.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0093650211401376">1</xref></sup> Thus, the second hierarchical regression analysis included self-esteem at the baseline on Step 1; age, baseline body esteem, and baseline TV exposure were entered as covariates on Step 2; Time 2 TV viewing, race, and gender were entered on Step 3; interaction terms for Time 2 TV viewing by race, Time 2 TV viewing by gender, and race by gender were entered on Step 4; and the three-way interaction term representing Time 2 TV viewing by race by gender was entered on the fifth step.</p>
<p>The results of the regression analysis are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0093650211401376">Table 4</xref>. As can be seen, Time 1 self-esteem was a marginal predictor of Time 2 self-esteem scores. Baseline self-esteem accounted for 9% of the variance in children’s self-esteem at follow-up, <italic>F</italic><sub>change</sub>(1, 394) = 3.43, <italic>p</italic> = .06. The covariates (Step 2), as a set, did not significantly predict children’s self-esteem. The predictor variables entered on Step 3 collectively accounted for an additional 2% of the variance in children’s self- esteem, <italic>F</italic><sub>change</sub>(1, 388) = 2.81, <italic>p</italic> = .04. In particular, Time 2 television viewing was negatively related to children’s self-esteem. The two-way interactions between Time 2 TV viewing by race, Time 2 TV viewing by gender, and gender by race approached significance, <italic>F</italic><sub>change</sub>(1, 385) = 2.20, <italic>p</italic> = .06. The contribution of the three-way interaction between television viewing, sex, and race (Step 5) was statistically significant, <italic>F</italic><sub>change</sub>(1, 384) = 5.97, <italic>p</italic> = .01 explaining an additional 2% of the variance. The entire model explained 25% of the variance in children’s follow-up self-esteem scores.</p>

<p>Hypothesis 2 predicted that television exposure would significantly predict higher self-esteem among boys, but lower self-esteem among girls. In order to fully verify the form of the significant two-way interaction between Time 2 TV viewing and gender as reported above, we computed a simple slopes analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0093650211401376">Aiken &amp; West, 1991</xref>). The analysis revealed a disordinal interaction, such that Time 2 television viewing was negatively related to girls’ self-esteem (β = −.20, <italic>p</italic> = .01), but not significantly related to boys’ self-esteem scores (β = .00, <italic>p</italic> = <italic>ns</italic>).</p>
<p>Our first research question asked if there was a racial difference in the relationship between television exposure and subsequent self-esteem. Another simple slopes analysis was computed to examine the form of the significant two-way interaction between Time 2 television viewing and race. The analysis revealed another disordinal interaction, such that Time 2 television viewing was negatively related to Black children’s self-esteem (β = −.23, <italic>p</italic> = .00) but not significantly related to White children’s self-esteem scores (β = .10, <italic>p</italic> = <italic>ns</italic>).</p>
<p>Our last research question asked if gender and race would moderate the relationship between television exposure and children’s self-esteem. A simple slopes analysis was conducted to examine the form of the significant three-way interaction as reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0093650211401376">Table 4</xref>. The analysis revealed that Time 2 television viewing significantly predicted decreased self-esteem in White girls (β = −.30, <italic>p</italic> = .05), Black girls (β = −.35, <italic>p</italic> = .01) and Black boys (β = −.26, <italic>p</italic> = .04). In contrast, Time 2 television viewing predicted <italic>increased</italic> self-esteem in White boys (β = .38, <italic>p</italic> = .01). Thus, our analyses reveal that television viewing significantly predicts children’s self-esteem (Hypothesis 1), but this relationship is dependent upon children’s gender (Hypothesis 2) and race (Research Questions 2 and 3).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We sought to determine whether changes in television use would be associated with self-esteem measured 1 year later in a sample of White and Black boys and girls. We found that television exposure predicted a decrease in self-esteem for all children except White boys. A look at the effect size, as estimated by the change in <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>, points to the fact that an television viewing is a weak-to-moderate predictor of lowered self-esteem for White girls, Black girls, and Black boys, and a weak-to-moderate predictor of self-esteem in White Boys.</p>
<p>Why did television exposure predict a decrease in self-esteem among all children except White boys? There are at least three potential explanations for this pattern. First, the majority of television content serves to reinforce both gender-role and racial stereotypes (Herrett-Skjellum &amp; Allen, 1995). Indeed, males are portrayed as powerful, strong, and rational whereas females are portrayed as frail, emotional, and sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0093650211401376">Thompson &amp; Zerbinos, 1997</xref>). Black male characters are disproportionately shown as buffoons, or as menacing and unruly youths, and Black female characters are typically shown as exotic and sexually available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093650211401376">Marable, 1996</xref>). The media comparisons made available for White boys, therefore, are quite positive in nature. Social identity theory would predict that exposure to these messages serve to bolster the self-concept of White boys because their basis for comparison reveals that prestige, power, and wealth are commonplace and easily achievable for White males on television. Indeed, research demonstrates that upward comparisons can actually be beneficial to people when they are led to believe that attainment of the depicted achievements is possible (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0093650211401376">Suls, Martin, &amp; Wheeler, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>A second possible explanation concerns the nature of the portrayal of White female characters and African American characters on television. Returning to the idea that television serves to reinforce gender and racial stereotypes, social identity theory would predict that White girls and Black children are using these messages as a basis for self-evaluation that, in turn, negatively impact their self-esteem. Given that media messages about White girls and Black children are often negative, the next question to ask is why would children use these messages as a basis of comparison? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0093650211401376">Milkie (1999)</xref> argues that viewers struggle to avoid self-evaluations with media messages because the mass media alter societal ideas about what is normative. If children believe that others (e.g., peers, family) use such messages to evaluate them, White girls and Black children cannot simply ignore mass media messages as a comparative referent. Future research should not only continue to examine the kinds of messages children are extracting from the mass media, but also examine what role peer and family networks share in mitigating or exacerbating comparisons to these messages and subsequent impact these comparisons have on self-esteem.</p>
<p>A third explanation why White girls and Black children in this sample reported lower self-esteem could be due to the fact that television viewing is displacing real-life experiences that might build self-esteem. In support of this idea, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093650211401376">Harrison (2006)</xref> found that children who watched more than 20 hours of television per week reported significantly fewer unique self-descriptors than children who watched less than 20 hours. She argued that heavy television viewing predicted a drop in self-complexity because there is less variance in the content of available media messages, and television does not depict the diversity found in real life. If we relate these findings to self-esteem, then, children who are not doing other things besides watching television cannot help but compare themselves to what they see on the screen. However, children who watch less and interact more, are able to discover other things about themselves (e.g., fit, funny) that they might not have discovered if they were watching television. Of course, this theory does not explain the increase in self-esteem for White boys. Clearly, the relationship between television exposure and children’s self-complexity is an area ripe for future research.</p>
<sec id="section20-0093650211401376">
<title>Limitations, Strengths, and Future Directions</title>
<p>Overall, our findings support television consumption has an impact on children’s self-esteem, at least in the short term. Yet an alternative explanation for the findings reported here could be due to the specific content to which the children were exposed. In particular, the Black participants in this sample could be watching programming which exacerbates negative portrayals of African Americans. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0093650211401376">Ward (2004)</xref> examined the impact of multiple forms of media use (e.g., exposure to music videos, sports, Black-oriented television) on self-esteem and racial self-esteem among 156 African American high school students. She found that exposure to music videos, but not exposure to prime-time television overall, predicted lower self-esteem and racial self-esteem among both genders. Music videos often rely on shortcuts and cultural stereotypes because they are a story-telling format with little time to devote to deep characterizations; thus, it is no surprise that Ward found that music videos were a predictor of low self-esteem. A limitation to this study, then, is that genre distinctions were not assessed. Nonetheless, future research should continue to measure overall time spent with television to assess whether television viewing is displacing key activities and interactions that would serve to nurture children’s self-esteem.</p>
<p>In spite of this key limitation, our study does possess the strength of a longitudinal design. The data suggest that television exposure positively predicts children’s self-esteem, independent of age, initial self-esteem, and body satisfaction. Because longitudinal panel studies are not experiments, however, causal claims must be considered with caution. It could be argued, for instance, that individuals with low self-esteem seek out media consumption in an effort to feel better about themselves or to take their minds off of their problems. If that were the case here, self-esteem assessed in Wave 2 should predict television viewing during the same time period. We conducted regression analyses to test this possibility, and found that controlling for age, body satisfaction, and baseline television exposure, self-esteem assessed in Wave 2 did not predict television viewing. The fact that self-esteem did not predict television viewing for the race/gender subgroups does not negate the possibility of a reciprocal causal relationship; it merely suggests that for these children, reciprocation between television exposure and self-esteem does not <italic>yet</italic> play a key role. We may not see a reciprocal relationship for all children until they mature and form their identities.</p>
<p>Despite its limitations this study makes several unique contributions to the literature on media exposure and self-esteem among children. First, the use of a racially diverse sample allowed for investigation of potential racial differences. Second, the use of a global self-esteem measure allowed us to assess the impact of the media on other dimensions of self-esteem (e.g., cognitive, social) independent of body esteem. Third, the use of a longitudinal design extends existing cross-sectional research linking media exposure with self-esteem in children. In particular, our initial analysis assumed that optimal interval for examining the effect of television viewing on children’s self-esteem would be 1 year. However, our results show that this time span may be inappropriate. Given elementary school children’s rate of development, messages and habits from a year ago may have exerted their impact on self-perceptions, and those effects have gone. Thus, future research should continue to examine the dynamic nature of self-esteem in young children using time frames shorter than 1 year.</p>
