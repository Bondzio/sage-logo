<p>Milly Buonanno, <italic>Italian TV Drama and Beyond: Stories from the Soil, Stories from the Sea</italic>, Intellect: Bristol and Chicago, 2012; 264 pp.: £24.95</p>
<p>Drama programming on Italian television is one of those areas of media output which are widely and routinely ignored by media scholars. The term ‘invisible television’ has been coined for such programming, regardless of the national context in which it is applied. Conscious of this and the various reasons for it, Milly Buonanno seeks in this book to establish the cultural significance of Italian TV drama, identify its distinctive features, and show why it is a matter of broad trans-local interest. The book, in fact, does more than this, for its first half offers an important contribution to the history of Italian broadcasting. Buonanno traces the historical development of <italic>sceneggiato</italic> from the mid-1950s to the mid-1990s, exploring in turn how it re-enacted major historical events of Italian history for viewers. She discusses also the consequences of the great influx of American imports (led by <italic>Dallas</italic>) following the development of commercial broadcasting in the 1970s and 1980s, and offers two case studies: one of <italic>La Piovra</italic>, which concerned the Mafia, and one of <italic>Un Porto al Sole</italic>, the first Italian soap opera. The second half of the book is devoted to contemporary drama, examining four particular genres: the police drama, the Mafia story, biopics and period drama, the latter involving not only the dramatic reconstruction of the past but also the politics of memory and identity. This is an impressive book. It breaks new ground and, while focusing on one particular nation’s television storytelling, is cross-national in scope, attending to the ways in which Italian TV drama has developed and grown through the interaction of domestic and foreign elements. It also provides a salutary counterbalance to the predominance of attention paid to British and American television drama in media scholarship. Milly Buonanno has written an important contribution to European television studies.</p>
<p>John Hartley and Kelly McWilliam (eds), <italic>Story Circle: Digital Storytelling Around the World</italic>, Wiley-Blackwell: Chichester, 2009; 307 pp.: £16.99</p>
<p>Typical of story circles as a community media practice is, on the one hand, the central ideological commitment of empowerment by free expression and promotion of solidarity, and on the other the continuation of the ‘bardic’ tradition originating before the 14th century in Wales. The combination of a social emancipatory and literary tradition is presented here as the framework of workshops all over the world in which storytelling is applied. In the second chapter one of the editors, John Hartley, describes the history of the bardic traditions. By enumerating what bards and minstrels and television have in common, he concludes that the historical ‘bardic function’ of the television is to ‘textualize the world meaningfully for a given language community’ (p. 22). Both bards and television are professionalized and exclude outsiders (the public) from creative participation. That’s why digital technologies can give a new interpretation to this bardic function and the challenge is now to organize the myriad voices of amateurs to ‘propagate coherent sense across social boundaries, among different demographics and throughout social hierarchies’ (p. 38). The question is: how much popularity can professionalism stand and vice versa? In the third, (introductory) chapter the other editor, Kelly McWilliam, sums up the practices of story circles around the world: practices in educational institutions, the story circles of communities (historical, aspiration, recuperative), of online cultural institutions and origination from governmental, business and religious hosts. The greater part of the book (the other 17 chapters) is devoted to a description of those practices by the founders. The book is written well and seems very useful for practitioners, but there is no place for further theoretical and empirical reflection about the central aims of the story circles. For some readers it may be hard to work out the meanings of abbreviations and other insider language. That can be an obstacle to promoting the story circles internationally – a strategy to disperse them outside the Anglo-Saxon world (outside universities) would be advisable.</p>
<p>Janey Gordon, <italic>Community Radio in the Twenty-First Century</italic>, Peter Lang: Oxford, Bern, Berlin, Bruxelles, Frankfurt am Main, New York and Wien, 2012; 403 pp.: £45.00</p>
<p>Communities are multifold, not being confined only to a specific geographical locality, but also becoming manifest through a distinct set of interests or experiences, a particular language or an integrating orientation. Radio organized at a community level may appeal to any of these factors, helping certain groups to come together, communicate with each other, and celebrate their cultures. In this book, Janey Gordon has brought together a wide-ranging collection of papers which attend to community radio or some aspect of it. She divides it into three sections. The first of these is devoted to activism and community radio. The section shows how activism has been involved with community radio in Britain, the USA, Uruguay, the Philippines and Bangladesh, with a final chapter looking at the ways in which new media technologies can be used by community radio stations in promoting various forms of activism. The second part of the book deals with various theoretical concerns raised by community radio, such as its relation to ‘mass’ media, the concept of community as applied to radio, the role of the citizen and alternative journalism, music-based radio and public service values. The final section offers a series of case studies from around the world, covering such countries as Laos and China, Hungary, South Africa, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. As these summary details make clear, this collection provides abundant evidence of the varied contributions community radio makes to media landscapes across the globe. Many of the contributors have first-hand experience of community radio and their chapters show the many roles radio can have in producing, sustaining and stimulating communities of one kind or another.</p>
<p>Heather Anderson, <italic>Raising the Civil Dead: Prisoners and Community Radio</italic>, Peter Lang: Oxford, Bern, Berlin, Bruxelles, Frankfurt am Main, New York and Wien, 2012; 275 pp.: £48.00</p>
<p>Those who have never experienced incarceration are unlikely to have heard of prisoners’ radio. Heather Anderson seeks to bring such programming to wider awareness, looking at both producers and consumers as active agents. She has been involved in community radio since the early 1990s, and especially with the Brisbane station, 4ZzZ. Anderson distinguishes between three types of prisoners’ radio: those that mainly play requests and dedications, those that mainly focus on the provision of information on prison issues and those which are a hybrid of the two. She offers four detailed case studies of specific programmes: Locked In at 4ZzZ, Beyond the Bars at 3CR, Melbourne, Stark Ravers at Coop Radio, Vancouver, and Prisoners’ Justice day programming at CKUT, Montreal. These come in the second half of the book, and are preceded by the development of a theoretical framework for investigating prisoners’ radio as a distinct genre of programming. Anderson certainly fills a gap. The book contributes much that is of interest in developing a broader understanding of this particular broadcast form of citizens’ media and civic responsibility.</p>
<p>Helmut Anheier and Yudhishthir Raj Isar (eds), <italic>Cultural Expression, Creativity and Innovation</italic>, Sage: Los Angeles, London, New Delhi, Singapore and Washington, DC, 2010; 488 pp.: £29.99</p>
<p>There have been two previous volumes in Sage’s Cultures and Globalization series, addressing the many tensions and conflicts in culture as a way of life or cradle of identity, and the global imbalances and divides in cultural markets. The third volume turns to the relations between globalization, cultural expression and creativity. Creativity has increasingly become coupled with notions of innovation in recent years, often enough with both terms being used as bland buzzwords by people on the make, as well as in various promotional, managerial and self-help discourses. To note the draining away and pollution of conceptual sense in such developments is not to call for a return to the individualistic and exclusive aesthetic values once associated with creativity. These have been effectively critiqued and overtaken by approaches which emphasize the social and collective processes in which creative practices occur. That is the emphasis given in this volume, and due caution is also taken to proceed in awareness of the semantic baggage which creativity and innovation now carry. The essays it contains are wide-ranging, bringing in not only broad theoretical issues but also more specific areas of application, such as philanthropy, migration and exile, contemporary design in the Arab world, intellectual property rights, fashion and ethics. As were the two earlier volumes, the second half of the book is devoted to cultural indicator suites. These offer a wealth of empirical data on the relations between globalization and cultural change. The book as a whole is a welcome addition to the series, providing as it does such an array of topics and discussions. It is a significant contribution to the sociology of culture and the arts.</p>
<p>Gary Genosko, <italic>Remodelling Communication: From WWII to the WWW</italic>, University of Toronto Press: Toronto, Buffalo and London, 2012; 161 pp.: £40.00</p>
<p>The study of communications and culture has long involved the use of models, yet they haven’t been much discussed, at least in the mainstream academic literature associated with such study. Denis McQuail and Sven Windahl wrote an overview of communication models that was published in the early 1980s. This remains useful, but there have been various developments since then, and at least partly because of that, there is a need for a new look at the many models which pervade communication studies. This is what Gary Genosko provides, though inevitably he has to be selective, focusing more on thinking afresh about some of the more well-known models of communication and culture. He begins with a restitution of the Shannon and Weaver model of the immediate postwar period, a model most of all applicable to the 19th-century communications technology of telegraphy, and then turns to Stuart Hall’s encoding/decoding model (strangely excluded from consideration by McQuail and Windahl) and Roman Jakobson’s model of communicative functions. A mid-book chapter focuses on Baudrillard’s comments on modelling communication in his essay ‘Requiem for the Media’, which then leads into discussion of the phatic function in Jakobson’s model. This is followed by Eco’s semiotic modelling of communication within and across multiple contexts, and the idea of aberrant decoding as he develops it. The final main chapter moves from George Gerbner to Félix Guattari, from transmission theory to the critique of any unified model and suspicion about communication as such. Although the book as a whole lacks to some extent in coherence and connection, and suffers at times from rather vague and gestural expression, Genosko has produced an interesting intellectual revisiting of communication models.</p>
<p>Patrizia di Bello, Colette Wilson and Shamoon Zamir, <italic>The Photobook: From Talbot to Ruscha and Beyond</italic>, IB Tauris: London and New York, 2012; 236 pp.: £59.50</p>
<p>The photobook has been relatively neglected by historians of photography, with only scattered studies having appeared. Recently this has begun to change, and the collection of essays represented here is indicative of the awakening of a broader interest. It offers close readings of individual photobooks, exploring various ways of understanding their interaction of text and image. The combinatory effects achieved through this interaction in the photobook is a common preoccupation among all the contributors to the book, yet the particular cases chosen for discussion are broad and heterogeneous. There are chapters on Fox Talbot’s <italic>Sun Pictures in Scotland</italic> (1845); the 20 volumes of ethnographic text and photographic images that comprise <italic>The North American Indian</italic> (1907–1930); the work of Emil Otto Hoppé and Walker Evans; Brassai’s <italic>The Sculptures of Picasso</italic> (1949); Ed Ruscha’s <italic>Twentysix Gasoline Stations</italic> (1962); the development from exhibition catalogue to photobook; <italic>One Day for Life</italic> (1987); <italic>Ein Gespenstverlässt Europa (A Spectre is Leaving Europe</italic>) by Heiner Müller and Sibylle Bergemann (1990); <italic>Alexandrie l’Égyptienne</italic> by Carlos Freire and Robert Solé (1998); Eduardo Gageiro’s <italic>Lisboa No Cais da Memória</italic> (2003); and Orhan Pamuk’s <italic>Istanbul: Memories of a City</italic> (2005). As this itemizing of chapter topics should indicate, the three editors have put together a collection that highlights the photobook in all its manifestations. The book as a whole deals with the diverse ways in which meaning is created and shaped in the photobook, and attends to the visual, tactile and interactive experiences it offers. It is an admirable addition to photographic historiography.</p>
<p>Lee Rainie and Barry Wellman, <italic>Networked: The New Social Operating System</italic>, The MIT Press: Cambridge, MA and London, 2012; 358 pp.: £20.95</p>
<p>Lee Rainie and Barry Wellman are concerned in this book with how the internet and mobile phones have been central to the reorganization and reorientation of social networks. They are now more expansive and more diverse than ever before. Their first section deals with what they call the ‘triple revolution’: a revolution in social networks, a revolution in the personalized internet and a revolution involving always-available mobile connectivity. They devote a chapter to each of these hyperbolically termed developments. Rainie and Wellman regard being networked as being able to take advantage of a range of opportunities for acquiring information and knowledge, solving problems, making decisions and getting involved with other people. They see all this as part of a ‘new social operating system’ in which networked individualism enables us to be who we are without the tight restrictions of closed communities. We can now expand our personal relationships and make work less hierarchical and more cooperative. In other words, everything is getting better and better. It makes you wonder how people made anything of their lives prior to this ‘triple revolution’, beset as they were by impoverished resources and disabling constraints. Now of course one may nod at the various advances and opportunities they enumerate throughout the book, but the chipper perspective they adopt becomes pervasive and leads to a loss of balance in the book. They also only pay lip-service to the problem of technological determinism. They acknowledge right at the outset that ‘technology does not determine human behavior; humans determine how technologies are used’ (p. ix), but all too often they fall into the facile usage of a personified ‘they’ when talking about technologies, so that we’re told ‘they’ reshape this, or ‘they’ reconfigure that. The term ‘technological determinism’ is used only twice in the book, only one appearance of which is indexed. There is no serious engagement with the concept of the complex issues which it raises. This is a shame, for there is much that is engaging in the book. It has many points of interest. But it is also too in awe of its own subject, and at times almost begins to read like a manual for the social operating system it describes. It needs to be more sociologically and historically engaged, and look beyond its own techno-centredness.</p>
<p>Barbara Czarniawska, <italic>Cyberfactories: How News Agencies Produce News</italic>, Edward Elgar: Cheltenham and Northampton, MA, 2011; 229 pp.: £65.00</p>
<p>Much of the news we read or hear comes from news agencies which are responsible not only for disseminating a huge amount of news data, but also for filtering it from sources and mediating it to journalists and news organizations. How is this inflow and outflow managed? That is the key question addressed by Barbara Czarniawska in this book. The book is based on fieldwork in three news agencies: Swedish TT, Italian ANSA and Reuters, with the data deriving mainly from diary-interviews with journalists working in these organizations. Three main chapters are devoted to each of these news agencies. They cover a typical working day (TT), the function of meetings in news production (ANSA) and the ‘tooling’ of the product (Reuters). The book highlights the increasing cybernization (the growing role of machines in news production) and cyborgization (the growing reliance of people on machines). The anticipated and unanticipated future will in many ways lie in the combination of these processes (mainly the unanticipated). The book will be of great interest to anyone researching or teaching news studies. It will help bring news agencies more centrally into the picture, not simply as ‘gatekeepers’ but rather as news producers in their own right.</p>
<p>Isabela Fairclough and Norman Fairclough, <italic>Political Discourse Analysis: A Method for Advanced Students</italic>, Routledge: London and New York, 2012; 266 pp.: £22.99</p>
<p>Norman Fairclough is internationally renowned for his work in developing critical discourse analysis (CDA). He is joined in this book by his partner, who has also written previously on discourse analysis and argumentation theory. Here they view political discourse very much as a form of argumentation. The examples they work on in the book are all taken from political responses to the economic debacle that has ensued following the credit crunch and post-2007 global financial crisis. Their analysis of these examples focuses on the practical argumentation involved, looking at how discourses provide agents with reasons for action. Early in the book they attend to the nature of political discourse and what differentiates it from other kinds of discourse; outline their approach to practical reasoning; engaging with existing accounts in argumentation theory and philosophy; and discuss how CDA can be brought together with the analysis and evaluation of arguments. It is in the second part of the book that they attend specifically to the economic and financial crisis, looking at the British pre-budget and budget reports over the period of the crisis, at part of the public debate over bankers’ bonuses, and at the debate in the House of Commons over the Government’s proposal to raise university tuition fees. This is a well-organized book, its writing accessible but rigorous and thorough, and its approach synthesizing CDA and the analysis of practical argumentation an important advance in the study of political discourse.</p>
<p>Emile G McAnany, <italic>Saving the World: A Brief History of Communication for Development and Social Change</italic>, University of Illinois Press: Urbana, Chicago and Springfield, 2012; 208 pp.: US$25.00</p>
<p>The seed for this book was sown on a rainy day in Belgium when Emile McAnany was in a bookshop and came across a title in French by Wilbur Schramm. He went on to study with Schramm at Stanford, and four decades later there has emerged this study of how communications technologies may be used to help foster social change and improve people’s lives for the better. The book summarizes much of the work of McAnany over the ensuing years, including those spent in Africa and Latin America. It is a history and analysis of policy formation and development relating to this application of communications technologies. McAnany draws on the work of Lerner, Rogers and others in this field, and covers the period from the Marshall Plan to the UN’s Millennium Goals. According to McAnany, in North America at least there has been a decline of interest in communication for development, so this overview of its development as a field is timely, and may serve to revive and refocus what goes on within its bounds. This is indeed a handy guide to the ideas and issues, people and projects that have been central to this field, so whether it’s raining outside or not, pick up this book when you see it. It may just plant a seed.</p>
<p>Donald G Ellis, <italic>Deliberative Communication and Ethnopolitical Conflict</italic>, Peter Lang: Oxford, Bern, Berlin, Bruxelles, Frankfurt am Main, New York and Wien, 2012; 248 pp.: £58.00</p>
<p>The major concern of this book is the relationship between deliberative democracy, communication and the resolution of conflicts in ethnopolitically divided societies. The theoretical traditions and models relevant to, and the various issues arising from this relationship, are set out with admirable conciseness at the start of the book. Donald Ellis makes clear that the main purpose of conflict resolution is social justice. Deliberative communication is about values and responsibilities as well as evidence and reasons; it is central to what democratic participation is about. He also reminds us that the democratic imagination must be informed. Do the media contribute to this, or obstruct it? Do they help the deliberative process in respect of ethnopolitical conflict, or report and commentate on it in such a way as to inflame the conflict? Open questions of course, but ones on which too many journalistic vessels founder. In the book, Ellis discusses why ethnic conflicts come about and how they cause such instability in social life. He confronts some of the major difficulties and objections to deliberative democracy. Branching out from here, there are chapters on media and information environments, group decision-making, and argument, as well as on the components of the deliberative communication process and how these combine in the interests of democratic values and consensus-based resolutions. An important chapter deals with the question of unlocking obdurate positions either side of a conflict, so opening up dialogue between otherwise strong and antagonistic identities. Here what is perhaps the major example discussed throughout the book – the Israeli–Palestinian conflict – is an obvious case in point. The Hutus and Tutsis would be another. Ellis has produced a valuable contribution to discussion and debate on a vital process in negotiating division and dealing with conflict. It is relevant across the social sciences, not least because it draws on literature from various social science disciplines, and it deserves to be widely read.</p>
<p>Øyvind Ihlen, Jennifer L Bartlett and Steve May (eds), <italic>The Handbook of Communication and Corporate Social Responsibility</italic>, Wiley-Blackwell: Oxford and Malden, MA, 2011; 585 pp.: £110.00</p>
<p>Assuming that corporations practise social responsibility and take it seriously, then this needs to be communicated effectively and persuasively. This comprehensive handbook on such communication brings together scholars from public relations, marketing and organizational communication to show how various aspects of communication, including dialogue, trust, discourse, rhetoric and reputation, inform corporate social responsibility (CSR) and influence the way organizations are, or should be, managed. The editors begin the book with an overview of the CSR literature, offer a rationale for the book, outline criticism of CSR as ‘an essentially contested concept’ and make their own case for the importance and value of communication for CSR. Contributors come from many different countries, and the main sections of the book cover field-specific literature reviews, CSR communication in action and commentaries on the central topic of the book, which show what communication disciplines can bring to its discussion. At nearly 600 pages of main text, this should prove to be the definitive collection on CSR communication, at least for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Robert M Entman, <italic>Scandal and Silence: Media Responses to Presidential Misconduct</italic>, Polity: Cambridge, UK and Malden, MA, 2012; 269 pp.: £17.99</p>
<p>We’re all familiar with the floods of negative attention and appraisal that periodically descend over the figures of certain politicians, but are the scandals that do break the only scandals that could break? Not according to Robert Entman. His argument is that the media sideline, play down or turn a blind eye to most political misdeeds. There is enormous inconsistency of treatment, at least in North America, which is Entman’s domain. His focus is on US presidents and aspirants to the White House; his target the grossly uneven, capricious journalistic coverage of high-magnitude political misconduct, along with the disproportion between the costs to society of official misbehaviour and the intensity of media attention; and his period the 20 years from 1988 to 2008, with the greatest scrutiny going to George W Bush. Bush’s repeated success at avoiding scandal ‘provides important grist for the book’s explication of the ways scandals either ignite and persist, or fade quickly’ (p. 13). Conversely, for Clinton ‘most of the scandals that could catch fire, did’ (p. 13). Entman gives the lie to the assumption that when scandal breaks it is generally the American press, rather than government or political parties, which drives the process; he shows that cover-ups often operate and duplicity often pays off. Journalistic failure in relation to political corruption and malfeasance has considerable implications for the health of political democracy in the USA, and Entman does his fellow countrymen and women a great service by exposing the degree of such failure.</p>
<p>Zygmunt Bauman, <italic>On Education</italic>, Polity: Cambridge, UK and Malden, MA, 2012; 143 pp.: £9.99</p>
<p>This edifying short book takes the form of a series of conversations between Zygmunt Bauman, world-renowned emeritus professor of sociology, and Riccardo Mazzeo, editor at the Italian publisher, Edizioni Erickson. The purpose of their dialogue is to consider the role of education in a world where more and more different groups and communities coexist alongside each other amidst the two conflicting trends of mixophilia and mixophobia, where the old prospect of a career for life has dissipated and where future opportunities and expectations for young people are riddled with uncertainties and perturbations. This world is of course the familiar liquid of late modernity which Bauman has been famously diagnosing over the last two decades. In his conversations with Mazzeo, Bauman discusses a wide range of luminaries and leaders including Gregory Bateson, HG Wells, José Saramago, Vaclav Havel and Cem Özdemir, and brings such factors as consumerism and austerity cuts into their discussions of educational issues. He mentions in Britain the deep cuts in government funding of education, and the colossal rise in university fees, and suggests that we are baffled and incapacitated by such breathtaking blows to our children’s and grandchildren’s futures: ‘we can hardly imagine the full reach of the social and cultural devastation that is bound to follow the erection of a monetary version of the walls of Berlin or Palestine at the entry to the knowledge distribution centres’ (p. 51). But of course, as Bauman openly acknowledges, imagine we must the consequences that will ensue, including the reversion to a class-ridden society. As he accurately puts it: ‘It takes just a few minutes and a couple of signatures to destroy what took thousands of brains and twice as many hands and lots of years to build’ (p. 41).</p>
<p>Patrick Hyder Patterson, <italic>Bought and Sold: Living and Losing the Good Life in Socialist Yugoslavia</italic>, Cornell University Press: Ithaca, NY and London, 2011; 388 pp.: US$39.95</p>
<p>Compared with other communist countries in Eastern Europe, Yugoslavia was a unique experiment. This was quite clear when you entered the country after visiting other countries in the Soviet bloc. There was never the same environmental austerity, the same awareness of being watched, the same hostile envy of you as someone from the consumer-privileged West. Yugoslavs enjoyed a wide range of consumer goods, access to a consumerist shopping culture and participation in a lifestyle ethos of sorts. They were exposed to western-type advertising and promotion. The experiment that was Yugoslavia blended socialism and capitalism in a distinctive mix. It is this mix and how it unravelled that Patrick Hyder Patterson investigates in this thoroughly researched and carefully argued book. He begins with the period of the 1960s and 1970s when this mix developed and became consolidated. The book looks at how this particular market culture was shaped by advertisers and the mass media, retailers and marketing specialists, and shows how the appeal to consumerist values was legitimated. The move to consumerism was of course contested and critiqued, and Patterson takes us through what was involved and how the state responded with what, for the context, was a remarkable admixture of toleration and flexibility tempered with occasional censure. Two chapters contrast the pursuit and enjoyment of a consumer lifestyle by ordinary Yugoslavs, and the staunch, anti-market, Marxist humanism of the <italic>Praxis</italic> revisionists. In his final chapter, Patterson attends to how consumerism contributed to the making and unmaking of Yugoslavia, while in an epilogue he deals with Yugo-nostalgia, where what is regretted as lost and longed for is the consumer culture that in the end triumphed over genuine human needs. Patterson has produced a fine historical analysis of the Yugoslavian vision of the good life. He vividly recreates what it meant to those who participated in it and shows how it made a difference to them both as they lived it and as they witnessed its demise. We all know the tragic consequences of that.</p>
<p>Ulrich Adelt, <italic>Blues Music in the Sixties: A Story in Black and White</italic>, Rutgers University Press: New Brunswick, NJ and London, 2011; 192 pp.: £20.95</p>
<p>This book is concerned with a shift in affiliation to the blues from black people to white people in the 1960s. It attends to this via six case studies dealing with B.B. King, Eric Clapton, Janis Joplin, the Newport Folk Festival, the American Folk Blues Festival and <italic>Living Blues</italic> magazine. It is a self-consciously revisionist account which focuses on the racial politics of blues music in this period in order to challenge what is denounced as the romanticization of the blues by white scholars, white performers, white cultural brokers and white consumers. There is a certain polemical appeal in this, but the book suffers from the self-conceitedness which underlies it and the staleness of story which overlies it. Here, at last, is revealed the truth of what was involved in late-1960s white attraction to blues music, yet all we are given is the same old story of white appropriation and the consequent destruction of the very soul of that music. Adelt’s crusading purpose is to contribute, via his case studies, to ‘social justice … through exposing racialist structures’ in such attraction and appropriation (p. 12). He asserts that his case studies provide ‘a representative view’ of the ‘museumification’ of white connoisseurship (p. 11), but does not adequately explain this representativeness or offer a clear set of criteria of what makes them representative. They could be seen instead as having been chosen because they best suit his polemic – case studies to suit his case, rather than problematize it – and the claim is certainly debatable, at least up to point. Eric Clapton is, for example, an easy target, fitting all too well with what Adelt wants to argue. Despite his fame, Clapton is also not broadly representative of white interest in the blues in 1960s and 1970s Britain; the picture is far more complex than showcasing him acknowledges. Adelt’s book suffers further by being over-schematic, predictable in structure and organization, and all too prone to sweeping statements. This is apparent right from the outset when we are told that in the 1960s ‘attempts by young white audiences to reject middle-class culture, racism, colonialism, and fascism sometimes took form in a nostalgic re-creation of a safe blackness that predated the civil rights movement’ (p. 2). This is a line of argument pursued throughout the book, yet how often was ‘sometimes’ and why are key terms in the argument like nostalgia, not conceptualized? Little is said in the book about the appeal of the blues <italic>as</italic> music, and the complexities and nuances of both the appeal of this music to white people as well as its relations with identity politics are lost in the drive to explain that appeal as ‘conservative’ and ‘racialized’. This is not to say that it never was, but rather that the argument is one-dimensional. Finally, there is the question of evidence. Adelt’s ‘primary sources’ are mainly not primary but secondary in that he draws mainly on easily resorted to sources like autobiographies, press articles, album covers and liner notes. He mentions interviews, both printed and those conducted by him, but the latter seem mainly to have been conducted by email, and in the States; they are not in any case extensively cited. There is a missed opportunity here of engaging in oral history with members of various groups involved on both sides of the racial line, and both sides of the Atlantic. This would have made the book far more original, though such data may well have upset its post-hoc revisionism. The historiographical issues attendant on such revisionism are nowhere dealt with. The book is, pejoratively, what it claims in its subtitle: all too conveniently ‘a story in black and white’.</p>
<p>Gregory Ferrell Lowe and Jeanette Steemers (eds), <italic>Regaining the Initiative for Public Service Media</italic>, Nordicom: Göteborg, 2012; 257 pp.: SEK 280/€30.00</p>
<p>Public service broadcasting has produced the great majority of quality programming, yet it is everywhere under attack. Commercialist values and approaches prevail, destructive inroads have been made on excellent developments in public service media, funding sources are frozen or cut back. Murdoch <italic>fils</italic> even had the effrontery to turn a respected public lecture forum into an ill-disguised rant against the BBC. It is therefore timely to have this book come out, offering as it does a wide-reaching audit of PSB issues. The four sections of the book deal with political case-making in northwest Europe – the heartland of PSB’s historic beginnings; responses to environmental pressures, with a focus on evaluating and regulating performance; introducing PSM in countries with little or no history of such media; and challenges facing PSM operators in trying to regain the initiative. The volume derives from and brings together the proceedings of the RIPE@2010 conference in London which was convened to address questions of public service media after the recession. This is an important set of papers offering useful contributions to discussion of the future of PSB.</p>
<p>Jan van Dijk, <italic>The Network Society</italic>, Sage: London, Thousand Oaks, CA, New Delhi and Singapore, 2012; 326 pp.: £26.99</p>
<p>The first edition of this book was in Dutch and was written at the end of the 1980s. Its fully revised third edition is a clear indication of how well received its earlier incarnations have been. With each new edition the inventory of the social aspects of new media provided by the book has steadily extended and reduced. The reason for this is given early on: ‘The new media have merged so much in society that they touch about every aspect of it’ (pp. 18–19). That statement would also be one justification for the title. Those who write about new media are prone to sweeping descriptions about their revolutionary nature or the way they now define society. There is something of this in Van Dijk, but also suitable – and refreshing – notes of caution, signs of reservation, moments of pulling back. He begins with basic terms and statements, sets up his theoretical framework and outlines the technological infrastructure of network society. The main part of the book deals with the social aspects of new media – economic, political, legal, cultural, sociological and psychological. There are new chapter summaries and conclusions, and new definition and explanation boxes. There is also a concluding chapter taking up policy perspectives. Jan van Dijk provides a wide-ranging, interdisciplinary discussion of new media. If you teach new or digital media modules, this would be a sound and accessible textbook to choose.</p>
<p>Raymond Boyle and Lisa W Kelly, <italic>The Television Entrepreneurs: Social Change and Public Understanding of Business</italic>, Ashgate: Farnham, UK and Burlington, VT, 2012; 176 pp.: £55.00</p>
<p>Anyone picking up this book will immediately think of such television programmes as <italic>The Apprentice</italic> and <italic>Dragons’ Den</italic>. These do indeed figure quite prominently, for they have clearly raised the profile of business and entrepreneurial ventures, but there are now quite a range of programmes in which business – its risks and rewards, its gains and setbacks – is a key presence. Certainly contexts may vary – a restaurant here, a philanthropic millionaire there; a shopping chain here, competing hoteliers there – but many of the underlying themes connect them together. Business is the new form of entertainment. Raymond Boyle and Lisa Kelly study the ways in which entrepreneurs and businesses are represented in factual entertainment programming in Britain, showing how such programming has developed and become centred around the ‘business entertainment format’. They are concerned with how such programming has changed ideas and attitudes to business and entrepreneurship. With these aims in mind, they divide the book into two sections, the first being concerned with the television industry in Britain and the different types of factual entertainment which are being produced, while the second turns to the audience to investigate, via audience focus groups, public understanding of business television and business more generally. Although it occurs throughout the book, a final chapter is devoted to the concept of the celebrity entrepreneur. The book is the fruit of a two-year research project funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council. Boyle and Kelly show how the ‘business entertainment format’ in television has become central to public discussion and debate about business. Theirs is a timely book. It offers a valuable account of how business has been transmuted into regular entertainment viewing.</p>
