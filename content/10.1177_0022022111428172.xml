<abstract>
<p>The present study examined whether psychological well-being, life satisfaction, and risk behavior differed among European Canadian (<italic>n</italic> = 147), Arab Canadian (<italic>n</italic> = 129), and Arab youth in Egypt and Lebanon (<italic>n</italic> = 131). Using parental acceptance-rejection theory, we also examined the strength of associations between perceived parental rejection and positive and negative outcomes for these youth. Our results suggested that European Canadian youth were less likely to perceive parental rejection and had higher life satisfaction than both Arab groups. However, although Arab Canadians and Arabs perceived more parental rejection than their European Canadian counterparts, it had less of an effect on their adjustment. We argued that culturally normative aspects of parent-youth relationships in Arab families may mitigate the effects of perceived parental rejection and that immigration may not exert a negative effect on Arab families in Canada. Instead, we suggested that researchers need to focus on the strengths of youth and families, rather than the negative effects of immigration and/or cultural group status.</p>

<body>
<p>Historically, Arab culture and its people have been underrepresented in the social sciences literature, leaving a gap in our understanding of the similarities and differences between Arab and other cultures. Currently, there are large and growing Arab populations in many countries including Canada, due in part to its official multiculturalism policy and extensive network of settlement agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022022111428172">Chuang, Rasmi, &amp; Friesen, 2011</xref>). Yet Arab scholarship has directed very little attention to immigration issues, in Canada or elsewhere. The need to examine Arab populations has never been as critical as it is now, in light of the Arab Spring.</p>
<p>Immigration is a complex phenomenon, but at its core, it is a family process, necessitating an examination of both familial and individual adaptation. This is particularly important for Arabs in Canada, who are faced not only with the challenges of negotiating discrepant Arab and Canadian values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022022111428172">Schwartz, 2006</xref>) but also post-9/11 discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022022111428172">Khalema &amp; Wannas-Jones, 2003</xref>). We address these issues by examining how the parent-youth relationship is related to youth adjustment in Arab immigrants to Canada, and compared to matched samples of European Canadians and Arabs in the Middle East (Egypt and Lebanon).</p>
<sec id="section1-0022022111428172">
<title>Parent-Youth Relationships</title>
<p>Early parenting research tended to apply Western models of parenting to families from various backgrounds, despite the importance of nesting these processes within the social, cultural, and historical contexts in which they occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022022111428172">Harkness &amp; Super, 2002</xref>). In contrast to this approach, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022022111428172">Rohner (1986)</xref> developed parental acceptance-rejection theory (PART) based on ethnographic research conducted in over 40 industrial and nonindustrial societies. According to PART, parental warmth is a unidimensional continuum anchored by parental acceptance and parental rejection, which are organized around four classes of behavior: warmth/affection<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022022111428172">1</xref></sup>, hostility/aggression, indifference/neglect, and undifferentiated rejection. They are similarly perceived by youth and adults transculturally, despite cultural differences in the specific words and behaviors used to express them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022022111428172">Rohner, Khaleque, &amp; Cournoyer, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>A central postulate of PART (personality subtheory) argues that universally, youth who perceive parental rejection experience poorer psychological, behavioral, and cognitive outcomes than those who perceive parental acceptance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022022111428172">Rohner &amp; Khaleque, 2010</xref>). A review of over 100 studies found support for personality subtheory in Arab countries (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022022111428172">Ahmed, Rohner, Khaleque, &amp; Gielen, 2010</xref>). However, most studies included in this review were unpublished theses or dissertations, conference presentations, and/or written in the Arabic language, making them largely inaccessible to Western researchers. Similar to the vast majority of PART research, these studies were also conducted with members of each country’s majority group. As a result, we have a very limited understanding of personality subtheory in immigrant groups, where there is likely to be more intercultural interaction, as well as variation across culture. We address these gaps by examining the validity of PART’s claims for immigrant Arab youth in Canada compared to their heritage and settlement culture counterparts.</p>

<title>Psychological and Behavioral Adjustment</title>
<p>To date, the deficit perspective has guided most immigration research, and as a result, researchers and practitioners have focused their attention on treatment strategies and risk-based prevention programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022022111428172">Park, 2004</xref>), as opposed to strength-based programs and services that could facilitate immigrant youth and families’ positive adjustment in Canada. We address this issue by examining immigrant Arab youth’s positive psychological functioning (life satisfaction and psychological well-being) in comparison to youth from the majority culture in their heritage and settlement countries.</p>
<p>The limited research examining children and youth’s life satisfaction suggests that it is strongly associated with family satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022022111428172">Park, 2004</xref>). Cross-culturally, people from collectivist, Eastern cultures tend to report lower life satisfaction than those from individualist, North American cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022022111428172">Diener &amp; Suh, 2000</xref>). Therefore, we expect European Canadians to report higher life satisfaction than both Arab groups (Hypothesis 1a). Based on some evidence suggesting that immigrants have lower life satisfaction than non-immigrants (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022022111428172">Ullman &amp; Tatar, 2001</xref>), we also expect Arabs to report higher life satisfaction than Arab Canadian youth (Hypothesis 1b). Although no studies have examined psychological well-being in an Arab context, since it is positively related to life satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022022111428172">Ryff, 1989</xref>), we expect a similar pattern: European Canadians will report higher psychological well-being than both Arab groups (Hypothesis 2a), and Arabs will report higher psychological well-being than Arab Canadians (Hypothesis 2b).</p>
<p>Although risk behavior becomes salient in adolescence and young adulthood, its prevalence may be influenced by culture. Studies have found that youth in Western countries report more risk behavior than those from Eastern countries (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022022111428172">Jessor, Turbin, Costa, Dong, Zhang, &amp; Wang, 2003</xref>). Based on this research, as well as the importance of reputation and honor in Arab society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022022111428172">Uskul, Oyserman, &amp; Schwarz, 2010</xref>), we expect that European Canadians will report more risk behavior than both Arab groups (Hypothesis 3). Given the contradictory findings reported by immigrant risk behavior studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022022111428172">Amundsen, Rossow, &amp; Skurtveit, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022022111428172">Brindis, Wolfe, McCarter, Ball, &amp; Starbuck-Morales, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022022111428172">Vazsonyi, Trejos-Castillo, &amp; Huang, 2006</xref>), we will not make a specific hypothesis for Arab Canadian risk behavior relative to Arabs.</p>

<title>Perceived Parental Rejection and Psychological and Behavioral Outcomes</title>
<p>Although personality subtheory has not been explored in immigrant groups, the robustness of previous findings with members of the cultural majority suggests that these relationships will be replicated. However, the strength of the relationship is likely to differ, due to a general trend for non-Western families to report more perceived parental rejection but not necessarily more negative outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022022111428172">Erkman &amp; Rohner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022022111428172">Steely &amp; Rohner, 2006</xref>). Though no study has compared the strength of the relationship between perceived parental rejection and its outcomes in different ethnocultural groups, culturally normative aspects of parent-youth relationships such as parental control may buffer the deleterious effects of perceived parental rejection for many ethnocultural groups. Moreover, given the large number of factors that influence immigrant youth adjustment, we expect perceived parental rejection to have a lesser effect on Arab and Arab immigrant youth’s life satisfaction, psychological well-being, and risk behavior compared to European Canadians (Hypothesis 4).</p>

<p>A one-way ANOVA was conducted to examine Hypotheses 1 through 3.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although few group differences emerged, the present study corroborated PART’s personality subtheory with its overall finding that youth who perceived parental rejection had lower levels of psychological well-being and life satisfaction and were more likely to participate in risk behavior. This study extended the PART literature by replicating its findings with an Arab Canadian immigrant sample, but also by comparing the strength of these associations with matched samples of European Canadian and Arab youth in the Middle East.</p>
<p>We also found that European Canadian youth who perceived parental rejection tended to be more poorly adjusted than their Arab Canadian and Arab counterparts. This finding may be explained by considering two complementary aspects of normative parent-youth relationships in Arab culture: parental control and intrafamilial hierarchy. Arab parents are strong uncertainty avoidant and believe that they are protecting their children by discouraging exploration of the unknown and enforcing strict rules and regulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022022111428172">Hofstede, 2001</xref>). As such, a primary socialization goal in Arab families is obedience, achieved in part through vertical parent-child communication and even physical punishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022022111428172">Kayyali, 2006</xref>). Although these practices are considered maladaptive in Western culture, they are supported by the Arab values of embeddedness and hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022022111428172">Schwartz, 2006</xref>). For this reason, Arab youth have been found to be more interconnected with their families than European Americans, while also favoring the notion of “absolute submission” to their parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022022111428172">Dwairy, Achoui, Abouserie, &amp; Farah, 2006</xref>). Although obedience and conformity are the cultural underpinnings of Arab society—especially within the family—because Arab parents are typically warm and caring in the treatment of their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022111428172">Abudabbeh, 1996</xref>), perceived parental rejection is not met as negatively as in Western families, where independence is encouraged, and warmth and control are separate, almost mutually exclusive constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022022111428172">Chao, 1994</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section13-0022022111428172">
<title>Arab and Arab Immigrant Youth</title>
<p>We found no significant differences between Arab Canadians and Arabs in regards to perceived parental rejection, psychological well-being, life satisfaction, and risk behavior. Had we only examined these relationships for immigrant Arab and European Canadian families, our results would have suggested that Arab immigrants have poorer relationships with their parents and are more poorly adjusted than their native-born peers. Importantly, this finding could have been interpreted to suggest that immigration is associated with decreased individual and family functioning, as well as perpetuating some of the negative stereotypes surrounding Arabs. By using three samples, we were able to anchor Arab Canadians against their counterparts in both heritage and settlement contexts and report that Arab Canadian youth and families are doing well.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0022022111428172">
<title>Future Directions</title>
<p>Our study presents an exciting new area of research for PART and parenting scholars, as it suggests cross-cultural differences beyond the universal association between PART and adjustment. Indeed, our understanding of PART’s personality subtheory is saturated: Hundreds of studies have confirmed that youth all over the world have poorer adaptive outcomes when they perceive parental rejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022022111428172">Rohner &amp; Khaleque, 2010</xref>). It is now time to direct our focus to the factors that buffer the adverse effects of perceived parental rejection cross-culturally.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The main limitation of this study is generalizability, particularly for Arabs in the Middle East. Arab participants in this study were students at two private, American universities in Egypt and Lebanon, who only represented two of the 22 Arab nations. Moreover, Arabs from Egypt and Lebanon are generally less collectivistic than Arabs from the Persian Gulf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022022111428172">Buda &amp; Elsayed-Elkhouly, 1998</xref>). Although Arabs have a larger, shared sense of identity and many commonalities, it is important to be mindful of intracultural variation. Finally, the self-report, cross-sectional nature of this study prevents us from inferring causal influence.</p>
