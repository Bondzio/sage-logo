<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study was to determine if viewing a training video on empowerment of individuals with an intellectual and developmental disability would change the attitudes of direct support professionals (DSPs). Participants were 43 DSPs from a human service provider to individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. We randomly assigned them to one of two groups. A control group completed the Community Living Attitude Scale (CLAS–MR) without viewing a training video on empowerment until after CLAS–MR completion. The experimental group viewed the video on empowerment and then completed the CLAS–MR. The hypothesis was supported in that DSPs who viewed the video prior to CLAS–MR completion had significantly more empowering attitudes towards individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities compared to the control group. </p>

<p>The purpose of this study was to determine if viewing a training video on empowerment of individuals with an intellectual and developmental disability would change the attitudes of direct support professionals (DSPs). Cattaneo and Chapman define empowerment as ‘an iterative process in which a person who lacks power sets a personally meaningful goal oriented toward increasing power, takes action toward that goal, and observes and reflects on the impact of this action’ (2010, p. 647). Hence, empowerment involves making decisions, having control, and having a say in decisions that affect one’s life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744629512443652">Martin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744629512443652">Henry et al., 2004</xref>). </p>
<p>Individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities have a desire and a right to be in control of their life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744629512443652">Martin, 2006</xref>). The American Association of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities echoes this focus in their <italic>Self-Advocacy Movement</italic>, where they state:<disp-quote>
<p>AAIDD joins with people with developmental disabilities in supporting the full expression of citizens with disabilities to speak for themselves in making choices about their lives. This includes decisions about living arrangements, work, personal relationships and the funding of service needs and supports. (n.d., para. 9)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Empowerment is key in helping individuals to advocate for themselves and express their life choices. In order to facilitate empowerment, professionals are encouraged to exhibit attitudes and behaviors that promote empowerment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744629512443652">Lotan and Ells, 2010</xref>). Following past research on improving DSPs’ knowledge on empowerment, the main question of this exploratory research was: can a change in attitude take place during a training video on empowerment?</p>
<sec id="section1-1744629512443652">
<title>Empowerment</title>
<p>In addition to the aforementioned <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744629512443652">Cattaneo and Chapman (2010</xref>) definition, empowerment is also considered as having the power to make decisions regarding one’s life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744629512443652">Martin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744629512443652">Henry et al., 2004</xref>). The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s statement on recovery identified empowerment as one of the 10 ‘fundamental components of recovery’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744629512443652">2006</xref>, p. 1). It defines empowerment as the following:<disp-quote>
<p>Consumers have the authority to choose from a range of options and to participate in all decisions – including the allocation of resources – that will affect their lives, and are educated and supported in so doing. They have the ability to join with other consumers to collectively and effectively speak for themselves about their needs, wants, desires, and aspirations. Through empowerment, an individual gains control of his or her own destiny and influences the organizational and societal structures in his or her life. (2006, p. 1)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Although this definition is from a mental health treatment model, it is also consistent with the view of empowerment in settings that assist individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities.</p>
<p>Although nearly two decades ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744629512443652">Lord and Hutchison (1993</xref>) looked at the process of empowerment and the struggle of those with intellectual and developmental disabilities who are seeking empowerment. The participants in this study described feeling as if they had no power and attributed this feeling to several factors, including social exclusion, services that did not meet their needs, poverty, and abuse. They also identified several key factors in their process of becoming empowered, including acting on new information and receiving support from people. This study highlights the importance of staff knowledge and training in empowerment for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. DSPs need to mentor as part of their job responsibility to promote empowerment for all people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Next, we address past research on how DSPs view individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. </p>

<title>Research on DSP attitudes toward people with intellectual and developmental disabilities</title>
<p>Past research supports that training can improve the attitudes of professionals. To begin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744629512443652">Henry et al. (1996a</xref>), using the Community Living Attitudes Scale (CLAS–MR), found that participants trained in community living philosophies were more likely to have a positive attitude and acceptance of empowerment, and were less likely to agree with exclusion, than untrained individuals. These researchers indicated that while they could not determine what type of training produced positive attitudes toward empowerment and inclusion, they did determine that training is an important variable. They also indicated that the CLAS–MR is sensitive enough to measure the attitude changes that take place after training.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744629512443652">Henry et al. (2004</xref>) continued their research by looking at professionals from two countries. Results suggested that the training provided by the agencies determines staff attitudes towards empowerment and indicated American professionals had significantly higher scores on the empowerment subscale of the CLAS–MR than Israeli professionals, supporting their hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744629512443652">Henry et al., 2004</xref>). </p>
<p>Research has also looked at training on concepts that are related to empowerment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744629512443652">Wong and Wong (2008</xref>) looked at effectiveness of training on self-determination and found that professionals’ attitudes and knowledge improve when individuals receive training. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744629512443652">Zijlmans et al. (2011</xref>) found that individuals trained in emotional intelligence exhibit more behaviors consistent with the concept of empowerment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1744629512443652">
<title>Rationale for our study</title>
<p>Training provides service providers with strategies to implement practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744629512443652">Schubert, 2007</xref>). Adopting principles of empowerment is the first important step for agencies that support people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744629512443652">Henry et al., 2004</xref>). Although some research investigated ways to promote empowerment for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (such as through self-advocacy groups: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744629512443652">Gilmartin and Slevin, 2009</xref>), training focused explicitly on empowerment was not investigated prior to our study. Also, research prior to this study did not determine if a video could change attitudes regarding empowerment. Therefore, our hypothesis was that viewing a training video on empowerment would make a positive change in DSP attitudes towards people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section5-1744629512443652">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 43 DSPs from a non-profit human service agency in southeastern Pennsylvania. Ages ranged between 21 and 60, with a mean of 37.09 (SD = 10.46). Fifty-eight percent of the participants had more than five years’ work experience with individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. There were more female participants (<italic>n </italic>= 34) than males (<italic>n </italic>= 9). To recruit, the agency sent invitations to DSPs via email and inter-office mail on our behalf, so that researchers were not aware of the contact information of potential participants, and were not aware of individuals who chose not to participate in the research. This was a sample of convenience. We used a drawing for a $50 gift certificate as an incentive to recruit participants.</p>
<p>The participants of this study were DSPs, who worked in either a residential group home or a day habilitation program, assisting individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities in daily living tasks at home and work environments. Both groups were relatively even in regard to experience, gender, and age, and all participants had the same job description.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1744629512443652">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>The materials included an informed consent form, a short video on empowerment, a television and a DVD player, and a debriefing statement. </p>
<p>The video utilized was <italic>Changing Attitudes </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744629512443652">Advocating Change Together, n.d.</xref>), which was written and performed by individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities and showed brief vignettes about individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities in empowering roles that challenge stereotypes. Most notably in the video, the participants viewed a three minute vignette that focused on how individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities viewed their own lives and their ability to make choices around marriage and independence. This vignette involved a young woman with an intellectual disability being asked if she is lost and why she is alone (without staff supervision) by individuals passing by her in a public setting. The young woman was simply waiting for her significant other and looking forward to building her life with him. </p>
<p>Additionally, we administered a demographic survey and the CLAS–MR. The empowerment subscale of the CLAS–MR was our dependent variable. This subscale is a 13-item measure, found to have satisfactory internal consistency and a test–retest reliability of 0.74 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744629512443652">Henry et al., 1996b</xref>). </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1744629512443652">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>This research was conducted in November 2008, with approval from the Institutional Review Board from Albright College and approval of the non-profit human service agency. Interested employees who responded to our invitation reported to a conference room. Those who chose to participate in this study read and signed an inform consent form (they could also keep a copy of this form).</p>
<p>Each participant was randomly assigned to one of two groups by drawing a number out of a box with equal numbers of odd and even numbers; people who drew odd numbers went into one group and people who drew even numbers went into the other group. The experimental group completed a short demographic questionnaire and then viewed a 10 minute video on empowerment of individuals with intellectual disabilities. Once the video was finished, the participants completed the CLAS–MR and listened to a debriefing statement. The control group filled out a brief demographic questionnaire, and the CLAS–MR. Once they completed the questionnaires, they listened to a debriefing statement and then were given the opportunity to view the video to ensure they had the same opportunity as the experimental group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1744629512443652">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>This study utilized a two-group design (a group receiving training and a control group who did not receive training until after completing the dependent measure), and the hypothesis was analyzed using an independent samples <italic>t</italic>-test.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1744629512443652">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Participants who watched the video scored higher on the empowerment subscale of the CLAS–MR (mean = 60.04, SD = 4.84), compared to those that did not view the training video (mean = 33.22, SD = 7.62). An independent samples <italic>t</italic>-test indicated that this difference is significant <italic>t</italic>(41) = 13.698,<italic> p </italic>&lt; 0.05, and our hypothesis is tentatively supported, recognizing that small sample size and replication of our findings are needed to fully support this training tool.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1744629512443652">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to determine if a training video on empowerment could change DSP attitudes toward empowerment of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. We found that participants who viewed the brief video on empowerment had significantly more favorable attitudes regarding empowerment of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities than those who did not view the video, at a statistically significant level. Our finding is consistent with past research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744629512443652">Henry et al. (1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744629512443652">1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744629512443652">2004</xref>). This research might mean that even a brief video could assist training DSPs to support empowerment in their work, although limitations of this study should be considered, and more research is warranted in this area.</p>
<p>Beyond the concept of training, past research has indicated that people need to be mentored and supported through the process of empowerment (Llwewllyn and Northway, 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744629512443652">Lord and Hutchison, 1993</xref>), supporting research on training DSPs who can assist individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities in their daily environments. Also, past research, although less recent, indicates that professional attitudes regarding empowerment can affect the parents with adult children with intellectual and developmental disabilities in terms of satisfaction and sense of empowerment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744629512443652">Dempsey, 1999</xref>). Based on our study and these past findings, training staff in empowerment principles may be beneficial not only to the individual with an intellectual or developmental disability, but also to other important people in their lives, although there is a need for continued research in this area.</p>
<sec id="section11-1744629512443652">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Limitations of this study include that the sample was from one provider agency and may not be as diverse as the overall population of professionals working with individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The small sample size and limited diversity (such as few male participants) of the sample limits the generalizability of these findings. Additionally, since there was no baseline measure of attitudes, there is no guarantee that the video was the exact reason for the difference between the two groups.</p>
<p>More importantly in regard to practical applications of research on practice, this study did not determine permanent attitude change towards empowerment, so we are uncertain of the long-term effects of this. We also do not know if there was a behavioral change in interaction with individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. This research is simply an initial step to explore how training might help to promote empowering attitudes. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1744629512443652">
<title>Suggestions for future research</title>
<p>Because this study was simply exploratory, and since literature from the past 20 years emphasizes empowerment and training DSPs (Llwewllyn and Northway, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744629512443652">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744629512443652">Lord and Hutchison, 1993</xref>), more research on empowerment is warranted. Such research should look at both individuals with an intellectual and developmental disability and service providers. Furthermore, since this study utilized a 10 minute video, future research, utilizing a more in-depth training on empowerment, would be beneficial. Additionally, further research with a larger sample from various service providers would be needed to truly determine if a short video is helpful. Future studies could benefit from a pre-test post-test design. Future studies can also look at long-term attitude change and possibly even behavior change in the workplace. Finally, future research teams might benefit from using individuals with an intellectual and developmental disability as research team members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744629512443652">Nierce and Abma, 2011</xref>). </p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1744629512443652">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Based on this research and previous research, it is likely beneficial for professionals who work with individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, including DSPs, to be trained in empowerment and taught facilitation of empowerment skills, and for research to continue in this area. Future research in ways to achieve empowerment would be beneficial to individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, and to society, by allowing individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities to be productive members of society.</p>
