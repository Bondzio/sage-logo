<title>Background:</title>
<p>Osteoarthritis after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction receives much attention in orthopaedic science. Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is related to increased joint fluid volumes, bone marrow edema, and cartilage biochemical and morphological changes believed to cause fragile joint conditions. These joint conditions may not be able to adequately counter the imposed loads during sports.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546512473568">
<title>Hypothesis:</title>
<p>At 6 months after surgery, knee cartilage displays inferior quality in ACL-reconstructed knees when compared with controls. This inferior quality is influenced by the time to return to sports and/or by the time to surgery.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512473568">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546512473568">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Fifteen patients treated with isolated ACL reconstruction were compared with 15 matched controls. In all participants, a 3-T magnetic resonance imaging cartilage evaluation was performed entailing quantitative morphological characteristics (3-dimensional volume/thickness), biochemical composition (T2/T2* mapping), and function (after a 30-minute run: in vivo deformation including recovery). Nonparametric statistics were executed reporting median (95% CI).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546512473568">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>No volume and thickness between-group differences existed. In patients, medial femur (FM) T2 was higher (45.44 ms [95% CI, 40.64-51.49] vs 37.19 ms [95% CI, 34.67-40.39]; <italic>P</italic> = .028), whereas T2* was lower in the FM (21.81 ms [95% CI, 19.89-22.74] vs 24.29 ms [95% CI, 22.70-26.26]; <italic>P</italic> = .004), medial tibia (TM) (13.81 ms [95% CI, 10.26-16.78] vs 17.98 ms [95% CI, 15.95-18.90]; <italic>P</italic> = .016), and lateral tibia (TL) (14.69 ms [95% CI, 11.71-16.72] vs 18.62 ms [95% CI, 17.85-22.04]; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Patients showed diminished recovery at 30 minutes after a 30-minute run in the FM (−1.60% [95% CI, −4.82 to −0.13] vs 0.01% [95% CI, −0.34 to 1.23]; <italic>P</italic> = .040) and at 30 (−3.76% [95% CI, −9.29 to −1.78] vs 0.04% [95% CI, −1.52 to −0.72]; <italic>P</italic> = .004) and 45 minutes after exercise (−1.86% [95% CI, −4.66 to −0.40] vs 0.43% [95% CI, −0.91 to 0.77]; <italic>P</italic> = .024) in the TL. Eight patients returned to sports at 6 months or earlier. Return before 5 months (3/8 patients) was associated with increased cartilage thickness (in TM, TL, and lateral femur [FL]), deformation (in FL), and delayed recovery after running (in FL and FM). Median surgical delay was 10 weeks (range, 5-17 weeks). Surgery within 10 weeks (9/15 patients) was also associated with delayed cartilage recovery (in FL and FM). For the other parameters, no significant relationships could be established for either return to sports or surgical delay.</p>

<sec id="section6-0363546512473568">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>At 6 months after surgery, cartilage in patients with ACL reconstruction shows diminished quality and in vivo resiliency compared with controls. Caution is advised in an early return to sports especially when dealing with patients who received prompt surgery. Possibly, high impacts on this qualitatively diminished cartilage might play a role in the development of osteoarthritis in ACL reconstruction. Replication in larger samples and follow-up are warranted.</p>

<p>Osteoarthritis (OA) after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is a comorbidity receiving much attention in orthopaedic science. Pivoting sports are considered “high risk” for the incidence of ACL ruptures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512473568">18</xref></sup> According to a review by Myklebust and Bahr,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512473568">18</xref></sup> treatment with ACL reconstruction effects a return to sports in 65% to 88% of athletes compared with 19% to 82% enrolled in nonoperative treatments.</p>
<p>Postoperative sports participation, however, might not be tailored to ongoing structural remodeling of the traumatized knee. Surgery within 6 weeks after injury showed increased joint fluid volumes combined with slowly resorbing bone marrow lesions (BMLs) and cartilage morphological changes during the first year. Hence, these signs depict precarious joint conditions that might not be able to counter the excessive torsional loads that the knee would be subjected to when returning to strenuous activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512473568">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512473568">9</xref></sup> Interestingly, in a 6-year prospective study, Keays et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512473568">14</xref></sup> found that type or level of postoperative sports played was not a predictor for the incidence of radiographic OA after ACL reconstruction. In cases of no further sustained chondral or meniscal damage requiring meniscectomy, pursuing athletic activities was suggested as not accelerating joint deterioration. Surgical delay (mean, 40.59 months), however, was in this particular study much longer and related to OA development, whereas the time to return to play was not reported or accounted for in the analysis. In cases of an average 3-month surgical delay, Hoffelner et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512473568">11</xref></sup> concluded that patients, who all returned to competitive sports within 8 months after isolated ACL surgery, showed no increased OA risk at 10 years’ follow-up. Osteoarthritis was detected in 36% of operated knees; however, no significant differences could be attained after cross-sectional within-patient comparison.</p>
<p>To date, it is agreed that surgical delay determines the presence of concomitant injury on arthroscopic evaluation, affecting the risk for OA progression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512473568">10</xref></sup> Surgery is proposed to be performed within the first year, whereas a delay of over 6 months was even put forward as a risk factor for OA development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512473568">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512473568">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512473568">23</xref></sup> In athletes wishing to return to pivoting sports, reconstruction is advised to be performed within 4 to 8 weeks in cases of absent joint swelling and full range of motion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512473568">18</xref></sup> Also, in cases of surgery within 6 weeks, ACL-reconstructed knees were suggested to benefit from a longer recovery in view of the morphological sequellae that the joint seemed to endure after surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512473568">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512473568">9</xref></sup> Consequently, the impact of return to sports and surgical delay on future joint deterioration remains enigmatic.</p>
<p>In clinical practice, most patients are usually discharged from rehabilitation and attempt a full return to leisure or athletic activities at an average of 6 months after surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512473568">16</xref></sup> Therefore, the purpose of this study was 2-fold. First, a comprehensive evaluation of cartilage status was undertaken in ACL-reconstructed patients 6 months after surgery and compared with matched control patients. Using 3-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the cartilage evaluation entailed in vivo quantitative morphological characteristics, biochemical composition, and function (ie, tissue resiliency). Second, within patients, the role of time to return to sports and/or surgical delay on cartilage status was explored. It was hypothesized that knee cartilage would display inferior quality when compared with controls. An early return to sports and/or surgery (ie, too soon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512473568">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512473568">9</xref></sup>) was hypothesized to contribute to a worse cartilage outcome at 6 months after surgery. These results may have implications on fine-tuning rehabilitation strategies and surgical planning.</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>Fifteen patients (8 men, 7 women) who underwent ACL reconstructive arthroscopic surgery were recruited from an experienced orthopaedic surgeon’s practice. All patients received surgery between April 2010 and April 2011. Eligibility to participate was evaluated based on arthroscopic evaluation and standard questionnaires. Inclusion criteria were (1) 20 to 40 years of age to reduce the risk of cartilage degeneration associated with ageing, (2) body mass index (BMI) of 20 to 30, (3) regular sports participation before injury, (4) isolated ACL reconstruction using hamstring tendon autografts, and (5) being able to run 30 minutes. Exclusion criteria were (1) any cartilage lesion present on arthroscopic evaluation or diagnosed before injury as the latter might have evolved into degenerative changes regardless of the incident, (2) concomitant meniscectomy or meniscal sutures, (3) concomitant collateral ligament injuries ≥grade 2, (4) history of knee injury and/or surgery, (5) MRI contraindications, and (6) other joint and/or bone lesions. In all patients, anatomic ACL reconstruction was performed using a double semitendinosus and gracilis autograft with a cortical suspension system (Endobutton CL, Smith &amp; Nephew, Andover, Massachusetts) on the femoral side and use of a metal interference screw (RCI, Smith &amp; Nephew) and staple on the tibial side. Briefly, anatomic position was achieved with the tibial tunnel in the center of the ACL remnant and through the anteromedial portal for the femoral tunnel. The grafts were fixed with the knee in 30° of flexion. After surgery, all patients enrolled in a structured 4- to 6-month rehabilitation program.</p>
<p>Fifteen control participants were recruited from the community or university campus. Eligibility was verified using standard questionnaires. Control participants were matched to the patients by sex, age, BMI, sports participation (ie, type of sports and training volume as determined by the Baecke sport index<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512473568">2</xref></sup>), and dominance of the limb to be investigated. Additionally, all controls were able to run 30 minutes. Exclusion criteria were (1) a history of knee injury including cartilage defects and/or surgery, (2) known bone and/or joint pathological abnormality including clinical or MRI-related signs of OA at the time of the study, and (3) MRI contraindications.</p>
<p>Informed consent forms ratified by the local ethics committee were obtained from all patients. Patient demographics are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512473568">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Experimental Procedures</title>
<p>As the patients were evaluated 6 months after surgery, experimental procedures took place from October 2010 until November 2011. All patients were instructed not to practice sports the day before testing or on the testing day and to avoid running, lifting heavy weights, and taking stairs 4 hours preceding the actual experimental procedures. The procedures were performed on campus and occurred at the same time of day for all patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512473568">27</xref></sup> The protocol comprised (1) MRI evaluation of cartilage status including in vivo quantitative morphological characteristics (ie, 3-dimensional [3D] volume/thickness), biochemical composition (ie, T2/T2* mapping), and function (ie, deformational behavior including recovery); (2) evaluation of lower limb function and knee laxity; and (3) questionnaires.</p>

<title>MRI Evaluation of Cartilage Status: 3D Morphology, Biochemical Composition, and Function</title>
<p>High-resolution images of knee cartilage morphology (ie, sagittal 3D double echo steady state sequence with fat suppression by water excitation [DESS WE]) and baseline biochemical T2/T2* maps (T2/T2* MapIt, Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) were obtained using a dedicated 8-channel knee coil on a 3-T Trio Tim magnet (Siemens Medical Solutions).

<p>The weightbearing exercise consisted of a 30-minute run on a predefined track on campus. Participants ran at a self-selected comfortable pace during which running speed (km/h), distance (km), and step count were recorded. To standardize the cushioning properties of footwear, all patients wore the same type of neutral running shoe during the experiment (Ekiden 50; Kalenji, Villeneuve D'ascq, France). After running, all patients provided a visual analog scale (VAS) score for knee pain experienced during the exercise (on a 10-cm scale: 0 cm representing “no pain at all” and 10 cm representing “extremely painful”). In view of the active patient population under study, running was preferred as it is a basic component in (late) postoperative rehabilitation and in many sports activities. A 30-minute run was adequate to allow for cartilage changes to be detected using MRI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512473568">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512473568">25</xref></sup> Tibial plates have been shown to recover within 60 minutes after a 20-km run, providing a rationale to repeat postscans up to tpostt45.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512473568">15</xref></sup>

<title>Image Analysis: 3D Morphology and T2/T2* Quantification</title>
<p>Three-dimensional reconstruction, volume calculation, surface area calculation, and model registration were performed using a commercial modeling software package (Mimics, version 14.0, Materialise NV, Leuven, Belgium).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512473568">27</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Three-dimensional DESS image stacks were subsequently segmented to generate a 3D reconstruction of lateral/medial femoral/tibial cartilage (lateral femur [FL], medial femur [FM], lateral tibia [TL], medial tibia [TM]). A semiautomatic segmentation procedure was implemented based on a 3D LiveWire algorithm and a slice-by-slice manual correction to digitize cartilage plates by masking. Manual correction was preceded by a region growing algorithm to dispose of abundant voxels. Subsequently, 3D cartilage plates were reconstructed, and absolute 3D volumes (in mm<sup>3</sup>) were calculated for baseline and postscans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512473568">27</xref></sup> Normalized 3D cartilage volumes (ie, normalized to cartilage-bone interface area: [absolute 3D volume (mm<sup>3</sup>)/cartilage-bone interface area (mm<sup>2</sup>)]) were determined. Cartilage-bone interface area was defined as the area of the underlying bone surface in contact with the cartilage plate. By means of eroding morphological operations, surface areas were extracted from 3D reconstructions of the underlying bone and determined by means of surface triangulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512473568">27</xref></sup> Normalized 3D volumes are considered an equivalent measurement of cartilage thickness for the cartilage areas under study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512473568">13</xref></sup> and are referred to as “thickness (in mm)” in this article.</p>
<p>The T2/T2* relaxation times were derived from online reconstructed maps centered on the medial/lateral compartment using a pixel-wise, mono-exponential, nonnegative least squares fit analysis (MapIt, Siemens Medical Solutions). Regions of interest covering full-thickness cartilage were segmented, delineating the entire layers to calculate the global T2/T2*. Next to cartilage tissue, posterior horns of the menisci were segmented. Although cases treated with meniscal procedures were excluded, subclinical meniscal degeneration was considered important in view of cartilage health outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512473568">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546512473568">29</xref></sup> The 3D DESS WE images served as visual guidance.</p>
<p>All image analyses were performed by a single researcher with 3 years of experience at the time of analysis and who was blinded to the time sequence of scanning.</p>
<p>Intratester reliability, precision errors for volume, and T2/T2* quantification were determined (see the Appendix, available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ajs.sagepub.com/supplemental/">http://ajs.sagepub.com/supplemental/</ext-link>).</p>

<p>The Shapiro-Wilk test revealed an overall nonparametric distribution (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Hence, nonparametric statistics were executed, and descriptive statistics were reported as median (95% confidence interval [CI]).</p>
<p>To investigate differences between groups, the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> or Kruskal-Wallis test was applied. To test whether cartilage morphology for all plates changed over time, the Friedman test for repeated measures was implemented. Post hoc pairwise comparisons were conducted using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. <italic>P</italic> values were adjusted for multiple comparisons of main effects (“time” or “cartilage plate”) by applying Bonferroni corrections. Spearman ρ coefficients were calculated to investigate all correlations. Significant correlation coefficients of ≥0.5 were considered.

<title>Return to Sports and Surgical Delay</title>
<p>At 6 months after surgery, 8 of 15 patients had returned to sports. In these cases of return to sports, only 1 patient practiced the preinjury sport again (ie, outdoor running). The remainder engaged in another safe or low-risk sport: outdoor running (1/8), fitness (4/8), cycling (1/8), and swimming (1/8). Median weekly frequency was 2.5 h/wk (95% CI, 1.5-4.5). Tegner scores were significantly lower in patients when compared with controls (3 [95% CI, 2-4] vs 6 [95% CI, 3-8], respectively; <italic>P</italic> = .025). Whether a patient returned to sports or not did not correlate with symptomatic and/or functional status in this sample (for relevant variables in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512473568">Table 1</xref>, all <italic>r</italic>
<sub>s</sub> &lt; 0.4 and <italic>P</italic> &gt; .05). Reasons for a restrained return were intrinsic motivation (3/7), withdrawing from facility (2/7), fear of reinjury (1/7), and “not yet allowed” (1/7).</p>
<p>Comparison between controls and either patients who returned to sports or those who did not revealed no significant differences for all cartilage status parameters except for function of the TL during recovery. More specifically, at tpostt30, the TL showed significantly larger volume decreases in those who returned to sports compared with those who did not and compared with controls (−6.15% [95% CI, −12.10 to −0.96], −2.96% [95% CI, −12.11 to 0.22], and 0.04% [95% CI, −1.52 to 0.72], respectively; <italic>P</italic> = .012 between “returned to sports” and “controls”).</p>
<p>Among patients who returned to sports, timing of return was recorded the latest in the sixth month and the soonest in the fourth month after surgery. Spearman ρ revealed significant and strong positive correlations (ie, the sooner the return, the larger the baseline morphological characteristics) between time to return to sports and baseline volumes for the TM and TL (both <italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.76, <italic>P</italic> = .049) and thickness for the FL (<italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.76, <italic>P</italic> = .046) and TM (<italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.76, <italic>P</italic> = .049).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The most important finding of this study revealed that although no differences in cartilage volume and thickness could be shown between ACL-reconstructed knees and healthy matched controls, differences in biochemical composition were apparent at 6 months after surgery. Based on 4 measurements up to 45 minutes after exercise cessation, equal cartilage deformation after a 30-minute run among patients and controls was noted. Equal deformation between groups preceded significantly slower recovery of cartilage morphological characteristics in patients. Additionally, early postoperative sports participation was related to trends toward increased cartilage volume, thickness, and deformation and to slower recovery of cartilage morphological characteristics after running. Similarly, although all patients were operated on before 6 months after injury, a shorter surgical delay was associated with slower cartilage recovery after running.</p>
<p>Knee cartilage volume and thickness did not differ between patients and controls. In this regard, interindividual differences in cartilage morphology are suggested as being larger than side-to-side differences, potentially accounting for the present lack of significance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512473568">7</xref></sup> The rationale for including distinct control patients, however, was 3-fold. (1) After injury and during rehabilitation, overstraining of the nonreconstructed knee might occur as a compensatory overuse phenomenon to guard the operated side.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512473568">11</xref></sup> (2) Biochemical marker concentrations were reported to be elevated also in the contralateral joint possibly because of altered gait patterns and/or release of matrix fragments or cytokines into circulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512473568">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512473568">26</xref></sup> (3) Cartilage defects, meniscal injuries, and previous ACL injuries are possibly sustained in the opposite limb. Excluding those patients would have further impeded recruitment. Nonetheless, cross-sectional designs do not adequately reflect cartilage adaptations over time. Frobell et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512473568">9</xref></sup> monitored cartilage changes after surgery, revealing overall small changes that could only attain significance after 2 years. Hence, substantial changes might not yet have occurred at 6 months’ follow-up.</p>
<p>When compared with controls, T2 prolongation was detected in patients’ FM, and T2* decreases were registered in the FM, TM, and TL. T2/T2* mapping techniques are reported to target water content and collagen matrix. As opposed to increasing T2, T2* tends to decrease in case of degeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512473568">3</xref></sup> To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting T2/T2* values in ACL-reconstructed knees as soon as 6 months after surgery. One year after reconstruction, Li et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512473568">17</xref></sup> reported T2 elevations of 1% to 12.2%. Potter et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512473568">22</xref></sup> substantiated progressive prolongation of T2 in the FL from 1 year onward. Although the capacity of T2* in early disease detection warrants further investigation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512473568">3</xref></sup> overall, biochemical mapping results suggest diminished cartilage quality in ACL-reconstructed knees at 6 months after surgery.</p>
<p>Regarding cartilage function, deformation appeared equal among patients and controls. However, between-group differences revealed significantly slower recovery of cartilage deformation after running in patients for the FM and TL. Additionally, differences in significant time effects within groups suggest potential differences between groups that could not be statistically proven because of sample size. As such, a tendency is noted toward slower recovery in the FL and more deformation in the FM. Our results are in agreement with those of Hosseini et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512473568">12</xref></sup> who reported, during a single-legged quasistatic lunge at lower flexion angles (0°-15°), increased contact deformation in overlapping tibiofemoral cartilage layers in both medial and lateral compartments of isolated ACL-reconstructed knees at 6 months after surgery. Investigation of in vivo cartilage deformational behavior provides a means to encompass tissue resiliency, determining in part its vulnerability to degeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512473568">27</xref></sup> Collagen disruption, endorsed by the aberrant T2 values, causes loss of collagen tensile strength, which possibly accounts for the delayed recovery observed. Delayed recovery might induce a state of maintained deformation and dehydration as compared with healthy joints. Enduring dehydration may have deleterious effects on chondrocyte metabolism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512473568">24</xref></sup> In this respect, because of the fast and repetitive (high) impact loads to be encountered during sports, delayed cartilage recovery may be potentially deleterious, eliciting a negative vicious circle toward degeneration.</p>
<p>The results of our study are the first to associate an early return to sports with trends toward increased cartilage deformation and diminished cartilage function at 6 months after surgery. Although not significantly different from controls, a tendency toward increasing volume/thickness in the patients may be suggestive signs of OA onset. During early OA, collagen disruption causes water accumulation, resulting in swollen tissue recognized by the present abnormal T2. In support, in early OA, next to thinning, cartilage thickening associated with swelling was previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512473568">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512473568">8</xref></sup> Frobell et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512473568">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512473568">9</xref></sup> similarly reported central FM volume increases up to 2 years after ACL surgery. Notwithstanding the limited sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512473568">Figure 2</xref>), return to sports from 5 months onward (ie, 5/8 returners) seemed to be associated with deformation and recovery similar to the control group. As such, postponing sports this far may be more suitable for knee cartilage to counter excessive repetitive loads. One might argue that baseline measurements are needed to attribute the worse cartilage outcomes to timing of return to sports. This study did not include baseline testing because current rehabilitation guidelines advise against 30-minute runs being implemented in the acute postinjury or postreconstruction phase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512473568">16</xref></sup> Recent longitudinal MRI studies in ACL-reconstructed knees, however, describe baseline increases in T2/T1ρ along with decreases in delayed gadolinium-enhanced MRI of cartilage (dGEMRIC), which were attributed to blunt trauma. Subsequently, these markers of decreased tissue quality were described to monitor an attempt of restitution during the first year(s).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512473568">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512473568">20</xref></sup> Hence, in support of the current correlation outcomes, it is likely to suggest that the earlier the return to sport during the first year, the more fragile the cartilage and thus the more deleterious the effect of resuming sports. In agreement with the recent epidemiological literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512473568">1</xref></sup> and the rehabilitation guidelines,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512473568">16</xref></sup> the return rate at 6 months was relatively low. Fifty-three percent practiced some sort of sports, of which 12.5% reported a return to the preinjury sport. Actual return to the same sport does not affect the main outcome of this study. In fact, the current notion of cartilage fragility supports the advice to consider a delayed return to sports. In this regard, investigation of later time points would be an interesting lead for future research.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the sooner surgery was performed, the more cartilaginous functional decline was apparent at 6 months after surgery. In view of the body of literature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512473568">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512473568">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512473568">23</xref></sup> in this sample, with a median surgical delay of 2.5 months, all patients received early surgery, which accounted for the absence of substantial collateral damage on baseline arthroscopic surgery (as intended). Considering limited sample sizes, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546512473568">Figure 3</xref> suggest that surgery before approximately 10 weeks (ie, 9/15 patients) was associated with delayed cartilage recovery after running. Surgery performed within a 2.5- to 6-month window led to recovery comparable with the control group, suggesting adequate tissue resiliency. During an ACL rupture, considerable impact is cushioned, accounting for inflammatory processes and posttraumatic BMLs to present. On top of primary-phase BMLs, secondary-phase BMLs are introduced by surgery itself, accompanied by prolonged knee effusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512473568">9</xref></sup> Surgery performed promptly potentially endangers the joint’s possibility to allow the primary-phase effect to be adequately processed. Hence, potential biological side effects of surgery on cartilage homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512473568">26</xref></sup> might be amplified when patients enroll in rehabilitation. In case of the need for surgery, early reconstruction (ie, within the first 6 months or 1 year at the latest <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512473568">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512473568">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512473568">23</xref></sup>) is encouraged to avoid progressive cartilage and/or meniscal damage. However, based on the results of this study, proper balance with return to sports is suggested for consideration.</p>
<p>The nature of the protocol led to a relatively limited sample size. Although suggested outcomes agree with results from longitudinal studies using larger samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512473568">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512473568">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512473568">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512473568">20</xref></sup> and significance is attained for the main results, replication remains warranted for the sake of generalizability. Second, selection based on “clear arthroscopic evaluation” (ie, absence of concomitant visible cartilage lesions, meniscus injuries, or other grade 2 ligament injuries) was pursued to include a homogeneous sample, which facilitates the investigation into the effect of the reconstruction itself. It should be mentioned that arthroscopic surgery cannot preclude the presence of ultrastructural damage in the cartilage or menisci at baseline. With regard to the latter, next to the exclusion of cases treated with concomitant meniscal procedures at baseline, it is interesting to note that biochemical mapping did not reveal between-group differences for the menisci in the present analysis. Third, comparison with nonoperatively treated ACL tears and/or patient baseline conditions would be an interesting expansion of the protocol. However, healthy matched controls were our first option as the former 2 groups cannot serve as healthy references. Fourth, as this is a retrospective case control design, prospects in view of long-term outcome cannot be drawn.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This experimental study reports MRI signs suggesting cartilage fragility at 6 months after isolated ACL reconstruction in a young, active population compared with matched control patients. Although no macromorphological differences existed, ultrastructural MRI changes suggested early degeneration, corresponding with declining in vivo tissue resiliency. Diminished cartilage cushioning properties are proposed to be a potential danger in view of a full return to sports. Based on the results of this study, caution is advised for an early return to sports (ie, before 5 months after surgery), especially when dealing with patients who received early surgery (ie, within 10 weeks after injury).</p>
