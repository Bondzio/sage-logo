<abstract>
<p><bold>Background</bold>: Recently, clinicians and researchers started using diagnostic ultrasound to measure humeral torsion as an alternative to radiological assessments in overhead-throwing athletes and other clinical populations. Ultrasound appears to be a reliable, nonradiological alternative, but ultrasound assessment has not been validated against computed tomography (CT), the current gold standard.</p>
<p><bold>Purpose</bold>: This study aimed to establish the validity of an ultrasound assessment of humeral torsion by comparing data obtained using both ultrasound and CT, the current standard.</p>
<p><bold>Study Design</bold>: Cohort study (Diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: Humeral torsion was measured using both ultrasound and CT in 24 collegiate-aged baseball players. Comparisons between the assessments were made using both regression and Bland-Altman plots. Reliability and precision were also established.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: A strong relationship existed between humeral torsion variables obtained with ultrasound and CT (<italic>R</italic> = .797, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .635, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). The ultrasound assessment yielded reliability coefficients ranging from .991 to .997, with approximately 1° of measurement error. The CT method’s reliability coefficients ranged from .805 to .933, with approximately 3.5° of measurement error.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: There was a strong relationship between humeral torsion obtained with ultrasound and CT, the current standard of assessment. Ultrasound provides a reliable, valid alternative to CT for obtaining an indication of the amount of humeral torsion in the upper extremity.</p>

<p>Humeral torsion represents the amount that the distal humerus is twisted relative to the proximal humerus. The dominant limb of throwing athletes has repeatedly been shown to have more humeral torsion than their nondominant limb as well as the limbs of non–overhead-throwing athletes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512436801">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512436801">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512436801">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512436801">15</xref></sup> This increased humeral torsion has been linked to upper extremity injuries including throwing-related shoulder and elbow injuries in overhead-throwing athletes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512436801">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512436801">17</xref></sup> and has been demonstrated to largely influence glenohumeral rotation range of motion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512436801">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512436801">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512436801">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Methods for measuring humeral torsion include the use of radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and ultrasonography, with the CT methodology currently considered the gold standard.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0363546512436801">¶</xref></sup> Yet, radiological measures like radiography and CT, as well as MRI, pose some methodological difficulty that makes them less useful in both the clinical and research setting. Those barriers include cost, radiation exposure, time, and difficulty obtaining accurate measurements.</p>
<p>Diagnostic ultrasound has been shown to be a potential alterative to radiological/MRI measures, making it a tool that can be utilized for quick, accurate screenings in the clinical setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512436801">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512436801">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512436801">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512436801">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512436801">19</xref></sup> Unlike radiological/MRI methods, which directly measure torsion from angles derived from both the proximal and distal humerus, the ultrasound techniques described in the literature indirectly measure humeral torsion by calculating the forearm inclination angle relative to a standardized humeral position.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512436801">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512436801">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512436801">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512436801">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512436801">19</xref></sup> Ultrasound measurements of humeral torsion have reliably produced results that mimic the findings obtained using radiographic measures in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512436801">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512436801">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512436801">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512436801">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512436801">17</xref></sup> But to date, a direct comparison of the ultrasound measurement with the CT gold standard has not been conducted. This level of validity is necessary before it can be concluded that the ultrasound assessment is a viable alternative. The purpose of the current study was to compare the amount of humeral torsion obtained through the ultrasound measurement with the CT measurement in a cohort of college-aged baseball players.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-0363546512436801">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Twelve male collegiate-aged baseball players (age, 21.8 ± 1.5 years; height, 185.2 ± 9.5 cm; weight, 91 ± 13.2 kg) participated in the current study. A combination of both pitchers and position players with varying injury histories were enrolled to ensure that sufficient variability existed across the 24 upper extremities assessed (bilateral assessment in the 12 players) for the analyses performed. All participants were healthy at the time of testing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512436801">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>All participants attended one testing session, during which humeral torsion was assessed using both ultrasound and CT measurements. Before participation, all participants read and signed the informed consent forms approved by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Institutional Review Board.</p>
<p>Humeral torsion was assessed using the indirect ultrasound technique described by Myers et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512436801">8</xref></sup> Whiteley et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512436801">15</xref></sup> and Yamamoto et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512436801">19</xref></sup> Before the current study, the investigators established construct validity, reliability, and precision of the torsion assessment, yielding intrasession, intersession, and intertester reliability coefficients ranging from .96 to .98, with an average of 2.3° of measurement error.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512436801">8</xref></sup> Participants lay supine on a treatment table with 90° of shoulder abduction and elbow flexion. A tester positioned a 4-cm linear array ultrasound transducer (LOGIQe, General Electric, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) on the participant’s anterior shoulder with the ultrasound transducer level with the plane of the treatment table (verified with a bubble level) and aligned perpendicular to the long axis of the humerus in the frontal plane. The second tester then rotated the humerus so that the bicipital groove appeared in the center of the ultrasound image, with the line connecting the apexes of the greater and lesser tubercles parallel to the horizontal plane. A grid was applied to the display of the ultrasound unit to aid examiners with positioning of the humeral tubercles. The second tester then placed a digital inclinometer on the ulnar side of the forearm, pressing firmly against the ulna, and recorded the forearm inclination angle with respect to the horizontal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512436801">Figure 1</xref>). Because the ulna extends perpendicular to the elbow epicondylar axis (line connecting the medial and lateral epicondyles), this angle reflects the angular difference between the epicondylar axis (distal humerus) and the line perpendicular to the line connecting the apexes of the greater and lesser tubercles (proximal humerus), thus representing an ultrasound-assisted approximation of humeral torsion. Three trials were performed bilaterally by 2 separate assessors, both of whom have extensive experience in the ultrasonography measurement technique. Each assessor was blinded to the results obtained by the other assessor, allowing for intertester reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients) and precision (standard error of measurement) to be established for the data collected in the current study. Previous work by the investigators has demonstrated that ultrasonography assessment has high intrarater, interrater, and intersession reliability. Therefore, the mean of all 6 trials (3 from each assessor) was calculated to represent the humeral torsion angle for each limb.</p>

<p>Either before or after the ultrasound measurement (depending on the availability of the CT scanner), each participant was escorted from a sports medicine research laboratory to the radiology department of a university medical center. In all cases, the CT and ultrasound measurements were performed within 1.5 hours of each other. Computed tomography was conducted on a Siemens Somatom Definition AS (Siemens Medical Solutions USA Inc, Malvern, Pennsylvania) CT scanner. In most cases, the CT image was obtained with the participants’ arms placed at their sides. In 4 cases, the larger size of the participants dictated that the image be obtained with the arm in full elevation. In all cases, the limb was oriented parallel to the scanning table, confirmed with the laser sighting provided by the CT unit. Two-millimeter transverse plane slices were obtained for the entire proximal humerus (from the acromion, distal to the surgical neck) and distal humerus (from the distal shaft, proximal to the supracondylar ridges, distal to the elbow where the radius and ulna could be appreciated). Scanning these regions ensured that we obtained the necessary imaging to calculate the humeral torsion angle and the bicipital forearm angle from the CT images, while minimizing participant’s radiation exposure.</p>
<p>To calculate humeral torsion from the series of CT images, 2 assessors independently selected the proximal and distal humeral slices that each thought best portrayed the necessary landmarks to calculate the humeral torsion angle. To ensure that the most appropriate slice was included for analysis, the chosen slice and the slice immediately above and below were used to calculate the humeral torsion angle for each limb. The humeral torsion angle was calculated as the angle between the proximal and the distal humeral axes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512436801">Figure 2</xref>). The proximal humeral axis was established by identifying a line extending from one edge of the humeral articular surface to the other and then drawing a line perpendicular to the line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512436801">Figure 2A</xref>). The distal humeral axis was defined as a line connecting the most prominent points on the humeral epicondyles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512436801">Figure 2B</xref>). The mean of the humeral torsion angle from the 3 series of slices represented the humeral torsion angle obtained by each assessor for each limb. Each assessor independently calculated the humeral torsion angles from the obtained CT scans, allowing for the calculation of intertester reliability and precision.</p>

</fig>
<p>As a secondary analysis, to compare the humeral torsion obtained with the ultrasound measurement and CT scans using the equivalent anatomic landmarks, the bicipital forearm angle was calculated from the CT images. The bicipital forearm angle was defined as the angle between a line that connected the apexes of the greater and lesser tubercles (on the slice when the tubercles were most prominent) and a line that was perpendicular to the distal humeral axis (to represent the ulna) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546512436801">Figure 3</xref>). All CT image processing was conducted using ImageJ Imaging Processing and Analysis software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland).</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Agreement between the ultrasound and CT humeral torsion variables was determined through both linear regressions (with accompanying Pearson correlation coefficients) and interpretation of the Bland-Altman plots. All limbs were treated as independent; thus, 24 limbs (12 participants assessed bilaterally) went into all analyses.</p>
<p>While the methods used in the current study have been previously reported to be reliable and precise, it was important for us to demonstrate that these specific data used to establish validity were collected with reliable methods. As such, both reliability and precision were established for all variables in the current study. For the ultrasound humeral torsion measurements, 3 trials obtained from each assessor were used to calculate intratester (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 3,1) and intertester reliability (ICC = 3,k) and precision (standard error of measurement [SEM]). Similarly, reliability and precision (ICC = 3,1 and 3,k; SEM) of the CT humeral torsion data were calculated within and between assessors. The mean of the CT humeral torsion angles obtained across assessors represented the humeral torsion variable that was compared with the ultrasound variable. For the bicipital forearm angle (obtained from the CT images), only one assessor obtained this variable given that it was a variable of secondary importance. The intrarater reliability and precision (ICC = 3,1 and SEM) were obtained from the 3 trials completed for each limb. All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 17 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The primary purpose of the current study was to establish the validity of using diagnostic ultrasound for measuring humeral torsion by comparing it to humeral torsion data collected with CT, the current gold standard. To meet this purpose, humeral torsion was assessed in 24 limbs using both the ultrasound and CT methods. Agreement between the 2 methods was assessed through both regression analysis and visual interpretation of Bland-Altman plots.</p>
<p>The results of the current study suggest that there is a strong positive relationship (<italic>R</italic> = .797) between humeral torsion data obtained with CT and ultrasound, with 63% of the variance in CT humeral torsion being explained by the ultrasound data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546512436801">Figure 4</xref>). These results suggest that the assessment of humeral torsion with ultrasound provides a viable alternative to the CT methodology, especially in the clinical setting when time, cost, and radiation are concerns.</p>
<p>While the relationship between the ultrasound and CT methods is strong, there is still 37% of the variance that is unaccounted for in the regression model. We suspect that this variability stems from several methodological issues. With CT, the humeral head axis was defined as a line perpendicular to the line bisecting the articular margins of the humeral head. The articular surface was identified visually on each CT scan slice by the 2 assessors, potentially resulting in measurement error in calculating the humeral head axis. When we examined the reliability of the CT data (the current gold standard), it exhibited lower reliability and greater error of measurement than the ultrasound measurements. Thus, measurement error associated with the CT method may account for some of this variability, suggesting that, while commonly used in the literature, CT may not best represent a true gold standard. The analysis of 95% limit of agreement demonstrates that the difference between the torsion measured using ultrasound and CT can be different as much as 18° higher or lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0363546512436801">Figure 6</xref>). However, this analysis assumes that both measures are reliable and therefore may be affected by the lower reliability of the CT methodology.</p>
<p>An additional source of variability may be that the ultrasound data are affected by the amount of elbow carrying angle present given that the ulnar inclination is used to indirectly measure the distal humeral angle. It has been previously demonstrated that the typical carrying angle for male athletes as in the current study is approximately 10° when the arm is in extension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512436801">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512436801">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512436801">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512436801">22</xref></sup> The carrying angle decreases as the arm moves into flexion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512436801">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512436801">21</xref></sup> In the current study, the arm was placed at 90° of elbow flexion during the ultrasound assessment, thus minimizing this source of variability.</p>
<p>A final source of variability may be the inherent differences between the 2 methods given that different anatomic landmarks and ultimately a different angle are used between the direct method (CT) and the indirect method (ultrasound) compared in the current study. With the ultrasound method, the primary landmarks of importance are the humeral tubercles and bicipital groove, while these landmarks are not used for the CT measurements. The result is a consistent bias of approximately 38° that is evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0363546512436801">Figure 6</xref>. Potentially, variability with location of the tubercles and bicipital groove relative to the axis of the humerus (from CT scans) may account for some of the variability between the ultrasound and CT humeral torsion measurements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512436801">7</xref></sup> Because of the bias present, it must be emphasized that each method is measuring a different anatomic angle; thus, the data obtained from each method cannot be directly compared. But clinically, both anatomic angles represent the amount of twisting present at the humerus. Despite the potential sources of variability described above, the data obtained with the CT methodology mimic data for overhead-throwing athletes presented in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512436801">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512436801">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512436801">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Given that ultrasound assessment of humeral torsion is an indirect measure of humeral torsion, a subsequent analysis was conducted where the ultrasound measurement was directly compared with an equivalent angle (bicipital forearm angle) calculated from the CT images. As would be expected, there was strong agreement between the 2 angles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0363546512436801">Figure 5</xref>), with a bias of approximately 7° between the 2 measures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0363546512436801">Figure 7</xref>). This small bias as well as remaining 14% variability that was unaccounted for in the regression model was most likely a result of the minimal role that carrying angle plays when the arm is flexed to 90° as well as the influence of the soft tissue that is present between the inclinometer and the ulna when performing the ultrasonographic method. Given the strong agreement, we are confident that the ultrasound method is accurate in calculating the intended angle. The higher reliability associated with identifying the landmarks needed for the bicipital forearm angle (on the CT images), compared with the primary CT measurement used in the current study, suggests that more research should focus on the potential usefulness of the bicipital forearm angle as an indicator of humeral torsion when CT is used. It was the authors’ experience that it was much easier to identify the glenoid tubercles used for the bicipital forearm angle compared with finding the articular margins for the standard CT assessment. Overall, more research should focus on best establishing the gold standard for humeral torsion assessment.</p>
<p>Clinically, results of this study demonstrated that the ultrasound assessment can be used as a viable screening tool for the amount of humeral torsion present in overhead-throwing athletes as well as other patient populations. For example, Myers et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512436801">9</xref></sup> recently demonstrated that collegiate pitchers with a history of throwing-related elbow injury exhibited increased humeral torsion compared to pitchers with no injury history. Whiteley et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512436801">17</xref></sup> prospectively determined that the amount of humeral torsion present in adolescent baseball players was predictive of injury. The same ultrasound methodology (as in the current study) was utilized by both Myers et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512436801">9</xref></sup> and Whiteley et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512436801">17</xref></sup> suggesting that clinicians can use the methods for injury risk screening.</p>
<p>In addition to screening for potential injury risk, the ultrasound methodology can also be used as an adjunct screening tool for the assessment of humeral rotation range of motion. Assessing humeral rotation range of motion either as part of preparticipation screenings or the injury evaluation process in the overhead-throwing athlete is a very common clinical practice. Yet, it has been previously shown that the amount of humeral torsion plays a significant role in the amount of humeral rotation range of motion observed clinically.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512436801">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512436801">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512436801">12</xref></sup> A clinician may use ultrasound to assess humeral torsion as part of his or her humeral rotation range of motion screening procedures to determine how much of the amount of humeral rotation range of motion observed results from humeral torsion versus soft tissue tightness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512436801">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The current study has 2 limitations that warrant acknowledgment. In the current study, only 24 limbs from 12 participants were assessed. Typically, regression analyses warrant a larger sample size. But the costs and radiation exposure associated with CT hindered our sample size. Despite the lower sample size, a strong relationship between the CT and ultrasound assessments was demonstrated. Additionally, the current study only examined collegiate baseball players. Baseball players consistently exhibit more humeral torsion characteristics in their dominant limbs than the normal population. To minimize the effects of this limitation, we not only included their dominant limb but also included their nondominant limbs in the analyses. Previous work has shown that the nondominant limbs in baseball players mimic the amount of torsion present in patients with no history of overhead sport participation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512436801">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512436801">15</xref></sup> The nondominant limb data that appear in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512436801">Table 1</xref> are consistent with torsion present in non–overhead-throwing athlete populations presented in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512436801">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512436801">15</xref></sup></p>
