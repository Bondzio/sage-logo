<abstract>
<p>The recognition of his deceased father in an old war-time picture sets in play for the writer the undoing of the self through the temporal and fluid reterritorialization of the space historically delineated, identified, and owned by the collective signifier “father and son.” Aware of living in and contributing to the crisis of representation and instigated by the event of revelation, the writing attempts to show how this signifier is placed under erasure, how “father and son” becomes other, how previous resistances to reflexivity are challenged, and how, through a praxis of differentiation, a delirious freeing of the self is seen to emerge.</p>

<body>
<p>I see you sitting there in the bottom of the landing craft. I am intensely attracted to your face, to the wryness of the smile that shows as you look up to the camera above, to the cigarette dangling from the corner of your mouth that suggests a surprising confidence and sense of cool, to the helmet on your head, pushed back slightly to reveal an unusual calm irreverence in your eyes . . . you are my father; I know you as you sit there, the busy/ness of preparation all around you, other men clambering into the unstable boat, soldiers cumbersome and unsteady with their kit, rifles, backpacks all wrapped in the paraphernalia and the imminence of war. You are my father, I see you there; how is it that I recognize you, and yes, know you, even though as you sit there ready to do battle with your grenades and your guns strapped to your body, you are only a young man, a boy that I never knew?</p>
<p>I first saw this picture a few months after you had died. The book about the D-Day landings in 1944 that held it secret for so many years had sat on the shelves in the little flat in which you lived with mum. I know that you voraciously read books about the war and the appetite that you had for this never seemed to wane. Mum was tidying your things. I sensed the indeterminacy of her space and the uncertainty of her life as she flowed from the immediacy of your shared everyday presence in this little room to the immediacy of a lonely life of memory and loss that she lived until the day that she too died and left me to finish the clearing and the tidying in the little room that was the focal point of your lives for so many years.</p>
<p>She was sitting in your chair. She held the open book up to me and asked me to look. I leaned down and focused upon one page of writing, impenetrable to my gaze and one page dominated by a large grainy black and white photograph of soldiers in a boat, clearly readying themselves for war. Mum looked up at me, not with the cockiness of the young soldier that I immediately recognized and who was also looking up at me but somehow with the sadness of revelation that it seemed she now had to make. Her look was one of obvious pride, carrying with it a certain mischievousness and most of all a deep, deep sadness.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077800411429090">Deleuze (1995)</xref> says, “What history grasps in an event is the way it’s actualised in particular circumstances; the event’s becoming is beyond the scope of history” (p. 170). Dad had fought in the Second World War, had been a commando, had landed in France in 1944, and had fought behind enemy lines. I had seen the scars on his body, was aware of his sightless eye, and would wince when my mother described teasing out another piece of the razor sharp shrapnel that periodically worked itself to the surface of his pale, war-torn leg throughout his later life. I knew these things about dad, and yet, they somehow eluded my sense of self in relation to him.</p>
<p>Seeing this picture in the fresh unknown of the wake of his death started something flowing in me. The man that I had only ever known as “Dad” began to get free of himself, in me. Seeing this picture sparked a beginning, a beginning to live with him differently, and in this becoming, his life in me and mine in him began to change. Before seeing this picture it was as if his life in mine had somehow always been fixed, a living that felt, that seemed to be, in my world of childhood senses, unreflexive and simply just there.</p>
<p>I have remained mesmerized and deliriously inspired by the multiplicity of this event. Both literally and metaphorically I could not put this picture down. I would pick up the book, turn its pages to that place, and I would find myself careering off the rails into unexpected places. It is happening now! Becoming with this picture, sets up a seriality and a form of knowing that has taken me to the Deleuzian (1988) notion of “assemblage” (p. 257) with its vibrancy of multiple vectors, intersecting forces and lines of flight, its continual working with the play of plurality and change, and its resistance to the boundedness and containment of the more sociological and culturally inscribed notion of “group.” As I find myself living within an assemblage that I can always temporarily call <italic>becoming father-becoming son</italic> I begin to discover and work with a motif for my practice and my style. In this increasingly voluptuous immersion there is the beginning, and hence, a becoming of a loss of a sense of self, and with this the enforced separations of self and other and form and content begin to dissolve into mixtures and hybridizations. It is not that the name or the classification, the binary or the dualism, is simply or reductively done away with; rather it is that it becomes other within the active and fluid and transmutating life force of the assemblage.</p>
<p>In this new assemblage of <italic>becoming father-becoming son</italic> emerges a sense of self that I come to recognize and live with through the impact of the openness of that book and my mother’s revelation of that dark grainy picture. I became and become more and more aware of Foucault imploring me to get free of myself or is it to get free of <italic>one</italic> self, of the one self that does the holding on that creates and then establishes the holding back, the holding from, the very hold on life that binds it and strangles connection with the potentialities and fluidities of delirious existence? I hear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077800411429090">Deleuze (2007)</xref> say, “But from one to the other, there is no enlargement, or inversely, no miniaturisation: there is heterogeneity” (p. 255). In these knowings of me, in these knowings of you, I sense my desert becoming more populous, the differentiations that excite and cause these heterogeneities to vibrate and to multiply live more and more in worlds of intensity; I sense flows in these <italic>becoming father-becoming son</italic> transmutations that have never washed me before.</p>
<p>I have often smiled with Jonathan in his sharing of the story that tells of his mother’s slight incredulity and, I suspect, thinly veiled pride, when he tells her that he is writing another piece about his dad (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077800411429090">Gale &amp; Wyatt, 2010</xref>). I imagine them walking, at her pace, together, enjoying the gentle English sunshine: “What more is there to write?” she asks and though I don’t know her, I sense a slight mischievous smile on her face. I sense her knowing that there is always something more to write. Seeing the photograph of my dad gives me release in bringing me closer to the Deleuzian view that relational ontologies are always in flow and always involve transmutation: There will always be something to write.</p>
<p>The freeing of the self that this implies shifts and troubles the substantive in me, and in this newly emergent becoming, I am seduced by a presently hazy but becoming clearer image of a transcendent form of empiricism that moves me in sensation beyond the self of consciousness, memory, and personality, beyond a form of self that is both constructed and diminished by the subtle discursive manipulations of technologies of self. I will describe the intensive moment of seeing of my dad in this picture in terms of what Deleuze (1988) calls a “haecceity” (p. 262) and what is also close to Virginia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077800411429090">Woolf’s (1985)</xref> “moment of being.” In this reflective and refractive folding instant of re/cognition, I sensed my dad; I sensed my self and the relational space that we share in new, volatile, and highly incommensurate ways. I am becoming in my sense of <italic>our</italic> life as existent within assemblages, never fixed, always shifting, always eluding specification, and always living in generous virtuality rather than closed actuality. An awareness of and a working with a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077800411429090">Deleuzian (2004a)</xref> “logic of sense” is central to the creative evolution of such becoming. Deleuze claims that conventional and orthodox notions of sense, “common sense,” “good sense,” “nonsense,” and so on, lock us within a fundamental and firmly established <italic>doxa</italic> of representation. These can be seen to work to hold notions of difference such as “father” and “son” within specified unities of categorization. The logic of sense that Deleuze proposes is based upon and emerges from sense as an event, of difference as repetition, operating both within and to promote an always differentiating seriality of fluid, transmutating rhizomatic form. So, for Deleuze, bodies can be seen as causes in relation to each other, ‘They are causes of certain things of an entirely different nature. These <italic>effects</italic> are not bodies, but, properly speaking, ‘incorporeal’ entities. They are not physical qualities and properties, but rather logical and dialectical attributes. They are not things or facts, but events” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077800411429090">Deleuze, 2004a</xref>, p. 7).</p>
<p>So, for Deleuze, this logic of sense makes possible a very different life from that of humanism and phenomenology where the individual, the person with consciousness and subjectivity, lives with the issues and problems of a life that runs its linear course from birth to death and where sense data are provided as a means of contributing to that life’s wholeness and manifest completion. Living with a logic of sense involves, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077800411429090">Rajchman (2000)</xref> points out, “a kind of temporal indetermination of a life, which is prior to the ‘I think’ of representations . . .” (p. 130). In this moment as I begin to write my next sentence, “Seeing this photograph . . .” I am drawn to correction; I am pulled up by sense, and I am realizing that in that moment something more than, something different to, seeing was taking place. In this moment my father did not become something different; it was not as if I had seen another representation that I simply added to my knowing of my father by placing more sense data into some vessel of categorical unity; rather it was as if I found myself living differently with a <italic>becoming father-becoming son</italic> that I had never lived with before. As Rajchman puts it, “The being of sensation is what can <italic>only</italic> be sensed, since there precisely pre-exists no categorical unity, no <italic>sensus communis</italic> for it” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077800411429090">2001</xref>, p.9). As I continue to reflect upon this moment I continue to feel the exhilaration that I felt in terms of getting free of a knowing and a way of knowing my father qua becoming father. And of course, beginning to live within this new emergent father–son assemblage, the feeling of exhilaration is intensified by a palpable sense of getting free of the self that was also defined by similarly constraining notions of “son.” Again, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077800411429090">Deleuze and Guattari (1988)</xref> claim “. . . children draw their strength neither from the molar status that subdues them nor from the organism and subjectivity they receive; they draw their strength from the becoming-molecular they cause to pass between sexes and ages . . .” (p. 277).</p>
<p>The intensity of that moment, of everything that “seeing” my dad in that picture conveyed, somehow for the first time, somehow differently, reminds me of an observation noted by Francois <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077800411429090">Dosse (2007)</xref> and made by Jean-Pierre Muyard, on his first meeting with Felix Guattari in Paris in 1964; something of the molecular electricity in Muyard’s description resonated with my feeling of the impact of that moment:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I remember the impression that I had, I’d describe it as something physiological, the impression that Guattari immediately made on me felt like a startling vibration, a process of connection. The connection took place then and there and I accepted the energy more than the personality or the man himself. (p. 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>“I accepted the energy more than the personality or the man himself”: In coming to terms with this “being of sensation” that is integral to Deleuze’s logic of sense, it was as if the powerful energy of that moment created a re/cognition and prompted the seeing of the man that I had known all my life as my father in newly differentiating ways. In that electric moment I sensed cues, hints, and gestures, the fleeting allotropic elements of singularity that form the becoming of father and son. I am aware of the living, pulsing, ontological multiplicities in the relational space that exist in and between singularities and the assemblage and what Muyard refers to in his simple and direct language as “energy.” The categorical difference of my concept of “father” began reconstitution and differentiation in the affect and percept of that crystal moment. Again I am drawn to the words of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077800411429090">Deleuze (2002)</xref>:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[no posterity or lineage, but a proliferation . . .] . . . you are not the little Eskimo going by . . . you do not need to mistake yourself for him. But you may perhaps put yourself in his shoes, you have something to assemble with him, an Eskimo-becoming which does not consist in playing the Eskimo, in imitating or identifying yourself with him or taking the Eskimo upon yourself, but in assembling something between you and him, for you can only become the Eskimo if the Eskimo himself becomes something else (p. 53).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What is it about this photograph? The quality of the print is dark and indistinct; the darkness of the interior of the landing craft contrasts sharply with the bright reflected light shimmering off the water in which it sits. The faces of the young soldiers are camouflaged and dark, merging into the greyness of their uniformed shoulders and the gloomy shadows of the interior of the landing craft. My dad’s is one of the faces that looks up to the camera and the reflected brightness in his eye and the brief mischievous twinkle that it conveys paints a stark contrast to the sombre tones of the image as a whole. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800411429090">Deleuze (2004b)</xref> was drawn to the creative power that he felt existed in and exuded from the paintings of Francis Bacon and the way in which the fierce and challenging realism of their distorted heads and bodies demanded a continual and continuing viewing and re/viewing of the bodies with which his work engaged. He says, “The scrubbed and brushed parts of the canvas are, in Bacon, parts of a neutralised organism, restored to their state of zones or levels: ‘the human visage has not yet found its face . . .’” (p. 46). In this not yet finding of the face with Deleuze we are encouraged to live beyond the organism, beyond the organized bodies of science and forces of representation that would work to construct, identify, and stratify selves in particular ways.</p>
<p>As I now look again and again at this picture and become absorbed within the indistinctness of its depth and what I see of my dad within its dark folds and powerful affects, I also find myself with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800411429090">Deleuze (2004b)</xref> and his figure of the body without organs and the challenge that it offers to “the organisation of organs we call an organism” (p. 44). As I look into my dad’s face, peering up at me through the grainy image of the busy dawn preparations of this early morning raid, I am aware of my own “intense and intensive body” as it shivers and sighs with the shock of re-connection, re-cognition and re-constitution that looking at it has upon me.</p>
<p>As I reel back, the forces of these waves washing over me, I live with my father again: He comes alive in my life in different ways; the knowing I have of his repetition creates a difference that startles me. Coming alive in the vibrating power of this sensation is an “intensive reality, which no longer determines with itself representative elements” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800411429090">Deleuze, 2004b</xref>, p. 45) It is also here that I find my challenge to the all pervasive and highly restrictive imprisonment that phenomenology’s body with organs imposes upon us and to those neoliberal “technologies of self” that Foucault sees constraining us in so many ways.</p>
<p>As I pick up and focus again upon this photograph, I find myself being seduced by the twinkle in my dad’s eye and catch myself smiling back at him. As I write here now I have an image of thought that is full of gleeful wickedness, in the wave of delirium that is beginning to take over me; I am with him on the cliffs, overlooking the sea, walking in spring sunshine; we are laughing at something that is intuitively ours, the infection that I feel sweeping through my body, has grown out of release, and I sense desire in my movements; the intoxication is intense.</p>
