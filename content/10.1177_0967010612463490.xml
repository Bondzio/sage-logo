<abstract>
<p>Security studies is again reflecting on its origins and debating how best to study in/security. In this article, we interrogate the contemporary evolutionary narrative about (international) security studies. We unpack the myth’s components and argue that it restricts the empirical focus of (international) security studies, limits its analytical insights, and constrains the sorts of interlocutors with whom it engages. We then argue that these limitations can at least partially be remedied by examining the performance of identities and in/securities in everyday life. In order initially to establish the important similarities between (international) security studies and the everyday, we trace elements of the evolutionary myth in <italic>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</italic> and <italic>Angel</italic> – which both stand in for, and are, the everyday in our analysis. We then argue that the Buffyverse offers a complex understanding of (identities and) in/security as a terrain of everyday theorizing, negotiation and contestation – what we call the ‘entanglement’ of in/security discourses – that overcomes the shortcomings of (international) security studies and its myth, providing insights fruitful for the study of in/security. In conclusion, we briefly draw out the implications of our analysis for potential directions in (international) security studies scholarship and pedagogy.</p>

<p>The publication of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0967010612463490">Buzan and Hansen’s (2009)</xref> <italic>The Evolution of International Security Studies</italic> and the subsequent engagements with it in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0967010612463490"><italic>Security Dialogue</italic> (2010)</xref> highlight that (international) security studies<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0967010612463490">2</xref></sup> is again, or still, reflecting on its origins and debating how best to study its central concept, security. For Buzan and Hansen, as for others, the story of (international) security studies as a subdiscipline is told chronologically through an evolutionary metaphor. Most frequently, scholars tell this story to students via textbooks,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0967010612463490">3</xref></sup> but it is also a story that security studies scholars tell themselves. Beginning with a narrow understanding of security as being about the threat, use and control of military – and especially nuclear – force in strategic studies during the Cold War, the (international) security studies story emphasizes a shift over time from empirical and theoretical simplicity to empirical and theoretical complexity, and presents these changes as the ‘widening and deepening’ (see Chapter 7 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0967010612463490">Buzan and Hansen, 2009</xref>) of both the subdiscipline of (international) security studies and the security agendas of policy practitioners. However, academic analyses are not the only sites at which this evolutionary metaphor of security appears. Many elements of this story can be found in a seemingly unlikely place: the world of <italic>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</italic> and its spin-off <italic>Angel</italic>, collectively known as the ‘Buffyverse’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0967010612463490">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Buffyverse is also a fruitful site for examining the multifaceted and complex theorizations of in/security that we find in everyday life in the ‘real world’. At first glance, this may seem counterintuitive. After all, <italic>Buffy</italic> and <italic>Angel</italic> are television series, located within the genres of fantasy and science fiction, among others, and so generally assumed to be both merely entertainment and ‘other-worldly’. Nonetheless, we argue that the Buffyverse is directly relevant to the study of in/security for several interrelated reasons. First and most importantly, the central motif in the Buffyverse is, precisely, in/security: the basic premises, plotlines and narrative arcs of the shows all focus on characters’ identities, insecurities and attempts to produce security. Second, ‘popular culture comprises the primary sites, practices and frames through which people make sense of the world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0967010612463490">Rowley, 2010</xref>: 14). Popular cultural texts are produced out of the commonsense cultural resources of a given society. The deployment of such resources ensures that narratives and representations are intelligible and plausible within both popular culture and society more broadly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0967010612463490">Weldes, 1999a</xref>: 119). Thus, popular culture <italic>is</italic> the ‘real world’, providing us with meanings, including about world politics. Third, the continuous nature of the storylines in the Buffyverse, which developed over 12 seasons,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0967010612463490">5</xref></sup> provides masses of data for analysis and critique. Finally, in part through its fantasy and science-fiction elements, the Buffyverse estranges, exposing the taken-for-granted nature of commonly held assumptions and providing a space for ‘radical doubt and questioning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0967010612463490">Davies, 1990</xref>: 4) within which we might reassess our conceptualizations of identities, threats and in/securities. It thus provides a good site for challenging what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0967010612463490">Davies (2010</xref>: 178) has called ‘the conceit that IR [and (international) security studies] are constituted as separate from … the everyday’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0967010612463490">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The article is organized as follows. In the next section, we examine the myth of the evolution of (international) security studies. We discuss the components of this myth, including contemporary (international) security studies conversations about in/security, and identify some shortcomings in (international) security studies that emerge out of our analysis of the myth. In the second section, we show how the various components of the myth can be identified in the Buffyverse, in order to establish some of the similarities between understandings of in/security in (international) security studies and the everyday. At the end of this section, we highlight that the Buffyverse demonstrates in quite sophisticated ways that identity and in/security are mutually constituted social constructions. In the third section, we argue that the Buffyverse offers a complex – even positively messy – understanding of in/security as a discursive terrain on which identities and in/securities are constantly theorized, negotiated and contested in everyday life: what we call the ‘entanglement’ of discourses of identity and in/security. Conceptualizing in/security as a discursive terrain, we argue, offers some solutions to the shortcomings identified in (international) security studies. The conclusion draws out several implications of such messy everyday entanglements for potential directions in (international) security studies scholarship and pedagogy.</p>

<title>Security studies’ evolutionary myth</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Riley:</speaker>
<p>I suddenly find myself needing to know the plural of apocalypse. (B4.12)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0967010612463490">7</xref></sup></p>
</speech>
<p>The (international) security studies myth has several components (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0967010612463490">Table 1</xref>). The first of these is a powerful evolutionary metaphor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0967010612463490">Shah, 2010</xref>: 632–3) that allows a specific, contestable understanding to appear natural and uncontestable. Metaphors create equivalencies, helping us to understand one thing in terms of another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0967010612463490">Shapiro, 1985–6</xref>: 194–5); in this case, the evolutionary metaphor invokes a biological framework to account for and make sense of changes in (international) security studies scholarship. Its effect is to produce and naturalize a narrative that, by privileging some facts while marginalizing others, simplifies (international) security studies into a coherent account with a beginning, middle and end (or current) state. It distils a ‘shapeless past’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0967010612463490">Jenkins, 1995</xref>: 150) into a chronological account of a shift from theoretical and empirical simplicity to theoretical and empirical complexity, and constructs the ‘truth’ of (international) security studies as one of progressive phases: its widening, deepening and fragmentation/complexification. Moreover, even where scholars do not explicitly argue that real-world events drive changes in (international) security studies, the myth’s chronological structure constructs an implicit understanding of theory as both distinct, and following, from ‘external’ security practices. The evolutionary metaphor further reinforces this distinction in suggesting that organisms, in this case (international) security studies, are separate from their environments, the ‘real world’ of security practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0967010612463490">Shah, 2010</xref>). This evolutionary narrative is mythical in the sense that ‘IR myths are <italic>apparent truths</italic>, usually expressed as slogans, that IR traditions rely upon in order to appear to be true. The “truth” or “falsity” of an IR myth is beside the point’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0967010612463490">Weber, 2001</xref>: xvi, emphasis in original). The commonsense truth/slogan of (international) security studies is that, through widening and deepening, it has evolved into a higher, more complex organism (body of knowledge).</p>

<p>The myth’s second component is that salient security issues are those found in a postwar US/Western context. Even if the narrative is contextualized with brief preliminaries about Westphalian models of international relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0967010612463490">Buzan and Hansen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0967010612463490">Kolodziej, 2005</xref>) or the interwar period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0967010612463490">Walt, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0967010612463490">Baldwin, 1995</xref>), (international) security studies’ origin lies in the shift from ‘defence’ to ‘security’ after World War II (e.g. the 1945 formation of the United Nations Security Council, the 1947 US National Security Act). With the onset of the Cold War and the construction of Soviet and other international communist enemies, strategic studies emerges, focusing on external (communist) threats, the (Western) state as the referent object of security, a bipolar (East–West) balance of power, a stark distinction between the domestic and the international, and on military, and especially nuclear, threats. Security, in this ethnocentric context, is about the ‘use, threat and control of force’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0967010612463490">Buzan and Hansen, 2009</xref>: 12; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0967010612463490">Walt, 1991</xref>: 212; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0967010612463490">Kolodziej, 2005</xref>: 22–3) to ensure (Western) state survival in the face of these objective external threats. Once strategic studies is firmly established and the Soviet nuclear threat embedded within it, it enters what some consider the subdiscipline’s ‘Golden Age’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0967010612463490">Wæver and Buzan, 2010</xref>: 468) of simplicity, when (international) security studies was ‘simultaneously productive, influential and relatively coherent’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0967010612463490">Wæver and Buzan, 2010</xref>: 467). This aspect of the narrative universalizes the particular, taking the perceived situation of the United States and its Western allies at one point in time and generalizing it as an accurate model of the situation faced by all states at all times (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0967010612463490">Hoffman, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0967010612463490">Smith, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The third component of the myth concerns (international) security studies’ ‘widening’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0967010612463490">Sheehan, 2005</xref>: 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0967010612463490">Dannreuther, 2007</xref>: 3) or ‘broadening’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0967010612463490">Krause and Williams, 1996</xref>, <italic>passim</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0967010612463490">Christie, 2010</xref>: 177). Widening refers to two related changes, both of which expand what can legitimately be seen as a threat to security. Initially, what constitutes a threat requiring a <italic>military</italic> response is expanded. Such threats come to include not just the (potential) use of conventional or nuclear weapons by other states, but also such problems as ‘resource scarcities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0967010612463490">Ullman, 1983</xref>: 140). Second, threats requiring <italic>non-military</italic> responses become security issues. Examples include ‘catastrophic natural disasters’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0967010612463490">Ullman, 1983</xref>: 138), environmental degradation and change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0967010612463490">Matthews, 1989</xref>), population growth, and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0967010612463490">Weiner, 1992/3</xref>). In the 1990s, human security advocates continued widening by including epidemics, trafficking, lack of access to food supplies, denial of civil and political rights, and inter-ethnic conflict, among others, as security threats (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0967010612463490">Paris, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The myth’s fourth component, the ‘deepening’ of (international) security studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0967010612463490">Booth, 2005b</xref>: 14; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0967010612463490">Fierke, 2007</xref>: 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0967010612463490">Peoples and Vaughan-Williams, 2010</xref>: 7), refers to transformations in the referent object of security, revealing the inadequacy of a state-centric approach. Some scholars thus look ‘up’ to regional, international and/or global security, focusing on the transnational nature of threats (see, for example, interdependence, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0967010612463490">Keohane and Nye, 1977</xref>) and arguing that only states acting in concert (see, for example, regimes, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0967010612463490">Krasner, 1983</xref>) can address these. Others focus on the regional, international or global as the object to be secured (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0967010612463490">Bay, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0967010612463490">Lake and Morgan, 1997</xref>). A more fundamental challenge comes from deepeners who look ‘down’ to human security. On this argument, the individual should be the commonsense referent object of security (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0967010612463490">Buzan, 1983</xref>). This set of critiques challenges the domestic/international divide, in that the state itself is sometimes recognized as a threat to the security of individuals and substate groups (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0967010612463490">Ayoob, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>The proliferation of approaches to in/security is the myth’s fifth component. According to this element, (international) security studies ‘fragmented’ into multiple approaches – beyond the usual variants of realism and liberalism (such as neorealism, offensive and defensive realism, neoliberal institutionalism, liberal internationalism) – adding, among others, securitization theory and critical, feminist, post-structural and post-colonial security studies. These newer approaches offer alternative conceptualizations of in/security based on competing epistemological and methodological assumptions. They are generally seen as providing critical and/or constructivist analyses of both threats and the referent objects of in/security, highlighting in particular the mutual constitution of threats and identities (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0967010612463490">Shepherd and Weldes, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Various modes of scholarly dis/engagement between these approaches comprise the sixth component of the myth. Some see these approaches as in ‘dialogue’ with one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0967010612463490">Dannreuther, 2007</xref>: 210; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0967010612463490">Fierke, 2007</xref>: 2). This ‘conversation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0967010612463490">Buzan and Hansen, 2009</xref>: 262) revolves around theories’ privileged threats and in/securities, and their referent object(s) of security, as well as the epistemological and methodological assumptions best suited to studying in/security. But this conversation has produced only limited modes of engagement between approaches, which derive, in part, from a limited understanding of who does, or should, participate in security dialogues.</p>
<p>One mode of <italic>dis</italic>engagement is a retreat from dialogue in favour of a vision of (international) security studies as most productively pursued through ‘camps’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0967010612463490">Buzan and Hansen, 2009</xref>: 262), a theoretical ‘division of labour’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0967010612463490">Wæver and Buzan, 2010</xref>: 480; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0967010612463490">Buzan and Hansen, 2009</xref>: 257), thus representing (international) security studies as a ‘theoretical menu for choice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0967010612463490">Williams, 2008</xref>: 11). On this view, security scholars can and should pursue their theoretical and empirical interests as they see fit, within their separate traditions, without worrying about what others are doing (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0967010612463490">Miller, 2010</xref>: 645). Some scholars understand these positions to be so radically divergent as to preclude – and render unnecessary – further dialogue. Hence, some theoretical approaches are simply ‘mutually exclusive’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0967010612463490">Williams, 2008</xref>: 10), ‘incommensurable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0967010612463490">Biersteker, 2010</xref>: 605) or ‘irreconcilable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0967010612463490">Sheehan, 2005</xref>: 4). Yet another, contrasting form of <italic>en</italic>gagement raises the possibility of ‘eclectic synthesis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0967010612463490">Williams, 2008</xref>: 10). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0967010612463490">Biersteker (2010</xref>: 604), for instance, argues that ‘we should look for syntheses, for order out of disorder, and pursue … “the unity of opposites”’.</p>
<p>A final option, which can derive from each of these forms of dis/engagement, is a position of theoretical superiority in which one’s own approach is proffered as <italic>the</italic> correct way to study in/security. This position is not limited to one particular approach (nor are we immune). Indeed, some authors have argued that this ‘broadening and deepening’ of ‘security’ means that the latter term loses its analytical purchase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0967010612463490">Walt, 1991</xref>: 213; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0967010612463490">Baldwin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0967010612463490">Morgan, 2000</xref>: 40; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0967010612463490">Kolodziej, 2005</xref>: 2). As a result of the ‘fuzzy boundaries, contention, methodological quandaries and so on’ caused by widening and deepening, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0967010612463490">Morgan (2000</xref>: 40), for instance, wants to re-entrench a ‘traditionalist’ approach to (international) security studies in which security just <italic>is</italic> about ‘survival and physical safety’ to be achieved through the ‘deliberate use of force by states’. Similarly, critical security scholars have articulated theoretical superiority over both realist and anti-foundational approaches (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0967010612463490">Booth, 2005c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0967010612463490">Sheehan, 2005</xref>: 151–68).</p>
<p>Each of these modes of dis/engagement takes place between limited sets of interlocutors (the myth’s seventh, less overt, component). For example, one might be excused for thinking that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0967010612463490">Russett and Arnold’s (2010)</xref> article ‘Who talks, and who’s listening?’ concerns conversations between academics and other security practitioners but it instead concerns ‘networks of communication’ among (English-language) journals and academics. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0967010612463490">Biersteker (2010</xref>: 603) argues that ‘perspectives emanating from the centers of world politics should be corroborated with, informed of, and corrected by the views of scholars from the peripheries’, again privileging (Western) academic views of in/security. In his critical security studies text, in a section headed ‘Real people in real places’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0967010612463490">Booth (2005c</xref>: 274) discusses the implications that academic theories have for ‘real’ others – for example, ‘the people(s) of the Balkans, women in East Africa’ – but does not consider how ‘real people in real places’ might be theorizing in/security. The ‘partners’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0967010612463490">Buzan and Hansen, 2009</xref>: 264) in the (international) security studies conversation are academics and the in/security theorizations discussed are academic ones.</p>
<p>Security scholars do, of course, sometimes engage with elite policymakers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0967010612463490">Biersteker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0967010612463490">c.a.s.e. collective, 2006</xref>: 472–3). Elite security practices are usually brought into (international) security studies to validate, falsify or demonstrate the relative superiority or inferiority of particular academic approaches. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0967010612463490">Kolodziej (2005</xref>: 3) uses policy practices to ‘evaluate contending schools of thought’ in terms of ‘how close they come to capturing the [elite security] actors themselves’. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0967010612463490">Dannreuther (2007</xref>: 210) argues that ‘theories prove their utility by the extent to which they variously illuminate the [policy] issues under examination’. The focus remains on academic theory and theorizing, to be validated, or not, by elite practices.</p>
<p>Restricting the engagement in this way reproduces the radical (constructed) distinction between the ‘academic’ and the ‘real’. As a result, as our analysis of the (international) security studies myth shows, security studies ignores <italic>everyday</italic> security practitioners – by which we mean individuals and groups from the ‘margins, silences and bottom rungs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0967010612463490">Enloe, 1996</xref>) of world politics – as both speakers and audience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0967010612463490">8</xref></sup> But, we want to argue, everyday security practitioners, like elite practitioners (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0967010612463490">Rowley and Weldes, 2012</xref>), are inescapably immersed in theorizing identity and in/security. As Weber says, ‘if politics happens anywhere, it happens in the everyday, in all sorts of “high” and “low” ways’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0967010612463490">Weber, 2008</xref>: 138; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0967010612463490">Weldes, 2006</xref>). If we look at, listen to and explore ‘the world as non-experts see it and make it and use it, rather than as expert IR scholars imagine it is or ought to be’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0967010612463490">Weber, 2008</xref>: 138), we hear more complex and nuanced conversations about in/security, with important implications for (international) security studies. We return to this discussion of everyday theorizations of in/security, and the complex critique that the Buffyverse offers, in the third section of this article. First, we unpack how elements of the evolutionary myth appear in the Buffyverse, in order both to set the scene for the critique that follows and to demonstrate more extensively the ways in which the Buffyverse speaks to central concerns of (international) security studies.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0967010612463490"><italic>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</italic> (1997–2003)</xref> is set in the fictional town of Sunnydale, California, the location of a ‘Hellmouth’, ‘a center of mystical energy’ (B1.1) that attracts and nourishes evil and provides a point of contact between Earth and Hell(s). A cross-genre combination of fantasy, science fiction, soap opera, sitcom, horror and teen drama, the show follows the adventures of Buffy Summers (the Slayer) and her friends (the Scoobies)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0967010612463490">10</xref></sup> as they battle various supernatural and human enemies. At the end of season three of <italic>Buffy</italic>, Angel – a vampire with a soul and Buffy’s former lover – moves to Los Angeles, opens a supernatural detective agency and continues battling evil in the new show, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0967010612463490"><italic>Angel</italic> (1999–2004)</xref>.</p>
<p>Like the (international) security studies myth, <italic>Buffy</italic> begins with a conventional, simplistic conception of in/security. The first two seasons are rife with one-off ‘monsters of the week’: threats that are given, objective and external. Humans are the self-evident, unproblematized referent objects of security. The unmistakably evil monsters always attack Buffy – or other innocent humans – first, although they need not do so to be considered imminent threats. Threats are defined in terms of capabilities, and the intention to use those capabilities is assumed. Threats are decisively dealt with by Buffy through the use of force; just as in realism, relative force is what matters. Realism’s stark distinction between domestic and international is embodied in vampires’ inability to enter domestic spaces without explicit human invitation.</p>
<p>The balance of power is also starkly evident in the first season of <italic>Buffy</italic>. Although there are frequent battles with vampires and other ‘monsters of the week’, it is the overarching and ongoing war with the Master (an extra-strong vampire) and his vampire minions that preoccupies Buffy, as he tries to acquire the power not just to kill a few humans but to bring about an apocalypse (compare strategic studies’ early preoccupation with Soviet nuclear force). More overt traces of strategic studies’ World War II/early Cold War foundations – the myth’s second component – are found in the Buffyverse as well. The origins of the Initiative – the modern, hi-tech military unit that experiments on and attempts to ‘weaponize’ vampires and demons – are shown in ‘Why We Fight’ (A5.13). Largely through flashbacks, we learn that Angel was forced into ‘patriotic’ service in 1943 by US military officers operating under the auspices of the newly-created ‘Demon Research Initiative’. His mission – to rescue a submarine containing three powerful vampires on whom the Nazis had been conducting research – allegorizes the Manhattan Project and the development of the USA’s nuclear capability.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0967010612463490">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Buffyverse can also be read as widening its conception of in/security. Over the seasons of Buffy and Angel, threats and insecurities proliferate. As with (international) security studies, threats provoking the use of physical force expand – to the point where Riley wonders about the plural of ‘apocalypse’ (see epigraph on p. 515, above). In addition to vampires, the Slayer fights an increasingly diverse range of demons, witches, sorcerers, werewolves, shape-shifters, reanimated corpses, cyborgs, gods, and the U.S. military. At the same time, more threats appear that, while not requiring the use of force, are nonetheless considered salient in/securities. For example, access to food – that is, blood – is a chronic insecurity for vampires (see, for example, B2.8). Economic insecurity is a concern in the Summers household after Buffy’s mother dies (B6.4, B6.5, B6.12) and is ongoing for Angel’s detective agency. Homelessness is a recurring source of insecurity for teenagers in Los Angeles (A1.20, A2.12, A2.14).</p>
<p>The Buffyverse’s conception of in/security deepens, too. First, although in slayer mythology slayers fight vampires and other evils alone (B1.1), Buffy increasingly relies on Giles (her Watcher) and the Scoobies, thus performing a liberal internationalist notion of collective security. Teamwork is central to fighting the manifold evils at the Hellmouth (see especially B2.14, B3.22, B4.21, B5.22, B7.22). Second, the notion of in/security is deepened through the globalization of threats. In the first four seasons of <italic>Buffy</italic> and the first three of <italic>Angel</italic>, threats, even apocalypses, are generally quite local but, in later seasons, the threats become more far-reaching. The major threat in season five of <italic>Buffy</italic> is the potential opening of a gateway to hell dimensions, which threatens the whole of humanity. In <italic>Angel</italic>’s season four, Jasmine, an entity with mind-altering powers, uses global media structures to brainwash humanity. Third, state-centrism’s inadequacy is highlighted through the increased vulnerability of domestic space. No threats enter Buffy’s home during season one but, over time, the domestic/international boundary becomes porous: intrusive threats include a killer mummy (B2.4), a killer robot (B2.11), killer eggs (B2.12), a killer face mask (B3.2) and killer ghosts (A1.5).</p>
<p>The proliferation of (international) security studies approaches is also evident in the Buffyverse. Magic spells, whether uttered intentionally or unintentionally, are akin to securitizing speech acts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0967010612463490">12</xref></sup> These spells result in effects both expected, as when Willow casts a spell to reinstate the barrier preventing vampires from entering the Summers house (B2.17), and – frequently – unexpected, as when Xander fails to make classmate Cordelia fall in love with him, instead intoxicating all Sunnydale females (including vampires) <italic>except</italic> Cordelia (B2.16). Human security is pervasive and is best seen in the two series’ substate focus and their predominant concern for the in/securities of individuals. Feminists’ attention to gendered insecurities like female circumcision/female genital mutilation appear in ‘She’ (A1.13). In this episode, female demon refugees ask Angel for help in escaping from male demons, who fear the sexual power of their female counterparts and routinely perform excisions of the female demons’ ‘ko’ (an erogenous organ in the spine) in order to maintain male control over them into adulthood. Critical security studies’ emancipatory focus is also depicted: Buffy frees humans from a lifetime of slave labour in a demon dimension (B3.1); Anne opens a homeless shelter in Los Angeles (A2.12, A2.14); and Fred (the only member of Angel’s team not brainwashed by Jasmine) fights to free the others, even as she acknowledges that they seem happy under Jasmine’s spell (A4.19).</p>
<p>As our analysis so far shows, many elements of the (international) security studies myth appear in the Buffyverse: it highlights the Cold War origins of (international) security studies; it widens and deepens; and it proliferates approaches to in/security. To this extent, the Buffyverse reproduces the (international) security studies myth in the everyday. At the same time, however, the Buffyverse is more complex. The social construction of identity and in/security is not only made explicit to the audience (analogous to [international] security studies scholars) but is also self-reflexively accepted by the characters (the everyday security practitioners ignored by [international] security studies). During a sociology seminar at University of California Sunnydale, Willow explains social constructivism: ‘social phenomena don’t have unproblematic objective existences. They have to be interpreted and given meanings by those who encounter them’ (B6.5). However, the social construction of identity and in/security emerges much earlier than this overt discussion in season six. Through the characters’ experiences in the early seasons, characters and audiences alike gradually comprehend that in/securities are constitutively linked to identity, and vice versa. As the Master says: ‘We are defined by the things we fear’ (‘Nightmares’, B1.10; see also B1.8, B1.11). The intimate connections between identity and in/security emerge forcefully in episodes in which demons harness and amplify characters’ already-existing insecurities. In ‘Fear, Itself’ (B4.4), each character’s most deeply held insecurity is revealed as that which threatens their identity. Similarly, in ‘The Yoko Factor’ (B4.20), the vampire Spike attempts to undermine the Scoobies’ strength by playing them off against each other. Their ability to function effectively – achieve security – as a team is thus exposed as dependent on their identity security within that team.</p>
<p>In another divergence from the myth (with, we argue below, profound implications), the Buffyverse also expands who talks and who listens, in terms of both legitimate data sources and conversational partners. Parallel to academic practices, the Scoobies frequently use canonical texts (such as ancient chronicles and codices) and scientific and modern technological methods (such as computer software and chemistry experiments) in their research. However, for both the Scoobies and Angel’s gang, knowledge is recognized as both incomplete and opaque, and its status is fundamentally questioned. Characters are sceptical, even sometimes cynical, about information that derives from official sources and authority figures, such as the Watchers’ Council (see, for example, B5.12). They also listen more widely to those who have been directly affected by events and actively seek to bring them into discussions as everyday security practitioners (see, for example, B3.21, B3.22, B4.10, A2.3, A3.5). (We return to these claims in more detail in the final section of the article.)</p>
<p>Taking seriously the mutual social construction of identities and in/securities highlights their mundane nature as well as the everyday contexts in which, and the actors by whom, they are theorized. In the next section, therefore, we argue that the Buffyverse provides useful correctives to (international) security studies. Because, as our analysis of its myth has shown, (international) security studies theory is generally ‘alienated from everyday life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0967010612463490">Davies, 2010</xref>: 193), it has not yet sufficiently engaged with the everyday, either theoretically or empirically (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0967010612463490">Guillaume, 2011</xref>). In <italic>Buffy</italic> and <italic>Angel</italic>, <italic>everyday</italic> identities and in/securities, to which (international) security studies does not pay analytical attention, are theorized, negotiated and contested. Moreover, theoretical proliferation in the Buffyverse leads not to fragmentation but rather to the <italic>entanglement</italic> of diverse discourses of identity and insecurity, in the everyday.</p>

<title>The Buffyverse does in/security</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Buffy:</speaker>
<p>Nothing’s simple. I’m constantly trying to work it out, who to hate or love … who to trust … the more I know, the more confused I get. (B2.7)</p>
</speech>
<p>Rather than viewing ‘security’ as a concept that needs to be defined, broadened, deepened, and so on, by an academic discipline ‘alienated from everyday life’, we understand security as diffusely present on a broader discursive field, as a terrain on which multiple identities are performed and relationships played out. Viewing security – or, more accurately, in/security – as a discursive terrain allows us to take seriously the claim that it is an essentially contested concept. Because of its complex and appraisive nature, in/security ‘inevitably involves <italic>endless</italic> disputes about [its] proper use on the part of [its] users’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0967010612463490">Gallie, 1955–6</xref>: 169, emphasis added). Crucial, then, is not establishing the concept’s true meaning, but recognizing and interrogating its profound multiplicity and contestability. Understanding in/security as that which is theorized on an everyday discursive terrain allows us to see that everyday security practitioners operate with multiple, and essentially complex, understandings of identity and in/security.</p>
<p>Identity and in/security are fundamentally messy. As we show in this section, in <italic>Buffy</italic> and <italic>Angel</italic> we find multiple identities and in/securities, multiple relationships between them, and multiple discourses and approaches. We demonstrate how in/securities treated as analytically distinct in (international) security studies are always already empirically entangled in everyday security practices. Whether, in their daily lives, everyday security practitioners understand insecurities as complementary, competing or contradictory, whether they prioritize one form of insecurity over another, and how they negotiate the relations among insecurities, depends empirically on the ways in which they <italic>theorize</italic> these, whether they are explicitly aware of this theorizing or not.</p>

<speaker>Anya:</speaker>
<p>Maybe. I choose to feel threatened. (B4.13)</p>
</speech>
<p>The Buffyverse expressly integrates, and indeed privileges, everyday identities and in/securities. Fitting-in and coming-of-age anxieties – all rooted in identity – abound, and are seen as of equal importance to in/securities emanating from vampires, demons, and other putatively external and possibly apocalyptic threats (which in the Buffyverse also occur any/every day). Moreover, identity insecurities are not only teenage concerns: adult characters continue to grapple with identity issues – anxieties about sexual identity, relationships, academic proficiency and career prospects – on a regular basis. Giles, Buffy’s Watcher, experiences intertwined parental anxieties: he both fears that Buffy no longer needs him and worries that Buffy’s reliance on him retards her development (e.g. B6.7). Anya (quoted above), is concerned that the Initiative may act upon binary classifications and will not appreciate the distinction between demon and ex-demon. (In typical Anya-style, she hides her emotions by pretending that her fear is a rational and voluntary response to the situation.)</p>
<p>A variety of relationships between identity and in/security emerge in the Buffyverse. Above, we highlighted insecurity about one’s own identity. Conversely, certainty about others’ identities also has security implications. At the outset of <italic>Buffy</italic>, a community with clearly demarcated boundaries and essentialized identities – insiders (humans) and outsiders (vampires/demons) – is established, with rules governing how insiders and outsiders can be treated. Vampires and demons can be slain with impunity; humans are by definition worthy of protection and cannot be killed, no matter how heinous their crimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0967010612463490">Molloy, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>However, these identities become destabilized very early on, so that insiders and outsiders can no longer be so easily distinguished. Vampires can be ‘good’ (e.g. Angel, Spike, Harmony), demons can be unthreatening (e.g. Clem, Lorne), and humans are not always what they seem. Many have hybrid identities, such as Oz (a werewolf for three nights a month), Anya (a former vengeance demon), Doyle (half-human, half-Bracken demon) and Willow (who develops increasingly powerful witchcraft). Angel’s long-term enemy in Los Angeles, the law firm Wolfram and Hart, serves the city’s most powerful demons although it is staffed and run by humans (see, for example, A1.1). In ‘The Ring’ (A1.16), we see ‘humans consorting with demons; humans helping demons; demons helping humans; demons helping other demons. We also have humans … fighting each other’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0967010612463490">Molloy, 2003</xref>: 116). Indeed, identities become so entangled that the early opposition between human and vampire/demon in <italic>Buffy</italic> has been completely turned on its head by the end of <italic>Angel</italic>: in the final season, Angel and his co-workers accept the senior partners’ offer to take over the Los Angeles branch of Wolfram and Hart. The Buffyverse thus fundamentally problematizes and destabilizes the boundaries of the ‘we’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0967010612463490">Stern, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0967010612463490">Weldes 1999b</xref>: 105-7) to be secured.</p>
<p>Furthermore, denizens of the Buffyverse recognize, if sometimes belatedly, that operating on the basis of essentialized identities does not necessarily produce security. A striking illustration occurs early in <italic>Angel</italic> when, acting on an implicit essentializing assumption, Angel kills a demon he believes to be pursuing a pregnant woman, only to discover that the demon was her champion, and that Angel’s own actions have put her unborn child in mortal danger (A2.1). A longer-term example involves Faith, another slayer. After accidentally killing a human (B3.14), Faith begins to use her power both aggressively and self-interestedly and comes to be seen by the Watchers’ Council and some of the Scoobies as essentially evil. By kidnapping Willow and attempting to kill both Buffy and Angel, she indeed assists the season’s major threat, the Mayor of Sunnydale, in his attempted ascension to full demonhood. The ‘problem’ of Faith is handled by the Watchers’ Council: she is captured, sedated and transported, ready for shipment to England for trial but escapes before rendition is complete. This brutal treatment exacerbates Faith’s isolation from the Scoobies and pushes her towards the Mayor, thus increasing rather than alleviating the Scoobies’ and Sunnydale’s insecurity.</p>
<p>Whether characters reflect explicitly on the relationship between identity and insecurity or not, characters with whom we identity (‘us’) can become threats (‘them’). In ‘Gingerbread’ (B3.11), the threat is ostensibly witches who have killed two young children. In the face of their suspicion of witches, and in an attempt to protect their children from witchcraft, a group of mothers, including Buffy’s mother Joyce and Willow’s mother Sheila, form MOO – ‘Mothers Opposed to the Occult’ – and end up trying to burn Buffy and Willow at the stake. MOO’s approach is to ‘establish a predictable, systematic world in order to control it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0967010612463490">Breton and McMaster, 2001</xref>), thus paradoxically creating a world in which Sunnydale parents are willing to kill their children to protect them. In direct contrast, after Angel has killed the pregnant woman’s champion, he is distraught: ‘That it didn’t occur to [Angel and friends] … that a demon could be anything but trouble weighs on Angel’s conscience almost as much as the realization that he had killed’ someone protecting the vulnerable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0967010612463490">Molloy, 2003</xref>: 116). Even with the best of intentions, sometimes ‘we’ are ‘them’.</p>
<p>Having established the dense entanglement of identities and in/securities, in the next subsection we explore how characters within the Buffyverse theorize on the terrain of in/security, and how they conceptualize and debate identities, behaviours and threats. We illustrate the diversity of approaches and discourses upon which they draw and examine some of the many occasions when Buffy and the Scoobies, and Angel and his co-workers, disagree – both among themselves and with other (elite and everyday) security practitioners – about how to negotiate the terrain of in/security in their everyday lives.</p>

<p>If we see in/security as a terrain of theorization, negotiation and contestation, it becomes clear that security is, at best, only ever a temporary and localized performance. Unlike (international) security studies, which often implicitly treats the achievement of ‘security’ as the desired end state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0967010612463490">Stern, 2006</xref>) – such as the stability of Mutual Assured Destruction or bipolarity – Buffyverse characters are used to living with insecurity every day, treating it as a familiar, permanent, even humdrum backdrop to their lives. Buffy refuses to miss out on the Homecoming dance, for instance, just because yet another catastrophe looms: ‘If the apocalypse comes,’ she tells Giles, ‘beep me’ (B1.5). In a later episode, when Buffy’s sister is abducted by a demon, she says resignedly: ‘So. Dawn’s in trouble. Must be Tuesday’ (B6.7). Insecurity is both mundane and unavoidable; the Buffyverse is about how to produce temporary forms of security with respect to very specific identity–insecurity complexes. At best, there is ‘not safe, but safer’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0967010612463490">Koopman, 2011</xref>: 277), for a little while.</p>
<p>Everyday security practitioners do not theorize or act consistently according to a single theoretical framework, either over time or at any point in time. Buffyverse characters’ approaches to generating security vary according to context and their diverse theorizations of concrete identities and in/securities, which are sometimes constructivist, sometimes liberal, sometimes realist, sometimes feminist (etc.). On the US holiday of Thanksgiving, for instance, the Scoobies debate the ethics of allowing native American spirits to carry out retaliatory violence on leaders of the white settler community (B4.8). Willow deploys a post-colonial discourse in the spirits’ defence, citing historical grievances as an explanation and justification for their actions. The others, in contrast, would rather treat them, in classic realist terms, as simply an externally given evil/threat to be eliminated. In this case, the realist argument wins and, in the end, they kill the spirits. However, on a normative level, Willow’s arguments remain persuasive and viewers are left to ponder the legitimacy of the Scoobies’ decisions and actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0967010612463490">Wilcox, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In season five, Buffy and Giles disagree about whether to kill Dawn (Buffy’s sister, magically created by monks and introduced out of the blue at the beginning of the season). Given that Dawn’s death will close a portal between Earth and several hell dimensions, preventing demons of those dimensions from coming to Earth, Giles is prepared to kill Dawn; he can treat her instrumentally because she is not ‘real’ (B5.21, B5.22). Giles is also willing to (and does eventually) kill Ben, the human ‘host’ for the evil god Glory, who is attempting to find and use Dawn (‘the key’) to open the portal so that she can return to her home dimension. Buffy, in contrast, opposes killing Ben because he is an innocent human. Furthermore, despite being aware of Dawn’s recent and abrupt creation, because she has been implanted with memories of growing up with Dawn and views her as ‘really’ her sister, Buffy invokes an ethic of care and chooses to sacrifice her own life in order to save Dawn, as well as humanity (B5.22). However, after Buffy has been resurrected by her friends, she acknowledges that she would now be prepared to kill Dawn if she had to make the choice again (B7.17).</p>
<p>As these examples highlight, everyday security practitioners in the Buffyverse view discourses of insecurity as intersecting with – rather than as necessarily privileged over – other essentially contested concepts, such as justice, liberty, equality, and development. They also come to different conclusions about the relative merits of different approaches in different circumstances and self-reflexively acknowledge that identities, and thus insecurities, are dynamic and that experiences alter their perspectives. This section’s epigraph is a tongue-in-cheek example of the frequent discussions that the characters have with each other about what security looks like and how best to pursue it.</p>
<p>Expressly competing discourses of, and approaches to, in/security are most apparent when the Scoobies encounter the Initiative (<italic>Buffy</italic>, season four). This covert US military organization’s overt covert mission is to capture, research, control and eliminate ‘Hostile Sub-Terrestrial’ threats – that is, demons and vampires (B4.11, B4.13).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0967010612463490">13</xref></sup> In ‘Doomed’ (B4.11), we see the Scoobies and the Initiative pursue – separately – the same Vahrall demon, using very different methods based on divergent epistemologies. Initiative commandoes are briefed by scientists on generic Vahrall demons’ physical characteristics – size, weight, special hazards – with no attention paid to <italic>this specific</italic> individual. They use scientific techniques to track it, following its pheromone signature. The soldiers do not know where it is going but they do know where it has been. In direct contrast, Buffy and her friends use very different sources of information, including less ‘reliable’ texts, to determine what <italic>this specific</italic> demon is looking for, what it intends to do, and where it is going, although they have no way of tracking its movements.</p>
<p>Interestingly, both epistemologies arrive – quite literally – at the same place, when both search parties meet at the Hellmouth and find the demon making a sacrifice designed to instigate yet another apocalypse. In pursuing and locating the threat, at least, neither approach is superior to the other. Crucially, however, while the soldiers might have been equally capable of locating and killing the demon, their approach means that they cannot prevent the apocalypse – because they are unaware of the significance of the demon’s actions. Their method of killing the demon would have brought on the apocalypse. Buffy, in contrast, has researched the ritual and is able to kill the demon without bringing on the apocalypse, albeit not without relying on some military equipment. The Initiative’s ‘unknown unknown’ is known to Buffy – for whom almost all situations are treated as ‘known unknowns’ – because she retains a radical scepticism of knowledge claims and methods more generally. Nonetheless, without commando assistance, Buffy could not have prevented the threatened apocalypse.</p>
<p>These divergent epistemologies are reiterated when Buffy decides to join forces with the Initiative (B4.13). She attends a military briefing about ‘sub-T 67119’, identified as ‘demon class, Polgara species’, which the commandoes have been ordered to capture. Again, the troops are informed of characteristics such as its ‘distinct protein marker’ and its unique defensive capacities. As Forrest – one of the commandoes – has earlier stated, ‘They’re just animals, man, plain and simple’ (B4.7). However, during the briefing, Buffy raises questions concerning the demon’s motivations:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Buffy:</speaker>
<p>What do they want? Why are they here? Sacrifices, treasure, or are they just getting rampagey?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Dr Angleman:</speaker>
<p>They’re not sentient, just destructive, I believe.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Prof. Walsh:</speaker>
<p>They do have keen eyesight, however.</p>
</speech>
<p>The Initiative’s understandings of demons again focus on capabilities, treating them as essentialized objects rather than subjects with their own intentions, beliefs and desires.</p>
<p>Buffy later observes that questions are ‘an Initiative faux pas’ (‘The I in Team’, B4.13), contrasting the hierarchical command structure of the Initiative with the Scoobies’ deliberative and participatory approach, as well as problematizing the unquestioned authority of ‘expert’ scientific knowledge. In the Buffyverse, the sources of information upon which characters are prepared to draw include folklore, fairytales, nursery rhymes, prophecies, oracles and visions, as well as their own and others’ first-hand observations and experiences. Buffy, Angel and other characters also make use of informal networks, rumours, gossip and, occasionally, paid informants. Diverse people’s (and demons’) knowledges are taken seriously, and their life experiences given validity; nothing is excluded as worthless purely because of the method by which, or the subject from which, it was obtained (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0967010612463490">Feyerabend, 1975</xref>).</p>
<p>Indeed, Buffy, the Scoobies, and Angel and his co-workers seek out, listen to and assist people whose insecurities cannot be or have not been acknowledged as legitimate concerns by regular authorities, such as the police (see B2.18, A1.1, A1.4, B7.4). Similarly, Buffy is explicitly attentive and attuned to disruptions to the rhythms of everyday life, whether she is identifying vampires by their out-of-date fashion sense (B1.1) or diagnosing her new college roommate as a demon based on the roommate’s obsessive behaviours, irritating habits and growing toenail clippings (B4.2). Conversely, Buffyverse characters are often acutely aware of the dangers of <italic>not</italic> listening, of designating some actors and their concerns as not worthy of attention, as when a Sunnydale High student literally becomes invisible after being ignored by her classmates (B1.11). In ‘Earshot’ (B3.18), after acquiring an ‘aspect’ of a demon she has killed, Buffy can hear everyone’s thoughts and discovers that someone wants to kill everyone in the school. In order to track down the potential murderer, the Scoobies must treat as credible each insecurity that Buffy is able to identify from the jumble of thoughts she has overheard.</p>
<p>The significance of the critique of (international) security studies offered by the Buffyverse is best highlighted by contrasting the examples above with season seven of Buffy, in which Buffy and her friends revert to simplistic ways of conceptualising the world and threats to their security (see Buffy’s earlier critique of rigid binary distinctions, that we highlighted in the very first epigraph).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0967010612463490">14</xref></sup> Written and screened after September 2001, this season’s ‘big bad’ is the First Evil – pure evil – who plans to release thousands of Turokhan, <italic>über</italic>-powerful vampires holed up in caverns beneath the Hellmouth. The Scoobies, along with twenty or so potential slayers (girls who have the potential to be activated as slayers upon Buffy’s death), must protect the town, as per usual. However, in this season, opportunities for diverse practitioners to participate in discussion are radically closed down in favour of a hierarchical model in which an expert – Buffy, as experienced slayer – is the leader and only a small number of elite practitioners are authorized to speak. Democratic debate is shown to be inefficient and ineffective, negotiation and contestation are argued to be dangerous, and the discourses that dominate are militarized and realist (B7.19). At one point, Buffy leaves her friends and allies to fight alone (B7.20). Although the hierarchical and militarized approach upon which the characters have based many of their arguments is ultimately undermined in the final episode (B7.22), when all of the ‘potentials’ become real slayers, the narrative arc’s lasting effect is a severe shrinking of the terrain upon which in/security is able to be theorized and performed. In effect, this season reproduces much of the in/security logic of the Bush administration’s ‘war on terror’. It is worth noting that Buffyverse fans have critiqued various aspects of this season’s episodes and narrative arc extensively online (see, for example, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.buffy-boards.com">www.buffy-boards.com</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.buffyvampireslayer.org">www.buffyvampireslayer.org</ext-link>), inadvertently lending further support to the claim that, on the whole, the Buffyverse provides a space for interrogations of and reflexivity about identity and in/security.</p>

<title>Conclusions: Suggestions for future research</title>

<p>Let’s not jump to any conclusions.</p>

<speaker>Buffy:</speaker>
<p>I didn’t jump. I took a tiny step and there conclusions were. (B5.15)</p>
</speech>
<p>When we examine in/security in the Buffyverse, some distinctive features emerge. In contrast to (international) security studies’ theoretical fragmentation, the Buffyverse highlights discursive entanglement; where (international) security studies privileges academic understandings, the Buffyverse embodies the everyday nature of in/security theorizing; and where (international) security studies narrowly focuses on elite practitioners, the Buffyverse demonstrates that we all engage in in/security practices, however far from the conventional centres of political power we appear to be situated. Thus, far from being a frivolous exercise, analysing the Buffyverse has significant implications for how and what we research as scholars of in/security. Instead of attempting to demonstrate which theory best explains the world, we should be looking at how <italic>all</italic> of these theoretical approaches – realist, neoliberal, institutionalist, feminist, post-structural, post-colonial, and so on – are being deployed on an everyday basis by everyday people. This means reconceiving the relationship between theory (theorizing, theorists) and practice (practising, practitioners), and acknowledging that everyone, not just academics and policy elites, does security. Theorizing is both a form of practice and an inescapable component of practice. As scholars, we therefore need to stop talking about – and very occasionally at (a very small, elite portion of) – the world and start listening to its inhabitants, in order to discover the wealth of what we do not know about how in/securities are theorized and, crucially, how these are theorized in and through everyday practices.</p>
<p>This, in turn, means accepting the messiness of everyday in/security discourses and practices and investigating these <italic>as</italic> contested and entangled, rather than attempting to tease out or abstract some unified and overarching ‘theory of security’. It means admitting that security is done in spaces we scholars of (international) security studies, and of international relations more broadly, often ignore, or downplay: the bedroom, the playground, the coffee shop, the cinema, the swimming pool, the construction site and the office are just some examples (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0967010612463490">Enloe, 2011</xref>). Instead of relegating the analysis of everyday life to cultural studies, anthropology or women’s studies, (international) security studies needs to take seriously – and on their own terms – the approaches and concepts that scholars in these disciplines have developed, and learn how to research in/security in new, entangled ways. Capturing snapshots of these entanglements within everyday life by everyday security practitioners means diversifying our research methods. Discursive and visual analytical tools, and ethnographic and participant-observation techniques, for instance, offer clear strengths to the researcher interested in mundane practices, in everyday theorizations, and in their entanglement.</p>
<p>Finally, pedagogical implications derive from our argument: we must consider how we teach and represent ‘security’ and ‘security studies’, and recognize the limitations of presenting neatly packaged accounts of how (international) security studies has become established as a subdiscipline (even if we do provide occasional caveats about omissions, elisions and simplifications). Acknowledging that the world is messy and cannot easily or unproblematically be parsed for analysis – that we lose as much as, if not more than, we gain through employing rigid categorizations, abstractions and generalizations – is perhaps the most valuable lesson we can impart to the next generation of scholars as they embark upon their own studies. As Buffy says about everyday life: ‘If you could hear what they’re feeling. The confusion, the loneliness…. It looks quiet down there. It’s not. It’s deafening’ (B3.18).</p>

<p>We designate episodes of <italic>Buffy</italic> (B) and <italic>Angel</italic> (A) by giving the season and then the episode within it. So, B2.7 refers to the seventh episode of the second series, ‘Lie to Me’. For a complete list of all the <italic>Buffy</italic> and <italic>Angel</italic> episodes referred to in the paper, see the bibliographic entries for the two shows. For this and each subsequent section of the paper, we have provided an epigraph from <italic>Buffy</italic> that speaks to the arguments we put forward. Our intention had been for these epigraphs to function as encouragement to the reader to pause and reflect on the connections between the epigraphs and the arguments. However, for copyright reasons, we are unable to include these epigraphs without also providing explicit commentary in the text (grr, argh).

<p>Matt Davies’ excellent analysis of work in Buffy (2010) also uses Buffy to get at both the importance and the neglect of the everyday in international relations.

<p>There are, over the course of seven seasons of Buffy and five of Angel, at least 14 apocalypses, resulting from a variety of causes and perpetrators (including apocalypses brought on by Willow and Angel). An alternative epigraph for this section – one which draws attention to <italic>Buffy’s</italic> awareness of feminist critiques of academic elitism and the restricted nature of ‘legitimate’ interlocutors in security dialogues –might have been Giles’ colleague Jenny Calendar’s observation: ‘you think that knowledge should be kept in these carefully guarded repositories where only a handful of white guys can get at it’ (B1.8).</p></fn>
