<abstract>
<p>The aim of this article is to investigate how a contemplative orientation to teaching may facilitate wholeness for teachers and students through a portrait of Diana, a kindergarten teacher working in a contemplative elementary school. The portrait, one of three portraits from a larger study, illustrates three central features of contemplative teaching: compassion, integrity, and mindful awareness. These three central features develop internally within individual teachers and are animated and influenced externally through their role as teachers. The context of their teaching, relationships with students, parents, and colleagues, and pedagogical choices, in turn influence the three central features. The emphasis on wholeness, unity, and integration of a contemplative orientation to teaching moves us toward a view of teachers and students as beings with not only minds and heads but also hearts and bodies. Contemplative teaching offers educational communities a path toward transformational, holistic, and integrative learning and teaching.</p>

<p>In a contemplative orientation to teaching,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1541344612456431">1</xref>
</sup> there is a seamless interconnection between inner and outer as illustrated by the Mobius strip. Mobius strips are unique because of their one sidedness. Rather than having two sides and two edges, with a simple twist a piece of paper has one side and one edge. Inner and outer become one. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1541344612456431">Palmer (2004)</xref> ruminated about the implications of the Mobius strip for human lives.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I have to keep repeating, “what seems to be” because there is no “inside” or “outside” on the Mobius strip—the two apparent sides keep co-creating each other. The mechanics of the Mobius strip are mysterious, but its message is clear; whatever is inside us continually flows outward to help form, or deform, the world—and whatever is outside us continually flows inward to help form, or deform, our lives. The Mobius strip is like life itself; here, ultimately, there is only one reality. (p. 47)</p>

</fig>
</disp-quote>
<p>The interconnection reflected in the Mobius strip is a keystone of a contemplative orientation to teaching. What is internal is influenced and influences what is external and vice versa. “Contemplative teaching begins by knowing and experiencing ourselves directly. We unlearn how we habitually think, sense, and feel, so we can return to the present moment freshly and clearly” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1541344612456431">Brown, 1998</xref>, p. 70). The qualities of compassion, integrity, and mindful awareness are situated internally within each individual teacher and yet are intimately connected to, influenced by, and impact the external world. A teacher’s acknowledgement, appreciation, and work to understand her or his inner life support the capacity to teach with compassion, integrity, and mindful awareness.</p>
<p>Contemplative teaching offers an educational vision with the goals of both personal and societal transformation. Contemplative teaching is “a set of pedagogical practices, originally developed in the great contemplative traditions of the world, that have as their aim personal growth and social transformation through the cultivation of conscious awareness and volition in an ethical-relational context” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1541344612456431">Roeser &amp; Peck, 2009</xref>, pp. 119–120). While contemplative teaching has long traditions in religious education and training, its relevance and value in how we teach young people in secular environments has garnered attention in North America through the work of scholars such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1541344612456431">Brady (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1541344612456431">Brown (1998)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1541344612456431">Hart (2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1541344612456431">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1541344612456431">2008</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1541344612456431">Jennings (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1541344612456431">2011</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1541344612456431">Kahane (2009)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1541344612456431">Lichtmann (2005)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1541344612456431">Miller (1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1541344612456431">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1541344612456431">2006</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1541344612456431">O’Reilley (1998)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1541344612456431">Palmer and Zajonc (2010)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1541344612456431">Roeser and Peck (2009)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1541344612456431">Zajonc (2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1541344612456431">2009</xref>), and other scholars connected with the Center for Contemplative Mind in Society, the Garrison Institute’s Initiative on Contemplative and Education, and the Mind and Life Institute.<sup>

<p>Interest in contemplative teaching has emerged recently among educational practitioners and researchers because of its emphasis on wholeness and potential for transformation, which run counter to many contemporary mainstream educational practices that emphasize isolated knowledge and transmission.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The practical legacy of the modernist tradition is a compartmentalized, fragmented way of learning and teaching, dualistic alienation of body from mind, emotion from intellect, humans from nature, and art from science, whereas the basis of contemplative understanding is wholeness, unity, integration. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1541344612456431">Bush, 2006</xref>, p. 1723)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Contemplative teaching, like contemplative understanding (as described above), is an orientation to the processes of teaching and learning that is based on wholeness. Wholeness embraces both strengths and weaknesses and thrives on paradox; seeming contradictions such as art and science can actually complement each other. A teacher with a contemplative orientation attempts to teach with compassion, integrity, and mindful awareness. These three qualities of being are revealed in descriptions and observations of one’s teaching self, relationships with others, and pedagogy. They will be discussed in depth in the portrait of Diana,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1541344612456431">3</xref>
</sup> a kindergarten teacher.</p>
<p>Teaching with <italic>compassion</italic> involves feelings of empathy and loving-kindness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1541344612456431">Jerslid (1955)</xref> comments, “To be compassionate means to partake in passion: the passions of others, the passions that arise within oneself” (p. 126). Compassion is characterized by being open to and moved by suffering; feelings of caring and kindness; taking an understanding, nonjudgmental attitude toward inadequacies and failures; and recognizing that one’s experience is part of the common human experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1541344612456431">Neff, 2003</xref>). The sharing of passions and the embodiment of compassion between teachers and students creates learning environments that recognize the centrality of wholeness for meaningful learning and relationships. Wholeness includes suffering and failure as well as kindness and passion.</p>
<p>Teaching with <italic>integrity</italic> involves honoring and utilizing aspects of one’s identity in one’s work. We teach who we are (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1541344612456431">Palmer, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1541344612456431">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1541344612456431">2004</xref>). Teaching with integrity involves congruence between a person’s inner life and their external role as a teacher. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1541344612456431">Palmer (1997)</xref> believes that teachers who teach with integrity are models of good teaching. “. . . [G]ood teaching comes from the identity and integrity of the teacher” (p. 16). Teaching with integrity is variable and individual and when guided by the qualities of compassion and mindful awareness serves to enhance the learning of all students and teachers through a desire for wholeness. One dictionary definition of integrity is “the state of being whole, entire, or undiminished.” bell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541344612456431">hooks (2003)</xref> explains how important one’s integrity is to one’s work as a teacher. “All the work we do, no matter how brilliant or revolutionary in thought or action, loses power and meaning if we lack integrity of being” (p. 164). Teachers who are open to bringing their whole selves to their work with learners connect their inner life with their role as a teacher.</p>
<p>Teaching with <italic>mindful awareness</italic> is a quality of mind that allows a teacher to attend simultaneously to both the minute details and wholeness in a moment. Mindfulness focuses on the minute, the immediate, while awareness offers a more global picture. Ellen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1541344612456431">Langer’s (1989)</xref> groundbreaking book <italic>Mindfulness</italic> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1541344612456431">1997</xref> follow-up <italic>The Power of</italic> <italic>Mindful Learning</italic> have been integral to an understanding of this concept in educational contexts. Teaching with mindful awareness is central to contemplative teaching because “like all contemplative disciplines, it deals with the whole rather than with the parts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1541344612456431">O’Reilley, 1998</xref>, p. 21). Mindful awareness focuses on wholeness, on the process, and on the potential of oneself, others, and the moment through a quality of attention. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1541344612456431">Senge, Scharmer, Joaworski, and Flowers (2004)</xref> describe mindful awareness as being “. . . fully conscious and aware in the present moment” through a process of “. . . deep listening, of being open beyond one’s preconceptions and historical ways of letting go of old identities and the need to control” and “. . . a state of ‘letting come’ . . . ” (pp. 13–14). Mindful awareness is not a static state a teacher attains but rather a constant process of returning again and again to the present moment guided by a sense of the whole.</p>
<p>Contemplative teaching is a framework that enables transformative experiences for teachers, students, and educational communities. Transformation means to change one’s current form and describes both a process and an outcome. Transformative learning theory’s roots of Paulo Friere, Jack Mezirow, Larry Daloz, and Robert Boyd have been extended and elaborated by scholars such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1541344612456431">Baumgartner (2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1541344612456431">2012</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1541344612456431">Clark (1993)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1541344612456431">Cranton (1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1541344612456431">1996</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1541344612456431">Dirkx (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1541344612456431">1998</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1541344612456431">Kegan (2000)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1541344612456431">O’Sullivan (1999)</xref>, and Taylor (1997). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1541344612456431">Dirkx (1998)</xref> compares transformational learning to instrumental learning and argues how transformative educators “teach the content with a different end in view, often using quite different instructional strategies” (p. 2). The emphasis on process and outcomes of consciousness raising, critical reflection or perspective changing, developmental growth or individuation distinguishes this approach to learning.</p>
<p>Arthur Zajonc, the former academic program director at the Center for Contemplative Mind in Society and current Executive Director or the Mind and Life Institute, insightfully shared in an article on contemplative education, “Knowledge, from the point of view of a contemplative tradition, is not primarily object-oriented. It is epiphany- or insight-oriented. It’s not good enough to know about reality; you need to change how you see reality. Real education is transformation” (cited in Boyce, 2007, p. 73). In order to facilitate transformative experiences for students, teachers require personally transformative experiences in their lives. Teachers’ transformative experiences have the potential to develop and enhance their ability to teach with compassion, integrity, and mindful awareness. Contemplative teaching and transformation exist in a symbiotic, interdependent relationship in which practitioner teachers create the opportunities for unique, transformative experiences for their students.</p>
<p>“Transformation is a movement toward increasing wholeness that simultaneously pushes toward diversity and uniqueness—become more uniquely who we are, and toward unity—recognizing how much we have in common with the universe (and perhaps even the recognition that we are the universe)” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1541344612456431">Hart, 2000</xref>, p. 26). Wholeness can be described as undivided or as an entity or system of interrelated parts. Wholeness involves welcoming and connecting all aspects of being human. An orientation toward wholeness accepts the good and the bad and purports that you cannot have one without the other. Transformation toward increasing wholeness is the goal for a contemplative teaching and learning environment.</p>
<p>The portrait presented below is one of three portraits in a larger study of a contemplative elementary school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1541344612456431">Byrnes, 2009</xref>). This larger study aims to understand and describe the principles and practices of contemplative teaching. The other two portraits focus on the co-teachers of first and second grades. In this article, the kindergarten teacher, Diana, is presented because of her unique role working independently to guide and facilitate student learning. Diana’s attempts to integrate her inner life with her contemplative approach to her role as teacher reveal both her strengths and limitations in exhibiting compassion, integrity, and mindful awareness in her teaching. She transforms toward greater wholeness through her successes and her struggles as a teacher and she creates opportunities for her students to learn from both their successes and their struggles.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Portraiture serves as an appropriate method to study contemplative teaching practices because of its emphasis on connection rather than separation, on seeing the universal through the particular, and on self-awareness and transformation of both participant and portraitist. Portraiture, like case study, attempts to detail an individual story with the underlying premise that “. . . as one moves closer to the unique characteristics of a person or place, one discovers the universal” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1541344612456431">Lawrence-Lightfoot &amp; Hoffman-Davis, 1997</xref>, p. 14). Portraiture retains many similarities to case study methods in its reliance on data sources obtained utilizing methods such as interviews, observations, and artifacts. It also departs from these methods in its placement of the researcher at the heart of the research process and in its search for goodness, for what is working.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>… portraiture is a method framed by the traditions and values of the phenomenological paradigm, sharing many of the techniques, standards, and goals of ethnography. But it pushes against the constraints of those traditions and practices in its explicit effort to combine empirical and aesthetic description, in its focus on the convergence of narrative and analysis, in its goal of speaking to broader audiences beyond the academy (thus linking inquiry to public discourse and social transformation), in its standard to authenticity rather than reliability and validity (the traditional standards of quantitative and qualitative inquiry), and in its explicit recognition of the use of the self as the primary research instrument for documenting and interpreting the perspectives and experiences of the people and the cultures being studied. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1541344612456431">Lawrence-Lightfoot &amp; Hoffman Davis, 1997</xref>, pp. 13–14)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541344612456431">Ladson-Billings (2005)</xref> observes, portraiture is a methodology that is “more than a new way to do narrative scholarship; it is also a new way to ask important epistemological questions about the variety of ways we can come to know another human being” (p. xvi). A central component of both portraiture and contemplative teaching is seeing oneself and others clearly. Portraitists attempt to “record and interpret the perspectives and experience of the people they are studying, documenting their voices and their visions—their authority, knowledge, and wisdom” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1541344612456431">Lawrence-Lightfoot &amp; Hoffman Davis, 1997</xref>, p. xv). Similarly to contemplative teaching, portraiture focuses on wholeness, integration, connection, awareness of the present moment, and the quality of experience.</p>
<sec id="section2-1541344612456431">
<title>Research Setting</title>
<p>The teachers selected for the larger study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1541344612456431">Byrnes, 2009</xref>) all taught at a small, independent elementary school located in Pebble City in the Western United States. The school’s mission was to offer a contemplative education to students in grades kindergarten through second grade. Pebble City offers a unique context for studying contemplative teaching in that it is the home of a Buddhist-affiliated university with a contemplative education department. There is a contemplative preschool affiliated with the university and in 2006, the first contemplative elementary school, The Gandhi School, opened under the direction of an alumnus of the university. The mission of the contemplative elementary school was to “develop a comprehensive reform model for contemplative education that can serve children from all cultural, religious, and socio-economic backgrounds. Our aim is to draw forth students’ faculties of clear thinking, empathic feeling, and skillful action so that they may find meaning in their own life and the necessary inner resources to be truly helpful to others” (school website).</p>
<p>The school was chosen as a research site because of its mission to design and implement a contemplative education reform model. The Gandhi School conceptualized education as a path involving three journeys: intelligence, compassion, and confidence. Intelligence was described as both acquiring and situating knowledge and being able to distinguish and discriminate. Compassion was the ability to have one’s own sense of self through increased individualism, which was paralleled by and intersected with a sense of belonging. Confidence was the ability to know oneself in a way that allows one to act in the world in ways that manifests intelligence and compassion. These three journeys were visualized as occurring for students, teachers, and families.</p>
<p>The mission of the school was to deepen intelligence, compassion, and confidence through five guiding principles that were tied to particular domains of learning. The guiding principles mirrored development that can occur within a person, while the curricular areas were external to a person but could facilitate the internal development of the principles. Similar to the Mobius strip, the internal guiding principles and the external curricular areas are interconnected and influence each other. The guiding principles and their accompanying curricular areas were (a) allegiance to the present moment nurtured through the domain of contemplative practices; (b) appreciation and interconnection nurtured through the domain of the humanities; (c) authentic communication nurtured through the domain of the arts; (d) synchronized activity nurtured through the domain of embodiment disciplines (athletics, health, and nutrition, etc.); and (e) precision and insight nurtured through the domain of the sciences. For example, engaging in contemplative practices such as 20 min of silence every day could cultivate an allegiance to the present moment and the capacity to be in the present could inform a study of contemplative practices.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1541344612456431">
<title>Data Collection and Analysis</title>
<p>The researcher utilized qualitative methods of data collection and analysis and spent 2 to 4 days a week in the school for approximately 3 months in the spring of 2007 and 2 weeks in the fall of 2007, observing the teaching and learning environment, talking with teachers, students, and parents, and collecting artifacts of practice. Sources of data included two formal, individual, audio-taped interviews with teacher participants; individual interviews with school staff, students, and parents; and observations of classroom teaching and other professional responsibilities. Artifacts such as lesson plans, teaching reflections, and journals were also collected.</p>
<p>Data analysis involved an iterative process of data collection, reflection, and analysis so that each step informed the others. The themes of compassion, integrity, and mindful awareness guided the process of constructing emergent themes, but the framework served only as a guide not the sole determiner of themes. Events, behaviors, statements, or activities were highlighted that (a) occurred multiple times; (b) connected with other events, behaviors, statements, or activities; (c) were rare or influential; or (d) did not occur even though the researcher expected them to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1541344612456431">LeCompte &amp; Schensul, 1999</xref>). Triangulation and listening for dissonant or disconfirming evidence were also used as an accuracy check of the principles and practices of contemplative teachers. Collecting information from multiple sources of data decreased the risk of inaccurate or false information and systemic biases. The systematic analysis of data occurred during two phases—first, during data collection through a recursive cycle of collection, reflection, and analysis; and second, after the data collection process concluded.</p>
<p>Portraits were created using the systematic analyses of data to create holistic pictures of teacher’s vision of contemplative teaching, beliefs about one’s teaching self, practices/pedagogy in the classroom, and relationships with students. Portrait development involved multiple phases of creating the essential features of a teacher through a vignette of a typical day, an essential metaphor for teaching, and critical incidents of the teacher’s self, relationships, and pedagogy. The following portrait presents detailed descriptions and analyses of Diana’s principles and practices as a contemplative teacher.</p>

<title>Portrait of Diana: See Me Beautiful</title>
<p>The school day for Diana began around five in the morning. She drove 20 min west from her home watching the sunrise reflected in the beauty of the Rocky Mountains. The sun and the color yellow were important to Diana and she explained that she hoped her teaching would be like a ray of sunshine illuminating her students’ gifts. Diana used the phrase “see me beautiful” as a reminder to look for beauty in her students, parents, colleagues, and herself.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>There's this song . . . called “See Me Beautiful.” I don't remember the song, but I remember the title and it, basically, just reminds me that we're all trying to do our best. . . . our school is founded on the premise that we all have basic goodness. So, I try to remember that.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>At 8 o’clock the teachers and interns gathered in one room for 10 min of meditation and silence. They sat in chairs in a circle with hands softly placed on their knees, eyes looking at the floor. There was some shuffling, clearing throats, and coughing every now and then, but mostly silence prevailed as each person focused on his or her breathing and being present in the moment. The group ended meditation by bowing into the center of the circle with hands resting on their hips, acknowledging the space and time they spent together as a community. After the meditation, the teachers discussed the agenda for the day, noted anything out of the ordinary, and reviewed events from the previous day or personal circumstances of life such as a book being read or a new restaurant in town.</p>
<p>Students began arriving soon after meditation ended. Diana stood in the hallway, greeting students and parents with hugs, handshakes, or a “hello” or “good morning.” She held hands with some students as they transitioned from dropping backpacks and lunches off in cubbies before heading outside to the playground. Around 8:30, the kindergartners gathered at the gate in the chain link fence to walk 20 yards to the creek. Several parents and Diana’s teaching assistant accompanied the class. Diana was engaged in conversations with multiple students during the morning walk and play time. They had many questions and stories to share.</p>
<p>During lunch, a group of five kindergarten boys sat in a semicircle outside on the grass in front of the school having a discussion about who were the best and worst soccer players. Sammy initiated the talk and was dominating the conversation along with one other student. Each boy stated he was one of the best soccer players and wanted to rank all of the soccer players (that were male) in the school including the first and second graders. Diana was sitting on the grass near the students watching, listening, and observing their conversation. Her lunch lay untouched on the ground next to her. After five minutes of listening to the boys’ exchange, Diana called Sammy to come see her. He put down his uneaten sandwich and walked the 10 feet over to where Diana sat cross-legged.</p>
<p>He stood next to her expectantly and she placed her right arm around his waist as she looked up at him. It was a common practice for Diana to call students over to her away from a group for her to talk with them. Usually it was to end some kind of activity that the student was initiating. Diana shared with Sammy, “It’s not helpful to compare yourself to other people. The conversation you are having could hurt people on the inside. I’m glad you are good at soccer and enjoy it so much. People have a lot of different skills and areas where they are good at something.” He nodded demurely as she talked. He started to walk away, but turned around, and with tears in his eyes, returned to Diana. Gently putting her arm around him again, she asked, “What’s wrong?” He replied, “You used a sharp voice with me.” Taking a deep, slow breath, and a moment to pause and consider the feedback, Diana calmly asked Sammy, “Could it be that you didn’t like the message I gave you?” He paused for a moment before slowly nodding his head yes. He remained, eyes focused on the ground, crying for another minute with her arm around his waist.</p>
<p>While it was a private conversation between Diana and Sammy, it was also a public conversation since Sammy’s peers were only 10 feet from the dialogue. Diana asked Sammy if she could share with the group what they talked about and Sammy moved his head up and down in affirmation. Diana recapped the conversation with the group and asked them if they had experiences of not being good at something and how that felt. She asked them if they could think of a time when they worked to be better at something. Students eagerly shared examples in response to Diana’s prompts and Sammy shared an example of playing a lot of soccer so that he would be good at it.</p>
<p>Each day after lunch the students gathered in the sunrise room for story time. The children clustered on the floor around Diana. This afternoon, Diana began her storytelling by lighting a candle on the end table to her right. The students recited the following lines together followed by a simultaneous bow.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Body like a bow and arrow</p>
<p>Speech like a silent bell</p>
<p>Mind open to the bright blue sky</p>
<p>All together kind and well.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Since it was Wednesday, this was the third time the students were hearing the week’s story. Speaking from memory, Diana leaned forward with her elbows on her knees, then after making eye contact with each child, she began . . . .</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>If you see a bee fly out of someone’s nose, good fortune will be yours. Every morning Shin said goodbye to Yuki and went up to the mountains with his friend Tasuke to chop wood. . . . The day the story happened, Shin said to Tasuke, “Ohhh, Tasuke, I am so tired.” So Tasuke replied, “why don’t we do some work and then take a nap.” So they did. Tasuke fell right asleep but Shin couldn’t fall asleep. Shin listened to the snore of Tasuke and watched his chest rise up and down when suddenly he saw A BEE FLY OUT OF TASUKE’S NOSE. Shin wanted to wake Tasuke so badly, but Shin decided to let his friend continue to sleep. Eventually Tasuke sat up and stretched and asked Shin about his nap. He said “Well, I couldn’t really sleep. While you were sleeping, I saw a bee fly out of your nose” Tasuke responded, “Wow, I didn’t feel that at all, but I did have a dream.” Can anyone tell us the story of the dream?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Several students raised their hands and Diana called on Gina to tell the story of the dream. Tasuke dreamt of going to a nearby town where there was buried a treasure of pearls and rubies and gold in a famous garden.</p>
<p>After the story, Diana brought out a board that was on the floor behind her. The board had five colors representing the five domains of learning. Each color listed several activity options, for example drawing or sewing for the arts, fractals or pattern blocks for the sciences, coloring or drawing mandalas for contemplative practices, writing alphabetical letters or looking at words in their word boxes for the humanities, or hopscotch or finger painting for the embodiment disciplines. As Diana orally reviewed the activity options for five-domain time, the school-wide gong rang to signal the start of the daily 20-min silent time. Students moved to their individual activities in silence. After 20 min, the gong rang to signal the end of silent time and the kindergartners cheered in their usual ritual.</p>
<p>For afternoon snack, Diana made popcorn and passed around plates of carrots. One student served the popcorn to the other students and together they sang a song of thanks for their food before eating. The Chinese language teacher entered the room as the students were finishing their snack and orally they went over colors and shapes in Mandarin. Diana sat in a chair in the corner of the room and ate with the students and practiced her Mandarin. After the lesson, Diana shared her frustrations with the class.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I’m not sure what it is about Mandarin. I feel like it brings out my worst qualities. I’m kind of crabby because I feel like I have to keep telling people to sit down, be quiet, and listen to the laoshi (teacher). What should we do? I feel like part of the problem is me.</p>
<p>One student suggested, “It might just be that we just got back from spring break and maybe it will be better next time.” Diana replied, “Next time we have Mandarin, I would like you to not be whispering and rolling around on the floor. I will try not to be so rrrrrrrr.” School ended at three o’clock and students were dismissed individually when they recognized their first name being spelled backwards by Diana.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the preceding portrait, Diana exhibited multiple examples of teaching with compassion, integrity, and mindful awareness and ways in which she struggled with these qualities. The following sections illuminate how these qualities of contemplative teaching are evidenced in Diana’s teaching principles and practices.</p>
<sec id="section6-1541344612456431">
<title>Compassion</title>
<p>Compassion is characterized by being open to and moved by suffering; feelings of caring and kindness; taking an understanding, nonjudgmental attitude toward inadequacies and failures; and recognizing that one’s experience is part of the common human experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1541344612456431">Neff, 2003</xref>). Diana’s interactions with Sammy reveal several characteristics of compassion. It was a delicate conversation for Diana for multiple reasons. The topic of competition was a sensitive issue for Diana because of her own negative experiences with it, and yet it inherently is a part of life. Diana recognized that Sammy's comparisons with his classmates were not helpful because they appeared to intentionally place him in a superior position to his peers rather than extending compassion to others. While the conversation could have focused on Sammy’s joy of soccer or the skills he had mastered through hard work, Sammy was using comparisons or put-downs of his peers in his ranking system of “good,” male soccer players in the first and second grades.</p>
<p>Also of importance to Diana’s exhibition of compassion in this incident were prior interactions between Sammy and Diana. In the past, Sammy had accurately identified exchanges when Diana had used a harsh voice with him and so she needed to consider not only what she said but the manner in which she expressed herself before she responded to his criticism in this situation. Was she being too harsh? Was it personal for her because he was so competitive and she had negative experiences with competitive people? In reflecting on the incident, Diana conceded that her first impulse was to be sharp, but she worked very hard to temper her response. She observed that the highly charged engagement demanded not only a caring disposition to the student but also a nonjudgmental attitude toward her own inadequacies—what she might consider failure on her part as a teacher. “I am so grateful to him on so many levels because he just helps me so much. One of those is when my voice is sharp, it’s really great to just connect in with that because it is.” Diana’s past openness to Sammy’s feedback and her commitment to act with compassion both toward Sammy and herself is an ability she has cultivated through years of practice.</p>
<p>In reflection about the experience with Sammy, Diana explained some of her reasoning for presenting the issue to the group as a means to promote compassion.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Well, I was hoping it would benefit everybody, actually, and also, timing wise, I wouldn’t have done that probably much earlier too because now that they’re—I feel like they’re very close and really understanding and they really get each other. They are now becoming really good sort of feedback for each other so it was that kind of thing. Just I like to present certain things to the group because, well, it gives feedback, for one thing, to the person, but then also––I think it really helps with compassion when you see that somebody’s struggling with something. Even if Sammy wasn’t struggling and didn’t feel met by that compassion, it would be a chance for others to feel it in other situations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Diana’s reflection on her interaction with Sammy illustrated her ability to be compassionate with her self when she made a mistake or unintentionally caused suffering to a student. Diana was open to listening and learning from her students and being vulnerable as a person developing. She consciously chose not to present herself an expert teacher who portended to understand everything and could never be wrong or inadequate. Diana did make mistakes as a teacher, and she was willing to acknowledge them when they were brought to her attention.</p>
<p>Diana also promoted compassion as part of the human experience through the story of “The Bee and the Dream” which ends with Shin and Yuki sharing their good fortune with their neighbors and family. The moral of sharing and giving was highlighted in the story. Whether the characters were sharing and buying dreams or sharing “good fortune,” the view of people as being interconnected underlies the motivation to act with compassion toward others.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1541344612456431">
<title>Integrity</title>
<p>Teaching with integrity is a process of acting in ways that are true to oneself, ways that are genuine, real, and authentic. Integrity in teaching varies for every teacher because of the individual principles and vision each teacher possesses. Diana’s core teaching vision addressed issues of truth, beauty, goodness, and service. Diana believed that an effective learning environment for her kindergarten students addressed truths such as the three journeys of intelligence, compassion, and confidence; “May you see clearly”; “Let kindness be your guide”; and “May you know yourself.” Truths were examined through stories such as the message in “The Bee and the Dream” that good fortune was meant to be shared. Some of Diana’s proudest moments occurred when students expressed truths she upheld. One afternoon, a parent came into class to play the marimba, a percussion instrument, and she appeared to be nervous about making mistakes. As Diana recalled,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>So, she said to the students, “I'll play you this song but I haven't practiced it for a while, so I'll make lots of mistakes,” and she said that about five times. And finally two of them said, “It's okay. You're a human being. We all make mistakes.” and I just felt so proud of them because they got that. I thought that was great success. So, that even kids being the teacher in a way and that's our goal, I think, to step back and let them do it.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The preceding example was so inspiring for Diana because in many ways her ultimate truth is “to oneself be true” or “live with integrity.” These students expressed the truth that mistakes are part of the common human experience and they are okay.</p>
<p>Integrity was also apparent in Diana’s goal to remember to “see me beautiful” and her genuineness in her relationships with students. She was excited to be with students and verbally and nonverbally expressed her beliefs that she was lucky to be with them each day. Instead of voicing her frustrations with another teacher or her assistant about the Mandarin lesson, she involved the students in understanding her feelings and allowed them to be a part of the process of problem solving how things could change.</p>
<p>Often a person’s integrity is revealed in instances of challenge or difficulty. Diana explained one of the tools she used when a student or parent challenged or frustrated her was to breathe and take the other person’s perspective. “One is always take a breath; just always, always, always, and realize that they are using the best tools they have at the time to get what they need, and then also that I am using the best tools.” The understanding that another person is using the best tools they have reflects the principle of “see me beautiful.”</p>
<p>Teaching with integrity welcomes differences, diversity, and even adversity as crucial for learning. Without challenges to one’s beliefs, values, or principles, it is often difficult to observe teaching with integrity. Diana’s integrity in teaching was based on her teaching principles of truth, beauty, goodness, and service. When she experienced challenges to her integrity, Diana utilized breathing techniques and the phrase “see me beautiful” to remind her to look for the goodness in others. Teaching with integrity emphasizes teaching with wholeness, bringing your whole self to your role as a teacher. Wholeness embraces the paradox of accepting where you are and where you are not exhibiting the qualities of contemplative teaching. Teaching with integrity, like compassion and mindful awareness, was not a static state to be attained, but a dynamic process that Diana strove to keep in mind as she dealt with the complexities of teaching.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1541344612456431">
<title>Mindful Awareness</title>
<p>Teaching with compassion and with integrity in many ways relies on the quality of mindful awareness. Mindful awareness in teaching requires openness to the present moment with a perspective of equanimity that is driven by a sense of wonder. Mindful awareness was cultivated in Diana’s morning meditation session. It was exhibited in the consciousness of space and time during the course of a school day and how transitions occurred between events, in knowing when students needed to be removed from a situation to debrief or hearing a new perspective, and how to most effectively facilitate learning.</p>
<p>A parent described how she believed Diana taught with mindful awareness, which allowed the students to be themselves.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>… I like how they (<italic>teachers at the Ghandi School)</italic> allow children to just sort of open up and not always know all the answers and let it all unfold in a slow sort of process and let the children really think about it. I remember early on in the fall there was a child in the class that none of the children were getting along with and the child was absent one day and they had a huge pow-wow and the kids were saying things like they were glad he was out. Diana said, well this has been really hard for you guys. Let’s talk about it. The kids themselves came up with all these ideas like, maybe he doesn’t know how to interact, maybe he doesn’t know how to get into a conversation, or maybe he’s afraid. The kids came up with it themselves. . . . She allowed the children to come to a place of absolute compassion without directing them in that way. Just opening up and really letting the conversation unfold. . . .</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Diana’s quality of attention to her students and to the context of their feelings contributed to her facilitating this discussion with them about one of their peers. The parent’s insight of Diana’s openness and willingness to not control the students’ thoughts or feelings revealed how teaching with mindful awareness was embodied by Diana. She opened the conversation with an acknowledgment of the students’ feelings and frustrations. She listened to students with openness, equanimity, and wonder, which encouraged students to develop a deeper understanding of the situation on their own with her support and guidance. She gave them space to share their thoughts and feelings and to deepen their perspective of another human being, a peer. She opened the door to compassion and a transformed understanding of another human being through her mindful awareness and the students chose to enter and live on that path of compassion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1541344612456431">
<title>Embracing Wholeness</title>
<p>Contemplative teaching focuses on uniting the deep inner life of the teacher with his or her outwardly visible actions. Rather than <italic>acting like</italic> a teacher or <italic>performing</italic> the role of teacher in the classroom, one who exhibits a contemplative teaching presence may engage in “a state of alert awareness, receptivity and connectedness to the mental, emotional, and physical workings of both the individual and the group in the context of their learning environments and the ability to respond with a considered and compassionate best next step” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1541344612456431">Rodgers &amp; Raider-Roth, 2006</xref>, p. 266). Many great teachers exhibit these three qualities of teaching, but it is the unique synthesis of teaching with compassion, integrity, and mindful awareness that reflect a teacher with a contemplative orientation to teaching. The whole is greater than the sum of the parts and an intention toward wholeness creates the potential for personal and societal transformation.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Contemplation is not a method, but rather a practice—an everyday practice that can transform the world. Bringing a contemplative attitude to preparing for the day, choosing what to think about, perhaps creates classrooms where life can be lived in many possible and diverse ways, through our relations and the spiraling-out stories of each person here. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1541344612456431">Seidel, 2006</xref>, pp. 1910–1911)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Contemplative teaching is a path leading from the past to the future. Rather than viewing teachers and students as disembodied beings by focusing solely on their intellect and rational systems; contemplative teaching’s emphasis on wholeness, unity, and integration moves education toward a view of teachers and students as beings with not only minds but also hearts and bodies.</p>
<p>While acknowledging the realities of schools today, the potential for contemplative teaching to create positive learning experiences, improve the working lives of teachers, and create transformative experiences for school communities so that the individuals within can see themselves, others, and the world in new ways is powerful. The current emphasis in our society on speed, multitasking, and “getting my way now” limits our ability individually and collectively to understand ourselves and our world. Contemplative teaching offers educational communities a way, which I believe allows students and teachers, to live and learn in ways that offer the most potential for transformation and for a holistic, integrative learning experience.</p>
<p>While Diana did not always view herself as the ideal contemplative teacher, she brought central, core characteristics of compassion, integrity, and mindful awareness into her teaching. The following description was Diana’s vision of an ideal contemplative teacher.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Well, I would hope a contemplative teacher is someone who's incredibly kind and patient, but brings out the best in each student and really takes the time to know them and see them for who they are, and also doesn't get caught in their own trip so much which, of course, is really kind of ridiculous, because maybe what the ideal contemplative teacher should be is just a human being working with herself or himself. So, in that way, I guess I do. I see where I could be better and that's kind of hard, but I also see that I'm a person. I need to just realize that and have some respect for my feelings in the situation too, and it's hard. It's hard.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Diana was open and reflective about both the gifts and limitations she brings to her teaching. She believed that her weaknesses as a teacher and as a human being were her ability to be too harsh or short-tempered. Diana also saw herself as quick to judge, which could limit or even inhibit her perception of people and situations. She believed that she was a loud and silly teacher, which did not match her conception of an ideal contemplative teacher as someone who is spacious and quiet. She was a human being working with herself which takes courage to do that hard work.</p>
<p>Diana’s experiential voyage involved struggle and was a complex undertaking but one that she felt was foundational to her role as a dedicated contemplative educator. Strategies like slowing down, taking time for in-and-out breaths in one’s body and in the daily rhythm of the day, or being curious about student responses or behaviors whether correct, incorrect, or even just unusual all facilitated Diana’s capacity to embody a contemplative approach to her teaching.</p>
<p>Contemplative education begins with the most intimate relationship possible––relationship with oneself. It is a journey that moves both outward into the world and inward into one’s own mind, body, and heart. It is a journey of knowledge and self-knowledge toward transformation. “Transformative learning involves experiencing a deep, structural shift in the basic premises of thought, feeling, and actions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1541344612456431">O’Sullivan, 2002</xref>, p. 11). Contemplative teaching attempts to create transformative experiences for both teachers and students. Teachers’ experiences with transformative learning create opportunities for students’ transformative learning experiences. “We work toward this depth when we invite students to directly and openly meet their world and themselves. This is enabled when we, as educators, meet ourselves, ideas, and our students directly, openly, and honestly; in this way, teaching primarily becomes a way of Being” (Hart, 2001, p.171).</p>
<p>Diana observed that the job of her kindergarteners was just to come to school and be who they were. Her openness to her students and her invitation to be who they were opened the door for transformative experiences. A contemplative approach to education focuses on understanding humans’ basic goodness, how to be of service in the world, the importance of being who you are, and a focused attention in the present moment. Contemplative teaching is a possible link to our future of equitably educating all children and supporting the development and growth of whole human beings.</p>
<p>A parent described the teachers at the Ghandi School as teaching with mindful awareness, compassionate, and integrity. Her insight into how this kind of teaching presence impacts children serves as a powerful reminder of the transformative potential of contemplative teaching.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The teachers are so present with the children.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>They really focus on one thing at a time. They are calm, gentle, and focused. When talking with a parent, they are completely focused on that conversation. Children know to touch them on the shoulder if they need their attention and wait until the teacher has finished with his or her other conversation. They know the children and they take the time to be aware of each child. . . . The contemplative practice is a centerpiece of this school. I think learning here is exciting and evolving and growing. Each teacher is empowered to find his or her own path, what contemplative education means to them individually and collectively evolves. They hold children in a space of presence. They deal with challenges or conflicts by involving the children in the problem solving through empathy. Their values come through in their teaching. One of the three questions on the application for this school is, “How does your child find joy?” What other place would emphasize or be aware of children’s joy. The theory behind the school is that if you give a child space, they will naturally want to learn.</p>
<p>Contemplative teaching embodies teaching with compassion, integrity, and mindful awareness. These three qualities of teaching are enacted daily by teachers such as Diana with a contemplative orientation and all three qualities embrace the wholeness of being human. A contemplative orientation to teaching creates space for learning and is a model of education that links the inner and external life in meaningful, transformative ways.</p>
