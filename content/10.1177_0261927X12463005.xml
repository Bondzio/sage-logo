<abstract>
<p>This study applies concepts and methods from the domain of Implicit Social Cognition to examine language attitudes toward foreign and U.S. accented speech. Implicit attitudes were measured using an Implicit Association Test (IAT) that incorporated audio cues as experimental stimuli. Explicit attitudes were measured through self-report questionnaires. Participants exhibited a pro-U.S. accent bias on the IAT measure but a pro-foreign accent bias on explicit measures. This divergence supports the conclusion that implicit and explicit attitudes are separable attitude constructs resulting from distinct mental processes and suggests that language attitudes research—which has traditionally measured only explicit attitudes—would benefit by incorporating indirect measures. The Associative-Propositional Evaluation Model is proposed as a comprehensive and consistent theory to explain the cognitive processing of language attitudes.</p>

<p>More than 40 years of research on explicit language attitudes has established that listeners determine a speaker’s social identity based on <italic>accent</italic>, or <italic>manner of pronunciation</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261927X12463005">Giles, 1970</xref>), and that listeners generally disfavor nonstandard accents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0261927X12463005">Gluszek &amp; Dovidio, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0261927X12463005">Lambert, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0261927X12463005">Ryan, 1982</xref>). In fact, second language speakers—even fully competent speakers—have been shown to suffer serious negative social, political, financial, and legal consequences due solely to their foreign accents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0261927X12463005">Kinzler, Shutts, DeJesus, &amp; Spelke, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0261927X12463005">Lippi-Green, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0261927X12463005">Matsuda, 1991</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0261927X12463005">1</xref></sup> Today, with worldwide population migration and corporate globalization facilitating contact between native and second language speakers in numbers never before seen in human history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261927X12463005">Blommaert, 2010</xref>), understanding this bias against foreign accented speech is important to an ever increasing number of people. The present study of participants’ attitudes toward foreign accented speech seeks to provide additional insight into the nature of listener reactions by incorporating into traditional language attitudes research the domain of <italic>Implicit Social Cognition</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0261927X12463005">Greenwald et al., 2002</xref>). Implicit Social Cognition suggests in part that social judgment and behavior are the result of both an individual’s <italic>implicit attitudes</italic> (immediate reactions) and <italic>explicit attitudes</italic> (thoughtful reactions; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261927X12463005">Greenwald &amp; Banaji, 1995</xref>). By definition, implicit attitudes are inaccessible to the individual and are difficult to observe directly using traditional self-report measures. To address this, researchers have developed a number of indirect measures designed to assess implicit attitudes. The current research incorporates one such measure, the Implicit Association Test (IAT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0261927X12463005">Greenwald, McGhee, &amp; Schwartz, 1998</xref>). The IAT is a computer-based sorting task that measures relative reaction times between distinct pairings of concepts and/or attributes. To the extent that a pairing is well established in memory, an individual should respond accurately and quickly when that pairing is presented, while responding more slowly and less accurately when a pairing is less well established in memory.</p>
<p>Additionally, the experimental findings reported here are interpreted within the context of recently developed <italic>dual process</italic> models of social cognition. The Associative Propositional Evaluation (APE) Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0261927X12463005">Gawronski &amp; Bodenhausen, 2006</xref>) is a dynamic cognitive model that explains how attitudes can be formed through two distinct but potentially interactive modes of mental processing, namely, <italic>associative</italic> (automatic or immediate) and <italic>propositional</italic> (thoughtful) processing.</p>
<p>For decades, traditional language attitudes research has posited the existence of a general negative affect toward nonstandard, including foreign, accents (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0261927X12463005">Lambert, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0261927X12463005">Rubin &amp; Smith, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0261927X12463005">Ryan, 1983</xref>). At the same time, in analyzing specific accents, many researchers have recognized that listener attitudes toward the same accented speech can vary, attributing this variation to a number of factors, including reaction type (e.g., <italic>affective</italic> and <italic>evaluative</italic> reactions), speaker trait (e.g., <italic>solidarity</italic> [kindness, friendliness, etc.] and <italic>status</italic> [competence, intelligence, etc.]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261927X12463005">Cargile &amp; Giles, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0261927X12463005">Ryan, 1982</xref>), the aggressiveness of the message (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261927X12463005">Cargile &amp; Giles, 1997</xref>), stereotypes associated with the speaker’s nationality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0261927X12463005">Frumkin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261927X12463005">Kristiansen, 2001</xref>), and the degree of nonstandardness of the speaker’s accent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261927X12463005">Brennan &amp; Brennan, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261927X12463005">Bresnahan, Ohashi, Nebashi, Liu, &amp; Shearman, 2002</xref>). While this extensive body of research provides a wealth of information about reactions to a multiplicity of nationalities and accents, a reconciliation of the idea of a general bias with evidence of specific attitude variation, as well as a quantitatively supported link between these factors and attitude type, and a consistent conceptualization of the attitude formation process, all remain elusive.</p>
<p>Outside the specific purview of language attitudes, research in the domain of Implicit Social Cognition defines attitudes based on the type of cognitive processes involved in their formation: <italic>implicit</italic> attitudes as a person’s automatic, immediate reactions to an attitude object based on preexisting stereotypes and cognitive connections, and <italic>explicit</italic> attitudes as reactions formed through additional controlled cognitive processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0261927X12463005">Wittenbrink &amp; Schwarz, 2007</xref>). Both implicit and explicit attitudes can be held simultaneously and both can affect behavior and/or judgment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261927X12463005">Greenwald &amp; Banaji, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0261927X12463005">Perkins &amp; Forehand, 2010</xref>). However, implicit attitudes, by definition, are inaccessible to the individual and thus are difficult to assess using traditional self-reflective methods, such as self-report measures or interviews—the two primary methods used in traditional quantitative language attitudes studies. Instead, implicit attitudes can be captured only through indirect methods that do not rely on personal introspection. One such measure is the IAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0261927X12463005">Greenwald et al., 1998</xref>), a recently developed methodology that measures response latencies in sorting tasks of stimulus exemplars from four concepts using two response options. The IAT is based on the assumption that greater association strengths are evidenced by faster performance in tasks requiring categorization into paired category labels that are consistent in the participant’s mind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0261927X12463005">Greenwald et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0261927X12463005">Nosek, Greenwald, &amp; Banaji, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0261927X12463005">2007</xref>). For example, in a hypothetical IAT used to measure relative implicit attitudes toward hamburgers versus hot dogs, participants who prefer hamburgers should sort visual stimuli representing hamburgers and hot dogs into the categories labeled <italic>hamburger</italic> + <italic>good</italic> and <italic>hot dog</italic> + <italic>bad</italic> more easily (e.g., more quickly and with less error) than into the categories labeled <italic>hamburger</italic> + <italic>bad</italic> or <italic>hot dog</italic> + <italic>good</italic>. For participants who prefer hot dogs, the opposite should be true. Thus, while explicit self-report tasks measure an individual’s accessible, thoughtful reactions to a stimulus object, the IAT is thought to measure an individual’s immediate affective reaction based on preexisting cognitive associations.</p>
<p>The implicit–explicit attitude distinction is consistent with the theoretical concept of intergroup behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0261927X12463005">Turner &amp; Giles, 1981</xref>) and Social Identity Theory (SIT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0261927X12463005">Tajfel &amp; Turner, 2004</xref>), which maintain that social group membership necessarily results in negative attitudes toward out-group members, and that by serving as a strong signal of group membership status (in-group vs. out-group), language attributes such as accent are at the very core of intergroup behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261927X12463005">Bresnahan &amp; Kim, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261927X12463005">Bresnahan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0261927X12463005">Giles, Hewstone, Ryan, &amp; Johnson, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0261927X12463005">Reid &amp; Giles, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0261927X12463005">Ryan, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0261927X12463005">White &amp; Li, 1991</xref>). Accordingly, the present study argues that SIT supports the assertion that immediately on recognition of the nonnativeness of an accent—shown to occur in as few as 30 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0261927X12463005">Flege, 1984</xref>)—out-group status is recognized and any existing implicit associations, including attitude information, is activated from memory. Thus, implicit attitudes are related in a meaningful way to group membership and language attitude-related behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261927X12463005">De Houwer &amp; De Bruycker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0261927X12463005">Perugini, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0261927X12463005">Perugini &amp; Prestwich, 2007</xref>). While studies that describe self-reported attitudes toward various nationalities or that directly examine the effects of accent on the cognitive processing of message content using self-report measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0261927X12463005">Floccia, Butler, Goslin, &amp; Ellis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0261927X12463005">Lev-Ari &amp; Keysar, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0261927X12463005">Munro &amp; Derwing, 1995</xref>) provide valuable insight into listeners’ consciously available attitudes, they do not speak to listeners’ implicit attitudes or to potential distinctions between the two attitude constructs.</p>
<p>This implicit–explicit attitude distinction and the IAT methodology are theoretically interpreted within the framework of the APE Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0261927X12463005">Gawronski &amp; Bodenhausen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0261927X12463005">Gawronski &amp; Bodenhausen, 2007</xref>). The APE Model describes attitude formation as the result of a dynamic dual processing system in which evaluation responses—attitudes—are formed as a result of two distinct yet potentially interacting cognitive processes in memory, <italic>associative</italic> or <italic>propositional</italic>. Associative processes are characterized as immediate or affective reactions to an object in the environment resulting from the automatic or unconscious retrieval of previously existing information in memory and generally correspond to implicit attitudes. Propositional processes, in contrast, are those that attempt to determine the validity of evaluations and beliefs by assessing their consistency with other relevant propositions. The Implicit Social Cognition framework thus links the nature of an attitude to its formation process and provides a consistent means for explaining attitude formation through the APE Model, a cognitive model not limited to language attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261927X12463005">Cargile, Giles, Ryan, &amp; Bradac, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0261927X12463005">Gluszek &amp; Dovidio, 2010</xref>) or persuasive messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0261927X12463005">Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 1986</xref>), but that is a comprehensive and consistent explanation of attitude processing, in general.</p>
<p>The current report addresses the application of the Implicit Social Cognition framework to language attitudes research through the investigation of two research questions:</p>
<list id="list1-0261927X12463005" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1</italic>: Whether participants’ implicit attitudes are biased in favor of U.S. accented speech, indicating an immediate negative reaction to foreign accented speech relative to U.S. accented speech.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 2</italic>: Whether participants’ explicit (e.g., self-reported) attitudes toward U.S. accented speech differ from their implicit attitudes, supporting the conclusion that the two types of attitudes represent distinct modes of cognitive processing, consistent with dual process models such as the APE Model.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Accordingly, this study tests the following two hypotheses:</p>
<list id="list2-0261927X12463005" list-type="simple">

<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Participants’ explicit attitudes, which are subject to cognitive control and self-presentation concerns, will show no significant bias in favor of either speaker in the context of the present study—a medical malpractice trial in which participants are asked to imagine that they are fair and impartial jurors—indicating that implicit and explicit attitudes can diverge, and supporting the conclusion that implicit and explicit attitudes are the result of different cognitive processes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0261927X12463005">2</xref></sup></p></list-item>

<title>Overview</title>
<p>Applying the Implicit Social Cognition theoretical framework to the context of language attitudes, the present study measured participants’ reactions to audio stimuli using two distinct methods. First, immediate, associative reactions were measured by IAT in Task 1. Second, thoughtful, propositional reactions were measured to determine the participants’ explicit attitudes toward the stimuli through self-report in Task 2. Because the APE Model suggests that propositional and associative processes can interact throughout, an additional explicit measure was employed in Task 3 to test the robustness of the explicit finding in Task 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0261927X12463005">Gawronski &amp; Bodenhausen, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0261927X12463005">2006</xref>).

<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 165 participants took part in this study. Participants were sought from a university’s graduate and undergraduate population. Participation was voluntary, and a fee of $10 per participant was paid in compensation. Participants ranged in age from 17 to 22 years, with an average age of 20 years. Of the participants, 114 were women and 51 were men; 63 self-identified their race as Caucasian/White/European, 40 as Asian/Chinese/Taiwanese, 20 as Hispanic/Mexican/Latino, and 17 as African/African American/Black. The majority of participants self-identified their nationality as U.S./American (131); 34 participants designated their nationality as foreign (16 as Chinese, 4 as Korean, 4 as Mexican, 2 as El Salvadoran, 2 as English, and 6 as other). Although all participants were proficient enough in English to attend a U.S. university, 35 indicated their native language to be something other than English (14 as Chinese/Mandarin/Cantonese, 8 as Spanish, 6 as Korean, and 7 as another language).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0261927X12463005">
<title>Task Procedure</title>
<p>Because the order of testing has been shown to have no effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0261927X12463005">Lane, Banaji, Nosek, &amp; Greenwald, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0261927X12463005">Nosek et al., 2005</xref>), the three tasks were administered in the same order to each participant. The tasks took a total of approximately 25 minutes to complete: approximately 10 minutes for Task 1 (the IAT), 10 minutes for Task 2 (the first self-report), and 5 minutes for Task 3 (the second self-report). A distraction task was inserted between Tasks 1 and 2, which consisted of a Rational Evaluation Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0261927X12463005">Pacini &amp; Epstein, 1999</xref>) that asked participants to rate the degree to which they emotionally or thoughtfully answer questions. In addition, participants were required to answer demographics questions after Task 3.</p>
<p>The entire study was computer based. Each participant sat in a private, sound-controlled room. Each room was equipped with a Windows™ based laptop computer with a standard keyboard, a track pad, an external mouse, and a set of headphones (Sennheiser™ HD 201) connected to the computer’s headphone port. All tasks were created using Inquisit™ software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261927X12463005">Draine, 1998</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0261927X12463005">
<title>Task 1: Implicit Associations Test</title>
<p>Task 1 consisted of an audio IAT designed to provide a means to measure participants’ immediate, associative responses to the audio tokens presented. The use of audio stimuli was deemed essential to the linguistic nature of the study and represents an expansion of the IAT methodology, which in published studies to date has relied on visual stimuli such as printed words and images.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0261927X12463005">3</xref></sup> The audio stimuli were excerpts, including lexical items and collocations, taken from the audio recordings (in .mp3 format) used in Task 2. These excerpts were equalized for loudness using SoundForge™ and trimmed to assure no silent lead at the start of each clip. Each audio stimulus consisted of three iterations of the same token. One second of silence was inserted between iterations. The semantic valence of each stimulus was prescreened, and only those stimuli that exhibited no significant variance in valence were used. As visual attribute stimuli, positive and negative valence words were used. Both audio and visual stimuli were randomized across participants. Participants were told stimuli would be presented either audibly through the headphones or visually on the computer screen. Participants were instructed to categorize each stimulus as belonging to the category shown in the upper left or upper right of the computer screen by pressing the appropriate computer key (“E” for left or “I” for right). The four categories were <italic>U.S.</italic> and <italic>Foreign</italic> (target concepts) and <italic>good</italic> and <italic>bad</italic> (target attributes). Participants were instructed to work quickly without sacrificing accuracy. Participants were able to categorize the audio stimuli immediately on the start of the recorded stimulus. A list of all stimuli and the organization of the IAT are set out in the table in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0261927X12463005">Appendix A</xref>.</p>
<p>The IAT was presented in five blocks, or stages. The first block was a practice stage, in which participants were presented with each of the four positive and four negative visual attribute stimuli twice, for a total of 16 trials. The second block was also a practice stage, in which participants were presented with each of the four audio stimuli spoken by the U.S. accented physician and the four audio stimuli spoken by the Korean accented physician twice, for a total of 16 trials. In the third block, a total of 32 trials were created from the combination of the first two test blocks. The fourth block repeated block two, but with the screen position of the attribute stimuli reversed. In the fifth block, the 32 trials from the third block were repeated, but with the reversed screen positions for the attributes, as shown in the fourth block. The order of the trials within each block was randomized. If incorrect selections were made, a red X appeared on the computer screen for 400 ms. Subsequent trials started 400 ms after the previous response or the disappearance of the red X. The assignment of screen position to positive or negative valence was counterbalanced for the participant pool, so that half the participants saw positive words on the left and negative on the right, and half saw them reversed.</p>

<title>Task 2: Self-Report 1</title>
<p>Task 2 was designed to measure the participants’ explicit attitudes toward foreign accent. Accordingly, Task 2 consisted of a written self-report survey, designed to measure participants’ thoughtful, propositional reactions to the audio stimuli. In this task, participants heard the fictional audio testimony in English of two similarly aged male actors portraying physicians in a medical malpractice trial. Given that previous studies have established that a number of extralinguistic personal features such as physical appearance and presentation characteristics affect jurors’ perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0261927X12463005">Catano, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0261927X12463005">DeSantis &amp; Kayson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0261927X12463005">Lavrakas &amp; Bickman, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0261927X12463005">Wells &amp; Bradfield, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0261927X12463005">Yarmey &amp; Kent, 1980</xref>), this study limited the channel of communication to audio recordings in order to isolate accent as a variable. Additionally, to avoid subconscious reactions that would naturally affect determinations of speaker credibility and introduce an unwanted variable into the research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0261927X12463005">Reich, 1981</xref>), two actors speaking with their natural, native accents were used instead of one actor affecting one accent or the other (as in a matched guise approach).</p>
<p>Speaker accent selection intended to minimize the potential that social stereotypes associated with specific foreign nationalities or U.S. regional dialects would affect results. To that end, one of the actors is a native Korean speaker and the other a native U.S. English speaker. Korean was selected as an appropriate foreign accent based on previous research that showed Korean accents are seldom (approximately 8% of the time) correctly identified in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0261927X12463005">Lindemann, 2003</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0261927X12463005">4</xref></sup> The U.S. accented actor is a native U.S. English speaker with a predominantly mid-Atlantic accent from the Philadelphia area, an accent that was chosen because of its status as a neutral prestige regional dialect in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0261927X12463005">Frumkin, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0261927X12463005">2007</xref>). The verbal performances of the actors were analyzed to verify minimal difference in acoustic factors—such as pitch variation and fundamental frequency differences—shown to affect perceptions of pleasantness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0261927X12463005">Eadie &amp; Doyle, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0261927X12463005">Fridland &amp; Bartlett, 2006</xref>) and, at least potentially, other variables in the solidarity dimension, such as likeability.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0261927X12463005">5</xref></sup></p>

<p>Participants were assigned to one of four treatment conditions within a two (accent: American vs. Korean) by two (defense vs. plaintiff) experimental design. To maintain ecological validity with the trial procedure cover story, the defendant treating physician was heard first, followed by the plaintiff’s expert witness. After hearing each testimony, participants were asked to rate the physicians and the testimonies they heard on a 14-item scale anchored 1 through 11 (believability, credibility, trustworthiness, knowledge, expertise, intelligence, competence, likeability, friendliness, warmth, judgment, persuasiveness, presentation style, and clarity), hereinafter referred to as <italic>speaker trait measures</italic>. The order of the presentation of these variables was randomized across participants.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0261927X12463005">10</xref></sup> After each testimony, participants were asked to identify the nationality of the speaker they had just heard in a free response format. In addition, after hearing both testimonies, participants were asked to provide their relative preference for the two expert witnesses. Specifically, participants were asked to indicate which of the two doctors they would side with in the dispute on a sliding scale from 1 to 11, the first doctor (1) to the second doctor (11).</p>

<title>Task 3: Self-Report 2</title>
<p>Because the APE Model assumes that the associative and propositional processes can inform each other throughout processing, the explicit attitudes found in Task 2 were checked with a third task. Task 3 consisted of a second response that measured participants’ reactions to a written statement regarding the outcome of the case. Specifically, participants were asked to imagine they were alternate jurors who did not vote on the case outcome but who heard all the testimony. They were then presented with two different outcomes, one at a time, and asked to rate on a scale from 1 (<italic>very unfair</italic>) to 11 (<italic>very fair</italic>) the fairness of each hypothetical outcome. Because Tasks 2 and 3 both involve explicit attitudes (propositional processes), it was expected that the fairness ratings in Task 3 would align with the preference ratings in Task 2.</p>

The <italic>D</italic> measure may be interpreted as equivalent to an effect size measure, similar to Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> measure; however, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> uses a pooled within-treatment standard deviation, whereas the IAT’s <italic>D</italic> measure uses a standard deviation calculated from only the scores in both measurement blocks. Previous IAT studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0261927X12463005">Greenwald et al., 2003</xref>) recommend that data be eliminated for ostensibly random responses (latencies of less than 300 ms for more than 10% of trials in combined task blocks) or lapses of concentration (latencies of greater than 10,000 ms).

<title>Correlations Between IAT Results and Explicit Findings</title>
<p>To examine the relationship between the IAT measure of implicit accent bias and witness preference, correlational analysis was conducted. Interestingly, a significant correlation between the IAT and witness preference obtained, such that a stronger pro-U.S. implicit bias predicted an increased likelihood of preferring the Korean expert witness explicitly (<italic>r</italic> = .26, <italic>p</italic> = .03). This result did not obtain for the control condition that incorporated expert witnesses who both had Korean accents (<italic>r</italic> = .02, <italic>p</italic> = .89) or American accents (<italic>r</italic> = −.08, <italic>p</italic> = .62), suggesting that the relationship between implicit accent attitude and witness preference is only significant when the participant heard two different accents during the testimony.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study’s IAT found that the participants’ implicit attitudes favor the U.S. accented speaker over the Korean accented speaker, confirming Hypothesis 1. Because implicit attitudes are linked to affective reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0261927X12463005">Gawronski &amp; Bodenhausen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0261927X12463005">Wittenbrink &amp; Schwarz, 2007</xref>), this result is consistent with the concept of a general negative affect toward foreign accented speech as posited by traditional language attitudes studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0261927X12463005">Ryan, 1983</xref>). In addition, because implicit attitudes are immediate reactions, this result suggests that for implicit attitude formation, <italic>foreign</italic> is a salient and meaningful out-group category for listeners irrespective of nationality attributions and that <italic>foreignness</italic> is a key component of the in-group/out-group distinction established by SIT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0261927X12463005">Lindemann, 2003</xref>). In fact, in the present study, participants sorted the audio stimuli before hearing one complete iteration of a stimulus: the average time for audio stimulus IAT responses was 1.233 ms, whereas the average length of one iteration of an audio stimulus was 1.25 ms. Because it is unlikely that specific speaker nationality could be attributed in such a short time but accent foreignness can be determined in as few as 30 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0261927X12463005">Flege, 1984</xref>), it appears that participants in the present study formed their implicit attitudes based on the nonnativeness of the accent and not on stereotypes related to any particular nationality. This result is consistent with research showing that language attitudes are formed even though listeners broadly and incorrectly identify the origin of a speaker’s accent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0261927X12463005">Niedzielski, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0261927X12463005">Preston, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, and more important, the IAT predicted expert witness choice, such that participants who revealed a stronger pro-U.S. bias on the IAT were more likely to explicitly favor the Korean accented speaker, regardless of whether the Korean accented speaker was the defendant treating physician or the expert witness for the plaintiff. Furthermore, this effect obtained only when participants heard expert testimony from both the U.S. and Korean accented witnesses. Because the explicit results obtained only in the accent comparison conditions, these findings show that the explicit preference for one speaker over the other is related to accent and not to witness role or to the order of accent presentation. Additionally, the predictive oppositional relationship between the pro-U.S. bias on the IAT and the likelihood of favoring the Korean accent in the explicit measures suggest two important conclusions with regard to language attitudes.</p>
<p>First, implicit and explicit attitudes toward the same foreign accented speech can diverge, generally confirming the study’s second hypothesis (Hypothesis 2). Hypothesis 2 specifically posited that there would be no significant bias in favor of either speaker in any of the four explicit measures of speaker preference. This hypothesis was based on the results from an underlying pilot study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0261927X12463005">Pantos &amp; Franklin, 2009</xref>) and on the notion that explicit attitudes are cognitively controllable. As such, in the context of the present study—a jury trial in which participants were asked to imagine themselves as fair and impartial jurors—participants were expected to overcome any implicit biases through additional cognitive processing. Instead of impartiality, however, the present findings showed a trend favoring the Korean accent in all four explicit measures, and although not statistically significant for the binary choice (the measure of which doctor the participant would side with in the dispute), the bias in favor of the Korean accented speaker for the three scalar analyses (the measure of the extent to which the participants sided with one of the speakers in Task 2 and the two fairness of verdict measures in Task 3) proved significant. The difference between the results for the binary and the scalar evaluations for siding with a speaker might be a reflection of a higher threshold for determining bias in binary selections, or some other aspect of the methodological choices made in the experiment design, such as inserting the 14 speaker trait questions between the two witness testimonies.</p>
<p>The second conclusion suggested by the findings of a predictive oppositional relationship between the two attitude constructs is that listeners can hypercorrect their explicit attitude reporting if they suspect their implicit attitudes might reveal a socially unacceptable bias. Such hypercorrection in attitude reporting has been shown to occur when participants are concerned about perceptions of their self-presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261927X12463005">Baron &amp; Banaji, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0261927X12463005">de Jong, van den Hout, Rietbroek, &amp; Huijding, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0261927X12463005">Lane et al., 2007</xref>). In the present study, almost half of the participant pool was composed of students from an introductory sociolinguistics class that was learning about the negative consequences of unfounded biases against foreign accented speech. If that is, in fact, the reason for the bias in favor of the native Korean speaker, then this result might indicate a type of hypercorrection in attitude reporting. It should be noted that the proportional aspect of the predictive oppositional result eliminates the possibility that the explicit bias in favor of the Korean speaker is related to the identification of the accent or the status of the speaker. Accent identification or status considerations alone cannot explain a higher likelihood of explicitly favoring the Korean accented speaker when implicit reactions favor the U.S. accented speaker. The proportionally oppositional attitude relationship between the two attitude constructs suggests there is an interaction between them.</p>
<p>With regard to the present study’s hypotheses, the results underscore the difference between the natures of the two attitude constructs and supports the argument that explicit attitudes are cognitively controllable, while implicit attitudes are not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261927X12463005">Botvinick, Braver, Barch, Carter, &amp; Cohen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0261927X12463005">Nosek et al., 2007</xref>). Nonetheless, both attitude constructs are authentic attitudes; both are reflective of an individual’s reactions to the stimulus; and both are cognitively formed by the individual—albeit through different cognitive processes. It is, therefore, not argued here that implicit attitudes are any more “real” than explicit attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0261927X12463005">Lane et al., 2007</xref>). The fact that the formation of explicit attitudes may be influenced directly or indirectly by social or other external factors does not diminish their authenticity, as long as they are reported honestly. It is also important to emphasize that the difference between the implicit bias in favor of the U.S. accented speaker and the explicit bias in favor of the foreign accented speaker does not indicate a change in attitude. It is not the case that the divergent attitudes mean that the pro-U.S. implicit attitudes changed to the pro-foreign explicit attitudes between tasks. Implicit attitudes remain separate from, and continue to coexist alongside, the individual’s explicit attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0261927X12463005">Rohner &amp; Björklund, 2006</xref>) and both can affect judgment and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0261927X12463005">Perkins &amp; Forehand, 2010</xref>). For language attitudes study, these results indicate that the same individual can process different attitudes toward the same attitude object and hold them concurrently, and consequently support the measurement of both implicit and explicit attitudes to provide a more complete picture of the individual’s attitudes, judgment, social perception, and potential behavior than measuring only one of these attitude constructs to the exclusion of the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0261927X12463005">Rohner &amp; Björklund, 2006</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section13-0261927X12463005" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Consistent with the Implicit Social Cognition’s conceptual framework, this study’s quantitative findings support the conclusion that listeners’ implicit and explicit attitudes are distinct attitude constructs, both with potential behavioral consequences. This study thus augments traditional language attitudes research by explaining the nature of reactions to foreign accented speech in terms consistent with broader attitudes study. Through the APE Model, the Implicit Social Cognition framework also provides the basis for a clear and comprehensive explanation of the cognitive processes underlying attitude formation and bears on certain previously unaddressed or unsettled practical considerations, including the effect of attitude on behavior. Because methods that involve introspection cannot capture implicit attitudes, and implicit measures do not capture explicit attitudes, this study argues that measuring both implicit and explicit attitudes using appropriate methods will provide a more complete analysis of listener reactions to speakers and their speech than will measuring explicit attitudes alone.</p>
<p>Of course, while this study represents a start, it also raises many questions. This study’s IAT findings do not mean that the participants exhibited a positive attitude toward U.S. accented speech or a negative attitude toward foreign accented speech in absolute terms. As such, the general negative affect toward foreign accented speech shown in this study is relative to U.S. accented speech, and the question of attitudes toward different varieties of foreign accented or U.S. accented speech relative to other varieties is reserved for future study. Researching the effect of a wide variety of accents would also help test the assertion that foreign accents, regardless of national origin, are out-group indicators. Future study is also planned to examine the effect of context on language attitude formation by examining language attitudes in various contexts other than the courtroom (such as the classroom or doctor’s office, for example) and to examine the effect of speaker gender on language attitudes, as well.</p>

<p>The purpose of measuring reactions to these variables was to test the trait dimension (status vs. solidarity) dichotomy maintained by language attitudes research and supported by an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0261927X12463005">Pantos &amp; Franklin, 2009</xref>). An analysis of those variables and findings is beyond the scope of this article.</p>
