<abstract>
<p>Third-party certification is usually a nonstate market-driven governance system in contrast to regulation. A firewood certification program in Chile uses a market-driven approach to increase compliance with regulation. The firewood certification program is unusual in operating in local markets and certifying a basic fuel. The program seeks to formalize the firewood market by certifying dealers rather than producers. Certified firewood is produced under a forest service management plan and dried to reduce air pollution. Using interviews with market actors, program staff, and consumers, as well as document analysis, the research looked at three arenas in the relationship of the certification to the state: (1) the role of the state in program governance, (2) the role of coercion, and (3) the consequences of market formalization for program goals. The study found that public agencies constituted a majority of the local certification councils. The program encouraged regulatory agencies to use enforcement against dealers who did not comply with regulations. The focus on formalizing the firewood market included imposition of the value-added tax (VAT), which increased the price of certified wood and diminished the priority of other certification goals. Certification opened the market to new actors and greater capital penetration and integration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Forest certification is one of the most important forms of alternative environmental governance, in which consumer decisions are intended to shape the conditions under which forest commodities are produced. Certification programs are usually seen as an alternative to regulation by the state, but some relationship with the state is inevitable. Thus, the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), the premier NGO for forest certification, excludes government agencies from participating in its governing assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1070496512449336">Forest Stewardship Council, 2011a</xref>), even as its Principle 1 is “compliance with all applicable laws” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1070496512449336">Forest Stewardship Council, 2011b</xref>). Relationships between certification processes and the state can be complex and are an aspect of forest certification to which relatively little attention has been given in the literature.</p>
<p>This article explores the relationships between the state and certification, using a program to certify firewood<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1070496512449336">1</xref></sup> in Chile as a case study. The program is the National System for the Certification of Firewood (<italic>Sistema Nacional de Certificación de Leña</italic> [SNCL]). The SNCL is unusual and innovative on several fronts. It is one of the few programs to certify firewood.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1070496512449336">2</xref></sup> It operates in local rather than international or even national markets, linking consumers with producers who are geographically and sometimes socially proximate to each other. Firewood producers are overwhelmingly marginal subsistence farmers with fragmented forest plots; firewood dealers likewise tend to be marginal and employed part-time. The SNCL certifies a product that is a daily necessity for the vast majority of households, touching consumers with considerably less purchasing power than most forest certification programs. The program seeks to change not only the environmental and social conditions under which firewood is produced but also to create more equitable relationships along the entire commodity chain. It seeks to do all this through a process of strengthening adherence to regulation by formalizing the firewood markets. In addition, the SNCL addresses air pollution problems by offering consumers firewood that has been dried. The SNCL thus engages issues in diverse policy domains, all within a single, if complex, national policy context. Most important, for our purposes, the SNCL is unusual in the high degree of involvement by the state in its implementation, to the point of challenging what is meant by a “market-driven” program.</p>
<p>In a major review of forest certification, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1070496512449336">Bass, Thornber, Markopoulos, Roberts, and Grieg-Gran (2001</xref>, p. viii) discuss several types of certification program. The most common form, which “reflects the original intention of forest certification,” is the market-oriented certification of forest products. In addition, there is “regulation-oriented verification to strengthen or complement forest law enforcement” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1070496512449336">Bass et al., 2001</xref>, p. viii). This type of certification program has been little discussed in the literature. As we shall see, the SNCL in Chile is both market oriented and regulation oriented, attempting to reinforce regulation by encouraging consumers to opt for certified wood among market choices. The program is best understood (and describes itself) as a <italic>public-private</italic> (rather than nonstate) market-driven governance system. Relationships between the public and private spheres in the SNCL raise questions about the nature and limits of certification. What are the boundaries of state and civil society? What does it mean to be both market oriented and regulation oriented? This article seeks to examine these issues through an empirical study based on ethnographic fieldwork. In this sense it is intended to contribute to the growing literature of an anthropology of policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1070496512449336">Shore, Wright, &amp; Però, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1070496512449336">Wedel, Shore, Feldman, &amp; Lathrop, 2005</xref>), as well as to the debates about forest certification. An examination of the SNCL shows that it has entered into a complex and paradoxical relationship with the state that to some extent distorts the goals of the program.</p>
<p>My study of firewood certification in Chile began in 2004, with a first site visit to Valdivia, where the program began. I returned in 2005 and attended the ceremony that inaugurated firewood certification as a national-level policy, creating the SNCL. After a third visit in 2007, I returned to Chile for 6 months in 2008. My research on the firewood market and certification program included approximately 70 structured and semistructured interviews with consumers, intermediaries, producers, certification program personnel and others involved in forest, and other firewood-related policy in Valdivia, Temuco, and Santiago. Site visits, ethnographic observations with numerous informal conversations, and document review also were important components of data collection.</p>

<title>Native Forest, Firewood, and Chilean Forest Policy</title>
<p>As Chileans would say, firewood is not a minor theme. It is the most important fuel in south-central Chile,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1070496512449336">3</xref></sup> heating 80% or more of urban residences and virtually all rural ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1070496512449336">Gómez-Lobo, Lima, Hill, &amp; Meneses, 2006</xref>). At a national level, firewood is second only to petroleum as a source of energy. Moreover, firewood is the most important product of the region’s threatened native forests, constituting 80% to 90% of native timber cut. The Chilean Winter Rainfall Valdivian Forests are regarded as one of South America’s natural treasures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1070496512449336">Neira, Verscheure, &amp; Revenga, 2002</xref>) and listed as one of the 25 global biodiversity hotspots by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1070496512449336">Conservation International (2011)</xref>. Finally, the burning of firewood is one of the major sources of air pollution in the cities where the SNCL operates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1070496512449336">Chile Ambiente Corporación, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1070496512449336">Toro, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The origins and structure of the SNCL cannot be understood without being placed in the context of Chilean forest policy history. The Chilean forestry sector was profoundly shaped by the Pinochet military regime in the Decree Law 701 of 1974, which promoted the development of a private forest industry based on plantations of exotic species, through subsidies and tax relief. The development of a forest industry was important to the military regime’s strategy of privatizing and diversifying the Chilean economy. There was no room in the new policy for small- and middle-sized landholders, who lacked capital and credit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1070496512449336">Lara &amp; Veblen, 1993</xref>, p. 129). Government assistance went instead to a handful of large national and international enterprises. From the point of view of its advocates, the new policy was a tremendous success, with more than a million hectares of forest plantation planted by 1990 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1070496512449336">Lara &amp; Veblen, 1993</xref>, p. 124). Another million were developed in the succeeding 15 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1070496512449336">Astorga &amp; Rebolledo, 2004</xref>, p. 21).</p>
<p>The new plantations radically altered the physical and social landscape. The afforestation provision of Decree Law 701, which was intended to cover only deforested areas, was loosely applied, and many areas of native forest were converted to plantations. Environmental groups saw this “substitution” as the major threat to native forests, producing as much as half of the loss of native forest in recent decades. Even during the military regime, critics highlighted the environmental damage caused by the monocultural plantations, as well as the destruction of rural communities and employment opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1070496512449336">Camus Gayán, 2006</xref>). Decree Law 701 is largely silent on issues regarding the native forest, though it did require the issuance of a forest management plan before native forest plots could be harvested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1070496512449336">Neira et al., 2002</xref>, p. 27).</p>
<p>With the restoration of democracy, debates about environmental policy came to the fore in the 1990s, with the participation of an active civil sector, including industry and the newly energized environmental NGO sector. The broad debate about the role of regulation in environmental governance became crystallized in debate about a bill to support native forests as Decree Law 701 had supported plantations, with incentives available to small landowners. Environmentalists argued that support for impoverished forest owners was necessary to restore and maintain native forests. They argued that the public good requires regulation to protect native forest even on private land. For the plantation industry, private property rights were paramount; they argued that the state should not interfere with the economic activities of landowners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1070496512449336">Arnold, 2003</xref>, pp. 321-322; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1070496512449336">Carruthers, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1070496512449336">Clapp, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1070496512449336">Silva, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>A bill for a Native Forest Law was submitted to the Chilean congress in 1992. Legislators were deadlocked as the debate continued for 15 years. Without a law to regulate native forests: The Chilean Forest Service, Corporación Nacional Forestal [CONAF] did not have a sufficient legal mandate or the resources to provide services to small landholders of native forest. This was made evident in the complete failure of the government to prevent damage to native forests during a boom in wood chips from the mid-1980s through the 1990s, when national and international firms contracted with marginal forest owners to extract wood on a much larger scale than the firewood market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1070496512449336">Centro de Análisis de Políticas Públicas, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1070496512449336">Claude, 1997</xref>). Both sides agreed that the issue of native forest conversion and other issues could be handled through private agreements, outside of state intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1070496512449336">Arnold, 2003</xref>, pp. 321-322). It is in this policy context that certification emerged as a means to move forward the management of native forest.</p>
<p>The Native Forest Law (Ley 20.283, “Recuperación de Bosque Nativo y Fomento Forestal”) was not enacted until 2007, two years after the SNCL was formed, and was not implemented until 2009. The law that finally passed did not significantly strengthen CONAF’s ability to support native forest management or even enforce existing regulations, nor did it provide broad subsidies to the marginal landowners who hold most of Chile’s private native forests. Instead, it provided a competitive grant program for specific activities. The Native Forest Law in the end did not result in a significantly changed policy environment, and the SNCL retained its place at the center of Chilean efforts to improve native forest management.</p>

<title>Certification as Environmental Governance</title>
<p>Much of the literature on forest certification does not lend itself to easy application to the present case study. Firewood certification in Chile spans different scales, from local to national, but has little to do with transnational environmental governance, for example. Analyses of networks and motivations of relatively powerful firms in decisions about certifying seem discordant with the marginal producers and dealers in the firewood markets. Even the Forest Stewardship Council, the seminal forest certification NGO about which so much has been written, is quite different in its structure and relationship to states from the SNCL.</p>
<p>Several streams of analysis of governance and certification have been useful for understanding the SNCL. These include discussions of the place of the state in governance, the context of neoliberal policies, and the relationship of certification to markets. Hysing encourages us to avoid thinking of forms of governance such as forest certification as being entirely separate from regulatory and other forms of state control. Hysing seeks to examine the “story line” of a transformation from government (top-down control) to governance (collaboration between public and private actors, with boundaries blurred) by an empirical study of two policy sectors on Sweden, forestry and transport. Hysing shows that government and governance, rather than being mutually exclusive categories, are two poles of a continuum, with multiple modes of governing combined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1070496512449336">Hysing, 2009</xref>, p. 652) in any given policy sector. The role of the state had changed, but not in a unidirectional way from government to governance. To the contrary, on an empirical level, multiple modes of governing were combined. In the Swedish forestry sector, for example, private certification grew, but at the same time the Swedish forest service was centralized and the state renewed its role as a major forest owner (p. 666). There has been not so much a shrinking as a shifting of the role of the state.</p>
<p>Various analysts have examined certification in the context of the neoliberal state, since certification has emerged as a form of neoliberal governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1070496512449336">Guthman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1070496512449336">Klooster, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1070496512449336">2010</xref>). Neoliberalism is based on an ideology of reliance on “self-regulating” markets, retrenchment of the state, and the concept of a society composed of individuals acting as consumers. Peck and Tickell maintain that neoliberalism should be understood as a process, neoliberal<italic>ization</italic>, rather than as an end state. They characterize this process as having two phases: roll-back, “preoccupied with the active <italic>destruction</italic> and <italic>discreditation</italic> of the Keynesian-welfarist and social-collectivist institutions” and the emergent roll-out, “focused on the purposeful <italic>construction</italic> and <italic>consolidation</italic> of neoliberalized state forms, modes of governance, and regulatory relations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1070496512449336">Peck &amp; Tickell, 2002</xref>, p. 384, emphasis in original). Chile has been one of the premier models of neoliberalism since the military government of Augusto Pinochet in the 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1070496512449336">Alexander, 2009</xref>). Roll-back broadly defines Chilean policy of the military government and roll-out has characterized the approach of the several governments since the restoration of democracy in 1989. A counterphase of “push-back” entails resistance to roll-out neoliberalization. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1070496512449336">Klooster (2010</xref>, p. 118) asks whether certification systems can comprise “an effective ‘push-back’ against the neoliberalization of commodity networks even though they make use of the same ideas behind other aspects of roll-out neoliberalization.”</p>
<p>The roll-out phase includes new forms of public-private governance, including “state-led encouragement of civil society institutions to provide erstwhile retracted services and other compensatory mechanisms” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1070496512449336">Guthman, 2007</xref>, p. 465). In this phase we have “a transfer of the operations of government (in Foucault’s extended sense) to nonstate entities” (Ferguson &amp; Gupta, 2008, p. 989). Guthman (p. 465) adds that some critics “argue that this shift from anti-regulation to meta-regulation is a bait and switch, allowing the appearance of no government when, indeed, the state has grown considerably and society is more rule-bound than ever.” This “baroque” quality of roll-out neoliberalization helps to situate the many paradoxes and ironies of certification as a form of environmental and social governance, including firewood certification in Chile.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1070496512449336">Raynolds (2000)</xref>, among others, is interested in the Polanyian concept of “embeddedness” of markets in social and political relationships. Alternative forms of trade such as certification both engage in and contest the market as the determiner of values. They use the “strategy of operating ‘in and against the market,’ questioning the market devaluation of people and nature, and yet doing so through market channels” themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1070496512449336">Raynolds, 2000</xref>, p. 299). Operating through the market runs the risk, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1070496512449336">Taylor (2005)</xref> says, of “being captured by the market’s conventional logic, practices, and dominant actors” (p. 130). This risk is particularly strong when certification programs engage in “mainstreaming,” that is expanding the market share of certified wood by encouraging large-scale retailers to buy certified wood. The focus on retailers increases their power in the certified market and tends to decrease the possibility that a premium paid by consumers would work its way up the commodity chain to producers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1070496512449336">Bass et al., 2001</xref>, p. 86; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1070496512449336">Klooster, 2005</xref>, pp. 406-407).</p>
<p>Among alternative forms of environmental governance, forest certification programs tend to operate within existing markets rather than challenging them. The SNCL is distinct in its attempt to change market relationships throughout the firewood commodity chain. It posits the firewood dealer as the most important actor in the market and seeks to reduce dealers’ power through creation of more transparent market transactions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1070496512449336">
<title>Principles of Firewood Certification</title>
<p>A useful way to understand the goals of the SNCL and its relationship to the state is to review its four basic principles, which are concerned with</p>
<list id="list1-1070496512449336" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>compliance with regulations,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the origin and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>quality of the firewood, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>service to the consumer.</p></list-item>
</list>
<sec id="section5-1070496512449336">
<title>Principle 1</title>
<sec id="section6-1070496512449336">
<title>The dealer should comply with all laws and regulations in effect, including tax, labor, transport, municipal licenses, and sanitation</title>
<p>This kind of principle is standard in forest certification programs. As noted previously, the first principle of the Forest Stewardship Council calls for compliance with all applicable laws. The implications of this legal and regulatory principle vary from country to country, depending on how developed regulations are, the degree to which they are enforced, and their relevance to the certification program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1070496512449336">Ebeling &amp; Yasué, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In the SNCL, Principle 1 is not just a proforma statement. It is the foundation of the program’s approach, which is based on the assumption that the root of firewood problems in Chile is the informality of the firewood market. These are the forest degradation that comes from unsustainable harvesting techniques (<italic>floreo</italic>) at the beginning of its “life cycle and at the end, the air pollution resulting from burning firewood” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1070496512449336">Kausel &amp; Vergara, 2003</xref>, p. 49; my translation from Spanish). Both of these problems are seen as aggravated by the lack of regulation in the firewood markets, according to the analysis on which the SNCL approach is based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1070496512449336">Reyes, n.d</xref>.).</p>
<p>Each urban firewood market is separate from the others, given the costs of transporting firewood over long distances. The commodity chain has many diverse and marginal actors, such as truck drivers who sell firewood on a seasonal basis. Wood is sold to consumers at fixed places of sale, by itinerant truck drivers, or in stores. The informality of the firewood markets is most strikingly noted in the failure of the state to collect the value-added tax (VAT) on firewood; no other commodity of such importance has escaped the 19% tax.</p>
<p>According to Reyes’ (n.d.) influential analysis for the design of the program, the informality of the firewood markets works to the advantage of intermediaries at the expense of both producers and consumers. Producers are unable to obtain market information and easy access to buyers. Consumers are at the mercy of dealers, who are known for their tricks of constructing “castles” (<italic>castillos</italic>) of firewood that are less than the stere meter they are supposed to be. Because the dealers do not collect the VAT, they do not provide an official receipt (<italic>boleta</italic>), which the consumer can use to lodge a formal complaint with the National Consumer Service. The focus of the program, therefore, is on firewood dealers (rather than producers) and their compliance with regulations, from proper registration for their trucks to paying health fees for their employees to registering as businesses under VAT regulations.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1070496512449336">
<title>Principle 2</title>
<sec id="section8-1070496512449336">
<title>The firewood needs to come from a forest plot with a current management plan approved by CONAF and carried out in a good manner</title>
<p>This principle is the core of the sustainable forest management component of the program. In terms of requiring compliance with existing regulations, Principle 2 is similar to Principle 1, except that the regulations apply primarily to the producer rather than the dealer. The mechanism for improved native forest management is adherence to a management plan (<italic>plan de manejo</italic>) issued by the Chilean forest service (CONAF). The management plan is a technical document that specifies a harvesting schedule and quantities. CONAF offers free services to prepare management plans for the small landholders who are the main producers of firewood, but its personnel are limited and few small-scale firewood producers have obtained a plan.</p>
<p>The second part of the principle, that the management plan be carried out in a good manner, has been even more difficult to achieve than simply possessing a plan. In practice, CONAF site inspections have been rare, due to a lack of field personnel. To the chagrin of numerous native forest activists who were interviewed, the emphasis is placed on fulfilling a bureaucratic requirement rather than providing extension services. Lara estimated in 1996 that silvicultural practices had been used on only 3% of native forest plots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1070496512449336">Lara, Donoso, &amp; Aravena, 1996</xref>). In practice, there is nothing to prevent landholders from treating the management plan as a simple cutting permit, without following its prescriptions for sustainable forest management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1070496512449336">Centro de Análisis de Políticas Públicas, 2010</xref>, p. 147).</p>
<p>In the firewood markets, the most important component of the management plan is the set of transport permits (<italic>guías de transporte</italic>) attached to it. Dealers who transport wood to urban markets are supposed to carry a permit as proof that the wood has been legally harvested. Dealers with nonapproved wood either transport it without a permit or use a blank permit obtained (sometimes purchased) from another producer, filling it in on the spot if the truckload is checked.</p>
<p>The SNCL program supports the goals of CONAF and does not require more from producers than CONAF would if it were able to carry out its functions effectively. What Principle 2 adds to current regulation is the ability to audit whether producers have complied with their native forest management plan. Dealers risk losing their certification if third-party auditors find that the producers who supply them have not followed their plan. Thus, although the SNCL does not certify producers, its auditors have authority over producers wanting to sell in the certified market.</p>

<p>The SNCL goes beyond the scope of most forest certification programs by offering an improved product: firewood that has been dried and thus burns more efficiently, with less pollution. Firewood with moisture content higher than 25% diverts the energy of combustion into producing steam rather than burning the wood, thus releasing particulates (PM<sub>10</sub>) into the air (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1070496512449336">Farías, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1070496512449336">Instituto Nacional de Normalización, 2005</xref>). Principle 3 addresses an entirely separate policy domain from sustainable forest management: the postconsumption effect of using firewood, rather than its source.</p>
<p>Air pollution caused by fall and winter firewood use is a serious problem in all the cities where the SNCL operates, and a critical one in several of them, especially Temuco and Coihaique, which are under emergency Environmental Pollution Control Plans (<italic>Planes de Descontaminación Ambiental</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1070496512449336">“Coihaique encabeza el ranking de las ciudades con mayor contaminación atmosférica del país,” 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1070496512449336">Toro, 2003</xref>). A study by the Chilean National Environmental Council (CONAMA) found that almost 90% of winter air pollution was caused by firewood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1070496512449336">Reyes &amp; Venegas, 2009</xref>). Proposed solutions to the pollution problem include more efficient stoves and better insulation in housing, both of which would require large public and private investments. A quicker way to alleviate the problem is to dry the firewood before it is put onto the market.</p>
<p>The pollution problem has a greater public urgency than deteriorating native forests. Pollution affects every urban resident in southern Chile, while the fragmented native forest plots are dispersed out of public sight. Improving air pollution is more likely than native forest management to “make or break” the SNCL in terms of public opinion. Not only is pollution the most visible problem related to firewood but it is also caused by the very people who suffer its consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1070496512449336">Kausel &amp; Vergara, 2003</xref>, p. 49). Monitoring for moisture content is not difficult, as every certified dealer has a moisture gauge. Achieving the goal of 25% moisture content in firewood is not so easy, however (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1070496512449336">Neira, 2009</xref>). The southern winters are so damp that the moisture content increases after a summer of drying, and it often takes a second summer to achieve the desired level. Firewood must be withheld from the market during the drying period, which would deprive the producer of income for at least a year.</p>

<title>Principle 4</title>
<sec id="section12-1070496512449336">
<title>The dealer should provide the consumer with precise and correct information about the product offered</title>
<p>With Principles 3 and 4, the SNCL addresses the entire commodity chain of firewood, from production to consumption. Whereas the first three principles address concerns of market formalization, sustainable forest management, and air pollution, the last principle is unusual in addressing the concerns of consumers themselves. It calls for the dealer to guarantee the information provided to the consumer about the origin, quantity, moisture content, and species of the firewood. The guarantor of this information is the official receipt (<italic>boleta</italic>) that the dealer gives the consumer when the VAT is paid on a product.</p>
<p>Through Principles 3 and 4, the consumer is motivated not only by ethical concerns about sustainability but also by specific benefits to themselves: a better product and more secure service. Principle 4 would be unlikely in a certification program operating in an international market. It is possible in Chile because the firewood commodity chain is short; the certified dealer often relates directly with both the producer and the consumer, and of course, because they are all subject to the same national regulatory system. By 2008, 10% of the firewood market in Valdivia and 5% in Temuco, the first two cities where the SNCL operated, had become certified. We can conclude from those figures that approximately the same percentages of firewood purchases in those cities paid the VAT and were of dried wood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1070496512449336">Centro de Análisis de Políticas Públicas, 2010</xref>, p. 157).</p>

<title>The State and Governance in the SNCL</title>
<p>Reviewing the principles of the SNCL helps us to understand the content and some of the context of firewood certification in Chile. In exploring the relationship between the state and this certification program, I address three issues: governance of the certification program, the role of coercion, and the consequences of market formalization as a central goal.</p>
<p>In order to examine the role of the state in the SNCL, it is useful to compare it with an ideal type of a purely market-based system; Cashore et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1070496512449336">Cashore, Auld, &amp; Newsom, 2004</xref>) provide just such a model. Cashore et al. are interested in analyzing questions of authority in forest certification programs as nonstate market-driven governance systems. Their development of an ideal type that delineates the role of the state in such systems provides a useful benchmark for examining the degrees of participation by the state in the SNCL. At the core of a nonstate certification system is the idea that the state refrains from using its sovereign power to sanction parties for not participating in certification or not meeting its standards. Participation in the certification process is expected to be entirely voluntary, as is participation by consumers in the certified market. The certified market is intended to provide incentives to producers and intermediaries by rewarding them with a premium on the prices consumers are willing to pay to attain the goals of the certification program or by strengthening or diversifying their share of the market.</p>
<p>In this ideal type, states may act as stakeholders without serving as an authority. As consumers of forest products, governments may shape procurement policies that support certification. As owners of forestland, governments may choose to abide by certification program standards. Governments may also provide resources for developing standards and to help groups that are attempting to become certified. Thus, states may be involved in a “nonstate” certification system as long as they do not direct the system or use their coercive powers to force actors into it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1070496512449336">Cashore et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>An observer expecting a nonstate governance system for forest certification would be quite surprised at an early meeting of the Firewood Certification Council (Cocel in its Spanish abbreviation) in Valdivia, Chile. The Cocel is the local SNCL council for each urban firewood market, with the authority to issue the seal of certification to firewood dealers. Of the 10 members on the Valdivia Cocel, 8 represented the state in the form of CONAF, the National Environmental Commission, the National Consumer Service, the Sanitary Authority, the Institute of Agricultural Development, the Internal Tax Service, the regional government, and the municipal government. Joining them were representatives of the local semipublic university (the Universidad Austral), and the NGO that designed and implemented the project, the Association of Foresters for the Native Forest (AIFBN). This program was clearly divergent from the ideal type, as well as the Forest Stewardship Council model of nonstate governance mentioned previously.</p>
<p>Reasons for the participation of some public agencies are more evident than for others. CONAF, the Environmental Commission, and the Institute for Agricultural Development are involved because most firewood is produced on forest fragments belonging to small landholders. The Sanitary Authority, a branch of the Ministry of Health, is concerned with the some of the conditions of workers in the firewood sector, and the National Consumer Service protects consumers from abuse. The presence of the Internal Tax Service is less evidently related to firewood issues, but is key to understanding the involvement of the state in the program, as will be discussed later. It is noteworthy that the major stakeholders in firewood certification, the producers and the dealers, were not represented on the Cocel.</p>
<p>The composition of the Cocel obscures the importance of the AIFBN, the NGO that conceived and initiated the project. The AIFBN is a strong organization with roots in the forestry school of the Universidad Austral de Chile, which has been at the forefront of experimentation in native forest silviculture and in critiques of Chilean forestry policy. The AIFBN received funding to initiate a firewood certification pilot program in Valdivia. A related program was started in Temuco in Region IX under the auspices of the Department of Social Action of the Catholic diocesan office. Even before the first certified firewood was even sold, the program, with funding from the European Union, was expanded to eight cities in south-central Chile.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1070496512449336">4</xref></sup> This expansion created the SNCL through an agreement between CONAF and several civil organizations, including the AIFBN, whose role shifted to providing auxiliary forestry services to firewood producers.</p>
<p>Public agencies are found in all the certification councils of the SNCL. Sixty-five percent of the membership of the 8 local Cocels was from the public sector in 2009, when all the Cocels had begun operation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1070496512449336">Sistema Nacional de Certificación de Leña, 2009</xref>). Public agency representatives were the majority in every city except one (Temuco). The SNCL’s national certification council (Conacel) has the permanent representation of CONAF, the National Environmental Council, the National Consumer Service, and the National Tax Service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1070496512449336">SNCL, 2011a</xref>). The “state” then has a predominant weight on the governing bodies of the SNCL. Even the police are represented on several Cocels. It is not unreasonable to anticipate that as a whole these agencies are likely to give priority to the regulation-oriented dimension of the SNCL, rendering it more “prescriptive,” to use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1070496512449336">McDermott, Noah and Cashore’s (2008)</xref> term.</p>
<p>The state, of course, is not a single actor with coherence and agency separate from society, even if it has the appearance of separateness from nonstate entities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1070496512449336">Mitchell, 2006</xref>). Each of the public agencies represented on the firewood certification councils has its own agendas and interests, its own degree of power and priority within the current political configuration, and its own relationship to the goals of the program. Even the boundaries between which entities are private and which are public are not entirely clear-cut. CONAF, which implements Chilean national forest policy, is structured as a private corporation within the Ministry of Agriculture. Nevertheless, given its functions, I have counted it as a public agency serving in all eight Cocels. On the other hand, there are numerous consumer NGOs in the Cocels that were formed by legislation to serve as conduits to the National Consumer Service. I have counted them as private groups, but they are closely related to the parent agency.</p>

<title>Coercion and Certification</title>
<p>Bass et al. note that regulation-oriented certification is appealing in situations where illegal forest activities are widespread.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1070496512449336">5</xref></sup> This is certainly the case with firewood in Chile, at least from the point of view of the regulatory agencies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1070496512449336">Bass et al. (2001</xref>, pp. 76-77), however, note that “the effectiveness of certification as a law enforcement tool is limited by the voluntary nature of most certification schemes: certification can only induce producers—not coerce them—into complying with legislation, and an economic incentive is required.” The SNCL seems to call upon the state to contravene the notion that participation by dealers in certification must be voluntary. The position of the SNCL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1070496512449336">SNCL, 2011b</xref>) with regard to the role of the state in certification is summarized in the introduction to the English-language version of its website:
<disp-quote>
<p>Non regulation of the firewood market is one of the main reasons for environmental and social problems related to firewood, for example air pollution and forest deterioration. To overcome this situation, one of the possible measures is to demand that the Government immediately and resolutely ensures that all legal requirements concerning the selling of firewood are applied. However this would go beyond the dealer’s capacity to adapt quickly and would jeopardize firewood supply. That’s why the decision has been made in favour of a voluntary certification system allowing a gradual regulation of the firewood market.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The position of the SNCL, then, is that the core problem is the lack of formalization of the firewood markets. A possible, but ineffective, approach would be to insist that all regulations are immediately and rigorously applied. A reasonable alternative is to create a system whereby dealers can gradually come into compliance with regulations without attracting the immediate sanctions of the state. For dealers, then, participation in certification is voluntary in the sense that they can seek refuge in a certification process that allows them to come up to standards at a reasonable pace, or face the possibility of a government crackdown. Within the SNCL, adherence to the program is verified by third-party audits; outside of the haven of certification, dealers are left to the sanctions of the state.</p>
<p>In all of its written materials, the SNCL describes itself as a voluntary program. The manual for certification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1070496512449336">SNCL, 2011c</xref>, p. 7) states this somewhat ominously: The program “is voluntary, that is to say, the law does not obligate one to become certified. Nevertheless, enforcement in the informal market is becoming greater and greater. . . .”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1070496512449336">6</xref></sup> This increase in enforcement is not independent of the certification program. To the contrary, the SNCL sees immediate coercive action against dealers who remain in the informal market as “fundamental.” The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1070496512449336">SNCL (2011d)</xref> website describes its monitoring program:
<disp-quote>
<p>The monitoring programme is fundamental to guarantee the success of a firewood certification system. It’s [<italic>sic</italic>] goal is to fight the black market and to coordinate monitoring between the relevant public services, such as the Police Carabineros de Chile, tax authorities Servicio de Impuestos Internos, the National Forestry Corporation Corporación Nacional Forestal and the relevant local authority.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The Spanish-language version uses the word <italic>fiscalización</italic>, which has the stronger sense of investigation and enforcement than the English word “monitoring.” SNCL staff have encouraged tax, forestry, and police agents to step up and coordinate their actions against uncertified dealers. The quotation above makes it clear that <italic>fiscalización</italic> is an integral part of the SNCL program rather than the interest of a few zealous staff members.</p>
<p>The rhetorical device of referring to the existing firewood market as a “black market” should also be noted. The term can be used in a variety of contexts to refer to illegal or extralegal exchanges, often with the implication that these exchanges are parallel to a legal market. A suggestion that the existing firewood market was an illegal activity existing alongside a legal market would be unwarranted. Before the entry of firewood certification and during its first years, the extralegal firewood market was the ordinary way of conducting business; alternatives to it simply did not exist. In this sense, the only “black market” that <italic>fiscalización</italic> can fight is one that would be created through greatly increased and effective enforcement.</p>
<p>It is appropriate to ask here why it is the dealer rather than the producer who is certified by the SNCL. The analysis of the firewood markets that underlies the SNCL’s strategy of reforming the entire commodity chain presents the image of dealers who benefit from the irregularity of the informal market. It is the dealer who holds a monopsonistic control over the market, with both producers and consumers at their mercy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1070496512449336">Reyes, n.d</xref>.).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1070496512449336">7</xref></sup> Yet many of the firewood dealers, especially the itinerant truck drivers, are also marginal actors, working seasonally, unable even to keep up the registration and insurance for their vehicles. One need not dispute the characterization of firewood dealers as tricky characters, however, to note also that they are the actors in the market who are most susceptible to coercion.</p>
<p>The dealers are endowed with greater culpability than the producers, who also ignore or defy CONAF regulations, and the consumers, who have been accomplices in avoiding the VAT on firewood. Enforcement is more difficult with producers and consumers, however. The small and medium forest owners are too dispersed and their holdings too fragmented to control easily. Moreover, as property owners they can refuse to allow CONAF agents to enter their land. There is a broad consensus that the sanctions in Decree Law 701 against producers have failed, in large part because local courts decline to impose fines or other judgments against forest owners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1070496512449336">Centro de Análisis de Políticas Públicas, 2010</xref>, p. 152). While it is illegal for producers to sell native forest products without a management plan, in practice it is the dealer who is the target of <italic>fiscalización</italic> through the transport permit for firewood.</p>
<p>Consumers for their part are too numerous and too concentrated (80% or more of urban households) to police, even though the consumer as much as the dealer engages in a transaction outside the tax regulations. In a city such as Valdivia, the consumer does not experience the extralegality of firewood. Household purchases of firewood are public events: The firewood is stacked and cut on the sidewalk outside the residence, often over several days. The consumer has no more concern about buying firewood than about buying gasoline. Indeed in the informal market it is not possible for consumers to pay the VAT because dealers are not registered with the Internal Tax Service and do not have the forms needed to record and pay the tax.</p>
<p>The dealers, in contrast, are relatively few in number. They necessarily bring the dispersed firewood into narrow spatial streams (roads leading into the city, fixed places of sale) where it can be “monitored” before it disappears again into the storage areas of individual households. Police action against dealers usually occurs on roads leading into the city, away from the involvement of either producer or consumer. Until the advent of the SNCL, enforcement was sporadic and conducted during regular working hours, leaving firewood transporters to bring in undocumented firewood at night or on weekends. My understanding from interviews is that the pressure to increase enforcement has been exerted by SNCL staff on the regulatory agencies, rather than the other way around.</p>
<p>The explicit and implicit coercion placed on firewood dealers challenges the notion that the SNCL is a fully market-driven process. Unequivocally, the SNCL can describe itself as a voluntary program with respect to consumers, who are still free to decide whether to buy certified wood or not. Their purchases of certified wood “drive” the system in that they generate the certification fee that supports the program and the prospects for increased income that motivate certified dealers. In the market-driven model of certification, the actions of consumers are supposed to generate incentives for undergoing the rigors of certification. In other forest certification programs, these economic incentives may include a premium on the price of certified wood, an increased share of the market, and an improved image. For dealers in the informal firewood markets, however, positive motivations are mixed with real fear of enforcement.</p>
<p>One can imagine a simpler certification program that focused on firewood producers rather than dealers, helping them to use CONAF management plans and to dry their wood economically. The designers of the SNCL took the much more complex route of formalization of the entire commodity chain in part because of their concern for equity for producers and consumers. Formalization, however, has consequences that go beyond the direct goals of the SNCL.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1070496512449336">
<title>The Consequences of Formalization</title>
<p>The written record of the three public workshops that preceded the formation of the SNCL indicates that the idea of formalization as the way to solve Chile’s firewood problems was not only already central but that it was not questioned as a means for better forest management or reduced air pollution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1070496512449336">Anonymous, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1070496512449336">Pantoja Toro, 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1070496512449336">2005b</xref>). Likewise, the idea of coercion was present from the earliest days of the SNCL. Neither formalization nor coercion as a method to reinforce formalization was a condition imposed by the state on the certification process. Rather, both ideas emerged from the nonstate actors in the process.</p>
<p>Because of its emphasis on formalization, the SNCL, using the format of a market-driven program, has succeeded in expanding the state’s regulatory reach over firewood production, marketing, and consumption. The SNCL helps CONAF to fulfill functions that its modest funding has limited, and to outsource those functions by third-party auditing of compliance with native forest management plans. The firewood certification program has anticipated public policy in applying a standard of drying wood to a 25% moisture content. This standard is now being applied to cities with air pollution emergencies. Most strikingly, the SNCL has helped the government to collect the VAT on a commodity that previously eluded it. Financially, the state is the “big winner” (<italic>gran ganador</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1070496512449336">Pantoja Toro, 2005b</xref>, p. 9) in the alteration of the firewood commodity chain. All of these actions have represented an expansion rather than a retrenchment of state influence on the firewood market.</p>
<p>Formalization is a multidimensional process, involving forestry, air pollution, vehicle registration, labor codes, municipal licenses, and tax regulations. For the consumer, formalization involves most notably payment of the VAT of 19%, which the SNCL made possible. Imposing the VAT has no direct relationship to the alleviation of native forest degradation and air pollution. Revenues collected through the VAT are allocated to the general fund and are no more likely to be allocated to firewood-related issues than to anything else. Nevertheless, in terms of its impact on consumers, the 19% VAT has the greatest effect of any component of the SNCL program.</p>
<p>There was no public announcement of an effective tax increase; rather, imposition of the VAT is treated as a technical rather than a political matter. Price increases in basic fuels are not always so apolitical in Chile. In January 2011, the state oil and gas company Endap proposed an increase of 16.8% for natural gas, the basic fuel of the far southern XII Region (Magallanes). Protesters in Magallanes immediately blocked roads and ports; after a week of protests, the Minister of Mining and Energy resigned and the government reduced the price increase to 3% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1070496512449336">British Broadcasting Corporation, 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1070496512449336">2011b</xref>). One can easily imagine the political turmoil if the government attempted directly to impose a 19% increase in the price of firewood, which affects more than 10 times the population of Magallanes Region.</p>
<p>I would argue that the sudden imposition of this tax works against the other aims of the SNCL, since the additional cost of certified firewood inhibits consumers from opting to participate in the certified market. This is especially true for lower-income consumers, who collectively use the greatest quantities of firewood and are likely to generate the most pollution due to inefficient stoves and moist wood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1070496512449336">Gómez-Lobo et al., 2006</xref>). The SNCL acknowledges the VAT as the largest component of the increased price of certified firewood but argues that the savings from more efficient dried firewood and the protections that paying the VAT give the consumer are worth more than the 19% increase in the price.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1070496512449336">8</xref></sup> The greater efficiency of dried firewood is more apparent to institutional users that heat with large-scale boilers than it is to low-income users who buy smaller quantities of firewood for multiple uses, including cooking in stoves where dry wood is not an advantage. It is certain that the official receipt received by paying the VAT increases the power of the consumer, who can use it to register an official complaint against the dealer. But again, particularly with low-income consumers, it is less clear whether protection offered by Principle 4 is regarded as worth the premium of 19% on a basic fuel, especially given the regressive nature of the flat tax. I am not arguing that the VAT is inherently wrong or should never be imposed on firewood but rather that its abrupt rather than a gradual introduction is problematic. Indeed, some legislators, including a very conservative senator, have called for subsidies to compensate for the increased cost of firewood (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1070496512449336">SNCL, 2011e</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1070496512449336">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The ultimate effect of formalization is to make the market “legible” to the state in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1070496512449336">Scott’s (1998)</xref> sense of the term.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1070496512449336">10</xref></sup> A rationalized, regulated market is open to interventions that the informal, seemingly chaotic market has evaded. The most important of these has been the entry of new actors into the firewood market. This process has been especially apparent in Valdivia, the first city to initiate a certified firewood market. As of 2010, none of the existing dealers in the informal market had become certified, in spite of outreach efforts. (Two had initiated the process early on, but soon dropped out.) In Valdivia, then, the SNCL has not succeeded in transforming dealers in the informal market into actors in the formal market. As Hernando de <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1070496512449336">Soto’s (2000)</xref> research on formalization has shown so clearly, it is not the formal economy itself that is a problem for the marginalized so much as the impediments to entering it. The existing dealers feared the regulatory pressures on them but were unable to fulfill the requirements for certification. This situation left them worried about the future of their livelihood and hostile to the program that was originally designed to serve them.</p>
<p>In their place, better capitalized actors became certified and sold firewood (for them generally a residual product) for the first time. Of the 16 certified dealers in Valdivia in 2009, 10 were owners of medium-sized forest plots; 2 were large forest plantation enterprises with native forest holdings, 2 were smaller forest industries (one producing furniture from native species and the other briquettes), and 2 were new intermediaries (one a professional forester and the other a cooperative of producers in an auxiliary project implemented by the AIFBN; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1070496512449336">“Pizarra de la leña certificada,” 2009</xref>). These new dealers were motivated to save the native forest, but they were also comfortable with meeting the bookkeeping and other requirements of working within the formal market, and they benefited economically from being able to sell directly to consumers. The certified dealers were enthusiastic about describing the SNCL and their agreement with its goals in interviews. Most of them had professional forestry training and shared a concern for the state of native forests; they were also glad to be able to sell firewood directly to consumers without having to go through a dealer in the informal market. In contrast, many of the dealers in the informal market were reluctant to be interviewed (and those with fixed places of sale uniformly declined to be interviewed) because they were afraid to reveal any details of their business. Much of the information about their viewpoints was obtained from informal leaders of the firewood dealers, who were not afraid to speak.</p>
<p>The new dealers preferred to sell to large institutional customers rather than to individual households. Of the 16 certified dealers listed in 2009, 12 sold only to retail establishments or customers with orders that exceeded the average household annual supply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1070496512449336">“Pizarra de la leña certificada,” 2009</xref>). In addition, the SNCL, in its efforts to mainstream certified firewood by increasing its share of the market, worked with large grocery and do-it-yourself retail chains to expand their niche of selling firewood in sacks at their stores. (The retail chains already included the VAT on the firewood they sold.) The shift to medium-sized producer/dealers and large-scale consumers made sense from the point of view of the survival of the SNCL, whose initial seed funding was to expire in 2012. Maximizing the amount of certified wood on the markets ensured a sufficient level of income from the certification fee and increased the visibility of the program. However, it postponed the goal of transforming the residential market.</p>
<p>In addition to opening the firewood market to new actors, formalization makes public and private investment in technological improvements possible. This can be seen already in public grants to certified firewood dealers for wood drying sheds and new drying technology. There is discussion of processing firewood into chips or pellets that can be burned more efficiently, which would generate production of new stoves. Pelletizing wood may make it more feasible to transport wood-based fuel greater distances, thus consolidating the firewood markets, which have necessarily remained local due to transport costs. Potentially even more significant is discussion of producing liquid biofuels from wood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1070496512449336">García, Carmona, Lienqueo, &amp; Salazar, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1070496512449336">International Energy Agency, 2009</xref>). A new industry would transform native wood into an all-purpose, highly transportable—and highly profitable—fuel. It would be difficult to realize these visions without a formal native wood market.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The goals of the SNCL can be seen as a “push-back” against the dominance of market relationships. Principle 1 seeks to re-embed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1070496512449336">Raynolds, 2000</xref>) the marketing of firewood in the social relationships between dealers and their workers through adherence to labor regulations. Principle 2 seeks to re-embed firewood production in its environmental context through encouraging sustainable forest management. Through Principle 3, the program seeks to improve environmental conditions in the cities. Principle 4 explicitly addresses the rights of consumers, who are usually outside the purview of certification programs. Beyond this, and in contrast with most certification programs, the SNCL strives to reform the entire commodity chain in order to increase the power of producers and consumers in the market. The program is designed to meet this goal by formalizing the market, making it possible for the state to increase the enforcement of regulations, especially those focused on dealers. The SNCL attempts to ease the transition to a regulated market by offering dealers an alternative, more gradual route to compliance, one that is financed by consumers willing to pay a premium on certified firewood.</p>
<p>Two questions were asked in the introduction to this article: What are the boundaries of state and civil society? What does it mean to be both market oriented and regulation oriented? The involvement of the state in the SNCL is certainly greater than what is reported for most other forest certification programs, which followed from the decision to formalize the firewood commodity chain. The SNCL is an example of certification with a high degree of cooperation between state and civil actors. It is important to note that this cooperation has taken place in a political context where many civil society actors, especially forestry and, more generally, environmental activists, had been working for more than a decade to strengthen the legislative foundation for a more vigorous involvement of the CONAF forest service in native forest restoration and sustainability. These activists recognized that sanctions alone would not improve the state of Chile’s forests but that a broader approach to include technical assistance and certification (through the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and other timber certification programs as well as the SNCL) was needed. For them, firewood certification was an alternative, not to regulation, but rather to stalled legislation as a route to greater state involvement in the long-neglected native forest sector. For them, civil society did not need to be sharply distinguished from the state. Environmentally aware consumers could bypass a paralyzed legislature and support formalization of the market by buying certified firewood. Thus, forest certification has not marked a uniform path from government to governance (or even back again), as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1070496512449336">Hysing (2009)</xref> found for environmental policy in Sweden. Likewise, the SNCL has resulted decisively neither in a neoliberal turn for native forest policy nor in a pushback against neoliberalism. The relationships between state, civil society, and the market vary in different components of this complex program and cannot be simply defined by one label or another.</p>
<p>There are numerous benefits to increased regulation of the firewood market. If CONAF forest management plans are followed by producers there is a chance to implement sustainable forest management, the enforcement of labor regulations will improve the conditions of workers in the firewood market, more transparent market relationships could give the producer greater control over prices, and consumers with official receipts will be able to resist unscrupulous dealers. Formalization of the firewood market, irrespective of the goals of the SNCL, has enabled new, better capitalized, and more visionary actors to begin to replace the marginal dealers of the informal market.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a market-based yet regulatory certification program poses several potential problems in the governance of the SNCL, since both the national and local Cocels are composed of majorities of representatives of state agencies, whereas other stakeholders, notably dealers and producers, are underrepresented. This imbalance can be redressed through the periodic elections of Cocel members.</p>
<p>A more difficult contradiction to overcome is a program that paradoxically describes itself as voluntary and yet calls upon the state to exercise its powers of coercion against dealers who decline to participate. The key to certification as a valuable form of environmental governance is neither being “market driven” nor “nonstate.” The key is its use of incentives rather than sanctions to move participants to change their behavior toward preferred goals, as several SNCL staff members have indicated (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1070496512449336">Rodríguez, 2009</xref>). Participation by market actors and communication are thus fundamental to certification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1070496512449336">Shannon, 2003</xref>), rather than a program of enforcement. The choice to use certification to create a formal market through changing the firewood dealers has had the effect of diminishing the priority of other goals because in Valdivia at least it has had the effect of excluding every existing firewood dealer, as they do not believe they can meet the criteria for certification. They are then left to fend for themselves in the face of increased state sanctions. Some leaders in the firewood movement would argue that this is not a bad outcome: If the illegal dealers cannot change their behavior, then they should get out of the market.</p>
<p>There are several problems with this position. One is inherent in all certification programs, which work within the market as a means to change it, and always remain vulnerable to pressures to conform with the interests of powerful actors in the market, especially as movements seek to mainstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1070496512449336">Klooster, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1070496512449336">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1070496512449336">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1070496512449336">Raynolds, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1070496512449336">Taylor, 2005</xref>). As more powerful actors enter the market and the price of firewood increases through the VAT, low-income households run the risk of being further marginalized. Poor households are hard pressed to pay a premium for certified firewood. They will continue to seek firewood at a price they can afford, and this will likely mean continued reliance on an informal market. Formalization may serve to split the firewood market into an emerging legal sector for those who can afford it and an emerging black market for low-income households. If certification succeeds in both gaining a significant share of the market and in increasing formalization outside of the certification program, the remaining informal market will take on the characteristics of a true black market—an illegal market existing in parallel to a legal one. Low-income households would then have a double disadvantage, not only less purchasing power but also the risk of facing state sanctions while obtaining a basic fuel.</p>
<p>If the SNCL is to meet its goals of improving forest management and reducing air pollution, it cannot afford to leave low-income households outside of the formal market.</p>
<p>Poor households constitute more than half of the consumer base and are more likely to pollute than middle- and high-income households (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1070496512449336">Gómez-Lobo et al., 2006</xref>). If low-income households are not included in a formalized market offering dried wood, urban air pollution will not be addressed.</p>
<p>The SNCL has formally joined two dimensions of firewood: as a native forest product and a fuel. The political system has been slowly moving to follow suit in the formal policy sphere, with discussion (but not yet action) in officially recognizing firewood as a fuel. Formalization has opened the firewood to the possibility of greater capital penetration and integration. Public and private ventures are changing firewood into “dendroenergy,” with possibilities for developing wood-based pellet systems that would be transportable and free of seasonality. The kinds of investments required for these transformations require a “legible,” smoothly functioning, and largely predictable—in a word, <italic>formal</italic>—market. How such a market can continue to serve the needs of the low-income households who constitute the majority of firewood consumers remains to be seen.</p>
