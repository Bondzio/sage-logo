<p>Increases in the resistance to tendon during movement may lead to rupture or gapping of the repaired tendon. The relative contribution of these factors—tissue oedema, tendon oedema, and the intact A2 pulley—to resistance to tendon gliding is unclear. In <italic>in vitro</italic> chicken models, we created oedema in subcutaneous tissue or tendon. The work of digital flexion (WOF) increased significantly after creation of oedema in those tissues. WOF decreased significantly after division of the A2 pulley. Preservation of the integrity of the A2 pulley significantly increased WOF at post-operative weeks 1 and 2 in the <italic>in vivo</italic> chicken model; increases in WOF were greater than those due to the presence of oedematous subcutaneous tissue. Pulley division at the time of surgery reduced WOF more drastically than the removal of volar subcutaneous tissue. Presence of an intact A2 pulley adds greater resistance to the movement of the repaired flexor tendon than volar oedematous subcutaneous tissue.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Post-operative mobilization after tendon repair can reduce adhesion formation of the tendon and improve clinical outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193411425329">Elliot, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193411425329">Osada et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193411425329">Sirotakova and Elliot, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193411425329">Tang, 2005</xref>). During such rehabilitation, gapping and rupture are major complications of the repaired tendons, indicating that the healing tendon repairs are overloaded. Oedematous soft tissue after surgery or the presence of the major pulleys contributes to the resistance to movement of the repaired tendon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411425329">Bhatia et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193411425329">Tang et al., 2001</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193411425329">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753193411425329">Zhao et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Simulated oedema significantly increases the energy required to move the flexor tendon <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193411425329">Cao and Tang, 2005</xref>). In <italic>in vivo</italic> models, increase in the work of digital flexion (WOF) corresponds to increases in severity of subcutaneous tissue oedema in the early postsurgical days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193411425329">Cao and Tang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411425329">Cao et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, keeping or releasing a part of pulley system, especially the A2 pulley, has been shown to affect the resistance to tendon gliding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411425329">Bunata et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193411425329">Cao and Tang, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193411425329">Paillard et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193411425329">Tang et al., 2001, 2007</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193411425329">2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411425329">Bunata et al. (2009)</xref> reported that enlargement and repair with an extensor retinacular graft of the A2 pulley and adjacent sheath reduced resistance by a mean of 31% to repaired tendon gliding. In chicken models, pulley venting decreased the rate of tendon repair rupture and gliding resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193411425329">Tang et al., 2001</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193411425329">2009</xref>) and increased repair strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193411425329">Cao and Tang, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193411425329">Paillard et al. (2002)</xref> found that both pulley plasty and resection of one slip of the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) reduced gliding resistance of the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) tendon in the cadaveric hand.</p>
<p>However, previous investigators studied factors of tissue oedema and effects of the A2 pulley integrity individually in animal models or human cadaveric hands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193411425329">Cao and Tang, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193411425329">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193411425329">Paillard et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193411425329">Tang et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193411425329">2009</xref>). No studies have compared the relative contribution of subcutaneous tissue oedema, tendon oedema, and the presence of the A2 pulley to resistance of tendon gliding. Our study was designed to compare the effects of these factors on the energy of digital flexion required during digital flexor tendon movements <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> in chicken models.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>In this study, 56 long toes of 28 white Leghorn chickens were used because the flexor tendons of chicken toes are similar to those of human fingers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193411425329">Farkas et al., 1974</xref>). The area between the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints are anatomically equivalent to zone 2 in the human hand and was chosen as the experimental region.</p>

<title><italic>In vitro</italic> study</title>
<sec id="section4-1753193411425329">
<title>Creation of subcutaneous tissue oedema and recording WOF</title>
<p>Fourteen toes were disarticulated at the knee joint and mounted securely to a board attached to the lower clamp of a materials testing machine (Model 4411; Instron Corp., Canton, MA, USA). Two K-wires were inserted through the metatarsal bone of the long toe to keep the toe tip pointing down but the PIP, DIP, and distal DIP joints were not restricted. The FDP tendon was identified by its effect on flexion of distal DIP joint with a light pull. The proximal end of the FDP tendon was connected to the upper clamp of the overhead crossbar connected to a force transducer. A 0.5-N counterweight was attached to the toe tip to ensure the digit was fully extended. A preload of 0.1 N was applied to the FDP tendon and the toes were moved upwards at a constant speed of 25 mm/min until the excursion reached 18 mm. The FDS and perforator tendons of the toes were not loaded during the test.</p>
<p>After the initial 4 runs to obtain consistent baseline measurements, end-point WOF was recorded beginning with the fifth run. With the toes maintained in full extension, we simulated tissue oedema by injecting 6.4 ml physiologic saline into the volar subcutaneous tissue over a 2-cm long toe segment distal to the PIP joint, overlapping the area of the A2 pulley, using the same method as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193411425329">Cao and Tang (2005)</xref>. Thirty-two different sites injected with 0.2 ml of saline per site were distributed evenly in this area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193411425329">Figure 2</xref>). The needle was inserted midway between the sheath and skin, which ensured that all saline was injected into the central part of the subcutaneous tissue.</p>
<p>The tendons were moved passively for six runs immediately after injection. Then the volar skin and subcutaneous tissue was resected for 2-cm before the seventh run. Finally the A2 pulley was incised for the eighth run (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193411425329">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193411425329">2</xref>). The WOF was recorded after each run after 18 mm excursion of the FDP tendon. The decision to use 18 mm of FDP tendon excursion was based on pilot studies, in which the FDP tendon excursion of 18 mm from the full digital extension produced close to complete (80 to 90%) flexion of the long toes.</p>

<p>Another 10 toes were mounted and loaded for the baseline data of WOF during 18 mm excursion in the fifth run after initial 4 runs as described above. A 2-cm volar tissue was resected and the sixth run was performed. Then we transversely incised the sheath 5-mm distal to the A2 pulley and injected 1 ml physiologic saline into 5 different sites of the FDP tendon over an area of 1.5-cm, creating “oedema” of the FDP tendon. An additional 1 ml saline was injected into the two bifurcations of FDS tendon before the seventh run.

<title>Surgical tendon repairs with an intact A2 pulley and recording WOF</title>
<p>Sixteen toes of 8 white Leghorn chickens were used and randomly divided into two groups. The chickens were anaesthetized by intramuscular injection with ketamine (50 mg/kg of body weight). The toes were operated on under sterile surgical conditions. A zig-zag incision was made in the plantar skin of the toes to expose the FDP tendons between the PIP and DIP joints. The A2 pulley and the FDS tendon were kept intact. With the toe extended, through a 1 cm longitudinal incision distal to the preserved A2 pulley, the FDP tendon was transversely cut through its volar two-third part and repaired surgically with a modified Kessler repair with 5-0 nylon sutures (Ethilon; Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA). The skin was closed and the toes were immobilized by dressing and adhesive tapes in a semiflexed position.</p>
<p>At the end of the postoperative 1 and 2 weeks, the toes were harvested, mounted to the testing machine and preconditioned for the initial 4 runs in the same way as in <italic>in vitro</italic> part described above. Then the WOF was recorded at the fifth run. Subsequently, the volar subcutaneous tissue of 2 cm was resected before the sixth run. Finally the A2 pulley was incised entirely along the midline before the seventh run. The WOF was recorded after each run (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193411425329">Figure 1</xref>). The changes in the WOF during each of the three parts of the simulated toe flexion (e.g., gliding excursions from 0–6 mm, 6–12 mm, and 12–18 mm) in these 16 toes were analyzed.</p>

<p>We further used 16 long toes of another set of 8 chickens to carry out a similar experiment as described above <italic>in vivo</italic> study except that the A2 pulley was completely incised, rather than keeping intact. The same test procedures were carried out at postoperative week 1 and 2.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we determined to some extent the relative contribution of the presence of the A2 pulley and oedema of the tendon and volar subcutaneous tissue to WOF. We hoped to obtain some insight into how important retention of the major pulley or oedema is with respect to resistance to tendon movement. In the <italic>in vitro</italic> part of the study, tissue and tendon oedema was simulated by a proven method: injecting saline into the subcutaneous tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193411425329">Cao and Tang, 2006</xref>). We found that oedema of subcutaneous tissue and tendon oedema increased the resistance to tendon movement, and division of the A2 pulley decreased resistance when the tendon was oedematous.</p>
<p>In the <italic>in vivo</italic> part of the study using a chicken tendon cut and repair model, we found that both oedematous volar subcutaneous tissue and presence of the intact A2 pulley greatly increased WOF at post-operative weeks 1 and 2. After division of the A2 pulley at the time of surgery and removal of the oedematous subcutaneous tissue, WOF dramatically decreased. Keeping the pulley intact increases the resistance; the increase was even greater than that produced by oedema of the volar subcutaneous tissue at weeks 1 or 2.</p>
<p>We believe that these findings can be explained by the anatomy and pathophysiology of the digital tendon system. When digital volar subcutaneous tissues are oedematous, the tendon sheath is tightly compressed to the tendon. The increase in pressure between tendon and sheath (particularly, the rigid and narrow annular pulleys) increases the WOF of tendon gliding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1753193411425329">Figure 7</xref>). When tendon is oedematous, the increase in the volume of the tendon decreases the room for tendon gliding within the synovial sheath. The A2 pulley may be even more narrow and restrictive for movement of the repaired and also oedematous flexor tendon, which leads to increases in WOF. Division of the A2 pulley decompresses the tendon and decreases WOF. Our results indicate that the A2 pulley is more restrictive to the oedematous tendon than to normal tendon. These findings further imply that release of A2 pulley when repairing injured tendons may be very effective to reduce WOF of tendon movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1753193411425329">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

<p>Whether the major annular pulleys, such as A2 and A4, should be partly vented has been a topic of great concern clinically (Bunata, 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193411425329">Elliot, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193411425329">Tang, 2005</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193411425329">2007</xref>). The data obtained from our current studies may have not direct relevance to the clinical situation. However, the findings from this study provide some insight to the relative significance of oedema formation and presence of an intact annular pulley on resistance to tendon gliding. Clinically, attention has been paid to oedema over many years. Our findings indicate that division of a key restrictive pulley may be more effective in reducing resistance to tendon gliding.</p>
<p>This study has following limitations. We did not study the effect of releasing the A2 pulley, whilst preserving the subcutaneous oedematous tissue. The relative contribution of subcutaneous oedema and an intact A2 pulley may be very different in chickens than humans. However, we could only use an animal model to carry out such investigations. The A2 pulley is very short (0.5 cm) in chickens so we had to incise the pulley entirely in the in vivo study, which is different from current clinical practice of a partial A2 pulley-venting procedure. Finally, rehabilitation procedures were not included but oedema can change and tissue fluid would redistribute after rehabilitation; resistance to tendon movement would differ after rehabilitation.</p>
<p>We conclude from this study that the presence of an A2 pulley, compared with subcutaneous oedema, makes a greater contribution to increases in resistance to flexor tendon movement in the chicken model. As tissue oedema is inevitable after surgery, the findings indicate that division of the intact A2 pulley can be an effective way to lessen WOF. Previously, both surgeons and therapists took degrees of digital oedema into serious consideration when deciding motion protocols. According to this study, whether the annular flexor pulley is divided or kept intact should be even more important a consideration when deciding the rigor of tendon motion, because this relates to resistance to WOF more closely than post-operative digital oedema.</p>
