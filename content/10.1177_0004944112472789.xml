      <abstract>
        <p>Currently, Australian boarding schools undertake to provide a home away from home for
          around 20,000 adolescents. Research documenting the boarding school experience is scarce,
          and, with few exceptions, exists as a less significant aspect of more general research
          into private school education. Such school-based research focuses on the positive,
          character-building benefits of the boarding experience. However, case studies of former
          boarders paint quite a different picture. In order for boarding schools to best support
          boarders’ development, it is vital that adults who fulfil a parenting role undertake
          appropriate training. This paper draws together available information to present a
          comprehensive picture of boarding in Australian schools, with a focus on the challenges
          faced by the <italic>in loco parentis</italic> role of staff. It is apparent that more
          skills-based training is vital to better equip staff in this very important role.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The purpose of this review is to assemble a current picture of boarding in Australian
        schools, with a specific focus on the challenges presented by the <italic>in loco
          parentis</italic> role of staff in their undertaking to create a home away from home for
        the young people in their care (boarders). Acting <italic>in loco parentis</italic>, or in
        the place of a parent, refers to the legal responsibility of a boarding school to undertake
        a number of the responsibilities of a parent. This role is pivotal to boarders’
        developmental outcomes but is also a role that presents many challenges in an increasingly
        demanding and litigious world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0004944112472789">Anderson,
          2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004944112472789">Hawkes, 2001</xref>).
        Available information and research on boarding schools is, in the main, of a theoretical,
        philosophical or a sociological nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0004944112472789">Anderson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004944112472789">Hawkes,
          2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0004944112472789">White, 2004</xref>), with
        very few attempts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0004944112472789">Bramston &amp;
          Patrick, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0004944112472789">CSC, 1982</xref>;
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0004944112472789">Cree, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0004944112472789">Papworth, Martin, &amp; Ginns, 2011</xref>;
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0004944112472789">Papworth, Martin, Ginns, &amp; Liem,
          2012</xref>) to quantify important aspects of this environment. There is a pressing need
        for data to inform the parenting role of boarding staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0004944112472789">Bramston &amp; Patrick, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0004944112472789">Van Hoof &amp; Holger, 1999</xref>), and this paper
        represents an initial investigation into the pastoral needs of adolescents who live in
        boarding school environments and the staff training required to respond to these needs.
        Information for the present review was gathered by searching catalogues and both education
        (ERIC) and psychology (<italic>psychinfo</italic>) databases, using the search words
        ‘boarding’, ‘boarding schools’, ‘residential schools’, ‘private schools’, ‘private
        education’, ‘isolated students’ and ‘boarders’.</p>
      <p>Boarding schools are regulated communities designed for the education and development of
        residential students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0004944112472789">Cree, 2000</xref>;
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0004944112472789">White, 2004</xref>). These
        institutions seem to hold a degree of fascination, particularly for those who have not had
        the ‘privilege’ of sharing this unique experience, and graduates are typically portrayed in
        promotional material as self-reliant young people well equipped to deal with the
        complexities of life beyond the school gates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0004944112472789">Boarding Schools Association [BSA], 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004944112472789">Gerrard, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0004944112472789">Independent Schools Council Australia [ISCA], 2008</xref>).
        Famous Australian alumni of elite boarding schools include political leaders such as Robert
        Menzies, as well as business giants, Kerry Packer and Rupert Murdoch. While works of fiction
        paint a whimsical rather than a realistic picture of the life of a boarder, they
        nevertheless constitute a popular representation of this environment and its inhabitants.
        The few authors who have investigated Australian boarding schools (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0004944112472789">Table 1</xref>) have commented on the
        scarcity of relevant boarding-school research, both in Australia and overseas, and have also
        noted that what is available is often dated and exists as a less significant aspect of more
        general research into private education. The desire to safeguard a school’s public standing
        and to protect its residents appears to have resulted in a closed-door attitude to inquiries
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0004944112472789">Cree, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0004944112472789">Poynting &amp; Donaldson, 2005</xref>),
        resulting in what might be considered a biased perspective of the boarding school
        experience. <table-wrap id="table1-0004944112472789" position="float"><label>Table

                  was found that rural adolescents who leave to board in the city managed the
                  transition well and also regarded it as having a number of advantages. Boarders
                  coped by talking to others, making an effort to get to know others and getting
                  involved with organised activities. Boarders who made the transition cited a
                  better education and access to greater opportunities and more contacts as
                  advantages of the move. Focus group feedback suggested that being ‘buddied’ with

                  house-parents and teachers. The author notes that the course is designed to be
                  practical rather than academic and is reportedly structured to contribute to the
                  basic knowledge and skills necessary to perform boarding duties. The course is
                  divided into 11 units including such diverse topics as philosophy through to

        boarding schools are a colonial replication of those in the United Kingdom (UK), the
        dissimilarity of Australian boarding schools to their corresponding institutions, not only
        in the UK, but also in the United States (US), Europe and South Africa, has been highlighted

        boarders. Only 8 of a total of approximately 154 Australian boarding schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0004944112472789">Independent Schools Council Australia,

      <title>Boarding numbers 1982–2009</title>
      <p>It is difficult to determine exactly how many boarders currently reside in Australian
        schools. Boarding school pupils have been excluded from the scope of the Australian Bureau
        of Statistics Schools Education and Work Study (SEW) since 2005; however, in May 2009, the
        ABS Labour Force Study (LFS) yielded an estimate of 19,200 boarding school pupils aged 15
        years and over. Previous estimates of boarding numbers have included boarders younger than
        15 years, rendering this recent figure an underestimate. The Independent Schools Council
        Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0004944112472789">ISCA, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0004944112472789">2010</xref>) recorded an increase in numbers
        of boarders between 2007 (16, 926) and 2009 (17, 097). These figures derive from 154 of the
        ISCA’s 1022-member schools and, based on the comparison with 20,899 boarders estimated by
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0004944112472789">the ABS (2008</xref>) and ABS LFS
        figures, also appear to underestimate current boarding numbers. Recent Australian data do
        not provide a detailed breakdown as was available in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0004944112472789">CSC study (1982</xref>) and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0004944112472789">ABS (2008</xref>).</p>
      <p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0004944112472789">Table 2</xref> displays more detailed
        information on boarders attending non-government boarding schools between 1982 and 2009.
        These data were derived from four separate sources: Australian Bureau of Statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0004944112472789">[ABS], 2005</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0004944112472789">ABS (2008</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0004944112472789">The Commonwealth Schools Commission (CSC, 1982</xref>) and
        the Independent Schools Council Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0004944112472789">ISCA, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0004944112472789">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0004944112472789">2010</xref>). The present review is focused only on
        non-government boarding schools, and the data (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0004944112472789">Table 2</xref>) reveal noteworthy trends. Despite an overall
        decrease in non-government boarding numbers from 28,133 in 1982 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0004944112472789">CSC, 1982</xref>) to 20,899 in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0004944112472789">ABS, 2008</xref>), Queensland and New South Wales continue to
        support the country’s largest boarding populations. The overall percentage of boarders who
        were male declined from 60% in 1982 to a relatively even split between males and females in
        2007. Historical research has found the rural economy to be a primary influence on boarding
        numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0004944112472789">CSC, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0004944112472789">Cree, 2000</xref>), and this remains a
        significant factor today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0004944112472789">ISCA,
          2008</xref>). Other factors that have influenced boarder numbers, albeit to a lesser
        extent, are increases in resource provision and support in local schools; improvements in
        technology, resulting in the improved accessibility and quality of distance education and
        upgraded roads and transport that have made daily travel to local schools a more viable
        option (ISCA, 2008). <table-wrap id="table2-0004944112472789" position="float"><label>Table

      <title>Reasons for boarding</title>
      <p>Empirical research on reasons for boarding is scarce; the exception is a survey of 3100
        families from 68 boarding schools conducted by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0004944112472789">Independent Schools Council of Australia (2008)</xref>.
        Based on this snapshot, which represents a response rate of 51%, the current profile of
        Australian boarding school students is a diverse group of young people from a range of
        backgrounds and countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0004944112472789">ISCA,
          2008</xref>). Currently, boarders come from cities, regional and remote areas and may
        board because their parents are employed overseas, or may board on a weekly basis in order
        to cope with their own sporting and academic commitments or as a way of coping with changed
        family circumstances (ISCA, 2008). Fifty-five percent of families surveyed indicated that
        there was little choice but to board their children, (ISCA, 2008). Parents from rural
        communities noted that while they would rather not send their children away to school, the
        decision was necessary in order to access a high-quality education important for their
        children’s future success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0004944112472789">Bramston &amp;
          Patrick, 2007</xref>; ISCA, 2008). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0004944112472789">Mason’s (1997)</xref> Australian study on the transition to boarding school also found
        that parents sought the increased options and opportunities afforded by boarding but were
        also concerned about the additional influences on their children and the decreased ability
        to keep an eye on their progress. Most parents who responded to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0004944112472789">Independent Schooling in Australia 2006–2008</xref> survey
        (ISCA, 2008) identified that being a boarder led to becoming a well-rounded, well-balanced
        person who was independent, self-reliant, tolerant and compassionate, with 92% indicating
        that they would choose boarding if they had to make the decision again. However, this very
        positive appraisal of boarding school graduates might also represent a rationalisation by
        parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0004944112472789">Duffell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0004944112472789">Poynting &amp; Donaldson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0004944112472789">Schaverien, 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>This information, while limited in scope, provides boarder demographics not notably
        different from those published in the more comprehensive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0004944112472789">CSC (1982</xref>) study. Consistent themes have emerged from
        research on recent and historical reasons for boarding, including boarders’ perceptions of
        the benefits of boarding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0004944112472789">Bramston &amp;

        geographical isolation, specialised courses, parents’ employment, family disruption,
        overseas students and character building. All are worthy of further exploration.</p>

        <title>Geographical isolation and access to specialised courses</title>
        <p>The major reason cited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0004944112472789">CSC
            (1982</xref>) for students to board was geographic isolation. The CSC study noted that
          of geographically isolated parents who chose to send their adolescents to boarding
          schools, 19.5% cited access to specialist courses, staff and resources as a reason. Today,
          many rural students still do not have reasonable daily access to a school that can provide
          a variety of senior courses; indeed, many high schools in country areas can only offer
          specialised courses through distance education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0004944112472789">Bramston &amp; Patrick, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0004944112472789">McGibbon, 2011</xref>). Recent research suggests that the
          decision to send children to boarding schools is still motivated by a desire to access
          courses that are prerequisites to tertiary education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0004944112472789">Bramston &amp; Patrick, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0004944112472789">Fisher, Frazer, &amp; Murray, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0004944112472789">ISCA, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0004944112472789">Mason, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0004944112472789">McGibbon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0004944112472789">Stevens, 1995</xref>).</p>

        <title>Parents’ employment</title>
        <p>The globalisation of society has resulted in greater mobility of the work force in
          general; this, along with the continuing mobility of certain professions (e.g. armed
          forces), means that boarding is a feasible alternative for such families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0004944112472789">Cree, 2000</xref>). When parents’
          employment means that they spend periods of time away from the family home, or that they
          must live interstate or overseas, rather than cause disruption to their child’s education,
          boarding school is often a practical choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0004944112472789">McGibbon, 2011</xref>). This is particularly so if the
          young person is completing their senior schooling or the adolescent does not manage change

        <title>Disrupted family circumstances</title>
        <p>Historically, relatively few students (9.9%) cited disrupted family circumstances as a
          reason for boarding (CSC, 1982). However, in more recent times divorce, separation and
          parental re-marriage are all reasons for choosing boarding as a substitute family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0004944112472789">Anderson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0004944112472789">Cree, 2000</xref>). While for many young
          people boarding is a carefully considered decision, lack of stability at home and exposure
          to traumatic and potentially damaging experiences motivated some families to seek a place
          in a well-ordered and secure environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0004944112472789">Anderson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004944112472789">Gerrard, 2001</xref>). The pressures of parenting may be
          enough to motivate parents to remove children from the confusion of a chaotic home and
          send them to a safe, controlled environment, where professionals can do the job instead
            (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0004944112472789">Cree, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004944112472789">Gerrard, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004944112472789">Hawkes, 2001</xref>). The social support,
          security and group standards of the boarding community may also be important during times
          of ill health or when families experience relationship breakdowns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004944112472789">Hawkes, 2001</xref>).</p>

          Hong Kong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0004944112472789">Cree, 2000</xref>).
          However, rather than the boarding system itself, access to the Australian tertiary
          education system, perceived as a cheaper alternative to university courses in the United
          Kingdom or the United States, is the proposed attraction for boarders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0004944112472789">Cree, 2000</xref>; Han, Jamieson, &amp;
          Young, 2000). ISCA (2010 ) data indicate that of the 483,330 students attending

        <title>Structure and character-building</title>
        <p>Parents perceived boarding schools as desirable for building character and developing
          self-reliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0004944112472789">BSA, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0004944112472789">CSC, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0004944112472789">ISCA, 2008</xref>). In support of this perspective,

            (2004</xref>) sociological study of an Australian co-educational boarding school also
          maintain a character-building perspective. Such self-reliance is promoted as one of the
          benefits of being a boarder but has also been interpreted as ruptured attachment or a
          boarder’s inability to rely on anyone but themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0004944112472789">Duffell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004944112472789">Gerrard, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0004944112472789">Schaverien, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0004944112472789">2011</xref>).</p>

      <title>Options for boarding</title>
      <p>Boarding schools offer a structured environment with controlled periods of private study,
        the constant presence and assistance of teachers and specialised staff, as well as use of
        the school’s facilities including libraries and computers outside school hours. This may be
        particularly important for those students who are heavily involved in academic commitments
        and extra-curricular commitments, including sport, music, debating and drama (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0004944112472789">Anderson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004944112472789">Hawkes, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0004944112472789">ISCA, 2008</xref>). While five-day (weekly) boarding numbers
        were included in the 1982 CSC study, only 3.9% of boys and 7.0% of girls who lived
        relatively close to school boarded. However, in more recent times, boarding has become an
        attractive option for families who live in close proximity to the school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004944112472789">Hawkes, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0004944112472789">McGibbon, 2011</xref>). Two boarder categories not included
        in the CSC study but incorporated in more recent boarding literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004944112472789">Hawkes, 2001</xref>) are ‘occasional’ and ‘day boarders’.
        Occasional boarders are those who generally do not board but may require accommodation for
        short periods of time, for example, when academic and extra-curricular demands might be
        particularly high or during family crises. Day boarders are those who, perhaps due to
        parental commitments, use the boarding facilities during the day and early evening and then
        return home to sleep. Demand for these options is increasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004944112472789">Hawkes, 2001</xref>), as is evidenced by the current
        marketing of prominent Australian boarding schools that note day boarding to be ‘the best of
        both worlds’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0004944112472789">Geelong Grammar School,

        from the primary social system of the home; tolerance of others and individuality,
        empowerment and opportunity. However, case studies of former male boarders paint a very
        different picture of the traumatised child who, while outwardly successful, struggled to
        reconcile the sacrifices made for him to attend the ‘best schools’, with his own experience
        of emotional deprivation, feeling abandoned and even being bullied or possibly abused (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0004944112472789">Duffell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0004944112472789">Schaverien, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0004944112472789">2011</xref>).

      <title>Changing responsibilities of Australian boarding schools</title>
      <p>Boarding schools are busy and complex places, required by the courts to minimise risk and
        prevent reasonably foreseeable harm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0004944112472789">Anderson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0004944112472789">Boyd,
          2000</xref>). The law is imposing increasingly higher standards of care on boarding
        institutions, which must demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the courts, appropriate
        handling of situations involving risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0004944112472789">Anderson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004944112472789">Hawkes,
          2001</xref>). Boarding schools are also bound by child protection legislation to safeguard
        children from harm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0004944112472789">Anderson,
        2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0004944112472789">Boyd, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004944112472789">Hawkes, 2001</xref>) and to prevent
        physical, emotional or psychological abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004944112472789">Hawkes, 2001</xref>). To this end, staff members who come
        into unsupervised contact with boarders are obliged to have criminal background clearance
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0004944112472789">Anderson, 2005</xref>). The risk of
        bullying is a constant challenge in a boarding environment, with harsh tales of overt
        bullying part of boarding’s historical inheritance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0004944112472789">Duffell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0004944112472789">Lambert, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0004944112472789">Poynting &amp; Donaldson, 2005</xref>). While it is
        imperative that the day-to-day running of a boarding school is governed by clear policies
        and guidelines and informed by relevant laws, this can also be counterproductive to
        cultivating an environment that is nurturing, supportive, as well as safe and transparent
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0004944112472789">Anderson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0004944112472789">Holgate, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0004944112472789">White, 2004</xref>). This conundrum presents a significant
        challenge for boarding staff who must walk the boundaries between the legal and parental
        responsibilities.</p>

      <title>Staff roles and responsibilities</title>
      <p>Boarding staff are not only facilitators and guarantors of security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0004944112472789">Anderson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004944112472789">Hawkes, 2001</xref>), but just as importantly, they are
          <italic>in loco parentis</italic> models for young people. The literature is somewhat
        silent on the demographics of staff in boarding schools, however, given the diverse
        backgrounds of boarders, heterogeneity of life experiences and age is an advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0004944112472789">Anderson, 2005</xref>). This is consistent
        with observations of many boarding establishments that yield a picture of staff across a
        continuum on age, experience and formal qualifications. The variety of experiences that
        staff bring to the boarding environment is important, but so is their ability to function as
        a team that is consistent and fair, and acts in the best interests of the young people in
        their care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0004944112472789">Anderson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0004944112472789">Cree, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004944112472789">Hawkes, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0004944112472789">Holgate, 2007</xref>). Boarding schools generally employ
        teachers as part of their boarding staff. However, the number of teachers employed and their
        designated roles differ according to the school’s organisational structure. There are ample
        descriptions of the skills, qualities and knowledge that all staff should possess, including
        personal qualities such as kindness, empathy and respect, emotional regulation,
        communication and knowledge of first aid, crisis management and legal issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0004944112472789">Anderson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004944112472789">Hawkes, 2001</xref>, 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0004944112472789">Turner, 2008</xref>). This mixture of skills and personal
        qualities required by staff who assume this important role would appear to require extensive
        preparation and training.</p>
      <p>Regardless of the specific roles assumed by staff members, each person has the vital
        responsibility for the nurture and welfare of the boarders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004944112472789">Hawkes, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0004944112472789">Holgate, 2007</xref>). This is a difficult assignment for
        young boarding staff members who are, in some cases, not very far removed from being
        students in such establishments. Staff have an obligation to model the behaviours, values,
        skills and attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0004944112472789">Hawkes,
          2008</xref>) young people require in order to lead meaningful lives and become productive
        members of society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0004944112472789">Peterson,
          1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0004944112472789">Sanders, 2004</xref>).
        The boarding environment, like the family environment, is an ideal setting for promoting the
        development of young people by teaching a range of skills including practical skills such as
        ironing a shirt, cooking and mending, to skills that focus on social and emotional
        competence such as communicating, controlling emotions and impulses and handling
        responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0004944112472789">Anderson, 2005</xref>;
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004944112472789">Hawkes, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0004944112472789">Holgate, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0004944112472789">White, 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>Staff and student interactions in the boarding environment are an important part of the
        young person’s social and emotional development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0004944112472789">Anderson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004944112472789">Hawkes, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0004944112472789">Holgate, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0004944112472789">Sanders, 2004</xref>). However, members of a boarding
        community occupy challenging boundaries between the need to develop empathetic relationships
        and the need to maintain an appropriate ‘distance’ befitting the power differential between
        students and teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0004944112472789">Anderson,
          2005</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004944112472789">Hawkes, 2001</xref>;
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0004944112472789">White, 2004</xref>). While the ideal
        age and qualifications of potential staff are not prescribed, numbers of staff required are
        usually expressed as a staffing ratio and included in the school’s legal documents, with
        ratios of 1 staff to 15 or more young people being common in a boarding environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0004944112472789">Anderson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004944112472789">Hawkes, 2001</xref>). This proposed ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0004944112472789">Anderson, 2005</xref>) presents a significant
        challenge for staff who assume a parental role for boarders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0004944112472789">Peterson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0004944112472789">Sanders, 2004</xref>).</p>

      <p>In addition to their parenting role, the need for knowledge of occupational health and

      <title>Do boarding schools provide a home away from home?</title>
      <p>Generally a young person’s social systems are divided into a primary personal system,
        represented by the home or family, and a secondary personal system, the school or university
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0004944112472789">White, 2004</xref>). Through analysis
        of boarders’ memoirs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0004944112472789">White
          (2004)</xref> found that boarders formed not one but two kinds of primary bonds, one with
        their family and the other with their boarding house, and that boarders’ personal values
        were drawn from both the family and from the boarding house. This research provides
        significant support for the importance of the parenting role of boarding staff. There is
        also considerable theoretical support for the primary nature of the boarding house and its
        staff in the social, emotional and intellectual development of boarders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0004944112472789">Anderson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0004944112472789">Cree, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004944112472789">Hawkes, 2001</xref>). Boarding staff, boarders and their
        parents all recognise that boarding institutions need to provide a home away from home
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0004944112472789">Anderson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004944112472789">Hawkes, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0004944112472789">Holgate, 2007</xref>; ISCA, 2008). The success of the

      <title>The future of boarding</title>
      <p>Due to the vast size of Australia, there will be an ongoing demand for places in boarding

        security and a strong sense of community and can cater for the physical, social, emotional,
        spiritual and academic needs of the adolescent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004944112472789">Hawkes, 2001</xref>; ISCA, 2008). Many parents indicated
        that boarding schools provided some sanctuary from outside influences and as such would
        increase in popularity (ISCA, 2008). However, what is not clear is the way forward to
        practical, empirically supported training that will empower staff to fulfil their brief to
        provide a safe, secure, positive learning environment where adolescents can develop not only
        in a physical and academic capacity but just as importantly, socially, emotionally and

      <title>Conclusions and implications</title>
      <p>As most boarding research is of a theoretical rather than empirical nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0004944112472789">Anderson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0004944112472789">Bramston &amp; Patrick, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0004944112472789">CSC, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0004944112472789">Cree, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004944112472789">Hawkes, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0004944112472789">White, 2004</xref>), there is a pressing need for data to
        inform the <italic>in loco parentis</italic> role of staff in boarding schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0004944112472789">Bramston &amp; Patrick, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0004944112472789">Van Hoof &amp; Holger, 1999</xref>). The
        purpose of the current review was to draw together the available literature and to present a
        comprehensive picture of the Australian boarding situation with a specific focus on the
        challenges of the role of boarding school staff and their undertaking to create a home away
        from home for boarders. It is apparent that, while boarding numbers fluctuate, boarding
        schools are an important and, it appears, an enduring feature of Australia’s schooling
        landscape. It is also abundantly clear that the expectations of boarding schools are far in
        excess of the provision of a safe, secure environment, but extend to what are generally
        thought of as parental responsibilities; that is, the social, emotional and spiritual
        development of each child. Boarding staff vary greatly in age and level of experience, yet
        all have the responsibility for the nurture and welfare of the young people in their care.
        The implications of these expectations are that all boarding staff require a comprehensive
        range of skills, and training must not be limited to information or knowledge but also
        involve skill development.</p>
      <p>In drawing together available information, this paper has exposed some shortcomings, the
        most important of which is that staff performing a parenting role in boarding schools do not
        have access to adequate skills-based training to support the developmental outcomes of the
        young people for whom boarding schools are a home away from home. Evidence-based parenting
        programs for adolescents are available and may represent a potential solution for the
        abovementioned problem. Modifications of existing parenting programs for adolescents may
        well provide a workable solution for improving the competence, confidence and self-efficacy
        of boarding staff in working with the young people in their care.</p>
