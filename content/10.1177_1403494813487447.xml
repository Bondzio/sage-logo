<title>Background</title>
<p>Lack of social support represents a high risk for physical and mental morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494813487447">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494813487447"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494813487447"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494813487447"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494813487447">5</xref>]. Social support also has a beneficial effect on well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494813487447">6</xref>].The main sources of support are family, friends, neighbours, and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813487447">7</xref>]. Sense of community in neighbourhoods may have the effect of limiting illness or disability and promote perceived social support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813487447">8</xref>]. Low civic participation is also associated with a higher probability of reporting poor health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494813487447">9</xref>]. Social support is seen as the qualitative aspect (functional support) of one’s social networks, where availability of perceived social support if needed has been clearly linked to health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494813487447">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494813487447">11</xref>], emotional and tangible support being most important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813487447">7</xref>]. According to House [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813487447">7</xref>], social support is an interpersonal transaction. He considers emotional support to involve liking, love and empathy, and tangible support to involve goods and services. Although the above studies show that social support is connected with health outcomes, they say little about what influences individuals’ experience of social support.</p>
<p>Personality is a robust predictor of behaviour and essential life outcomes; the quality of personal relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494813487447">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494813487447"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494813487447">14</xref>] is one of several life outcomes. In addition, neuroticism is correlated with mental and physical health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494813487447">15</xref>], especially as a risk factor for depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494813487447">16</xref>]. Extraversion is found to have a negative correlation with depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494813487447">17</xref>]. Eysenck [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494813487447">18</xref>, p. 2] defines personality as ‘the more or less stable and enduring organization of a person’s character, temperament, intellect, and physique, which determines their unique adjustment to the environment’. Personality domains such as extraversion and neuroticism are strongly connected with differences in how people promote or limit the possibility of creating and maintaining available social networks; for example, the following traits correlate: sensation-seeking, venturesome, active, surgent, carefree, sociable, lively, assertive, anxious, depressed, guilty, tense, irrational, shy, moody, emotional, and having low self-esteem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494813487447">18</xref>].</p>
<p>In 1988, House argued in a literature review regarding the structures and processes of social support for: ‘both scientific and practical or policy reason, social support, social networks, and social integration must also increasingly be viewed as <italic>dependent</italic> variables’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494813487447">19</xref>, p. 301]. To our knowledge, social integration and social networks have been viewed as dependent variables, while perceived social support has barely been used, especially in a general population. It seems mainly to be suggested that the connection between social support and personality is based on the nature of personality; for example, extraversion correlates with sociability and would thus be a predictor for the extent of one’s network, while people with high scores on neuroticism tend to experience negative emotions and might then direct more assertive behaviour towards a network.</p>
<p>In order to enhance and maintain strategies, it is essential to identify factors of social support from the general population. The aim of the current study was to examine the association of personality, neighbourhood, and civic participation on the level of perceived social support if needed, adjusted for age, gender, marital status, loss of social network, and perceived health status.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>This study used data from the third wave of the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (2006–2008) in Norway. The HUNT3 is a large census population health study, based on the invitation of all inhabitants of Nord-Trøndelag county aged 20 or more (totalling 94,194 inhabitants), of whom 50,839 participated (53.9% attendance). The data collection included both physical examinations and self-completed questionnaires; a detailed description of the methods can be found on the HUNT website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ntnu.edu/hunt/inenglish">http://www.ntnu.edu/hunt/inenglish</ext-link>). Norway consists mainly of rural areas having small cities; Nord-Trøndelag is quite representative of Norway, when it has no large cities. The present study used data from a total of 35,797 participants aged 20–89 (16,035 male and 19,762 female), with a fully completed short version of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ) including complete response to questions regarding social support.</p>
<p>The Norwegian Data Inspectorate, the Regional Committee for Ethics in Medical Research, and the HUNT Publication Review Board approved the protocols for HUNT 3 and this study. All participating subjects in this study provided written consent.</p>
<sec id="section3-1403494813487447">
<title>Measurements</title>
<sec id="section4-1403494813487447">
<title>Perceived social support</title>
<p>Two types of perceived social support from friends if needed, tangible and emotional, with one single item each, were examined in HUNT3. Emotional support was measured by asking: ‘Do you have friends that you can speak to confidentially?’ In terms of tangible support, participants were asked: ‘Do you have friends that can help you when you need them?’ The categorical response options included only ‘yes’ and ‘no’ for each item. This study designed a compound index for social support as: (1) low: answering ‘no’ to each question, (2) medium: answering ‘no’ to one of the questions and (3) high: answering ‘yes’ to both questions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1403494813487447">
<title>Personality</title>
<p>HUNT 3 enrolled a shortened version of the EPQ, using the two major dimensions of personality, Extraversion (E) and Neuroticism (N). Each dimension consists of six questions, answered by circling ‘yes’ or ‘no’. The uniformity of responses between genders makes the EPQ one of the most commonly used personality inventories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494813487447">20</xref>]. Eysenck and Tambs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494813487447">21</xref>] emphasize the Norwegian shortened version of EPQ for both research and clinical applications. The internal consistency for Extraversion and Neuroticism scales in HUNT3, calculated by Cronbach’s alpha, shows 0.72 and 0.74, respectively. The present study dichotomized E and N as: E (1) low: 0–3 score and (2) high: 4–6 score, N (1) low: 0–2 score and (2) 3–6, due to the distribution.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1403494813487447">
<title>Sense of community</title>
<p>Sense of community in neighbourhood was investigated by the claim: ‘I feel a strong sense of community with people who live here’, answered with five response categories: ‘Strongly agree, somewhat agree, not sure, somewhat disagree, and strongly disagree’, which were dichotomized into ‘high’ and ‘low’, due to the distribution.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1403494813487447">
<title>Civic participation</title>
<p>Civic participation was examined with the claim: ‘How many times in the last 6 months have you participated in the following: Association or club meeting/activity, music/singing/theatre, parish work, outdoor activities, dance, and worked out/sports’. These questions had five response categories (‘More than 1×/week, 1×/week, 1–3×/monthly (mo.), 1–5×/6 months (mos), and never’), which provided the basis for an index which was dichotomized into two categories, referred to as ‘Least one activity 1–5×/6 mos’ and ‘Never’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1403494813487447">
<title>Perceived health</title>
<p>Perceived health was investigated by the question: ‘How is your health at the moment?’, which had the following response alternatives: ‘Poor, Not so good, Good, and Very good’, of which the first two and last two categories were dichotomized into ‘Poor’ and ‘Good’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1403494813487447">
<title>Socio-demographic variables</title>
<p>Demographic variables (age and gender) and self-reported social network factors (living arrangement, marital status, and loss of social network) were used as covariates in the models. Age was categorized into three groups: 20–64 years, 65–74 years, and 75–89 years. Living arrangement and marital status were examined using a categorical variable based on the following issue: ‘Who do you live with?’ Loss of social network was investigated by the following two issues with categorical response ‘yes’ and ‘no’: ‘Has a member of your immediate family died?’ and ‘Has your relationship with your spouse or long-term partner ended?’</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1403494813487447">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The analyses were performed using the IBM<sup>®</sup> SPSS<sup>®</sup> Statistics version 19 (SPSS Inc., an IBM company, Chicago, IL, USA). The main research purpose, to investigate the association between personality, sense of community, civic participation, and perceived social support was tested by multinomial logistic regression. Pairwise correlation between covariates (as sum scores) was tested and showed the highest Spearman’s correlation coefficient 0.795 for ‘living arrangement’ and ‘marital status’. The variance inflation factor (VIF) of the covariates ranged from 1.01 to 1.12, indicating that there were no multicollinearity concerns. Pearson Chi-square tests were conducted to determine the first research question; whether any significant relationship existed between social support as the dependent variable and the other selected variables. Frequencies were used to describe characteristics of subjects. Multinomial logistic regression models were fitted to achieve the second research objective, which was to investigate both the crude and adjusted (possible confounders found to be significant at the bivariat level) associations of personality, sense of community, and civic par as related to the three-category outcomes of perceived social support if needed. Personality, sense of community, civic participation, and the adjusted association were possible confounders found to be significant at the bivariate level (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001). We also tested for an interaction between the predictors separately. The level of significance was set at <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001. Results are presented as odds ratio (OR) and confidence intervals (95%) for each model, crude and adjusted.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In HUNT3, 35,797 men (44.8%) and women (55.2%) aged 20–89 had a complete response to questions regarding social support and had a fully completed EPQ. Approximately 89% of the participants reported high social support, whereas 7.6% and 3.0% reported medium and low social support. Women (91.8%) reported high support more frequently than men (86.4%). Men responded more frequently as having a high sense of community in the neighbourhood and having at least one activity one to five times a month more than women: 76.7 % (women 73.0%) and 91.1% (women 90.1%), respectively. In total, 43.5% scored on low extraversion (introversion) and 27.7% scored on high neuroticism (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494813487447">Table I</xref>). Individuals’ average scores on extraversion and neuroticism were 3.70 and 1.66, respectively (not displayed in table). Additional sample characteristics are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494813487447">Table I</xref>, particularly in terms of possible confounders.</p>

<title>Prevalence of level of perceived social support</title>
<p>The prevalence of social support related to the covariates (individual and social factors) is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494813487447">Table II</xref>. The Chi-square test detected a significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) association between the majority of covariates and perceived social support, except between perceived social support and loss of social network, for which no significance was found. The prevalence of high social support was the highest among those with a high score on extraversion (94.3%). Those who did not agree with the claim: ‘I feel a strong sense of community with people who live here’ (8.1%) more often reported low social support, closely followed by those who never participated (7.5%) in one of the listed activities. Male participants, aged 75–89 years, not married/partnered, living alone and with perceived poor health status were all more likely to have low social support. According to the Phi value (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), the strength of association between social support and community is higher than the other covariates (<italic>Φ</italic> = 0.227).</p>

People who scored low on extraversion were around two times more likely to report less social support: OR=2.77 for medium social support and OR=3.25 for low compared with those whose scored high on extraversion. People who scored high on neuroticism were more likely to report medium social support (OR=1.57) and even more likely to report low support (OR=2.27) compared with those who scored low on neuroticism. Respondents who felt a low sense of community in their neighbourhood had higher odds of reporting medium social support and low social support compared with those who felt a high sense of community in their neighbourhood (OR=2.60 and 5.72, respectively). There was also a clear difference between medium and low social support by those who reported low civic participation.</p>

The results were slightly changed for community in terms of a small increase in OR and a slight decrease in OR for extraversion and civic participation. The OR for neuroticism was also slightly changed, with a small increase for medium social support and a small decrease for low social support. In addition, interaction effects (OR=0.67, for low social support) were found for gender X perceived health regarding the risk of three-category outcomes of perceived social support. The results show an age effect (OR=1.58 in age-group 75–89 for low social support), an effect of being male (OR= 2.31), and an effect of reporting poor health (OR=2.42). The interaction term indicates a relief of the total effect of being male and having poor health, but the effect is still higher (OR=3.76) than for females having poor health (OR=2.43) and males having good health (OR=2.31). Living arrangements and marital status remained not significant.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first study in Europe which viewed perceived social support if needed as a dependent variable using a census population-based study. The fact that women report the highest level of availability of perceived social support is in accordance with previous research measuring frequency and received social support in different populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494813487447">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494813487447">23</xref>]. Dalgard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494813487447">23</xref>] used questions about ‘number of close confidants, sense of concern or interest from other people, and relationship to neighbours’; men reported the highest level of practical help from neighbours if needed, whereas women reported having a number of confidants and getting more sense of concern from others. The current study also shows that men more often reported a high sense of community in the neighbourhood; this finding may explain why men more easily get help from neighbours.</p>
<p>There was a significant relationship between the level of social support and the other selected variables except ‘loss of social network’. There is reason to assume that loss of a spouse/partner/immediate family member would have a substantial influence on the level of social support due to the reduction of the immediate social network. However, the lack of significant correlation between the level of social support and the ‘loss of social network’ may be due to mobilizing the remaining social network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1403494813487447">24</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, extraversion, neuroticism, sense of community, and civic participation were associated with the three-category outcomes of perceived social support, even after adjustment for age, gender, perceived health, and the interaction term perceived health X gender. The current study found that people living alone and unmarried remained not significant; this may illuminate the difference between perceived and received social support. Previous studies have found that unmarried people and those living alone are less likely to receive social support than people who are married and living with someone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494813487447">2</xref>].</p>
<p>The odds of having low support were highest among those with a low sense of community, highlighting the importance of neighbourhoods as a source of friends who are available if they are needed. These results may also reflect a population which does not contain big cities. However, there is evidence that the social context people live in, such as a neighbourhood, is decisive for the degree of social support opportunities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813487447">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Failure to participate in civic activities shows a small difference between medium (OR=1.28) and low social support (OR=1.90). The small difference may be caused by the distribution of the population, in which 90.9% participate in an activity at least 1–5 times monthly. Civic participation as a source of social support does not necessarily give a sense of perceived social support if needed, but rather ‘provide’ or ‘actually received’[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494813487447">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494813487447">25</xref>]. Another explanation could be the importance of ‘sense of community’ or ‘achievement’ in civic participation.</p>
<p>The present study’s findings of different levels of social support by extraversion (OR= 2.53–2.99) and neuroticism (OR=1.72–2.25) support the claim that inequalities in social support are caused by personality traits, especially perceived support available if needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494813487447">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494813487447">26</xref>]. This study also found an interaction term that requires attention, the effect of poor self-rated health on men. The present study and some previous studies have found that women have somewhat lower self-rated health than men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1403494813487447">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1403494813487447">28</xref>] and somewhat higher perceived social support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494813487447">22</xref>]. The interaction term may indicate a slight mobilization of the available social network by males in poor health.</p>
<sec id="section15-1403494813487447">
<title>Strengths and weaknesses</title>
<p>The current study’s strength is basically due to the use of a large census survey from the general population aged 20–89 years, thus avoiding inherent selection bias; for example, from mental health surveys and various clinical samples. While the majority of previous studies used perceived social support as a dependent variable, one strength of this study is in using perceived social support as an independent variable, but this also complicates comparisons with other studies. The use of one single item for measurement has both strengths and weaknesses. Questions in relation to emotional and tangible social support, sense of community, and civic participation are apparent in simple terms. Simple terms can provide valuable information and be reliable and valid at the expense of specific detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1403494813487447">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1403494813487447">30</xref>]. This is a cross-sectional study, so reverse causality cannot be ruled out. In most cases, an inspection of confidence intervals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1403494813487447">Tables III</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1403494813487447">IV</xref>) shows a small interval with marked differences between medium and low perceived social support, besides extraversion with a light overlap.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The current study emphasizes the importance of personality and sense of community relative to the degree of experience of perceived social support if needed. Failure to participate in civic activities does not seem to be of major clinical importance for the degree of perceived social support. These findings have implications for both health and policy in terms of enhancing and maintaining strategies that promote perceived social support. Health professionals should be aware of men with poor health and their lack of support.</p>
