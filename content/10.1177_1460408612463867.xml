<abstract>
<p>Traditional management in cases of exsanguinating abdominal trauma led to poor outcomes in critically injured patients. Because prolonged operations were not well tolerated due to the severe physiologic derangements, an abbreviated laparotomy began to be used. Patients were then resuscitated in the intensive care unit and brought back to the operating room once their physiology had been normalised. This approach has been termed the damage control sequence. Elderly trauma patients are susceptible to significant injury that may mandate a damage control sequence. For myriad reasons, including pre-existing medical conditions, decreased physiologic reserve, and the emergent nature of their injuries, the application of this management approach in the elderly is fraught with challenges. The purpose of this review is to enumerate the damage control sequence, describe the complexities of its use in the elderly, and discuss associated outcomes in this challenging patient population.</p>

<p>Traditional management of severe, exsanguinating injury called for definitive correction of the surgical pathology and closure of the abdominal wall during the initial operation. Because the use of this approach in patients near physiologic exhaustion led to poor outcomes, an abbreviated laparotomy began to be used. This truncated approach to the severely injured trauma patient with life-threatening metabolic derangements has led to improved outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1460408612463867">Stone et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1460408612463867">Rotondo et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1460408612463867">Nicholas et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1460408612463867">Schreiber, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1460408612463867">Lee and Peitzman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1460408612463867">Duchesne et al., 2010</xref>). Described first by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1460408612463867">Stone et al. (1983)</xref> for the management of major bleeding diatheses during laparotomy, the approach was further refined and coined “damage control” by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1460408612463867">Rotondo et al. (1993)</xref>.</p>
<p>The use of the damage control sequence (DCS) is applicable to a minority of trauma patients. These patients have encountered severe injuries leading to extensive blood loss, haemodynamic instability, need for massive resuscitation, and altered physiology. Because of the development of the often fatal triad of hypothermia, acidosis, and coagulopathy, prolonged operations in these patients are not well tolerated. Cessation of the initial operation after surgical bleeding and contamination are controlled, allowing for resuscitation in the critical care unit and correction of physiologic derangements. Once this is accomplished, the patient is subsequently returned to the operating room for definitive repair of injuries.</p>
<p>Damage control laparotomy (DCL) in elderly trauma patients, defined as those aged 55 years and older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1460408612463867">Champion et al., 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1460408612463867">Morris et al., 1990a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1460408612463867">Schulman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1460408612463867">Kuhne et al., 2005</xref>), adds an even greater degree of complexity in the management of these critically injured patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1460408612463867">Table 1</xref>). The physiologic reserve of organ function in elderly patients is decreased when compared to younger patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1460408612463867">Rosenthal and Kavic, 2004</xref>; Marki, 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1460408612463867">Menaker and Scalea, 2010</xref>). Elderly patients are characterized by having pre-existing medical conditions that, when severe, may affect their ability to perform activities of daily living, let alone impair their ability to compensate for acute blood loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1460408612463867">Morris et al., 1990b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1460408612463867">Jacobs et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1460408612463867">McGwin et al., 2004</xref>). In elective general surgery for the elderly, time allows for a history and physical exam, consultation with medical specialists to optimise comorbidities, performance of provocative tests if deemed necessary, and optimisation of medical issues. In the elder trauma patient experiencing active bleeding as a result of their injury, there is little time for preoperative optimisation. In elderly patients, the use of preinjury anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents may also exacerbate bleeding and worsen outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1460408612463867">Bonville, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1460408612463867">Dossett et al., 2011</xref>). The elderly physiology may be altered or masked by medications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1460408612463867">Demetriades et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408612463867">Aschkenasy and Rothenhaus, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1460408612463867">Chang and Schecter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1460408612463867">Callaway and Wolfe, 2007</xref>). This alteration of physiology contributes to an underestimation of the severity of injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408612463867">Aschkenasy and Rothenhaus, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1460408612463867">Heffernan et al., 2010</xref>) and leads to inadequate fluid resuscitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1460408612463867">Demetriades et al., 2002</xref>) and delays in transfer to definitive care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1460408612463867">Svenson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1460408612463867">Utter et al., 2008</xref>). Although the elderly represent about one eighth of the population, they utilise one fourth of trauma and critical care resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1460408612463867">Rosenthal and Kavic, 2004</xref>). Because damage control is a resource-demanding enterprise, the use of this management strategy in the elderly could have significant financial implications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1460408612463867">Taylor et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1460408612463867">Newell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1460408612463867">Kairinos et al., 2010</xref>).

<p>The purpose of this review is to describe the DCS while specifically detailing intricacies of this management strategy in the elderly. Although damage control orthopedics will be mentioned, the subject will not be discussed extensively.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1460408612463867"><title>Indications/selection criteria</title>
<p>Of the number of elderly patients requiring laparotomy after traumatic injury, those patients necessitating damage control is small. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1460408612463867">Newell et al. (2010)</xref> found 14 elderly patients (age 55 years and older) who underwent damage control during a 5½-year period, excluding those patients with severe head injury. Only 4 octogenarians over a 12-year period required a DCL for trauma in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408612463867">Arhinful et al. (2011)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1460408612463867">Lustenberger et al. (2012)</xref> analyzed 9 elderly patients without significant head injury (Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score ≥3) that underwent a DCL over a period spanning 12 years. As this management approach is necessary in patients near physiologic exhaustion, the elderly trauma patient may already be predisposed because of physiologic changes by virtue of the aging process. Aging imparts a progressive deterioration of organ structure and function that is tolerated under normal circumstances. During times of increased physiologic demand, however, the elderly patient has insufficient organ function reserve, cannot compensate to meet the increased physiologic demand, and inevitably develops organ dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1460408612463867">Rosenthal and Kavic, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1460408612463867">Marik, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1460408612463867">Menaker and Scalea, 2010</xref>). The cardiovascular system, specifically, undergoes significant changes, which may profoundly affect the elderly trauma patient’s response to significant injury (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1460408612463867">Table 2</xref>). These changes, coupled with the high prevalence of underlying cardiovascular disease in those aged &gt;65 years, dramatically affect cardiovascular performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1460408612463867">Rosenthal and Kavic, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1460408612463867">Marik, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1460408612463867">Menaker and Scalea, 2010</xref>).

<p>Alterations in the aging heart affect all aspects of heart function including rate, rhythm, ventricular compliance, ejection fraction, cardiac output, and coronary blood flow. There is an approximately 30% reduction in maximal heart rate between the ages of 20 and 85 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1460408612463867">Menaker and Scalea, 2010</xref>). Additionally, the aging heart is less responsive to sympathetic stimulation rendering the elderly patient less capable of increasing their cardiac output by increasing heart rate. The use of medications such as beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers taken by the elderly to treat cardiovascular disease diminishes the reflexive tachycardia associated with intravascular volume loss and masks the expected response to injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1460408612463867">Menaker and Scalea, 2010</xref>). Increased myocardial collagen content and replacement of autonomic tissue by connective tissue and fat lead to conduction abnormalities such as atrial arrhythmias, bundle branch blocks, and sick sinus syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1460408612463867">Rosenthal and Kavic, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1460408612463867">Marik, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1460408612463867">Menaker and Scalea, 2010</xref>). Stiffening and reduced distensibility of the outflow tract of the heart leads to increased afterload; this, in turn, decreases left ventricular emptying and increases myocyte hypertrophy. The hypertrophied left ventricle decreases ventricular compliance, which is manifested by impaired relaxation. Ventricular relaxation, a process which is more energy dependent and therefore more oxygen dependent than ventricular contraction, is impaired leading to diastolic dysfunction. Decreased left ventricular compliance also leads to decreased early diastolic ventricular filling and a compensatory increase in flow due to atrial contraction. With increasing age, left ventricular filling becomes more dependent on atrial systole. Therefore, atrial fibrillation is tolerated poorly by elderly patients, especially those with marked diastolic dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1460408612463867">Rosenthal and Kavic, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1460408612463867">Marik, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1460408612463867">Menaker and Scalea, 2010</xref>). Although resting left ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac output are maintained in the elderly, peak ejection fraction and cardiac output decrease during times of stress. As the aging heart is unable to increase cardiac output by increasing heart rate, it depends more on increasing ventricular filling (preload) and stroke volume to augment cardiac output in the elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1460408612463867">Rosenthal and Kavic, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1460408612463867">Marik, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1460408612463867">Menaker and Scalea, 2010</xref>). This relationship between preload and cardiac output can lead to significant cardiac compromise in patients with hypovolemia. Management of the elder trauma patient’s resuscitation must strike a balance between providing sufficient volume to optimise cardiac output without causing pulmonary oedema secondary to decreased ventricular compliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1460408612463867">Rosenthal and Kavic, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1460408612463867">Marik, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1460408612463867">Menaker and Scalea, 2010</xref>). Coronary artery disease (especially right-sided coronary lesions) causes loss of autoregulation of coronary blood flow. Cardiac ischaemia with resultant pump failure can occur as myocardial demand is increased with acute illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1460408612463867">Menaker and Scalea, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Early identification of candidates for damage control optimises outcomes, and therefore, familiarity of potential scenarios where a DCS may be required is paramount (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1460408612463867">Rotondo and Zonies, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1460408612463867">Moore et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408612463867">Asensio et al., 2004</xref>). Given the limited physiologic reserve in the elderly trauma patient, this keen awareness of the need for damage control is extremely important in this population. Haemodynamic instability, which may be subtle and difficult to appreciate in the elderly, or obvious and include hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnoea, and altered mental status, should provide the surgeon suggestions as to the need for a DCL. High-energy blunt torso trauma, multiple thoracoabdominal penetrations, presenting coagulopathy, possibly exacerbated by prescribed anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents, hypothermia, and pre-existing medical conditions also offer evidence for the need of an abbreviated laparotomy. In the elderly, blunt mechanism of injury, primarily motor vehicle collisions, more often leads to the need for a DCL. Penetrating trauma is comparably low in older trauma patients when compared to the young. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1460408612463867">Lustenberger et al. (2011)</xref>, in a National Trauma Databank review of gunshot injuries, revealed that patients ≥55 years made up only 3.2% of the 98,242 patients in the investigation. Studies of elderly damage control patients reveal an equally low incidence of penetrating trauma as the mechanism of injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1460408612463867">Newell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1460408612463867">Lustenberger et al., 2012</xref>). Patients with major abdominal vascular injuries and multiple visceral injuries may need damage control. Similarly, patients with multifocal and multicavitary sources of exsanguination should be considered for damage control. Injury pattern recognition is important to determine the elderly patient requiring damage control. Destructive pancreatic head injuries, retrohepatic caval injuries, severe pelvic fractures and complex hepatic injuries indicate injury patterns necessitating damage control. Other factors to consider include intraoperative hypothermia, acidosis (pH &lt; 7.3), and coagulopathy as evidenced by non-surgical bleeding, the so-called bloody vicious cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1460408612463867">Moore et al., 1998</xref>). The elderly are more susceptible to hypothermia because of attenuated peripheral vasoconstriction, decreased basal metabolic rates, and reduced cold-induced metabolic heat production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1460408612463867">Worfolk, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1460408612463867">Kenney and Munce, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1460408612463867">Rosenthal and Kavic, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1460408612463867">Sagraves et al. (2006)</xref> considered a base deficit &lt;−8 mEq/L in a patient &gt;55 years as an indication for a DCL. Transfusion of ≥10 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and total resuscitation and operation times of &gt;90 minutes are also indications to consider damage control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1460408612463867">Rotondo and Zonies, 1997</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec4-1460408612463867"><title>Ground zero: prehospital care/initial resuscitation</title>
<p>Despite not initially being considered an integral part of the DCS, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1460408612463867">Waibel and Rotondo (2010)</xref> pointed to the importance of the prehospital setting in affecting outcomes in these severely injured patients. Termed “Ground Zero,” the prehospital phase of the patient’s management is emphasised. Prompt transfer to definitive care is essential. Elder trauma patients have been shown to have longer transfer times to facilities for definitive care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1460408612463867">Svenson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1460408612463867">Utter et al., 2008</xref>). This may be partly explained by the inability of current triage criteria to identify the severity of injury in the elderly resulting in undertriage and transfer to non-trauma centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1460408612463867">Utter et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1460408612463867">Weber et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1460408612463867">Scheetz, 2011</xref>). Since altered lactic acid and base deficit levels have been shown to predict major injury in elderly trauma patients, perhaps they can assist in the triage of these challenging patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1460408612463867">Zehtabchi and Baron, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>As mentioned, elderly patients may exhibit an altered physiologic response to injury. They are less likely to display decreased systolic blood pressure (SBP &lt;90 mmHg) and increased heart rate (HR &gt;100 beats/min) in response to injury and hypovolemia, and therefore do not trigger triage criteria for immediate transfer to a trauma center or trauma team activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1460408612463867">Lehmann et al., 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1460408612463867">Demetriades et al.

<p>While hypotension is frequently defined as an SBP &lt;90 mmHg, in the elderly patient even normal presenting vital signs may be unreliable as blood pressure is an imperfect surrogate marker for tissue oxygenation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1460408612463867">Ley et al., 2011</xref>). An SBP of 110 mmHg may be enough to cause inadequate tissue perfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408612463867">Bruns et al., 2008</xref>) and lead to poor outcomes in the elderly population if not aggressively corrected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1460408612463867">Blow et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1460408612463867">Schulman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1460408612463867">Heffernan et al., 2010</xref>). In the study of elderly blunt trauma victims by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1460408612463867">Scalea et al. (1990)</xref>, despite seemingly normal blood pressures and heart rates, a significant percentage of these patients demonstrated occult hypoperfusion necessitating attempted optimisation of cardiac output and oxygen delivery. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1460408612463867">Callaway et al. (2009)</xref>, in studying elderly blunt trauma patients &gt;65 years with normal SBP (&gt;90 mmHg) upon emergency department (ED) admission, found those patients with elevated lactic acid (&gt;4.0 mEq/L) and base deficit (&lt;−6 mEq/L) levels were four times more likely to die compared to elderly patients with normal lactic acid and base deficit levels at ED admission. Elderly damage control patients, in the work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1460408612463867">Lustenberger et al.

<p>The use of damage control resuscitation (DCR), defined as permissive hypotension, limited crystalloid use, and close ratios of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelets (PLT) to PRBC transfusion, has been shown to improve survival in patients undergoing DCL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1460408612463867">Duchesne et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1460408612463867">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1460408612463867">Cotton et al., 2011</xref>). Although DCR has been used to treat, as well as not exacerbate, the coagulopathy associated with massive blood loss, the use of this treatment strategy in the elderly must be approached with caution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1460408612463867">Kreimeier et al., 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1460408612463867">Heffernan et al.

In the retrospective review of patients undergoing DCL combined with DCR by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1460408612463867">Cotton et al. (2011)</xref>, DCR was associated with an improved 30-day survival compared to the cohort prior to DCR implementation. However, the median age of the DCR group was 34 years and the oldest patient was 47 years. Limiting crystalloid infusion as a component of fluid resuscitation, however, is suggested to improve outcomes in the elderly. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1460408612463867">Ley et al. (2011)</xref> studied the affect of emergency room crystalloid resuscitation on outcomes in elderly trauma patients and found they were nearly three times more likely to die if resuscitated with more than 1.5 litres of crystalloid in the ED. As the impact of age on outcomes of patients participating in a DCR has not been studied, prudence should be exercised in applying this management strategy to the elderly.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1460408612463867"><title>Part 1: control of haemorrhage and contamination (initial laparotomy)</title>
<p>Abbreviation of the initial operation prior to the development of physiologic exhaustion is the tenet of Part 1 of the DCS. This stage calls for cessation of haemorrhage, control of contamination, and temporary abdominal closure. Because these patients are haemodynamically unstable and physiologically deranged, prolonged operative interventions are not tolerated well. The baseline physiologic constraints of the elderly trauma patient amplify the need for prompt control of bleeding and contamination to expedite transfer to the ICU for continued resuscitation.</p>
<p>The operative conduct of damage control Part I does not differ significantly between elderly and young severely injured patients in that the course of the operation is dictated by the injuries encountered. Bleeding is controlled with packs, ligation of non-critical blood vessels, and temporary vascular shunts for critical blood vessels as the time needed for complex vascular repairs is not available. Haemorrhage control is ideally conducted at a pace that hastens the operation such that the development of non-surgical bleeding does not occur or is limited at best. Adjuncts for haemorrhage control including haemostatic bandages and fibrin sealants are used as deemed necessary. Contamination from hollow viscus injuries is limited by suture repair or segmental resection leaving the bowel in discontinuity.</p>
<p>Analyses of DCL in the elderly have demonstrated the expected severe intra-abdominal injury consistent with the need for damage control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1460408612463867">Newell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1460408612463867">Lustenberger et al., 2012</xref>). The elderly DCL cohort of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1460408612463867">Newell et al. (2010)</xref> had significant abdominal injuries as evidenced by their mean AIS abdomen score of nearly 3.5. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1460408612463867">Lustenberger et al. (2012)</xref>, in reviewing their trauma registry for patients who had a damage control procedure, including those for extremity and pelvic injuries, noted 50% of the elderly group had AIS abdomen scores ≥3.</p>
<p>A massive resuscitation utilising crystalloid, PRBC, and blood products is given to the damage control patient intraoperatively. When comparing resuscitative volumes given to elderly and young trauma patients in the operating room (OR), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1460408612463867">Newell et al. (2010)</xref> found both cohorts received &gt;10.5 litres of fluid. There were no statistically significant differences in infusion or transfusion volumes when comparing crystalloid, PRBC, FFP, PLT, or autotransfused blood. The elderly cohort received more cryoprecipitate (387 ± 1131 ml versus 30 ± 58 ml; <italic>p</italic> = 0.030) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1460408612463867">Newell et al., 2010</xref>). Likewise, the damage control study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1460408612463867">Lustenberger et al. (2012)</xref> did not reveal a statistically significant difference in PRBC, FFP, or PLT volume transfused for the first 24 hours after admission.</p>
<p>Once bleeding and contamination have been controlled, the abdominal wall is temporarily closed. This permits easy access for re-exploration of the abdominal cavity, measurement and characterization of effluent from the abdominal cavity, and accommodation of visceral oedema to avoid abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1460408612463867">Montalvo et al., 2005</xref>). The vacuum-pack dressing or negative-pressure wound therapy both serve this purpose.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1460408612463867"><title>Part 2: resuscitation in the intensive care unit</title>
<p>After the expeditious performance of the DCL, the elderly trauma patient is brought to the intensive care unit (ICU) for comprehensive monitoring, core rewarming, continued resuscitation and re-establishment of normal physiology, and correction of anaemia, coagulopathy, and altered chemistries. Although maintenance of core temperature is important from the time of injury through Part 1 of the DCS, correction of acquired hypothermia is emphasised during Part 2. Consequences of hypothermia in injured patients include reduction of cardiac output, development of cardiac arrhythmias, decreased off-loading of oxygen to cells due to leftward shift of the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve, and alterations of the clotting cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1460408612463867">Sagraves et al., 2006</xref>). Hypothermia is a proven independent risk factor for complications and mortality after trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1460408612463867">Jurkovich, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1460408612463867">Inaba et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408612463867">Beilman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1460408612463867">Waibel et al., 2009</xref>). Control of hypothermia is especially important in the elder damage control patient. In a study of critically injured patients requiring thoracic or abdominal cavity exploration by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1460408612463867">Inaba et al. (2009)</xref>, patients ≥55 years of age were more likely to arrive postoperatively hypothermic (temperature ≤35°C) to the ICU. Some of the physiologic explanations that put the elderly patient at risk for hypothermia have been discussed. Multiple modalities to increase temperature can be used such as increasing the ICU room temperature, use of warmed fluids, and implementation of temperature management systems including external warming devices and continuous arteriovenous rewarming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1460408612463867">Lee and Peitzman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1460408612463867">Sagraves et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Because the physiologic reserve in elderly patients is decreased compared to younger patients, attention to resuscitation and the normalisation of aerobic metabolism is crucial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1460408612463867">Chang and Schecter, 2007</xref>). Utilising endpoints of resuscitation such as base deficit and lactic acid to guide the resuscitation are paramount. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1460408612463867">Blow et al. (1999)</xref> demonstrated the importance of timely correction of lactic acidosis in that respiratory complications, multiple system organ failure, and mortality were all increased in patients with persistent lactic acidosis for greater than 24 hours. As it pertains specifically to the elderly, older patients have an increased susceptibility to prolonged occult hypoperfusion. The investigation of elevated lactic acid in the elderly by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1460408612463867">Schulman et al. (2002)</xref> revealed increased mortality (34.6% versus 11.6%; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in patients with prolonged occult hypoperfusion (lactic acid not corrected within 12 hours).</p>
<p>The need for additional monitoring to augment the resuscitation of elderly trauma patients has been well described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1460408612463867">Scalea et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1460408612463867">Friese et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1460408612463867">Greenberg et al., 2009</xref>). Timely use of a pulmonary artery (PA) catheter to guide resuscitation prior to the development of irreversible injury cannot be overemphasized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1460408612463867">Scalea et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1460408612463867">McKinley et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1460408612463867">Greenberg et al., 2009</xref>) and is recommended in the elderly trauma patient with significant lactic acidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1460408612463867">Friese et al., 2006</xref>). Non-invasive techniques of cardiac output and tissue perfusion monitoring may also be utilised and have demonstrated comparable effectiveness as PA catheters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1460408612463867">Demetriades et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1460408612463867">Menaker and Scalea, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1460408612463867">Scalea et al. (1990)</xref>, after identifying a population of elderly patients with high risk of mortality, studied the impact of PA catheter placement and augmentation of cardiac output. They found a significant incidence of elderly patients with occult hypoperfusion despite appearing haemodynamically stable. Additionally, they were able to improve oxygen delivery and survival in a subset of those patients by augmenting cardiac output utilising fluid, blood, and inotropes. Further outcome improvement was demonstrated by decreasing the time from ED admission to placement of the PA catheter. When the time of PA catheter placement decreased from 5.5 hours to 2.2 hours, survival improved from 7% to 53%. Elderly non-survivors were found to have low cardiac output unresponsive to inotropic support and reduced tissue oxygenation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1460408612463867">Scalea et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408612463867">Belzberg et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1460408612463867">McKinley et al. (2000)</xref> demonstrated initially depressed cardiac indices in their elderly critically injured cohort after initial placement of a PA catheter but improved haemodynamics and normalisation of resuscitation endpoints after guided resuscitation with fluid, blood, pressors, and inotropes as needed. Whereas only 31% of the young group required inotropes to meet their resuscitation goals, 83% of the elderly cohort needed inotropic support to normalise base deficit and lactic acid levels. This illustrates the physiologic differences in cardiac function between elderly and young trauma patients, highlights the frequent presence of occult hypoperfusion in the elderly, and underscores the risk of a “wait and see approach” in placement of a PA catheter as the persistence of shock correlates with post-injury multiple-organ failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1460408612463867">McKinley et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Reversal of hypothermia and acidosis helps to rectify the resultant coagulopathy due to massive blood loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1460408612463867">Moore et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1460408612463867">Lee and Peitzman, 2006</xref>). Aggressive transfusion of blood products (platelets, fresh frozen plasma, and cryoprecipitate) facilitates this process while anaemia is corrected with PRBC. The addition of recombinant Factor VIIa to improve the coagulopathic state can be considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1460408612463867">Lee and Peitzman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1460408612463867">Waibel and Rotondo, 2010</xref>); however, its use has to be weighed against its cost, risk of thromboembolism, and limited efficacy without proven mortality benefit.</p>
<p>The massive transfusion required by the damage control patient not only leads to blood parameter alterations but significant metabolic abnormalities also occur. Monitoring for, and correction of, electrolyte disturbances such as calcium and potassium and controlling glucose levels are mandatory during this phase of the DCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1460408612463867">Waibel and Rotondo, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1460408612463867"><title>Part 3: definitive injury repair (subsequent laparotomy)</title>
<p>After the correction of hypothermia, acidosis, and coagulopathy, the elder trauma patient is brought back to the OR for definitive injury repair. A caveat of this plan is the need to return the patient back to the OR for continued or recurrent surgical bleeding. This requires a repeat of Parts 1 and 2 of the DCS. During Part 3, a thorough exploration of the abdominal cavity is performed to look for injuries missed during Part 1 of the DCS. Packs are removed, haemostasis is ensured and definitive repairs are performed.</p>
<p>Although there has been no specific comparison of delayed bowel anastomosis between elderly and young DCL patients, caution should be exercised when performing delayed colon anastomosis in the elderly. Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1460408612463867">EAST, 1998</xref>) guidelines against primary colon repair after destructive colon injury include haemodynamic instability, significant underlying disease, associated injuries, peritonitis, and ≥4 units PRBC transfusion. Recent studies analysing the safety of delayed colon anastomosis take the above recommendations into consideration as well. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1460408612463867">Miller et al. (2007)</xref> reviewed their experience of colon resection in the DCL setting. Patients who, at the discretion of the surgeon, had a colostomy performed instead of delayed anastomosis during the second operation had bowel oedema, multiple comorbidities, prolonged interval from injury to operation, and recent shock. When comparing colon anastomosis in the DCL and non-DCL groups, there was no statistically significant difference in anastomotic leak, intra-abdominal abscess, or colon-related mortality. The authors concluded delayed colonic anastomosis was safe in selected patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1460408612463867">Miller et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Conversely, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1460408612463867">Weinberg et al. (2009)</xref>, after reviewing their own outcomes in the management of full-thickness or devitalized colon injuries following DCL, demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of complications (combined anastomotic leak and abdominal abscess) in the DCL group compared with patients undergoing definitive repair of their injuries during a single laparotomy. A 12.5% leak rate in the DCL cohort was high enough for these authors to suggest caution when contemplating colon anastomosis during return to the OR. Interestingly, there was a trend toward a higher complication rate in older patients when comparing DCL cohorts who underwent colon resection and anastomosis.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1460408612463867">Ordoñez et al. (2011)</xref> reviewed their experience of DCL patients with destructive colon injuries and noted an 81.4% success rate for delayed colonic anastomosis. There was no statistical difference in complications from delayed anastomosis (after DCL) versus standard laparotomy with primary anastomosis. Reasons for colostomy creation included persistent intra-abdominal infection, severe colonic bowel wall oedema and inflammation, and acidosis. These authors recommended delayed colon anastomosis except for the aforementioned high-risk groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1460408612463867">Ordoñez et al., 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1460408612463867">Ott et al. (2011)</xref>, in their analysis of the same subject, found nearly 75% of their damage control patients avoided colostomy. There was a statistically significant leak rate for left colon injuries and in patients with high transfusion requirement. They also noted a significant increase in the colonic leak rate of patients with an open abdomen compared to those who underwent immediate abdominal wall closure. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1460408612463867">Burlew et al. (2011)</xref> also noted increased anastomotic complications in the DCL group with fascial closure beyond 5 days in addition to those with left-sided colon anastomosis. They felt that persistent shock and hypoperfusion were related to colonic anastomotic leak development and recommended delayed anastomosis except for the high-risk groups.</p>
<p>In considering the literature, it would appear that there are high risk groups where delayed colon anastomosis after DCL would be precarious. Shock and hypoperfusion are risk factors that may render creation of a colonic anastomosis unsafe. One unsolved question that remains is if restoration of physiologic reserve is a sufficient endpoint for bowel anastomosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1460408612463867">Ott et al., 2011</xref>). Given that ample blood supply is necessary for healing at the bowel anastomosis and that insufficient microcirculation of the anastomosis leads to anastomotic leak and stricture, especially in the elderly, delayed anastomosis in this group needs to be approached with serious deliberation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1460408612463867">Urbanavičius et al., 2011</xref>). Measuring of tissue oxygen saturation at the anastomotic ends, or other means to determine appropriate microvasculature, may need to be performed in the elderly to decrease the disastrous consequences of an anastomotic leak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1460408612463867">Hirano et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1460408612463867"><title>Part 4: open abdominal wounds and definitive abdominal closure</title>
<p>Once definitive procedures have been performed, the abdominal wall can be evaluated for primary closure. Due to the massive fluid resuscitation and ischaemia-reperfusion injury, significant visceral oedema may prohibit primary closure. Primary abdominal closure has been shown to decrease complications. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1460408612463867">Hatch et al. (2011)</xref> noted significant decreases in intra-abdominal abscess, sepsis, and both respiratory and renal failure with primary closure in an analysis of DCL patients compared with those undergoing a single-stage procedure. Logistic regression analysis noted that abdominal closure at first take-back was associated with a reduction in infectious and non-infectious abdominal complications, as well as wound and pulmonary complications. Among other variables, however, age was controlled for in the logistic regression analysis.</p>
<p>In the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408612463867">Arhinful et al. (2011)</xref> of DCL for general and vascular surgery indications in octogenarians, primary fascial closure rate was achieved in 45% of patients. The possibility of bias affecting this closure rate could not be discounted in that repeat attempts at abdominal closure in octogenarians may have been limited to prevent subsequent trips to the OR with the need for general anaesthesia. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1460408612463867">Cheatham et al.

Studies investigating DCL in the elderly bear this out. When analysing ICU (ICULOS) and hospital length of stay (HLOS) in elderly damage control patients surviving to hospital discharge, ICULOS (&gt;14 days) and HLOS (&gt;30 days) were lengthy, however, these results were comparable to young damage control patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1460408612463867">Newell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1460408612463867">Lustenberger et al., 2012</xref>).

<p>The work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1460408612463867">Newell et al. (2010)</xref> suggested a shorter HLOS in elderly non-survivors of DCL. The mean time to death in elderly patients was about 10 days compared to 26 days in the younger group. The authors suggested that the elderly non-survivor of damage control would “declare themselves” reasonably early in the hospital stay and, therefore, aggressive management could be initially attempted. If survival then appeared doubtful, that information could be discussed with the patient’s family and consideration for de-escalating support could be entertained. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1460408612463867">Lustenberger et al.

(2011)</xref> developed an intra-abdominal abscess; this complication was second only to acute renal failure.</p>
<p>Although most outcome variables in elderly and young damage control patients were not significantly different, mortality rates between the two cohorts were dissimilar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1460408612463867">Newell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1460408612463867">Lustenberger et al., 2012</xref>). In one study, mortality in the elderly group was 42.9% compared to 12.5% in the young (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1460408612463867">Newell et al., 2010</xref>); in another, 55.6% of elderly patients succumbed to their injuries versus 7.1% in the young group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1460408612463867">Lustenberger et al., 2012</xref>). Worsened survival is not unexpected in the elderly damage control patient when compared to younger patients given the attendant severity of injury, differences in physiologic reserve, and the existence of comorbidity. Despite the high mortality rate, damage control is not futile in the elderly as a significant proportion of these patients do survive to hospital dismissal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1460408612463867">Newell et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1460408612463867">Sutton et al. (2006)</xref> evaluated the long-term impact of damage control surgery. In their review of prospectively collected data, mean age was 31 years, mean ISS was 33, in-hospital mortality was 27%, ICULOS was 17 days, and HLOS was 30 days. Over the ensuing 2-year period, 95% of patients were followed and 76% of them were readmitted for infection, ventral hernia repair, or fistula management. No patient who survived to initial hospital dismissal expired over the follow-up period. When considering long-term outcomes in the elderly DCL patient, there is little literature devoted to this topic. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408612463867">Arhinful et al. (2011)</xref>, in their review of octogenarians requiring an open abdomen for indications including DCL, showed a 66% 2-year survival rate in patients who survived to hospital dismissal. Overall, 2-year survival was a 41%.</p>
<p>Advanced age, as a sole criterion, is not an indication to withhold aggressive therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1460408612463867">Jacobs et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1460408612463867">Chang and Schecter, 2007</xref>). On the other hand, there are instances when damage control should either not be offered to the elderly trauma patient or further efforts at salvage should be withdrawn. Defining futility is difficult in trauma patients, especially when trauma surgeons have all experienced “saving” a particular patient whom others may have deemed as unsalvageable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1460408612463867">Coimbra et al., 2007</xref>). However, because there are definite consequences involved in continuing life-saving efforts, including but not limited to, maintenance of quality end-of-life care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1460408612463867">Trunkey et al., 2000</xref>) and resource expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1460408612463867">Taylor et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1460408612463867">Nirula and Gentilello, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1460408612463867">Chang and Schecter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1460408612463867">Coimbra et al., 2007</xref>), some criteria are necessary to guide management of the elderly candidate for damage control in instances where the likely outcome is death. These suggestions may be helpful as varying rates of utilising do not resuscitate (DNR) orders in patients have been noted among trauma centres nationwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1460408612463867">Nathens et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1460408612463867">Morris et al. (1993)</xref> <italic>a priori</italic> deemed damage control patients unsalvageable if they were 70 years or older, had suffered a prehospital blunt cardiac arrest, or had a fatal head injury. Prehospital blunt cardiac arrest and fatal head injury are listed as considerations for limiting aggressive therapeutic interventions in elderly trauma patients in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1460408612463867">Jacobs et al., 2003</xref>). A Trauma Score &lt;7 in trauma patients ≥65 years has been shown to predict a 100% mortality in this population and its use has been suggested as an indication to limit aggressive therapeutic interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1460408612463867">Jacobs et al., 2003</xref>). In DCL patients specifically, Revised Trauma Score has demonstrated prognostic predictive ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1460408612463867">Ordoñez et al., 2011</xref>). However, the participants in this study were young (mean age 32.9 years), injured primarily via a penetrating mechanism (80.7%), and predominantly victims of gunshot wounds (92.5%).</p>
<p>The combination of severe torso trauma, moderate shock, and mild-to-moderate head injury has been associated with poor outcomes and has been suggested as a complex in which to consider withdrawal of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1460408612463867">Nirula and Gentilello, 2004</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408612463867">Arhinful et al. (2011)</xref>, outcomes of elderly damage control patients were based upon comorbidities such as congestive heart failure. In determining potential futility in proceeding with a DCL in the elderly, the existence of significant comorbidities should affect the conversation with patient, if able, and family members as to whether this resource-rich management strategy should be employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408612463867">Arhinful et al., 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1460408612463867">Ordoñez et al. (2011)</xref> devised a clinical model, adjusted by age, utilising ICU admission pH and temperature, and the number of PRBC transfused within the first 24 hours of admission. This model was found to both assign appropriate risk of death of participants and discriminate between survivors and non-survivors. Postoperative complications may also suggest a dismal prognosis. Acute renal failure in the elderly damage control patient was associated with an 11-fold risk for mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408612463867">Arhinful et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec10-1460408612463867" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The study of the application of damage control in the elderly is in its infancy. The current literature suggests outcomes in the elderly damage control patient are respectable and justify the utilization of this approach in this population of patients. As the concept of damage control continues to evolve, it is anticipated that its use in the elderly will also advance. With greater application and study, it is hoped that we would be able to apply this management strategy more efficiently, working towards improved outcomes in appropriately selected candidates, while withholding the approach in those with little chance for meaningful survival.</p>
