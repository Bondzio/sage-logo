<p>Though not yet readily apparent in articles and book chapters, there is a burgeoning series of ‘in the field’ collaborations between geomorphologists and artists focused around the mutual exploration of ‘inspirational landscapes’, and the harnessing of the emotive dimensions of such body/world encounters in the production and communication of geomorphological knowledge. Seemingly at odds with the discipline’s emphasis upon the production of fieldwork <italic>data</italic> (as opposed to sensed phenomena), as well as its disavowal of the subjective, this work nevertheless resonates with a complex and fascinating aesthetic tradition within geomorphology. Here, we ‘place’ these contemporary collaborations via: reference to Humboldtian science, and the crucial link between sensibility and precision; a reading of the Kantian sublime in the work of G.K. Gilbert; a sketching out of the evisceration of both the aesthetic and art in the second half of the 20th century; and, finally, a review of the current scope of art/geomorphology collaborations, and possible futures.</p>

<title>I Introduction</title>
<p>Over the past two decades we have been witness to a variety of efforts to ‘re-enchant’ geomorphology. These involve a more ‘direct’ (by which is meant ‘in the field’) engagement with landforms, which becomes a means of prompting ‘out of the box’ thinking in the mode of W.M. Davis’ (1926) outrageous hypotheses. They have also generated discussion as to how geomorphologists should, and could, engage with landforms as objects of analysis, and communicate their knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309133312457108">Baker, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0309133312457108">1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0309133312457108">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0309133312457108">Baker and Twidale, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0309133312457108">Huggett, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0309133312457108">Stoddart, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0309133312457108">Twidale, 1996</xref>). In subsequent and related debates on the past, present and future of geomorphology, portentous gaps have been posited between subjectivity and objectivity, idealism and realism, empiricism and reductionism and so on, each laid one on top of another to form a disciplinary palimpsest, marked by a deep, seemingly impassable fissure. Far from being a ‘philosophically sedate discipline’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0309133312457108">Sherman, 1996</xref>: 87), geomorphology continues to grapple with a variety of conceptual issues, including its place within and without geography (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0309133312457108">Harrison, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0309133312457108">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0309133312457108">Rhoads, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0309133312457108">1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0309133312457108">1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0309133312457108">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0309133312457108">Rhoads and Thorn, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0309133312457108">1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0309133312457108">Slaymaker, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In this paper we want to engage with these debates on the character and scope of the discipline, and explore the potential of a ‘wonder-full geomorphology’. We do so not to resolve them via an all-encompassing explanatory framework (as has been attempted via general systems theory, critical realism and, more recently, actor-network theory), or shared concepts (such as relational space). Nor do we want to create a ‘bridging’ moment based on mutual concerns (such as global warming, environment degradation and loss of biodiversity). Rather, we want to reconsider key moments in the study of landforms in order, first, to help contextualize the emergence of these dichotomies – objective over and against subjective and so on – within geomorphology, and, second, to ‘place’ current, practice-based, collaborative projects undertaken by artists and geomorphologists that do not ‘bridge’ divides so much as juxtapose and learn from differing approaches to landforms. Key, here, is a shared interest in the sensuous encounters via which landscapes are made sense of, perceptually and cognitively, and a harnessing of the emotive dimensions of such encounters in the production and communication of geomorphological knowledge. This is an aesthetic mode of inquiry, we argue, which finds resonance not only in art’s long tradition of thought and practice, but in aspects of a history of geomorphology that have tended to be overlooked or disavowed by its 20th-century biographers. This is despite continued interest by some geomorphologists in art and aesthetics more broadly as manifest in, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0309133312457108">Shephard’s (1957)</xref> compelling argument on the way in which emerging geological knowledge in 1840s New England inspired the region’s artists, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309133312457108">Alexander’s (1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0309133312457108">1986</xref>) observations on the ‘form of the land’ and the shaping of Leonardo da Vinci’s and Dante’s artistic output.</p>
<p>The sundering of aesthetic sensibilities from scientific inquiry is usually traced back to what is considered to be a momentous, Enlightenment shift in the making of the modern-day geographic discipline, wherein, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0309133312457108">Hartshorne (1939</xref>), for example, observed, geography shed its ‘pre-critical’ collection phase – based on the compendium of images as well as texts – and became a synthesizing effort. Critical analysis was associated with the sorting and categorizing of observations, with the ultimate goal of pulling out from this wealth of material a generalizable set of processes. For Stoddart, the year 1769 is pivotal: Captain Cook’s entry into the South Pacific formally marked the end of a ‘barren didacticism of capes and bays’ and the inauguration of a discipline that produces and seeks to answer questions concerning ‘man and environment within regions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0309133312457108">Stoddart, 1987</xref>: 331). In both these accounts of disciplinary history, art, as well as a discussion of the aesthetic, is barely present. It is unsurprising, then, that Alexander von Humboldt’s 19th-century analyses of landforms are so often understood as on a cusp; and that his <italic>Cosmos </italic>(1845–1862) is denoted as tension-laden, and even fatally flawed, by virtue of his insistence that poetry and etchings were to be valued alongside systematic observations of physical processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0309133312457108">Stoddart, 1975</xref>).</p>
<p>Our own discussion of the place of art and aesthetics in geomorphology returns to and takes inspiration from Humboldt’s work. Crucial to our argument is the recognition of an ‘expanded field’ of artistic inquiry that predated the rarification of ‘artworks’ (principally in the form of oil paintings, watercolours and sculpture), which was firmly institutionalized by, for example, the founding of the Royal Academy of Arts in London in 1769.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0309133312457108">1</xref>
</sup> Prior to this strict winnowing, however (and continuing to circulate outside of it, not least in diverse scientific, mechanic and technological institutions), was an expanded field that encompassed: the instrumentalized graphic arts of maps and charts; a visual tradition of geological cross-sections based on explanation and exposition; the visual economies of a Linnaean Botany; and the ideals of landscape and view paintings. What we want to draw out from this is how art was indeed much more than a mode of representation that allowed for an ‘accurate’ rendering of the form, feature, colour and texture of landforms – a mimetic, if you will – but had, as Humboldt acknowledged, a range of roles in Enlightenment geographies, all of which relied upon, albeit in different modes, the working through of an aesthetic sensibility in the production of geographic knowledges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0309133312457108">Hawkins, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0309133312457108">2011</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0309133312457108">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Aesthetics refer here not to some personally held sense of beauty, but to a broad-based inquiry into multi-sensuous encounters between body and world, and the manner in which these were to be made sense of. Indeed, it is in the 18th century that such inquiry is formalized in the work of Alexander Baumgarten and Immanuel Kant. As such, the aesthetic was by no means to be ‘contained’ in the production and form of paintings and sketches, but undergirded fieldwork practices more broadly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0309133312457108">Stafford, 1993</xref>), as manifest in Humboldt’s ‘artistic’ philosophy.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the broad sweep of the aesthetic, we are interested here in its varied influence within a history of modern-day geomorphology. We draw out, for example, how a Kantian aesthetic has been used to ground a divide between the intelligible and the unknown, the latter viscerally experienced as the sublime and prompting a sense of awe and wonder that, importantly, prompts thought. And so in the work of G.K. Gilbert (1843–1918), often heralded as the ‘father’ of a modern-day, scientific, process-orientated geomorphology, we can trace how a felt engagement with the order of nature prompts a series of analytically framed questions concerning landform development. This is a very particular rendering of ‘wonder’ that persists across the field today, perhaps most strongly in contemporary planetary geomorphology: here, an (almost) unlimited frontier is afforded for the exploration of extra-terrestrial landforms and landscapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0309133312457108">Baker, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>These themes continue into the 20th century, wherein we find a ‘sense of place’ as part and parcel of the ‘scientific study of scenery’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0309133312457108">Marr, 1900</xref>). Leveson, for example, notes how, for a geologist, ‘the pleasing landscape is endowed with geologic clarity: material, structure, process, and time are meaningfully articulated’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0309133312457108">Leveson, 1988</xref>: 85). An extension of this argument can be seen in the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0309133312457108">Semken (2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0309133312457108">2011</xref>), who not only emphasizes a sense of place within Navajo and Blackfeet cultural repertoires, but weaves these into a native American geoscientific knowledge base that parallels, for example, ‘western’ models of dynamic equilibrium (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0309133312457108">Semken and Brandt, 2010</xref>). This experiential dimension, however, was written out as unnecessarily subjective by the proponents of a quantitative revolution, a moment that was to prove pivotal in the recasting of Humboldt and Gilbert as proto-quantitative scientists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0309133312457108">Chorley, 1978</xref>). Yet, while the scientism of this post-war period may have appeared extreme, even here we can find the continuing presence of aesthetics, but in an anaemic form. That is, sensuous encounters with nature are cast as the source from which systematic, methodological, technologically mediated procedures can produce data, the latter now clearly set apart from ‘mere’ sensed phenomena. Furthermore, this approach to aesthetics sees value in art works, but only insofar as they provide an accurate rendering of the world they are understood to mimic, thus enabling them to function as proxy data sets.</p>
<p>While we recognize the legacy of such framings, in the following we want to shed some light on what might be termed a ‘geomorphologic aesthetic’, wherein knowledge of the emergence and transformation of landforms is attained via a multi-sensuous engagement with landscape, and the making sense of that experience. This creative mining of geomorphology’s back catalogue allows us to then to place the emergence, in recent years, of field-based, collaborative projects between artists and geomorphologists that, among other things, seek to: prompt the generation of ‘inspirational data’; ask questions relating to audience and communication; and offer productive re-visionings not only of fieldwork and practice, but also the nature of the objects geomorphologists are working with.</p>

<title>II Putting art in its place</title>
<p>In this section, we want to begin our exploration of the place of art by returning to the ‘Age of Wonder’ wherein ‘Romantic Science’, as Richard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0309133312457108">Holmes (2010</xref>: xvi) puts it, ‘grew out of eighteenth-century Enlightenment rationalism, but largely transformed it, by bringing a new imaginative intensity and excitement to scientific work’. Publics across Europe and the USA followed with trepidation the cosmic voyages of William and Caroline Herschel, the flights of balloonists, as well as the maritime expeditions of Captain Cook and Charles Darwin, each of which encountered peoples and places, objects and practices that provoked new ways of thinking about a dynamic world, how it might work, and our place within it; and which also, as Holmes makes clear, undercut any notion of an antithesis between various fields of knowledge, as well as between adventure and diplomacy, experiment and spectacle, lay and expert.</p>
<p>Weimar Germany was to provide a similar locus of Romantic-cum-Enlightenment activity around such figures as Goethe, Bach, Schiller and Herder, as well as Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859), broadly considered a ‘celebrated patriarch’, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309133312457108">Buttimer (2001</xref>) puts it, of the modern-day geographical sciences, and the ‘creator’, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309133312457108">Ackerknecht (1955</xref>), of geomorphology in particular. For historians of science, Humboldt has become a key figure in the exploration of ongoing tensions in this era around the aesthetic sensibilities of the field scientist, and the empirical rigour of the arts and humanities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0309133312457108">Dettelbach, 2001</xref>), tensions that were to foreshadow the humanist/spatial science debates of the 20th century. Nevertheless, any sense of a profound disjuncture between the humanities and the sciences would be misleading: in Weimar Germany an emerging collection of geological maps and atlases, for example, were to have a profound cultural impact not only upon German landscape art (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0309133312457108">Mitchell, 1993</xref>), but literature also, contributing to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0309133312457108">Piper (2010</xref>: 27) calls a ‘new sense of space and self according to the principles of stratification, discretization, and relationality’.</p>
<p>Humboldt’s object of analysis was the Earth’s surface, to which he applied a physiognomic<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0309133312457108">3</xref>
</sup> mode of study. That is, in taking landforms as his focus, Humboldt sought to interpret form and feature as the profound, sensible expression of a holism that not only extended to the insensible, but undergirded the universe itself. Hence, landforms were not signs to be read, as though they were but the inferior semblance of things more real, but part and parcel of this mutually dependent assemblage of people, animals, vegetation, microclimate, elevation and so on, all animated and kept in harmonious balance by these forces – forces that, for Humboldt, were not to be confused with a creationism.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0309133312457108">4</xref>
</sup> Indeed, the surface of the Earth, as an object of analysis for Humboldt, lent itself to being sensed by the cultivated, gentleman explorer, who not only had the intellect<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0309133312457108">5</xref>
</sup> to discern such a beautiful holism, but the financial wherewithal to be able to enhance his ‘gaze’ via a series of ‘apparatus’ such as magnetic compasses, thermometers, electrometers and so on, which allowed for the systematic and measured re-presentation of certain key aspects of the field.</p>
<p>It is this commitment to systematic study – translated into a series of diagrams that tabulated and cross-referenced various forces, thus enabling comparisons to be made and rudimentary forms of multivariate analysis to be conducted – that have earned Humboldt the moniker of the first ‘geovisualizer’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0309133312457108">Jackson and Romanowski, 2009</xref>). His projections of landscape are physiognomic silhouettes of rising plateaus and falling elevations, which expressed the character of people as well as place. His isothermal lines, curves of constant annual mean temperature mapped for both surface position and mountain elevation, expressed a harmonious balance of all forces. Certainly, such diagrams worked to a topological imaginary that carved space into lines, interiors, exteriors and so on. But, as Dettelbach points out, within Humboldt’s aesthetic, ‘sensibility and precise measurement cannot be separated’. This is because the latter is ‘embedded in a particular account of philosophical authority, the mind, its faculties, and their legitimate scope’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0309133312457108">Dettelbach, 1999</xref>: 477).</p>
<p>Humboldt’s sketches, undertaken in the field, were later polished by European artists in the form of dioramas of a landscape’s diverse organic and inorganic components. These would in turn inspire landscape painters such as Frederic Edwin Church, who produced the large-canvas oil painting ‘Heart of the Andes’ (1859). Exhibited in New York, the painting had a profound impact: ‘When confronted with its immensity, the crowd becomes hushed. Women feel faint’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0309133312457108">Poole, 1998</xref>: 107). Such methodologies were especially important to Humboldt insofar as they allowed certain sensuous encounters with the land to be perceived, digested, made sense of in light of this holistic reality, and communicated to others.</p>
<p>While admiring of Humboldt’s attempt at systematic and error-free surveying and measuring practices, as well as his far-flung substantive interests, historians of geomorphology have tended to look upon his holistic philosophy as an unfortunate imposition of cultural ideas peculiar to the epoch. Stoddart, for instance, writes disapprovingly that, ‘These works aimed to demonstrate the interconnections of phenomena and the continuity and completeness of knowledge, rather than to adduce principles or explore problems: hence Mackinder’s little-remembered remark that the <italic>Cosmos</italic> “helped to delay the advance of science”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0309133312457108">Stoddart, 1975</xref>: 17–18). The German public’s adoption of Humboldt’s universal harmony as a spiritual-cum-political belief no doubt exacerbated Mackinder’s sentiments. More recent commentators, however, writing on the complexities inherent to a history and philosophy of geomorphology, have been more forgiving, with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309133312457108">Buttimer (2001</xref>: 105), for example, observing that ‘there are aesthetic and experience-based facets of [Humboldt’s] overall vision which enable the work to transcend tensions between objectivity and subjectivity, macro-scale survey and micro-scale theatre, scientific explanation and artistic representation’.</p>
<p>Humboldt’s enrolment of art, as well as his desire for precise and systematic measurements of sensible phenomena, becomes, for Buttimer, folded into his overall aesthetic; that is, a particular mode of encounter with nature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0309133312457108">Bunske (1981</xref>) goes further, and observes that such an encounter was illustrative of what has been termed the sublime. At first blush, the sublime refers simply to the overwhelming sense of wonder and awe felt when regarding the vastness of nature, as evinced, for example, by the public’s response to Church’s ‘Heart of the Andes’. In this broad sense, it partakes of many centuries of philosophical thought regarding human-environment relations, as well as the influential treatise of Edmund <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0309133312457108">Burke (1756)</xref> in particular, in which he traces his physiological, as well as emotional, response to such grand vistas. Yet, and this is what we want to flesh out below, in acknowledging the importance of the aesthetic it is also possible to draw out, in the work of another ‘founding father’ of geomorphology, G.K. Gilbert, another rendering of the sublime, one associated with the work of philosopher and physical geography lecturer Immanuel Kant (1724–1804).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0309133312457108">
<title>III A sublime nature</title>
<p>For Kant, a key problematic recurring throughout his work was the question of how we come to know the world around us, and in doing so come to know ourselves. It is in this context that the sublime, and the related concept of the beautiful, becomes a way of framing this encounter. Both the beautiful and the sublime, Kant proposed in his <italic>Critique of Judgement</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0309133312457108">1790</xref>), should not be understood as the intrinsic qualities of objects, such as landforms; rather, they emerge from a person’s perceptual and cognitive ‘making sense’ of such objects, and a judgement of something as either beautiful or sublime. Whereas the former is manifest as a feeling of pleasure in the fact that one can discern a harmonious order to an object (and this certainly echoes Humboldt’s views on the pleasure felt in observing nature), the sublime emerges from the discernment of a boundlessness or formlessness (whether by virtue of scale or scope) to nature. But, and this is crucial, while phenomena such as volcanoes and earthquakes evoke a wonder and awe that suggests a physical powerlessness, and propose the apparent limits of imagination, nevertheless it is the uniquely human recognition of this limit that in turn evidences the superiority of understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0309133312457108">Rolston, 1995</xref>). The sublime, then, is much more than a particular appreciation for a ‘grand’ nature; it brings into play the intellectual response to such grandeur. It is an invitation to thought.</p>
<p>Here, we want to think through the role of such an aesthetic in G.K. Gilbert’s wondering engagement with the order of nature, manifest as a series of analytically framed questions concerning its development. Broadly considered one of the founding fathers of a modern-day geomorphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0309133312457108">Orme, 2002</xref>), or ‘onlie begetter’, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0309133312457108">Tinkler (1985</xref>) puts it, referencing Shakespeare, of a process-orientated, dynamic approach, Gilbert’s mode of inquiry is more usually described in positivist, methodological terms, as the ‘interplay of observation and deductive reasoning wherein data were accumulated within a robust and logical theoretical framework’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309133312457108">Chorley, 2000</xref>: 569).</p>
<p>Importantly for our argument, Gilbert’s artistic practices emerged out of an ‘expanded field’ that included geologic cross-sections, field sketches and photography, as well as the chromolithographics, woodcuts and so on that formed such a large part of the output of key knowledge-forming institutions such as the Smithsonian in Washington, DC (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0309133312457108">Nelson, 1980</xref>). Gilbert, trained in geology and mathematics as well as anatomy, was hired to assist on John Wesley Powell’s geographic and geologic survey of the Rocky Mountain Region, 1874–1879, producing ‘Geology of the Henry Mountains’ in 1877. With the establishment of the US Geological Survey in 1879 he was appointed Senior Geologist, and went on to publish his study of the (Pleistocene) Lake Bonneville in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0309133312457108">1890</xref>. Over the course of his career, Gilbert also speculated as to the manner in which meteor impacts shaped lunar landscapes, and in 1906 documented with camera and notes earthquake damage along the San Andreas fault-line.</p>
<p>We want to look in depth at his artistic practice in the two years (on and off) Gilbert spent in the Henry Mountains. Reading his published monograph, we gain a sense of how the ‘comprehensive views from the mountain tops’ (1877: vii) afforded Gilbert an overall, visual grasp of landform; this ‘field of surpassing interest’ (p. 2) is rendered as a pared and pinned-back specimen, opened up for observation not by the hands of an anatomist, but by physical processes of weathering and erosion. He wrote:
<disp-quote>
<p>The deep carving of the land, which renders it so inhospitable to the traveler and the settler, is to the geologist a dissection which lays bare the very anatomy of the rocks, and the dry climate which makes the region a naked desert, soilless and almost plantless, perfects the preparation for his examination. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0309133312457108">Gilbert, 1877</xref>: 2)</p>
</disp-quote> This was no mere record of slash and cut, however, opening all to the God-like gaze of the scientist, but the prelude to what B.M. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0309133312457108">Stafford (1993</xref>) calls a ‘finer touch’, that used the full complement of senses in an exploration of objects.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0309133312457108">6</xref>
</sup> This was a visual imagining that acknowledged and then disavowed grand surface impressions as open to myriad interpretations, and hence duplicities, and sought instead, via a series of more intimate encounters, signs telling of the work of primal forces. In the process, as she goes on to write, ‘a “hard”, prestigious method, deemed intellectually superior to the “soft”, loose, irregular, or geometrically shapeless material it was supposed to regularize, was imposed from on high and from the outside’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0309133312457108">Stafford, 1993</xref>: 466).</p>
<p>Gilbert’s attentiveness to how things look became part and parcel of this imagining. In delineating the Blue Gate and Tununk shales, for example, it is their perceived colour and banding that is deemed crucial to their categorization; thus, ‘They are beautifully laminated and are remarkably homogeneous. It is only in fresh escarpments that the lamination is seen, the weathered surface presenting a structureless clay’ (1877: 5). Such loose, amorphous, complex visual scenes prompt a feeling of uncertainty, and, in Gilbert’s imagining, are hence very much an invitation to thought. Following a description of the thickness of the individual strata in the Gray and Vermilion Cliffs, he observes:
<disp-quote>
<p>The thickness of individual strata in these great sandstones is remarkable, and is one of the elements which must be taken into account in the discussion of the problem – which to my mind is yet unresolved – of the manner in which such <italic>immense</italic> quantities of homogeneous sand were accumulated. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0309133312457108">Gilbert, 1877</xref>: 7)</p>
</disp-quote> More often than not, such visual acuity is supplemented by touch, so that, ‘The rock of the Flaming Gorge group’, for example:
<disp-quote>
<p>is of a peculiar character. It is ordinarily so soft that in its manner of weathering it appears to be a shale. It is eroded so much more rapidly than the Henry Fork’s conglomerate above it, that the latter is undermined, and always appears in the topography as the cap of a cliff. Nevertheless, it is not strictly speaking a shale. The chief product of its weathering is sand, and wherever it can be examined in its unweathered condition it is found to be a fine-grained sandstone. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0309133312457108">Gilbert, 1877</xref>: 8)</p>
</disp-quote> Gilbert’s field sketch of the Gray and Vermilion Cliffs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0309133312457108">Figure 1</xref>), which also takes in the Henry Fork conglomerate, emerges from this visual imagining of the encounter between body and land. That is, it systematically records and locates in visual terms the key sighted and felt aspects of these encounters, but is also a crucial means of ‘thinking through’ how these aspects, rendered legible to self and others, can become subject to explanation.</p>

If we compare this to the previous view of Waterpocket Canon, what we see are two very different registers of sketch existing side by side within Gilbert’s text. In the first, we see the use of field-sketching to render the landscape structurally intelligible, a form of topographic art that foregrounded an accuracy of delineation, while in the second sketch we see Gilbert practising a mode of working akin to view-painting, wherein the focus is on capturing the scene but to emphasize a subject-centred, aesthetic appreciation of it.</p>

</fig>
<p>During his time in the Henry Mountains Gilbert was to detail his observations and findings in the form of numerous notes and sketches, all woven together as he strove to make sense of how particular landforms had been shaped by underlying physical processes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0309133312457108">Hunt, 1988</xref>, for reprints of these).</p>
<p>Yet Gilbert’s notebooks have usually been described as evidencing a move from ‘faithful’ description to idealized hypothesis, the latter alone being deemed scientific in character (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0309133312457108">Egger and Carpi, 2008</xref>), or, more figuratively, as the move from seed to germinating plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0309133312457108">Pollard and Fletcher, 2005</xref>: 458).<sup>

</fig>
<p>Leaving to one side this framing of science as the delineation of cause-effect relations, what we can draw out of these notebook excerpts is the Kantian sublime. When faced with the complex landscape of this site, for example, Gilbert wrote in his notes, ‘I don’t understand Mt Hillers’ (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0309133312457108">Egger and Carpi, 2008</xref>: n.p.). In order to make sense of this formation Gilbert has recourse to a graphic representation of a key process – magma intrusion and subsequent uplift and erosion – thereby typifying, regularizing and shaping a Henry Mountain ‘structure’. To be sure, Gilbert’s artistry here can be described as providing a visualized mode of description and explanation, but what is also apparent is that its varied forms – scenic view, topographic sketch, diagrammatic cross-section, and so on – all speak to a multi-sensuous, and hence aesthetic, encounter with landscape, and a sustained reflection upon how this encounter is to be made sense of perceptually and cognitively.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is this sense of ‘progress’ from one mode of thinking and communicating (ostensibly descriptive) to another (scientific) that was to become dominant in accounts of the history of geomorphology. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0309133312457108">Sack (1992</xref>) observes, it was Gilbert’s emphasis upon process geomorphology, and particularly his attentiveness to a thermodynamically based method of systems analysis, that was to become lauded by a new cadre of quantitative analysts, such as Strahler and Hack, while historiographies by, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0309133312457108">Church (2010</xref>) have stressed Gilbert’s figurehead role in regard to general systems theory. Part and parcel of this ‘installation’, as Sack calls it, of a new paradigm was, we would add here, the delinking of aesthetics (that is, sensuous encounters and sense-making) from the art ‘object’. As we go on to discuss below, while such aesthetics were to remain a disciplinary stalwart, albeit unacknowledged as such in the form of fieldwork, the art work was to be pinned down and accounted for in thoroughly instrumental terms as a mimetic of real-world processes and events.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0309133312457108">
<title>IV Enhanced’ field encounters and art as mimetic</title>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0309133312457108">Sack (1992</xref>) observes, Gilbert’s installation came at the expense of W.M. Davis. In presenting his ‘geographical cycle’ of landform development as a matter of ‘structure, process, stage’, Davis, of course, borrowed directly from Darwin’s evolutionary framing of organisms and the transformation of species. Whereas Gilbert had deployed an anatomical imaginary that prioritized the intimate exploration of bodies via a ‘finer touch’, Davis’ biological borrowing was firmly grounded in the gaze and the surface appearance of formations. Hence, his field sketches were initially based on maps of an area so that Davis could gain a sense of extant form; these would be redrawn after a field visit, but very much in accordance with the stage in the cycle of erosion that Davis wanted to emphasize. In consequence, what we see in Davis’ famous block illustrations are very much ‘ideal types’.</p>
<p>A useful articulation of this form-based imaginary, and its manifestation in the field sketch, is provided by Woolridge who, in vehement defence of Davis, wrote:
<disp-quote>
<p>In the first place I regard it as quite fundamental that Geomorphology is primarily concerned with the interpretation of forms, not the study of processes. The latter can be left to Physical Geology. Here an analogy may be helpful. The fact of organic evolution was sufficiently demonstrated by comparative anatomy long before the details of its mechanism came to light … Similarly Davis proceeded essentially by recognizing a developmental series of forms. Sketch, or better still photograph, a large number of river meanders and you will readily convince yourself of the reality of downstream shift or ‘sweep’, as well as the stages leading to cut-off. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0309133312457108">Woolridge, 1958</xref>: 31)</p>
</disp-quote> Even here, however, we can see the emphasis upon the sketch as an accurate mimetic of real-world events and objects – such that it can be ‘bettered’ in this role by the photograph<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0309133312457108">8</xref>
</sup> – as opposed to a thinking through of a multi-sensuous encounter with nature. To be sure, these encounters remain today a crucial part of the much-vaunted field trip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0309133312457108">Ritter, 1986</xref>), but are now rigidly systematized as the technologically enhanced, error-free measurement and recording of variables. Such encounters, in effect, allow for the production of <italic>data, </italic>which, because it has been methodologically and technologically mediated, is not to be confused with mere sensed phenomena. If we compare such a methodology with that of Humboldt, precision has by now become firmly sundered from the aesthetic sensibilities of the European gentleman.</p>
<p>Contemporaneously, the instrumentalization of art as a now separate, reified sphere of practice reached its apogee in the emergence of a body of work that seeks to use paintings, sketches and other artistic media as data proxies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0309133312457108">Gemtou, 2011</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0309133312457108">9</xref>
</sup> For Grove, an early pioneer of this approach, while oral narratives were ‘not to be taken at face value’, the detail provided on paintings of the Mt Blanc massif ‘is so accurate that full dependence may be placed on them as a source of evidence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0309133312457108">Grove, 1966</xref>: 135). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0309133312457108">Gellatly (1985</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0309133312457108">Schubert (1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0309133312457108">1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0309133312457108">1987</xref>) have situated paintings and photographs as part of a suite of sources to reconstruct past glacier positions in Mt Cook National Park and the Sierra Nevada de Mérida, respectively. In similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0309133312457108">Parham (2005</xref>) looks to Chinese art for evidence of type of local bedrock, the intensity of rock weathering, and the status of soil erosion, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0309133312457108">Hejl (2005</xref>) notes tafoni weathering in a Greek prehistoric wall painting.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0309133312457108">Cosgrove’s (1979)</xref> analysis of the aesthetics of Ruskin draws out, in some contexts the faithful representation of nature in all its colour and morphology is a matter of artistic principle. What is problematic, however, in such geomorphic analyses is the disavowal of the context within which art-making occurs, including but not limited to: the intentions of the artists and their existential and metaphysical concerns; the sociocultural environments within which they work; changing stylistic modes, such as the introduction of the picturesque; and the symbolic deployment of a colour and brush palette. Analyses that look to art to accurately represent nature (or not), we would emphasize, both draw upon and reinforce a more general, scientific understanding of visual culture as principally mimetic. Also, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0309133312457108">Rhoads and Thorn (1996b</xref>) note, this mimeticism is itself predicated upon a logical empiricism, wherein a fundamental gap is posited between an apparently objective observation that picks out real-world truths, and a subjective theorization that must then work in accord with these truths.</p>

<sec id="section5-0309133312457108">
<title>V The return of the aesthetic?</title>
<p>Over the past two decades we can discern an intermittent call for a return to more ‘direct’ encounters with nature as a source of intellectual inspiration, but also the productive channelling of an all-too-human curiosity. In 1981, for example, Stoddart appealed, in rather more appreciative vein, to the inspirational nature of landforms, as evidenced in the work of Humboldt. He writes:
<disp-quote>
<p>We take pleasure in an aesthetic and even emotional appreciation of the landscapes we perceive and project our imaginations on to them. Often we think this to be a modern development, though Humboldt treated it at length in the <italic>Cosmos</italic>. And it leads to the sense of wonder which we all must feel, on the coral reef, in the redwood forests, in high mountains or the desert, and indeed in Los Angeles or Calcutta, Istanbul or Peking, in the realization not only of Earth’s diversity but of man’s [sic] ingenuity in coping with it in the process of making a living … Let us not allow an arid formalism to replace the true attraction of geography, either at the elementary or the research level. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0309133312457108">Stoddart, 1981</xref>: 296)</p>
</disp-quote> Ten years later, Baker and Twidale made a similarly nostalgic call for a return to the ‘Golden Age’ of geomorphology, wherein Gilbert, Powell and their contemporaries were inspired intellectually and emotionally by the grand landscapes of the American West. They write: ‘Explanatory paradoxes posed by the newly reported landforms and landscapes stimulated creative thinking that expanded and improved explanations for already familiar landscapes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0309133312457108">Baker and Twidale, 1991</xref>: 74). Here, the invitation to thought proffered by complex landscapes is contrasted with a predictive, systems approach, which, they argue, relies upon methodological innovation and which, they imply, is hence lacking in wonder and excitement. For our own part, we discern here an interest in what may be termed the ‘affective capacity’ of landscape, a capacity that takes us back to the sublime as a viscerally felt invitation to thought. Such calls are usefully understood, we would like to suggest, as a return of the aesthetic, which, as we have argued throughout this paper, derives its impetus from a consideration of body/world encounters.</p>
<p>Yet, it must be stressed, given its broad-based remit, the aesthetic cannot be matched with a particular theoretical orientation or substantive domain. Indeed, we can find iterations of the aesthetic in biology, physics and chemistry, as well as art and the humanities. In other words, there is no one ‘hook’ upon which to hang an aesthetic framing; rather, there is a wealth of aesthetic modes of inquiry that can be brought to bear. Underscoring this particular geomorphological appeal to more direct encounters is, we would suggest, a broader reflection upon visual culture as an embodied (as opposed to an intellectual or cerebral) practice that brings the hands, eyes, sensory apparatus, nerve endings, neurons and so on into play. In the language of mimeticism noted above, ‘re-presentation’ as a term implies an inferior copy, or sign regarding something else, and it is precisely this language that we see being challenged, often via recourse to a prior Humboldtian or Gilbertian tradition. Where <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0309133312457108">Baker and Twidale (1991</xref>) look to the productive, sensuous engagement of body and land, Tooth looks to the affective capacity of the ‘virtual globe’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0309133312457108">2006</xref>) and the satellite image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0309133312457108">2009</xref>). Each of these also engage the sublime, which, as we hope the example of the <italic>Heart of the Andes</italic> used earlier indicates, is by no means ‘contained’ in the field. It can very much be discerned in such spectacles: their status and import in this regard lies in their singular capacity to affect people.</p>
<p>Part and parcel of this challenge is a renewed, disciplinary interest in art, a body of thought and practice that, manifest via its own modes of expression, has a long and complex aesthetic tradition. In recent years, however, we are also witness to collaborative practices in the field, as well as associated works produced by artists for diverse publics, from school children to gallery audiences. A pivotal point for such collaborations tends to be particular landscapes (some extreme, others considered mundane) that are considered complex in the sense that they prompt uncertainty over and against surety, as well as an acknowledgement of how this uncertainty has been narrativized in diverse ways across the disciplines.</p>
<p>The term ‘inspirational’, as used in the collaborative work of glacial geomorphologist Peter Knight and visual artist Miriam Burke, for example, denotes how their mutual collaboration has led them to explore how it is that they ‘notice’ and understand landscape differently, and, further, how this recognition prompts them to reconsider the nature of what was once overly familiar. Based in explorations of the local landscapes of North Staffordshire and its history during the last Ice Age, the project, developed over the course of three years, saw methodological exchange in both the cold lab and the field (with Burke visiting Iceland), culminating in the exhibition ‘Know this Place for the First Time’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0309133312457108">10</xref>
</sup> Included in this exhibition was Burke’s ‘Measuring Spoon’, a sculptural reflection on the ad hoc use Knight makes of a teaspoon for scale in his photographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0309133312457108">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Beyond these reflections on scientific method, both Burke and Knight see artistic practices, and particularly the arts’ traditional emphasis upon measuring the individual over and against a sublime Nature<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0309133312457108">11</xref>
</sup> as a means to take account of the inherent uncertainty in science. Indeed, in a comment thoroughly reminiscent of the Kantian Sublime, and the tension at its heart between the comprehensible and incomprehensible, Knight writes:
<disp-quote>
<p>Despite progress in remote sensing and analytical techniques, our reconstructions of past glaciations remain tentative, our understanding of modern glacial processes incomplete and our modelling of their future unreliable. In nineteenth century art, glaciers represented romance, mystery and unassailable majesty. In twenty-first century science their position is perhaps similar, but what art calls ‘mystery’, science calls ‘uncertainty’. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0309133312457108">Knight, 2004</xref>: 385)</p>
</disp-quote> Questions around risk and prediction are, for Knight, thoroughly emotive ones, insofar as they excite feelings of wonder and awe.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0309133312457108">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Risk and uncertainty have also underscored the collaborative work of vulcanologist Carina Fearnley and designer/performer Nelly Ben Hayoun. Key to their project ‘The Other Volcano’ is a desire to communicate the viscerality of living with volcanic landscapes, and in particular how wonder, excitement, fear and trepidation can be usefully harnessed as a means of prompting more sustained reflection upon how the risks associated with volcanoes are to be communicated.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0309133312457108">13</xref>
</sup> The project takes the form of what the artist describes as ‘semi-domesticated volcanoes’, each capable of ‘randomly’ erupting dust and gloop (from a combination of gunpowders, potassium nitrate and sugar), and housed in galleries – including the Welcome Trust, London (October–December 2010) and the Central Booking Gallery, New York (April–June 2011) – and the living spaces of volunteers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0309133312457108">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>It is while ‘waiting’ for the eruption, which sometimes does not happen, that observers are presented with the complexity of natural disasters, as well as the challenges faced by those who predict natural hazards. As with Burke and Knight’s work on glaciers, ‘The Other Volcano’ highlights the potential for art to move beyond the sense of accurately conveying scientific information, to communicate the ambiguities and hesitancies of Earth science, as well as its explanatory frameworks and ameliorative advances.</p>
<p>These ideas about risk and public communication, especially in relation to uncertain futures, are drawn together in a number of recent collaborations with artists and archaeologists undertaken by fluvial geomorphologist Mark Macklin. As part of an ongoing research project to examine the intersections between river dynamics and the archaeological record on the Teleorman River, a lower catchment of the Danube, Macklin has worked with artist Judy Macklin to gather data on recent changes in the landscape – thereby adding to a multi-sourced ‘thick description’ of the site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0309133312457108">Macklin et al., 2011</xref>) – as well as to raise public awareness of the longer-term evolution of the river landscape and the likely impacts of climate change. Intersecting this work with the European Union-funded project ‘Art-Landscape Transformation’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0309133312457108">Macklin and Macklin (2011</xref>) developed a programme of creative activities with local residents, including a four-day workshop with 30 pupils and their teachers at a school in the valley. Here, using aerial photographs and river walks, and the making of sketches and large-scale earth-art-style sculptures using natural and found materials, the children were encouraged to get to know and to model the river landscape within the scale of their lifetime, as well as that of their parents, grandparents and beyond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0309133312457108">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<p>The collaborative ventures outlined here – and more are appearing each year – very much resonate with the appeals for context by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0309133312457108">Harrison (1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0309133312457108">2001</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0309133312457108">Rhoads (1999</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0309133312457108">Spedding (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0309133312457108">1999</xref>), appeals that query the ontic character of landforms as well as their epistemic framing. It is no small matter that these calls are sometimes wrapped in an appreciation for earlier geomorphic inquiries that have an avowed commitment to the aesthetic. Harrison’s (2001) quantum-based arguments regarding the importance of emergent features and forms, for example, contains a persuasive call for an attentiveness to the diverse, sensible attributes of landforms, wherein:
<disp-quote>
<p>Earlier writers on the nature of landscape and the scientific study of scenery, perhaps freer of the constraints imposed upon them by issues of process or time, appeared to identify with the emergent structures of landscape. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0309133312457108">Marr (1900</xref>: 2) suggested that, ‘in viewing any scene, the attributes which strike us specially are size, form, character of surface, colour and movement…’ and reductionists argue that these are the subjective elements of a land-scape since the only objective variables are the elementary ones. The question can then be asked: what does this attitude say about our ontological and epistemological treatment of such emergent characteristics, especially since these elements are those which constitute the necessary (to human geomorphologists) parts of landscape?

</disp-quote> In similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0309133312457108">Rhoads (2006</xref>: 17) makes a strong argument for the dissolution of a subjective-objective divide, insofar as ‘human experience is as real as the existence of elementary particles and that experiences such as aesthetic appreciation, purposiveness, valuation, feeling, and harmony have equal ontological status to the entities of physical science’. Such a holistic effort is consistent with ‘the great traditions of Humboldt and Ritter, both of whom were interested in the interconnections among the physical, biotic, and human features on the face of the earth’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0309133312457108">Rhoads, 1999</xref>: 767).</p>
<p>Yet, while we note that the aesthetic very much resonates with such contextual concerns, it is also important to emphasize once more that there are many forms that such inquiry can take. Whereas Humboldt, as we outlined earlier, looked to a holistic universe of harmonious forces, and Gilbert developed his ‘finer touch’ as a means of illuminating the process-based nature of landforms, the current collaborative projects we describe are not so easily categorized. In large part this is because they are not predicated upon ‘bridging’ disciplinary, conceptual or methodological divides, nor is difference subsumed, such that one becomes a mere resource for the other. Instead, these collaborations appear, we want to suggest, to work to a post-Science Wars zeitgeist, wherein various aesthetic impulses and traditions are brought together and valued precisely because of their differential character.<sup>

</sup> Geomorphologists do not become artists, or vice versa; rather, the aesthetics generated by each serve to render the familiar unfamiliar. In the process an awareness of other narratives, other modes of research, other concerns and other publics certainly emerges, and, we would argue, this awareness is crucial if geomorphologists and physical geographers more broadly wish to intervene in what are heavily politicized, multi-sited debates on issues such as climate change, biodiversity, environmental degradation and so on. This, for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0309133312457108">Graf (1996</xref>), would be evidence of a ‘maturing’, outward-orientated subfield. As recent events in the USA, and increasingly in the UK, have made clear, physical geographers can no longer rest assured that their data is received as objective.</p>
<p>But also, perhaps, in their willingness to creatively juxtapose fact and fiction, realism and idealism and so on, we can gain glimpses of how such collaborations can produce novel narratives that no longer ‘fit’ the established spaces of the journal and the gallery, the field site and the studio. Such efforts resonate with a burgeoning art-science movement that eschews the modern-day, institutional compartmentalization that distances the arts, as a subcomponent of the humanities, from the natural sciences, and looks instead to how these revolve within a shared history characterized as much by negotiation, mutual learning, and symbiosis as by the search for fundamental difference.<sup>

<title>VI A post-human geomorphology?</title>
<p>By way of conclusion, we want to offer some thoughts – by no means didactic – on how such collaborative ventures may proceed. To begin, we would note that the artists so far engaging with geomorphologists, whatever their medium of choice or genre, tend to work to a humanist rendering of the sublime. This is by no means unusual in the art world, insofar as Kant’s emphasis upon the play of the imagination and understanding has generally been taken as an argument on the human power of reason over and against a meaningless, agency-less nature. In human geography also, Kantian aesthetics have tended to be understood as celebrating a ‘human-mind-social’ nexus over and against a ‘non-human-body-nature’ one; indeed, this framing has characterized all manner of debates on the human-environment relationship.</p>
<p>Yet it is possible to articulate a ‘post’-human aesthetic that incorporates those corporeal bodies – animal, vegetative and bacterial – that are non-human. Here, aesthetic inquiry picks up on other sense-made worlds, giving them body and consequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0309133312457108">Dixon, 2010</xref>). This post-human aesthetic can be extended further, moreover, into a reconsideration of the ‘agency’ of nature, not as a bundle of forces, materials and events awaiting human perception and analysis, but as existing in and for itself. As Clark writes, this is a nature that does not lend itself to the human condition, but to a thoroughly impersonal cosmos:
<disp-quote>
<p>[It] bears the trace of an ‘infinity’ that is palpably not of this world, one that is extra-terrestrial in a material rather than an ethereal or otherworldly sense: an exorbitance that no form of reciprocity, no contract, no economy on this spherical planet or anywhere else will ever square up. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0309133312457108">Clark, 2010</xref>: 8)</p>
</disp-quote> This seems at first sight, to be at odds with a geomorphological tradition that, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0309133312457108">Graf (1996</xref>) points out, has emphasized its role within geography more broadly as an unravelling of ‘human-environment’ relationships; to paraphrase W.M. Davis, this is an outrageous concept that, perhaps, disrupts the ‘rooting’ of more comfortable ones (1926: 465–466). Yet what is of import here is how the ‘human’ has itself come under query from a number of quarters, including physics, chemistry and biology as well as the humanities and arts, and found in many cases to be wanting. To quote from Davis’ provocative essay on the role of the outrageous in rendering the familiar unfamiliar:
<disp-quote>
<p>The very foundation of our science is only an inference; for the whole of it rests on the unprovable assumption that, all through the inferred lapse of time which the inferred performance of inferred geological processes involves, they have been going on in a manner consistent with the laws of nature as we know them now. We seldom realize the magnitude of that assumption. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309133312457108">Davis, 1926</xref>: 465–466)</p>

<p>We share this perspective with both historians of art and historians of science who refuse to accord a privileged status to ‘art’ objects, thereby opening up the field of study such that visual practices and products of science are set alongside artistic practices and aesthetic concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309133312457108">Alpers, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0309133312457108">Cook, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0309133312457108">Crary, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0309133312457108">Jones and Galison, 1997</xref>).</p>

<p>Physiognomy, usually dismissed as a scientific dead-end, or read as a precursor to biological racism, is most famously associated with the work of Casper Johann Lavater who sought to illuminate how the fundamental character, or ‘mental powers’, of the human being could be read from a simplified sketch or even profile of the face. Eschewing the mobility of expression (or pathognomy) as ephemeral and confusing, Lavater looked to the more truthful signs of the face in repose, often placing his subjects in a specially adapted chair to draw their silhouettes. This, he wrote, ‘arrests attention by fixing it on the exterior contours alone, it simplifies the observation which becomes by that more easy and accurate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0309133312457108">Lavater, 1789</xref>: 176–178).</p>

<p>As such, Humboldt’s work is in contrast with the ‘artistic geology’ of his contemporary John Ruskin, who sought in his landscape paintings to present Christian scripture with scientific precision via preparatory field sketches and map reading. Ruskin was also fascinated with landforms, and looked to the erosional processes that reduced mountains to ruinous architectures, which in turn worked spiritually upon their local populations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0309133312457108">Ruskin, 1856</xref>).</p>

<p>For Humboldt, a political democrat, intellect was a matter of learning and refinement, not biology. Hence, ‘T[t]here are nations more susceptible of cultivation, more highly civilized, more ennobled by mental cultivation than others – but none in themselves nobler than others. All are in like degree designed for freedom’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0309133312457108">Humboldt, 1849</xref>: 368). Nevertheless, his emphasis upon the sensibility and discernment of the gentleman explorer, as well as the need for large-scale, nature-based studies, had a profound impact upon what has been termed ‘empire science’.</p>

<p>Gilbert was to use similar rhetoric in describing the depth of features on the moon’s surface as ‘gigantic furrows’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0309133312457108">1893</xref>: 279) and ‘boldest carving’ (p. 278). Here, however, the finer touch could not yet be brought to bear.</p>

<p>Thank you to Bruce Rhoads for pointing out that Woolridge’s comments on the ‘betterment’ of mimetic representation in photographs resonates with the work of photographic landscape artist and ‘monkey wrench’ author Edward Abbey, wherein the image captures a stark reality, but also a transcendent, sublime encounter. It is worth noting that Abbey is also, of course, famous for advocating a thoroughly visceral encounter with landscape, such that you ‘walk, better yet crawl, on hands and knees, over the sandstone and through the thornbush and cactus. When traces of blood begin to mark your trail you’ll see something’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309133312457108">Abbey, 1968</xref>: 97).</p>

<p>Art as mimetic is also manifest in analyses of the intense optical phenomena following volcanic eruptions, being used to provide proxy information on aerosol optical depth. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0309133312457108">Zerefos et al. (2007</xref>), for example, reconstruct past aerosol optical depth, before, during and after major volcanic eruptions, by studying the coloration of the atmosphere in 500 paintings that depicted sunsets between 1500 and 1900. They note that the artists under study ‘appear to have simulated the colors of nature with a remarkably precise coloration’, and conclude that their study provides a ‘basis for more research that can be done on environmental information content in art paintings’ (p. 4033).</p>

<p>For Burke, reflection on this lineage is crucial to her practice: she writes: ‘When Caspar David Friedrich painted <italic>The Polar Sea </italic>(1823–24), he inspired a sense of awe and the sublime in his viewers, yet where does this wonder reside now that we can pull up images of the fabled and elusive North West Passage on Google maps? I start with the premise that uncertainty in science could also be described as what we do not know. As mystery. It is left to our imagination to fill the gaps where technology holds no answers, it blurs the boundaries of fiction and reality’ (from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.miriamburke.co.uk/about.php">http://www.miriamburke.co.uk/about.php</ext-link>).</p>

<p>A similar engagement with the poetics of nature and scientific knowledge can be seen in the work of artist Joanna Berger and geomorphologist Uwe Dornbusch, undertaken as part of the European Union’s ‘Beaches at Risk’ Project (2003–2009). The focus of Berger’s work, ‘Series 130–141’, was the artificial pebbles used to assess coastal erosion. Cast in tinted resin, and with a copper core designed to be easily visible and datable with a metal detector, Berger wrapped lines of love poetry around the cores of a batch of 11 and then placed them on one of the French study beaches.

<p>The distinctions drawn between scientific and artistic endeavours have a long, historical trajectory, punctuated by a series of debates on the relative merits of each (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0309133312457108">Arnold, 1882</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0309133312457108">Huxley, 1880</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0309133312457108">Leavis, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0309133312457108">Snow, 1956</xref>). Here, the apparent consensus regarding the impermeability of their categorical boundaries has two origins: first, the scientific revolution of the Renaissance, predicated in large part upon the rise of Copernican cosmology, empiricism and the systematic development of modern mathematics, physics, biology and chemistry; and, second, its gradual institutionalization in the faculties of the modern university, which in the 19th century culminated in the ‘segregation of the European educational system … between classical studies and scientific and technical training’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0309133312457108">Blair and Grafton, 1992</xref>: 535).</p>
