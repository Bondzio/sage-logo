<abstract>
<p>Ronald Hughes and his colleagues have written a groundbreaking article on child welfare’s use of differential response. Their research addresses the matter from a “lessons learned” and “ways to improve” approach. Our comments focused on three key issues: (1) the importance of evidence-based practice; (2) the recognition that no one practice modality can be a cure-all for child protection; and (3) the necessity of better quality training for child welfare professionals. We believe the value of this article goes beyond theoretical and ideological discussion, but should be used to promote and support research-informed knowledge in policy and practice.</p>

<p>Ronald <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049731513478843">Hughes, Rycus, Saunders-Adams, Hughes, and Hughes (2013</xref>) have written a seminal article that earnestly calls into question the child welfare field’s adherence to differential response. It may be the most important article in the child welfare arena in the past 15 years. Their article should be widely read, its lessons absorbed, and its message translated into policy and practice. In this commentary, we focus on three of their major concerns. First, in an era of evidence-based practice, why has a program with so little empirical support been so widely and aggressively utilized by the nation’s child welfare systems? Second, what is it about child welfare that leads those of us in the field to see each new program as a panacea, capable of solving all the problems presented by our most difficult endeavor—protecting children from parental abuse and neglect? Finally, we believe the Hughes’ article once again illustrates the need for enhanced training of frontline workers and their supervisors as well as improved decision making if child safety is to be in practice, as it is in law, our paramount concern.</p>
<sec id="section1-1049731513478843">
<title>Why a Program With So Little Support?</title>
<p>As Hughes and his colleagues demonstrate so poignantly, there is little objective empirical evidence supporting the efficacy of differential response as a child protection program or policy. What support does exist in the literature is deeply flawed methodologically and riddled with bias. In some instances, what has been presented as empirical research is, but thinly veiled advocacy. But advocacy for what? As demonstrated, it is not clear what differential response is. Reading the summaries of the various research studies in Appendix A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049731513478843">Hughes, Rycus, Saunders-Adams, Hughes, &amp; Hughes, 2013</xref>), one must ask how a program with so little empirical support gained such favor—at least 35 states utilize some form of differential response—in this era of evidence-based practice.</p>
<p>One answer is such programs are politically popular. They speak to the concerns of civil libertarians on both the political left, who see much of child welfare as unwarranted attacks on the poor, minorities, and otherwise disadvantaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049731513478843">Guggenheim, 2005</xref>), and the political right, who often for religious reasons promote a “hands off” approach to family life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049731513478843">Bartholet, 1999</xref>). Although they have different motivations, these disparate groups arrive at many of the same conclusions in their views of public child welfare work—as an intrusion by the government into the protected sphere of family life and the displacement of parent’s rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049731513478843">Bartholet, 1999</xref>). Similarly, fiscal conservatives like these programs because they limit the financial burden of programs that are largely aimed at the nation’s impoverished families. Political coalitions of the right and left built around child welfare policy are not new (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049731513478843">Gelles, 1996</xref>). Indeed, more than a decade ago, Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049731513478843">Bartholet (1999</xref>, p. 44) explicitly raised the question whether this coalition of the politically liberal and the politically conservative constitutes “an unholy alliance.” It was precisely this “unholy alliance” that partnered together to enact the first differential response legislation in Missouri in 1994 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049731513478843">Waldfogel, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Joining this coalition in support of differential response are powerful, politically connected private foundations that have promoted it well beyond what the research supports. In a system as resource starved as our public child welfare system, the influx of large amounts of private money can be irresistible. By way of analogy, just as money from big oil companies and political pressure have had a distorting effect on the scientific research relating to global warming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731513478843">Union of Concerned Scientists, 2004</xref>), foundation funding can distort research designs, findings, and assertions about the efficacy of programming in the field of child welfare.</p>
<sec id="section2-1049731513478843">
<title>Nothing New</title>
<p>None of this should surprise us. Child welfare has passed this way before. More than 30 years ago, in the wake of Congress’s passage of the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, and its establishment of the “reasonable efforts” requirement in federal child welfare law, states rapidly adopted family preservation programs. These programs quickly spread across the child welfare landscape and the mind-set became not that “reasonable efforts” were necessary but that “every conceivable effort” was required to maintain and/or reunify families. Like differential response, family preservation programs were utilized far beyond what research and reason would suggest was appropriate. As a result, many children were seriously harmed (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049731513478843"><italic>DeShanney v Winnebago County Dept. of Social Services</italic>, 1989</xref>) and many died (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049731513478843">Bartholet, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049731513478843">Gelles, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049731513478843">Ramsey &amp; Abrams, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>It was the distortion of the “reasonable efforts” requirement by political leaders, federal and state policy makers, and practitioners that spurred Congress to clarify its intentions regarding the protection of children—general and with regard to the “reasonable efforts” requirement specifically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049731513478843">Vandervort, 2010</xref>). It did so through the enactment of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (P.L 105-89), which expressed Congress’s intent that children’s safety be the paramount consideration in all child welfare programming.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Congress’s intent is being distorted by public officials who are charged with the implementation of ASFA’s requirements. Once again, to the detriment of children, we see an “overreliance” on preserving families and a reluctance to intervene/interfere with family life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049731513478843">Myers, 2011</xref>, p. 11). Differential response is one element in this distortion. One must ask why child welfare history is repeating itself in this way.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1049731513478843">
<title>A Deep Ambivalence</title>
<p>Historically, a child was considered the property of the parents, particularly fathers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049731513478843">Mason, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049731513478843">McLaughlin, 1988</xref>). In biblical times, parents had both the right and the duty to put disobedient children to death (Deuteronomy 21:18–21, n.d.). Thus, the near absolute power of parent over child is deeply rooted in the dominant culture’s Judo-Christian sensibilities. In the second quarter of the 1800s, the law began to evolve in the direction of allowing public authorities to intervene in family life in order to address the needs of children whose parents were unwilling or incapable of meeting those needs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049731513478843">Ex Parte Crause, 1839</xref>). Slowly over the last two centuries, our courts have worked out a delicate balance between parent, child, and state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049731513478843">Ramsey &amp; Abrams, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049731513478843">Stein, 2006</xref>). Thus, parents have broad discretion in raising their children as well as a constitutional right to their care and custody, and to control their upbringing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049731513478843">Troxel v Granville, 2000</xref>). Yet, the state retains “an urgent interest” in the welfare of its children and it may protect that interest through legal action when appropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049731513478843"><italic>Lassiter v Department of Social Services of Durham County</italic>, 1981</xref>, p. 27). We no longer think of children as property. However, our cultural history, as reflected by law, has left us with a deep ambivalence about the state stepping into protect children from parentally inflicted harm.</p>
<p>That ambivalence is reflected in the very foundation on which differential response is erected. As Hughes and colleagues remind us, differential response was initially justified largely through the vilification of those who would act aggressively to protect children from parentally inflicted harm. In the differential response literature, child protective services (CPS) workers are described as “coercive,” “intrusive,” basically disrespectful of families and hostile to parents’ rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049731513478843">Waldfogel, 1998</xref>). It is important to remember that the vast majority of families who come to the attention of CPS are quite dysfunctional. Many are overtly pathological and either unable or unwilling to make the changes necessary to provide for their children’s physical and emotional safety and/or to provide a minimal level of responsible care to their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049731513478843">Jones, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049731513478843">Rosenberg, 2009</xref>). Obviously, one primary problem is that CPS cannot know which families will fall into this category until it has conducted an investigation. So, one of Hughes and colleagues more disturbing findings is that differential response programs are reluctant to actually investigate whether a child has been abused or neglected. As the authors point out, absent such an investigation, children’s safety cannot be assured. As currently implemented, differential response systems seem to fail—or at the very least we cannot be confident it actually accomplishes—the primary rationale for and central mission of CPS: keeping children safe from parentally inflicted abuse and neglect.</p>
<p>As the field did with family preservation in the 1980s and early 1990s, it appears that differential response has been applied far beyond what is supported by the empirical data. Therefore, it is important we collectively examine this phenomenon in child welfare.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049731513478843">
<title>The Search for a Panacea</title>
<p>Child protection agencies routinely deal with the most challenging and complex families in our communities. Given CPS’s difficult and sometimes inconsistent mission of simultaneously investigating suspected child maltreatment as well as keeping families together, one would expect it to have a vast array of programs for parents, children, and families. The unfortunate reality is CPS has few tools with which to assess and manage the families it encounters. As a result, there is a sense that each new program is a panacea.</p>
<p>This mind-set ultimately damaged family preservation in the years leading up to the enactment of the Adoption and Safe Families Act. It is not that family preservation programs were ineffective or inappropriate. Those programs were very likely the right program for some families. The problem was we prescribed its use for families whom never should have been considered for family preservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049731513478843">Gelles, 1996</xref>). As Hughes and colleagues demonstrated though their review of the literature and interviews of key informants, the same has become true with differential response. Gelles’ remarks on family preservation programs in the 1990s could as easily be applied to the current findings concerning differential response: “Well-run family preservation programs still place children in harm’s way because such programs have an unrealistic belief in their own effectiveness—an unrealistic belief that has been fed and continues to be fed by the over marketing of family preservation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049731513478843">Gelles, 1996</xref>, p. 142).</p>
<p>What is clear is that policy makers and program managers have embraced differential response beyond its demonstrated capacity to keep children safe and aide families in providing adequate care. Children are routinely placed at unnecessary risk because we fail to learn or utilize lessons from our history on child welfare. If we are truly to make children’s safety our primary consideration, it is essential we stop viewing every new programmatic development as the solution to every child welfare problem. Rather, as we develop innovations, we must study them closely and honestly, and must proceed cautiously in applying them. One size cannot fit all. An approach similar to the medical model in which new drugs are rigorously tested before they are widely prescribed would be wise. And as with drugs, we must recognize that every program is not a magic pill to be used as a cure-all.</p>
<p>While policy makers and program directors want to see each new program as capable of meeting the needs of every family, the workers on the frontlines have inadequate experience, insufficient supervision, and lack assessment resources to adequately match children and families with the programs most tailored to addressing their identified needs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049731513478843">
<title>The Need for Training and Support</title>
<p>High turnover rate among frontline child welfare professionals has been a focus of attention for years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049731513478843">DePanfilis &amp; Zlotnik, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049731513478843">Liederman, 2003</xref>). The Children’s Bureau has recognized the importance of an experienced workforce in ensuring children’s safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049731513478843">Salus, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049731513478843">Thomas, 2012</xref>). But it has called turnover “a major concern in many child welfare agencies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049731513478843">Children’s Bureau, n.d.</xref>). Unfortunately, one result of high turnover is that child welfare professionals with the least amount of experience receive the most difficult of cases. They lack the experience and training necessary to identify risk factors, differentiate severity of cases, distinguish their own biases, and make objective assessments of the children and families they are assigned, and are often left feeling overwhelmed and unappreciated.</p>
<p>Closely associated with the inadequate training received by frontline workers is the high turnover rate on the part of first line supervisors. This again ensures that the professionals with the maximum responsibility for the families have the minimum experience. What Gelles said nearly 20 years ago continues to be true today: “If the current child welfare system is to be improved it will require three things: (1) training, (2) training, and (3) training” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049731513478843">Gelles, 1996</xref>, p. 158). While there have been efforts to improve training over the past two decades, there is still much work to be done (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049731513478843">Mitchell et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>As practitioners who work at or near the frontline, we have discerned no meaningful change over time in the impact that training is having on decision making by frontline child welfare staff. Accordingly, even though there is some indication that child maltreatment rates are declining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049731513478843">Finkelhor &amp; Jones, 2006</xref>), child death from maltreatment remains problematic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049731513478843">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2011</xref>). As alleged by the media and numerous lawsuits against CPS, one contributing factor is that frontline child welfare staff continue to lack the seasoning, training, and supervision to make the decisions necessary for the reasonable safety and well-being of children by their families.</p>
<p>As the Hughes article makes clear, the field attempted to address these concerns by broadly adopting a variety of screening instruments in an effort to systematically assess risk, and eliminate bias and prejudice in decision making. Yet, these screening instruments are far from foolproof. They assume a certain level of knowledge about family functioning, the skill to assess complex family situations, and an ability to exercise considerable judgment. While these tools may be helpful, they are insufficient to the task of carefully evaluating the children and families that CPS interacts with daily, and ultimately contribute to a lack of rigorous assessment.</p>
<p>No one discipline owns the problem of child protection, and no one discipline can singlehandedly hope to meet the multifaceted needs of the children and families assigned to America’s CPS agencies. For this reason, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049731513478843">Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (2012)</xref> has long supported the use of multidisciplinary teams “to enhance investigation” of child abuse and neglect cases. In response to the federal law, a number of states have established a requirement for multidisciplinary teams in their child protection laws (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049731513478843">California Welfare &amp; Institutions Code, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049731513478843">Michigan Compiled Laws Annotated, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049731513478843">Virginia Code Annotated, 2012</xref>). These teams hold real promise for getting better educated, more seasoned, and more resourceful professionals involved in child welfare decision making. Yet, while many states’ laws provide for these teams, none we are aware of has actually put into place practices and procedures to use them systematically to aid CPS fulfill its crucial mission. They exist only on paper.</p>

<sec id="section6-1049731513478843">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Hughes and his colleagues have done the child welfare field a great service by bringing to light the many and substantial problems in the current differential response program. The field should study their results closely and ask hard questions about the future of the program. While we must resist the urge to abandon its use all together, it is clear that the empirical foundation supporting differential response is, at best, shaky. Policy makers and child welfare staff on the frontlines should impose a moratorium on its use until the program is better defined and its utility is rigorously and honestly studied. Failure to do so runs too high a risk of violating the fundamental commitment of child welfare practice: keeping children safe.</p>
