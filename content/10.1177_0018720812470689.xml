<title>Objective:</title>
<p>Our objective is to provide thumb reach envelopes to help guide the placement of controls on handheld devices and to provide useful methods to gather and analyze thumb reach data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0018720812470689">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>With the proliferation of handheld, interactive devices, such as cameras, mobile phones, game systems, and remote controls, human factors professionals involved in designing these products need data to help guide the placement of controls.

<title>Results:</title>
<p>We present two-dimensional thumb reach envelopes on the primary control surface for handheld devices.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In a collaborative effort between industrial design and human factors professionals, we set out to design a pocket video camera intended to be held with one hand and operated primarily by the user’s thumb. The camera shape was to be rectangular, to use hardware buttons as opposed to a touch screen (software buttons), and to be held in the palm of the hand so that the vertically oriented device was positioned with the long axis of the device nearly perpendicular to the fingers. This design enables the fingers to grasp the device while permitting a considerable amount of interaction to occur with the thumb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018720812470689">Figure 1</xref>). Such a form factor is common in consumer electronic devices, such as cellular telephones, pocket video cameras, MP3 players, and other handheld devices.</p>

<p>To ensure a comfortable reach by users who vary in size, we hoped to rely on existing anthropometric data to help guide placement of the controls. We conducted an extensive literature review and found more than 50 sources containing anthropometric data for the hand and fingers (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720812470689">Blackwell et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018720812470689">Buchholz &amp; Armstrong, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018720812470689">Garrett, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018720812470689">Gilbert, Hahn, Gilmore, &amp; Schurman, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018720812470689">Gordon, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720812470689">Greiner, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018720812470689">Webb Associates, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018720812470689">White, 1980</xref>). Our marketing organization had previously identified three specific target user populations for our design: adolescent females, adult females, and adult males. The adults were specified further as parents of young children and all three groups as North American. We found many anthropometric studies focused on adult males and adult females, but only <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018720812470689">Snyder et al. (1977)</xref> addressed the adolescent population.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, all but a few of the sources that we found presented only <italic>static</italic> or <italic>structural</italic> anthropometric measures between anatomical landmarks with the hand in a rigid, unnatural posture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018720812470689">Pheasant, 1986</xref>). There are a number of sources of <italic>dynamic</italic> or <italic>functional</italic> anthropometry representing larger-scale reach envelopes that take into account the recruitment of multiple joints and limb segments for the entire arm or leg (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018720812470689">Eastman Kodak Company, 1986</xref>). Although these whole-limb reach envelopes are useful when designing workstations or cockpits, they are of little help when designing smaller, handheld devices.</p>
<p>Our review of the literature turned up only a few studies related to the dynamic or functional anthropometry of thumb reach. The relatively limited data related to thumb reach surprised us, given the indisputable prevalence of handheld electronic devices that are primarily operated with the thumb. The increased use of such devices has resulted in ergonomic problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018720812470689">Smith, Carayon, &amp; Cohen, 2003</xref>), including tendonitis from overuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720812470689">Brasington, 1990</xref>). Despite these issues, we found very few standards or guidelines for the design of devices that rely on thumb input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018720812470689">Zingale, Ahlstrom, &amp; Kudrick, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018720812470689">Gilbert et al. (1988)</xref> collected data on 105 participants in an effort to determine the optimal placement of thumb-operated buttons for a large handheld instructional device. They measured the maximum angular displacement and reach of the thumb on a control surface. The results helped them establish a set of design guidelines for angular placement of the thumb and an acceptable range of movement. Gilbert et al. studied thumb movements on a much larger device (30.72 cm × 17.92 cm × 7.68 cm) compared with the device we were designing for one-handed use. As a result, grip posture is dramatically different and their data had limited relevance to our design challenges. In another study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018720812470689">Zhang, Braido, Lee, Hefner, and Redden (2005)</xref> collected data for three-dimensional thumb range of motion. Zhang et al. instructed participants to keep their two distal joints (metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal) of their thumbs straight and stiff during their dynamic mapping of the range of motion. This method makes their results of little relevance to most handheld products, whereby users bend the thumb joints to grip and operate the device.</p>
<p>A few recent studies have attempted to define two-dimensional thumb reach envelopes and preferred control locations on the primary control surface of handheld devices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018720812470689">Im, Cho, Park, Jung, &amp; Park, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018720812470689">Karlson, Benderson, &amp; Contreras-Vidal, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720812470689">Kim &amp; Jung, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018720812470689">Karlson and colleagues (2006)</xref> tracked the trajectory of the thumb as participants (all right-handed) made movements between discrete touch targets on handheld devices of various sizes. In general, participants made faster movements between pairs of targets that required movements along a northeast-southwest line (in compass terminology) and slower movements between targets requiring movements along a northwest-southeast line. These differences in movement speed correlated with participants’ ratings of movement ease and difficulty in that the faster movements were also considered easier to accomplish.</p>
<p>In both the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018720812470689">Im et al. (2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720812470689">Kim and Jung (2010)</xref> studies, the number of participants was relatively small, 15 and 21, respectively, and both represent an adult, almost entirely male, Korean population. They based location preferences on predefined target regions and subsequent user-specified discomfort ratings rather than a more conventional definition of a reach envelope. Although discomfort is an interesting variable to plot, it is more useful for product designers to know what percentage of the user population will be accommodated comfortably by certain design decisions.</p>
<p>The results of all these studies certainly have utility in terms of providing some basic guidelines for design. However, as we began the development of a pocket-size video camera intended for one-hand operation (primarily with the thumb), we found insufficient data for our target demographic groups to guide our design. Therefore, we conducted our own study for collecting data to guide the placement of controls. To do so, we employed two methods. First, we used a version of the “Mr. Potato Head” method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018720812470689">Green, Paelke, &amp; Boreczky, 1992</xref>) to obtain participants’ preferred locations for primary controls. Second, to determine a direct and natural, two-dimensional thumb reach envelope, we used a handheld touch screen and a paint application to record the complete area reachable by each participant’s thumb.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 90 participants (35 adolescent females, 35 young mothers, 20 young fathers) from southern Maryland area took part in the study. All of the participants had taken a least 50 pictures and two videos in the past year (using any type of camera, including cameras built into cell phones). The adolescent females were required to be 14 to 19 years old, to provide signed parental consent, and to have one of their parents accompany them to the study. The young mothers and young fathers were required to be 25 to 43 years old and to have at least one child younger than 18 years living at home. The participants had a mean age in years of 16 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.3; range = 14 to 18) in the adolescent female group, 33 (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.1; range = 25 to 39) in the young mother group, and 34 (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.8; range = 26 to 39) in the young father group. We recorded, but did not screen for, dominant hand and found that 30 of the 35 adolescent females, 34 of the 35 young mothers, and 19 of the 20 young fathers were right-handed.</p>

<title>Control location (Mr. Potato Head)</title>
<p>We used a physical model that approximated the dimensions and weight of the video camera that we were designing and associated magnetic control representations to examine the participants’ preferred locations for primary controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018720812470689">Figure 2</xref>). The functions of the controls included record and navigation (typically integrated into a single square control with four-way directional surround plus a concentric center Record button), a control to review pictures and/or videos previously taken, and a control to delete pictures and/or videos previously taken. Participants selected among various types and sizes of controls. Depending on their selections, participants placed either three or four magnetic controls on the model. The user preference data for control type and size are not presented in this article.</p>

<title>Thumb reach envelope</title>
<p>A handheld touch-screen device (iPod Touch, second generation; Apple, Inc., Cupertino, CA) encased in a custom removable housing to simulate the intended overall dimensions of a vertically oriented video camera served as the input device for capturing the thumb reach envelope data. On the back of the iPod Touch, a small square was attached to simulate the approximate location of the intended camera lens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0018720812470689">Figure 3</xref>). A painting application, Sketchbook Mobile (Autodesk, Inc., San Rafael, CA) ran on the device to record the thumb reach envelopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0018720812470689">Figure 4</xref>). The program was set to use the maximum fixed-width brush size (approximately 6.36 mm in width).</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>After arrival, the participant received a brief overview of the study, signed a consent form, and completed a demographic questionnaire. The experimenter measured several anthropometric hand dimensions (e.g., hand width, thumb length) of the participant’s dominant hand using a ruler and caliper. The participant was then escorted to the Mr. Potato Head station and was presented with the camera model and magnetized parts representing the primary controls that would be found on a typical video camera. The participants were told that they would have the opportunity to “design” their own cameras, emphasizing the idea that they should design cameras for themselves and not consider the preferences of others. For most types of controls, the participant was given a choice of a few sizes and was asked to place the control on the camera model in his or her preferred location. All the controls were restricted to the lower portion of the side that faced the participant (the same side as the simulated display). The experimenter later used digital calipers to measure from the model’s bottom and right edges to the center of each control that the participant had placed.</p>
<p>At the next station, the participant received the handheld touch-screen device with the drawing application running. The participant was instructed to hold the touch-screen device as if to capture a video recording (as with either a vertically oriented video camera or a cell phone), “securely but comfortably,” with the dominant hand. The experimenter then asked the participant to swipe his or her thumb across the screen, shading any area that he or she could reach comfortably. It was also stated that when the participant had a secure and comfortable grip, he or she was not to shift or change hand position in an effort to reach more of the screen. The participant completed this task twice, and we saved the file related to each effort for later analysis (each file was treated as a distinct data point).</p>

<title>Basic Hand Anthropometry</title>
<p>A one-way ANOVA for hand length showed a significant difference between demographic groups, <italic>F</italic>(2, 87) = 45.7, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Post hoc tests indicated that the hand length of young fathers was significantly larger (<italic>M</italic> = 192 mm, <italic>SD</italic> = 7.1 mm) than the hand length of the young mothers (<italic>M</italic> = 174 mm, <italic>SD</italic> = 7.1 mm), and the hand length of the young mothers was significantly larger than the hand length of adolescent females (<italic>M</italic> = 167 mm, <italic>SD</italic> = 12 mm). A one-way ANOVA for thumb length also indicated a significant difference between demographic groups, <italic>F</italic>(2, 87) = 45.7, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Post hoc tests indicated that the thumb length of young fathers was larger (<italic>M</italic> = 72.8 mm, <italic>SD</italic> = 17 mm) than that of both young mothers (<italic>M</italic> = 60.6 mm, <italic>SD</italic> = 5.3 mm) and adolescent females (<italic>M</italic> = 56.1 mm, <italic>SD</italic> = 6.4 mm), whereas adult and adolescent females showed no significant difference.

<title>Thumb Reach Envelope</title>
<p>As described in the Method section, participants were asked to use a modified touch screen to swipe their thumbs across the screen, filling in the area that they could reach comfortably. Using these data, two analyses were conducted in an effort to understand the extent of the thumb reach envelope. In the first analysis, we measured the farthest distance the participants could reach with their thumbs. This analysis provided a single, simple dimension (the maximum reachable distance from the bottom-right corner) that could be compared between demographic groups. Overall, maximum thumb reach distance was significantly, but weakly, correlated with thumb length, <italic>r</italic>(88) = .26, <italic>p</italic> = .015, indicating that maximum thumb reach distance is generally greater for people with longer thumbs. A one-way ANOVA was conducted to examine differences between the demographic groups regarding maximum thumb reach. The results indicated a significant difference between the groups, <italic>F</italic>(2, 84) = 7.27, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Post hoc tests revealed that young mothers (<italic>M</italic> = 51.8 mm, <italic>SD</italic> = 7.1 mm) had a significantly smaller maximum thumb reach value than did both adolescent females (<italic>M</italic> = 58.9 mm, <italic>SD</italic> = 11.7 mm) and young fathers (<italic>M</italic> = 61.4 mm, <italic>SD</italic> = 9.7 mm), whereas adolescent females and young fathers showed no significant difference.</p>
<p>The second analysis was conducted to expand from a single dimension to a two-dimensional representation of the reach envelopes that would be expected to serve as a more useful tool for determining the optimal location for controls on a handheld, thumb-controlled device. Analysis of the thumb reach envelopes involved setting up a grid of 100 cells (5 cells wide and 20 cells tall; each cell 10.2 mm wide and 3.80 mm tall) and superimposing this grid over each participant’s thumb swipe, covering the entire touch screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0018720812470689">Figure 5</xref>). If the participant’s swipe covered at least half of a cell (on the basis of the visual judgment of the experimenter), that cell was included in the individual participant’s reach envelope. Both of the participant trials were included in the analysis, although 1 trial for 1 participant was removed because of file corruption, leaving a total of 179 trials. We calculated the percentage of participant trials in each group that reached each cell in the grid and plotted reach envelopes for the separate groups as well as for all the participants combined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0018720812470689">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<p>The analysis of the heat maps showed that there was no area that all participants could reach comfortably. An area between 45.6 mm and 49.4 mm from the bottom and between 25.4 mm and 35.5 mm from the right was reached by more than 90% of participants, and an area between 34.2 mm and 56.1 mm from the bottom and 15.2 mm and 45.6 mm from the right was reached by at least 70% of the participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0018720812470689">Figure 6</xref>). Visual inspection of the heat maps revealed different shapes to the maps for each of the demographic groups, with the adolescent females displaying an approximately circular shape (equal size vertically and horizontally), the young fathers displaying an elliptical shape (larger horizontally than vertically), and the young mothers somewhere in between. The young mothers also showed the smallest reach envelope, with areas in the upper portion of the device, particularly, the upper-left corner, unreachable by all of the young mothers participants, whereas the adolescent females had the largest reach envelope.</p>
<p>Quantifying these differences, adolescent females showed a concentrated area between about 30.8 mm and 43.2 mm from the bottom and between 15.2 mm and 35.2 mm from the right that more than 90% could reach. Young mothers had no area that 90% or more could reach but had a concentrated area between about 34.2 mm and 57.0 mm from the bottom and between 15.2 mm and 45.6 mm from the right that more than 80% could reach. Finally, young fathers had only a very small area (one cell) that 90% could reach and an area between about 41.8 mm and 60.8 mm from the bottom and between 15.2 mm and 45.6 mm from the right that more than 80% of the participants could reach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0018720812470689">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<title>Preferred Control Locations Compared With Reach Envelopes</title>

Generally, all three demographic groups placed the controls vertically relatively close to the location that the heat maps predict, although the adolescent females were slightly above the “sweet spot.” All three groups also generally placed the controls horizontally (from the right edge of the device) close to where the heat maps predict. Comparing the mean location, the young fathers placed the controls in the smallest cluster, whereas adolescent females separated the controls from one another more. Finally, the locations for the young mothers seemed to suggest that they might prefer the controls more closely aligned to the central vertical axis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We gathered thumb reach data for the primary control surface of a device intended for one-handed grip and for control primarily by the thumb. There was no location on the control surface that 100% of the study participants could reach with their thumb when gripping the device as intended. The lightest areas in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0018720812470689">Figure 6</xref> represent the portions of the control surface that at least 80% of participants reached. This area included an ellipse with its major axis oriented approximately tangential to the long axis of the right thumb in its natural posture when gripping such a device for use. The ellipse covered an area from approximately 15 mm to 46 mm from the right edge and 34 mm to 57 mm from the bottom.</p>
<p>The elliptical shape of our two-dimensional thumb reach envelope and its orientation with the long axis running northeast-southwest seems to fit well with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018720812470689">Karlson et al. (2006)</xref>, in which they found movements along this axis to be perceived as easier and measurably faster. From a physiological perspective, such movements map closely to abduction and adduction (movement of the thumb toward and away from the palm). Movements in the orthogonal direction (northwest-southeast) would rely on compound movements of retropulsion (lifting of the thumb), flexion, and extension (bending and straightening), requiring coordinated movements involving multiple joints. Additional biomechanical properties of the thumb and hand, such as differences in inertia in different directions of motion, may also contribute to the shape of the reach envelope, as has been shown in arm-reaching experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018720812470689">Ghez, Gordon, Ghilardi, &amp; Sainburg, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>When participants placed controls onto a model of such a handheld device in the Mr. Potato Head task, they placed the primary control (Record button in the context of this video camera) slightly above the optimal zone predicted by the reach envelope plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0018720812470689">Figure 7</xref>). This result could be attributable to the need to place multiple controls on the device in the Mr. Potato Head study in a more limited space. For this reason, users may have experienced the need to compromise on location to achieve a reasonable spacing between pairs of controls.</p>
<p>There are considerable differences between the iso-discomfort plots of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018720812470689">Im et al. (2010)</xref> and our reach envelope data in both the shape and location of the recommended area for optimum control placement. The Im et al. data suggest that the users can most comfortably reach an area that is lower and farther to the left on the control surface than our data would indicate. Such differences in results between these two studies can be attributable to a number of factors, including, for example, the thickness of the device (15.5 mm in our study and unspecified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018720812470689">Im et al., 2010</xref>), the nature of the task (rating of discomfort vs. comfortable reach), and differences in demographic groups studied. Most importantly, however, is the difference in the method of analyzing and presenting the results. The Im et al. study combines results from one-handed and two-handed use into a single contour plot of iso-discomfort. We believe that this combination of data may lead to the more circular (less elliptical) and more centered position of the primary thumb reach area in the Im et al. study.</p>
<p>In comparing our results to those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720812470689">Kim and Jung (2010)</xref>, it is difficult to understand why their computationally derived reach envelopes, although similar in elliptical shape, are oriented such that the long axis of the ellipse runs northwest-southeast, almost opposite to ours. They do not specify which hand participants used to grip the test device in their study, but since they plot their results with an origin in the lower left, it is conceivable that their data represent only left-handed operation.</p>
<p>We see a weak, but significant, correlation in our data between thumb length and maximum thumb reach. This evidence conflicts with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720812470689">Kim and Jung’s (2010)</xref> conclusion that hand size does not affect thumb reach. Our data also suggest that age is a factor in thumb reach. This finding is in conflict with the conclusion of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018720812470689">Gilbert et al. (1988)</xref>. It is clear from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0018720812470689">Figure 6</xref> that the thumb reach envelopes for our three demographic groups (adolescent females, young mothers, and young fathers) have different shapes and sizes. For example, the thumb reach plots for the adolescent females reveal a more circular shape than those of the young mothers or young fathers. The adolescent females also appear to have a generally larger reach envelope compared with either of the adult groups. This finding seems counterintuitive, given that the young fathers generally had longer thumbs than did the adolescent females.</p>
<p>A possible explanation is that participants in the younger group used a looser grip. Although we instructed all participants to hold the touch-screen device “securely but comfortably,” we speculate that younger users may tend to grip handheld electronic devices more casually and loosely. This looser grip could be attributable to either lower concern for dropping the device or greater confidence in their grip because they have more experience using such devices. Older users may be more inclined to grip such electronic devices more securely and thus further limit their ability to reach with the thumb. Note that the method of using a touch-screen device for collecting data on reach envelopes has the advantage of closely simulating the nuances of grip performance associated with handling such electronic devices that would not be accounted for by more traditional anthropometric study methods.</p>
<p>Another possible explanation for the larger reach envelope of the adolescent female group is greater joint flexibility. Although finger dexterity decreases with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018720812470689">Mathiowetz, Weber, Kashman, &amp; Volland, 1985</xref>), we assume that such age-related restrictions in joint flexibility would not be a significant impediment to the use of handheld devices for the adult age range covered in our study (25- to 43-year-olds). Although we did not collect such background information, we believe it is likely that participants in our adolescent female group had more prior experience using handheld devices that are primarily operated with the thumbs, such as phones, game controllers, and remote controls. Additional experience may contribute to a looser grip as mentioned earlier or possibly to greater joint flexibility.</p>
<p>We believe that the thumb reach envelopes reported here are the first of their kind and are likely to be useful to others engaged in the design of devices intended to be held in one hand and operated primarily with the thumb, such as cell phones, video cameras, music players, and navigation devices. However, we recognize that designers of such devices cannot rely on these thumb reach envelopes alone to guide control placement but will need to consider various design constraints and other data sources to converge on specific design recommendations. We also recognize that selecting small targets on a touch screen often requires more precise targeting (i.e., using the tip of the thumb) than the style of reaching used in this study. When pressing hardware buttons, people typically use the larger pad area of the thumb. Therefore, the results of this study may have some limitations in terms of the design for touch-screen products. Additionally, the participants’ task required them to interact with the device only for a short time (about 2 min), so we cannot project how reach envelopes might vary from the impacts of sustained thumb tension and flexion in longer-duration tasks.</p>
<p>These data were collected for a specific project: the design of a handheld video camera with hardware buttons. Certainly other projects with different design constraints may prevent the application of the data that we have presented here. For example, another device may differ considerably from the device in this study in terms of its thickness, width, weight, intended grip posture, and so on. Additionally, modifying the participant’s task (e.g., using only the tip of the thumb to indicate reach, increasing the task duration) could help to further define the reach envelope for devices different from that used here. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018720812470689">Pheasant (1986)</xref> points out, “Dynamic data are generally obtained in special purpose studies which often include factors which render the data inapplicable outside the original area of concern” (p. 135). In such situations when the data themselves are not applicable, we hope that designers will find valuable the methods that we have presented here for gathering and analyzing thumb reach envelope data.</p>
