<p><italic>Internet and Surveillance: The Challenges of Web 2.0 and Social Media</italic> is the latest contribution to the Routledge Studies in Science, Technology and Society and is supported by COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology). It provides a comprehensive critique of the impact of social media and their potential for a variety of surveillance opportunities. The wide range of contributors, including Christian Fuchs, Mark Andrejevic, Daniel Trottier and David Lyon, Anders Albrechtslund, Thomas Mathiesen and Rolf H. Weber, ensures that this excellent book offers much food for thought for students of Web 2.0 surveillance.</p>
<p>As these names suggest, <italic>Internet and Surveillance</italic> offers a wide range of views on the impact of surveillance opportunities available via Web 2.0 technologies and social media platforms such as Facebook and YouTube. In the Preface to the book, Mathiesen sets the scene for the following chapters by emphasizing the contrasts between previous, pre-internet surveillance operations that were carried out by the state and were generally perceptible, and the newer forms of surveillance enabled by the internet and Web 2.0 that are ‘hidden, unseen, and impossible to trace’ (p. xix). This theme continues into the Introduction by the editors, who place the working of Web 2.0 at the centre of a web woven by ‘the collection, storage, usage and analysis of a huge amount of personal data’ (p. 5). <italic>Internet and Surveillance</italic> has been structured to walk the reader through the various theories that may be applied to any consideration of the development of social media platforms.</p>
<p>Part 1 of the book comprises a number of in-depth examinations of the fundamental theories of surveillance on the internet and social media, with chapters devoted to the political and economic advantages of Web 2.0 surveillance for commercial enterprises. It features strong chapters on the central role played by surveillance in the capital accumulation process in social media (Fuchs); user exploitation and users’ dependence upon private commercial companies to finance the digital communication infrastructure (Andrejevic); and the ‘Key features of social media surveillance’ (Trottier and Lyon). It also includes a chapter on the lack of contextualization in internet surveillance, due to it being performed automatically by computer programs as opposed to humans, and thus incapable of storing information within relevant contexts. This chapter neatly leads on to a critique of ‘Internet surveillance studies and economic surveillance’ (Allmer), which analyses surveillance in the production, circulation and consumption of goods and calls for the founding of critical privacy movements on the internet in order to challenge the power of commercialization of the Web, and to increase a critical awareness of surveillance.</p>
<p>Even though such topics are subject to continual research, Part 1 offers an enlightening introduction and a strong foundation for the selection of case studies featured in Part 2. The thread that ties together the chapters in Part 1 – power – is also woven through the various chapters that comprise the second part of the book, ensuring that <italic>Internet and Surveillance</italic> makes an excellent starting point for postgraduate students in the field.</p>
<p>The case studies in Part 2 include a report on content analysis performed on the terms of use and privacy statements of commercial Web 2.0 platforms (Sandoval). The issue of power is considered in greater depth in Arditi’s examination of the ways in which surveillance was conducted and power exerted by the major music industry companies in order to criminalize the behaviour of internet users of peer-to-peer (p2p) file-sharing programs such as Napster. While Arditi fully acknowledges the role of commercialism in the criminalization of free p2p file-sharing, this is not the case in Albrechtslund’s consideration of ‘Location sharing and online social networking’. Albrechtslund argues that Web 2.0 users may enjoy participatory surveillance and may be empowered by the ability to publicize their location, but he does not address the commercial imperative behind this form of surveillance and the commercial incentive for them to do so.</p>
<p>Szekely details his research into the views on surveillance of information technology (IT) professionals as part of a project to compare and contrast the opinion values and attitudes of IT workers and those who commission privacy systems in Hungary and the Netherlands. While such research fits naturally into the scope of <italic>Internet and Surveillance</italic>, this chapter seems somewhat out of place, sandwiched as it is between Albrechtslund’s chapter and that of Christensen and Jansson. The latter provide a strong critique of theories relating to ‘Fields, territories, and bridges: networked communities and mediated surveillance in transnational social space’, but offer less detailed information about their empirical research into global connectivity in relation to transnational migrants of Turkish/Kurdish origin who were living in Sweden, and a Scandinavian expatriate community in Managua, Nicaragua. In a strong chapter entitled ‘When transparency isn’t transparency’, Wayland, Armengol and Johnson compare the issue of transparency in online information exchange to a ‘house of mirrors’ (p. 239). Following their research into the implication of a Californian law that compels the online publication of the identities of political campaign donors, they argue that the aim to introduce transparency into the political donation system instead results in the distortion of donor information and makes them and their beliefs far more visible than anticipated.</p>
<p>In the chapter ‘Privacy, surveillance and self-disclosure in the social web’, Monica Taddicken presents the results of her focus group research on how the surveillance potential on Web 2.0 platforms influences users. She concludes that many private individuals are ignorant about the potential misuse of their personal information, and need to be educated about online privacy. The direction of Part 2 then switches from the personal to the legal system as Rolf H. Weber, in ‘How does privacy change in the age of the internet?’, highlights the dichotomy between the competing requirements for personal privacy and free access to information. Weber considers the weaknesses of existing legal frameworks in the protection of individual rights and the links between privacy and security. He also looks at privacy-enhancing technologies and at how human rights legislation may be applied to protect individual privacy.</p>
<p>As Boersma notes in his summation, <italic>Internet and Surveillance</italic> offers both dystopian and utopian considerations of the internet, social media and Web 2.0. While internet surveillance is just one category of internet studies, its consequences may be extensive. As the thread of power is woven through each chapter, the book highlights the need for greater public awareness of the issues of power and surveillance on the internet, and for ‘an informed scepticism about surveillance’ (Boersma, p. 305). As well as making a substantial contribution to research in the field, this book should also amplify debate on internet surveillance, a debate that is far from complete.</p>
