<abstract>
<p><bold>Objective</bold>: This study examined whether involvement in a pre-surgical cardiac rehabilitation programme conferred a long-term survival benefit.</p>
<p><bold>Design</bold>: Patients randomly allocated to a pre-surgical cardiac rehabilitation programme intervention or a control group were tracked through national databases at a point approximately 12 years later, and all causes of mortality were identified from death records. Kaplan–Meier survival analyses based on involvement in a cardiac rehabilitation programme and known pre-surgical risk factors were carried out.</p>
<p><bold>Setting</bold>: Two health boards in the west of Scotland, referring to a single cardiothoracic tertiary centre.</p>
<p><bold>Subjects</bold>: Patients admitted to the waiting list for coronary artery bypass surgery.</p>
<p><bold>Interventions</bold>: Patients were randomly allocated to a control group (‘usual’ care) or an intervention group (nurse-led cardiac rehabilitation) in the pre-operative phase. They were followed up at 12 years post surgery.</p>
<p><bold>Main measures</bold>: The only outcome measure used for analysis was survival. Measures of anxiety and depression, and physiological and lifestyle risk factors were included as independent variables in analysis of death.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: The initial study included 110 patients – none were lost to follow-up. Relative risk of death associated with inclusion in the cardiac rehabilitation programme was 0.814; risk of death increased with increasing pre-surgical depression (RR 1.07) and anxiety (RR 1.09).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions</bold>: Undertaking pre-surgical cardiac rehabilitation confers a long-term survival advantage over patients not offered this service. Increased anxiety and depression in the pre-surgical phase are additional risk factors for increased mortality.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This study reports on 12-year follow-up of patients who were randomized to a cardiac rehabilitation programme whilst waiting for coronary artery bypass grafting. The control group received ‘usual care’.</p>
<p>Although lifestyle risk factors for coronary heart disease are well recognized,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215511429161">1</xref></sup> there is also increasing evidence for the role played by psychosocial factors, including socioeconomic deprivation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215511429161">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511429161">3</xref></sup> social isolation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511429161">4</xref></sup> and depression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511429161">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511429161"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511429161">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting should be offered cardiac rehabilitation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511429161">7</xref></sup> Reviews of cardiac rehabilitation studies have demonstrated short-term beneficial effects on quality of life, physiological markers and adverse incidents (such as myocardial infarction or death).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511429161">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215511429161"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511429161"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511429161">11</xref></sup> Longer term benefit through comprehensive follow-up has not yet been demonstrated, and there is evidence that patients fail to continue with the rehabilitation measures once their initial recovery stage has passed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511429161">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511429161">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 1997 ethical approval was granted by the appropriate NHS Research Ethics Committee to carry out a randomized controlled trial of a nurse-led shared care programme based on a low-contact cardiac rehabilitation model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511429161">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511429161">15</xref></sup> of monthly face-to-face contact with a nurse, and additional telephone contact as desired, offering motivational counselling to support lifestyle change, aimed at modifying known risk factors for individuals awaiting coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The monthly nursing contact alternated between a cardiac nurse specialist and a primary care nurse linked to their doctor’s surgery. The group who were randomized to the control arm received ‘usual’ preoperative care. At the time of the study, time on the pre-surgical waiting list was approximately 10 months. The initial study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511429161">14</xref></sup> demonstrated improvements in risk factors, particularly anxiety and depression, for those patients undergoing rehabilitation. In 2010 approval was gained for a follow-up study to examine the effects of risk factors and pre-surgical cardiac rehabilitation on long-term survival.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Between 1997 and 1998 patients awaiting coronary artery bypass surgery from two health board regions in the west of Scotland were recruited into a randomized controlled trial. The only initial exclusion criterion was living far from the study centre (approximately more than 30 miles (48 km) travel distance). During the initial recruitment phase 149 consecutive patients added to the pre-surgical waiting list were randomized to a control arm or an intervention arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215511429161">Figure 1</xref>). Following initial randomization 122 patients gave consent for inclusion in the study, although a further 12 were lost to the study before initial data gathering (either because of rapid deterioration in health, or because they elected to have their surgery undertaken privately).</p>

<p>All Scottish patients are allocated a unique identifier number, their Community Health Index (CHI) number. NHS Scotland Practitioner Services maintains a database of all patients registered with a general practitioner, and stores medical records after the patient’s death. Using the patient’s CHI number all 110 patients who were initially enrolled into the study were followed up on an intention-to-treat basis at a fixed census date in January 2010. All patients were located in the Practitioner Services database, survival status was confirmed, and date of death ascertained. Date and cause of death were then cross-referenced with death records held by the General Register Office for Scotland (GROS). There was no patient contact, with all follow-up being carried out through record linkage.</p>
<p>Well-being (measured by the SF-36 well-being scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511429161">16</xref></sup>) and anxiety and depression scores derived from the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215511429161">17</xref></sup> were available on 85 of the patients, and lifestyle data (including smoking history and alcohol consumption at the beginning of the study) were available on 89 patients. Individual risk factors were analysed to examine any relationship with mortality using Kaplan–Meier survival analysis. The pooled relative risk was calculated using log rank statistics of annual observed deaths – expected deaths and their variance.</p>

<p>None of the physiological or lifestyle risk factors (including comorbidities, family history of heart disease, serum lipids, body mass and waist circumference, blood pressure, daily exercise) for cardiac disease identified at first entry to the study were found to be significantly associated with survival when individually assessed using Fisher’s exact two-tailed chi-square test. Although there was a clear linear trend between all-cause mortality and smoking status (never smoked; ex-smoker; current smoker), chi-square test for trend did not show a statistically significant relationship (chi-square for trend is 2.22, <italic>P</italic> = 0.14). Mortality showed a relationship with alcohol consumption that conformed to the previously documented<sup>19</sup> J-shaped curve – moderate alcohol consumption (between one and seven units per week) having a relative risk of 0.83 compared to abstinence, while a grouped intake of eight units or more carried a relative risk of death of 1.34, and alcohol consumption in excess of 21 units per week had a relative risk of 2.75 when compared to baseline (abstinence). Numbers were too small to show statistical significance.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study followed up patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery 12 years after they had been entered in a randomized control trial where the intervention arm involved monthly therapeutic contact with a nurse using a rehabilitation model of care; the control arm receiving ‘usual care’. The follow-up study used survival as the outcome measures. Analysis of outcomes at initial recruitment (where outcome measures were changes in physiological parameters, and well-being as measured by SF-36 or Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) showed improvements in many of these measures at the time of surgery for the intervention group. The benefit of the intervention was further magnified as the control group deteriorated on these measures over the same period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511429161">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>At 12-year follow-up there was a residual benefit from the intervention, although the sample size was not sufficiently large to demonstrate statistical significance.</p>
<p>The relationship between survival and smoking is both well documented<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511429161">12</xref></sup> and expected, while the relationship with psychological well-being, although previously observed elsewhere, is less fully documented in the literature.</p>
<p>Our outcomes can be compared with a number of international studies, and support those studies where anxiety and depression have previously been shown to be related to adverse cardiac events and cardiac-related deaths. However, compared to other published studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511429161">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511429161">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511429161">20</xref></sup> a higher proportion (31.8%) of our study sample suffered moderate or severe depression, and had higher same-stage mortality rates,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511429161">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215511429161"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215511429161"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215511429161"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215511429161">24</xref></sup> although follow-up time for these studies was only between two and five years. Ten-year survival in the control/‘usual care’ group was the same as another Scottish study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215511429161">25</xref></sup> at 33% (<italic>n</italic> = 20), whereas those in the intervention arm showed a survival advantage, with seven (14%) deaths.</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that cardiac rehabilitation can offer a long-term survival benefit, particularly when it focuses on improving anxiety and depression as a key outcome measure.</p>
