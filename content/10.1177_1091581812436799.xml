<p>Dear Readers! Happy New Year! I think that it is well worth a page in issue 1 to summarize the milestones of 2011. First, our number of submissions continues to soar. Regular manuscript submissions nearly reached the 400 mark, with additional submissions for the Cosmetic Ingredient Review supplements. Second, while my sincerest thanks to my Editorial Board are always on the tip of my tongue, I must also acknowledge the efforts of nearly 150 ad hoc reviewers, in assisting us in doing our due diligence to give authors constructive feedback on their submissions. Thank you! I’m also proud to report that the impact factor for <italic>International Journal of Toxicology</italic> (<italic>IJT</italic>) has risen to 1.762, a 40% increase over last year. Further, according to our publisher, Sage, in 2010, there were 31 625 full-text downloads and 329 811 total online accesses to papers published in <italic>IJT</italic>. I’m also very excited to report that the number of articles submitted by members of ACT to <italic>IJT</italic> has approximately doubled in the past year—I view this as a tremendous vote of confidence for the journal and everyone associated with it. Please continue to submit your papers to your College’s journal—I think that you’ll like the service!!</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to another exciting and productive year as your Editor. As always, I would love any input and suggestions that come to mind; call, e-mail, or drop in any time!</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>Mary Beth Genter</p>
<p>
<italic>Editor-in-Chief, International Journal of Toxicology</italic>
