<abstract>
<p>The strength of Roberto Esposito’s immunitary reading of biopolitics lies in its ability to bring together biopolitics and thanatopolitics without fully collapsing them into each other. However, although Esposito has carefully elaborated the thanatopolitical tendency within Nazi biopolitics, the very idea of liberal thanatopolitics appears to be foreign to him. Despite the neglect of such a combination in Esposito’s thought, this article considers precisely this possibility. Befitting Esposito’s theory of immunity, this is done by focusing on the liberal efforts to halt the pandemic caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We discuss the hypothesis that the liberal insistence on the primacy of personified human life in the face of a dehumanizing pandemic systematically places many HIV-positive people in a zone of indistinguishability between full human existence and merely being alive in a thanatopolitical fashion.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article explores the thanatopolitical inversion of liberal biopolitics. The starting point of the inquiry is Roberto Esposito’s philosophy, in which the thanatopolitical tendency is well documented with regard to the Nazi regime’s murderous policies. Esposito has not pursued his analysis in relation to liberalism, although in his recent thought he has tended to place liberalism on the same biopolitical continuum with Nazism and maintained that these two share “a productivist view of life—a life made to serve in one case the superior destiny of the chosen race and, in the other, the maximum expansion of individual freedom.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0304375413497847">1</xref></sup> This perspective has emerged simultaneously with Esposito's elaboration of the <italic>dispositif</italic> of the person, a concept referring to the ancient experience of personhood as well as to the contemporary liberal experience of individual personhood; both experiences being premised on a capacity to push those not enjoying the status of the person to the edge of existence. As a result of this elaboration, at least the <italic>direction</italic> in which the thanatopolitical inversion of liberalism within Esposito’s thought can be sought has become evident.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0304375413497847">2</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Keeping in mind that the most central concept for Esposito is the notion of immunity, this article further suggests that the search for liberal thanatopolitics can be enabled especially in relation to the pandemic caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This is so because for Esposito the virus represents, in a most blatant fashion, the first of the two key aporias of our contemporary conceptions of immunity, namely, immune deficiency; the second aporia being self-destructive autoimmune illnesses. Just as Esposito used the symptomatology of autoimmune illnesses to account for Nazi thanatopolitics, I suggest here that liberal thanatopolitics can be best understood in relation to the dynamics of immune deficiency and especially to the HIV/AIDS pandemic.</p>
<p>By penetrating into the immune system and using the immune system’s mechanisms for its own benefit, the HIV virus fractures the whole idea of a strictly bordered individual. By using the defense mechanism which is thought to guarantee our integrity in the face of other organisms for its own replication, the virus fractures “an entire ontological scheme: the identity of the individual as the form and content of its subjectivity.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0304375413497847">3</xref></sup> Against this kind of blow, how can liberal traditions respond, especially in view of their desire to preserve and improve life by giving primacy to the personified individual? The answer suggested here is that it can only respond in an immune-deficient manner: as liberal policies of immunizing life insist on the primacy of personified human life in the face of a dehumanizing pandemic, these policies tends to producing a zone of indistinguishability between a full human existence and a condition of merely being alive. The mechanisms of liberal policy work against their own principles, promising life but bringing death.</p>
<p>The analysis will first engage with the move in Esposito’s theorizing from his account of Nazi thanatopolitics to an opening toward liberal forms of thanatopolitics, with a special emphasis on the problematics of individual rights as they are expressed in the dispositif of the person. Second, and in a more empirical manner, it will examine liberal thanatopolitics in relation to contemporary liberal responses to the HIV/AIDS pandemic, especially in relation to recent attempts to responds to the disparity of life changes between prosperous liberal societies in the West and societies in the Global South by emphasizing respect for individual rights. It will then conclude with a brief consideration of an alternative and more tolerant response to the pandemic that might be sought by emphasizing, with Esposito, immunity’s fundamental connection to community, understood in its originary meaning as the extraneousness that constitutes us as being “missing from ourselves.” This type of com-munity is the etymological and practical horizon of im-munity, and also something without which immunity loses its rationale and is destined to produce its own thanatopolitical closure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0304375413497847">4</xref></sup> Rather than the abyss of liberal thanatopolitics, a more affirmative direction will be sought by stressing not only the protective impetus of immunity but also the life-preserving quality of community.</p>
<sec id="section2-0304375413497847">
<title>From Nazism toward Liberal Thanatopolitics</title>
<p>Esposito’s reading of biopolitics is primarily informed by the notion of immunity. Although his thought certainly stands out in its comprehensiveness and its explicit engagement with the notion of immunity, his work can be situated within a larger body of critical thought in which this notion has been “bubbling” for some time already, and understood as the culmination point of this larger process; an interpretation that Esposito has also offered himself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0304375413497847">5</xref></sup> The notion of immunity has been addressed in the works of many well-known authors, such as Niklas Luhmann, Donna Haraway, Jacques Derrida, and Jean Baudrillard.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0304375413497847">6</xref></sup> As in the case of these works, for Esposito immunity refers fundamentally to the productive power of the negative. It refers to self-preservation that happens by reproducing “in a controlled form exactly that what it is meant to protect us from.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0304375413497847">7</xref></sup> Even though Esposito also discusses the importance of immunity within premodern institutions such as religion and Roman law, he holds that it is since the birth of modernity that immunity is made the “most intimate essence” of politics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0304375413497847">8</xref></sup> According to him, this is evident especially within the political categories of modernity, for instance, from sovereignty to property and to liberty. All these categories, which seek to secure the existence of a modern rational individual subject, are implicated in their own opposite: they all include a negative element that constrains the expansion of this subject. Consequently, the protection these categories offer comes with a risk of the negative element getting out of hand if the mediating mechanisms of these categories break down or the immunitary demand grows so strong that it overflows.</p>
<p>This risk scenario is exactly what Esposito thinks took place when the Nazis came to power in Germany. The Nazis wanted so intensively to avoid the degeneration of life they sought to foster that they crushed the will and reason of the subject—the very features that modern politics had relied on when immunizing life. For Nazis, the will and reason of the subject could not be used to immunize life because in every living being the biological element was understood to be the strongest force.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0304375413497847">9</xref></sup> Thus, without rerouting the immunitary machine in any way, the Nazis wanted to preserve and support the development of life within the German race by intervening directly on the level of life itself, which, according to the immunitary logic, could only mean that their primary tool had to become death—the negation of life.</p>
<p>Esposito illustrates his argument that Nazis were, in the foundations of their thinking, not against life but prolife with various empirical examples. He seeks to explain how, despite being murderous, Nazis nonetheless launched the most powerful campaign of their era against cancer, restricted the use of asbestos, tobacco, pesticides, and colorants, encouraged organic farming and diffusion of vegetarian cuisine? How else to explain the authority of doctors who were not only given a role regarding healing as we understand it but also regarding killing? It was the doctors under whose supervision the holocaust was planned and conducted; according to the regulations, it was only a doctor who had the right to open a gas valve. Moreover, without recourse to an immunitary perspective, it is hard to put all the pieces together concerning the trajectory of the Nazi regime from its birth to its end. Through the lens of immunity even the self-destruction ordered by Hitler in the final moments of the regime, when the contamination of the German race was only moments away as the Russians were already knocking on the gates of Berlin, is easily understandable. It can be conceptualized as a culmination point in the obsession with the health of their body politic, the preoccupation with detecting and removing the degenerative elements from this body. Hitler’s Demolition Order is an example of an autoimmune illness, in which the protective apparatus has become so aggressive that it turns against the body which it is supposed to protect.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0304375413497847">10</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The fact that Esposito spends considerable time investigating Nazism as it manifested itself in the last century does not mean that the thanatopolitical tendency should be associated exclusively with that regime. The defeat of Nazism did not bring the immunitary form of biopolitics to the end, nor did it remove the possibility of transforming biopolitics into thanatopolitics. For Esposito, the immunitary logic resurfaced in liberalism, which emerged victorious not only from its battle against Nazism but later also from its subsequent Cold War battle against communism. In this regard, Esposito relies on Michel Foucault’s understanding of liberalism not as a normative political doctrine or an ideology as such but more fundamentally as a particular practice of biopolitical governance, which both in its classical and in its contemporary neoliberal variations also considers the preservation and development of life to be ends in themselves.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0304375413497847">11</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, although it operates within the same biopolitical lexicon, what separates liberalism from Nazism is its different relation to the bodily dimension of human existence. If man for Nazism was only the body, for liberalism, echoing the words of John Locke and John Stuart Mill, man is the possessor of his own body. Thus, if within Nazism the individual body always belonged to the larger “body politic” and, consequently, the head of this body, the<italic> Führer</italic>, could do with this body what he wanted, within liberal thought it is the person occupying the body that has dominion over it. Therefore, one is able to use the body, sell the body, and modify the body as one wishes. In other words, one is able to legitimately treat one’s body as if this body was one’s slave. In this way, the immunitary form of biopolitics, and with it the thanatopolitical tendency, “is split into two antithetical forms that are not unrelated: Nazism and liberalism, or State biopolitics and individual biopolitics.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0304375413497847">12</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Here, however, Esposito begins to hesitate. This is probably because he does not want to risk his careful distinction between biopolitics and thanatopolitics which he considers to be joined together only through the logic of immunization and not in a direct fashion or in terms of succession. That is to say, not in the straightforward manner of Agamben and not in the manner of Foucault, whose inability to convincingly account for the relationship between sovereign order and biopolitical regime made Esposito’s immunitary reading of biopolitics necessary in the first place.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0304375413497847">13</xref></sup> Rather than opting for continuity or discontinuity in this regard, Esposito stresses a more anachronistic perspective in which sovereignty and biopolitics are not posited before or after each other, but are immersed into each other through a complex immunitary relationship in which one is refracted in the depths of the other. Consequently, sovereignty can always reappear within biopolitics but never in its past form as such but as the masked double of the past which returns as intertwined to the category of biomedicalized life in a much more intensified and deadly manner than before, exactly as happened in the Nazi Germany.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0304375413497847">14</xref></sup> Yet, although from this perspective it is hard to see why the deadly power of sovereignty could not also come to haunt and merge with liberalism, for some reason Esposito has not, at least explicitly, taken his thought in this direction. He has not brought liberalism and thanatopolitics together under a single rubric, even though his thought provides at least an opening to this possibility.</p>
<p>In fact, this opening has recently become even more accentuated since Esposito turned his attention toward the dispositif of the person. With this notion, Esposito sought to uncover the effects of the “separation between person as an artificial entity and the human as a natural being, whom the status of person may or may not befit.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0304375413497847">15</xref></sup> Although, again, it is Nazism that lurks in the background as the contemporary relevance of the dispositif derives from a counterreaction to the Nazi reduction of man to living matter, the dispositif itself is of a much older origin. Esposito traces the dispositif as far as ancient theater, Christianity and Roman law, and it is especially in the latter in which he sees the most explicit fulfillment of its horrendous potential to reduce living beings to the edge of existence. This ancient origin of the dispositif also explains Esposito’s preference for the notion of the person over the much more familiar term within the biopolitical literature, namely, the subject. According to Esposito, the dual status of the subject as both autonomous and subjugated, which was one of the focal points of Foucault's work, derives not from the modern invention of the subject by authors such as René Descartes and Gottfried Leibniz but, as with the intertwining of sovereignty and biopolitics, from the reappearance of an old idea in a modern horizon in its inverted form.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0304375413497847">16</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Despite the inequality carved right into the basis of personhood, Esposito maintains that it was quite natural that the concept of the person, which was very much battered by nineteenth-century biopolitics and then eventually almost completely destroyed by the Nazi thanatopolitics, reappeared at the center of discourse after the Second World War. After the horrors of the Nazi concentration camps were brought to public knowledge, there was a need for a more extensive legal protection than the one provided by the status of a citizenship, which had proven to be too exclusionary. The notion of the person was readily available. Hence, in the 1948 Declaration of Human Rights, the human being was argued to possess rights because of the very fact of being a person. In this way, the will and the reason of the human subject were brought back and humanity as whole was made the master of its own fate once again as everyone, regardless of the regime or the conditions in which they found themselves in, were given a possibility of transcending their corporeal matter; or at least this was the intention.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0304375413497847">17</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Yet, as we know, the promise remains to be fulfilled. Despite the increased humanitarian talk, fundamental rights are still to be extended to all human beings in so far as they would be protected from starvation, disease, and war. For Esposito, here lies a paradox. The neglect and disregard of the right to life for millions of people does not occur because human rights have not been extended far enough but because of the internal structure of these rights, which stems all the way from the ancient idea of personhood, which has only been given a new form. As Esposito emphasizes,
<disp-quote>
<p>a category defined in juridical terms, no matter how broad, becomes meaningful only thanks to the comparison and indeed the opposition with another category from which all other categories are excluded. […] inclusion only makes sense to the degree to which it marks a limit beyond which there is always someone or something. Outside of this differential logic, a right would never exist as such, but instead would constitute a juridically irrelevant given; and indeed it wouldn’t even be spoken of as such.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0304375413497847">18</xref></sup>
</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the case of human rights, the needed opposition is derived from precisely the fact that rights, as we understand them, are always related to personified human life in contrast to the living matter as such. This has been evident already from the beginning of the epoch to which we still find ourselves attached, that of modernity, as one only needs to recall the philosophy of Thomas Hobbes to realize it. As Esposito has elaborated, for Hobbes, it is the destructive ensemble of bodily needs, impulses, and drives which create a demand for an institution—namely, sovereignty—that polices these corporeal excesses and thus guarantees the right to life to those it represents instead of the endless proliferation of offensive and defensive measures deployed by everyone against everyone. In this way, sovereignty grounds itself on an artificial extracorporeal core, which it separates from the bodily dimension. It separates the moral and rational part, which gives legitimacy to the institution and which the institution represents, from the “life understood in its materiality, in its immediate physical intensity.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0304375413497847">19</xref></sup> In other words, the whole institution and the protection of life it ensures are based on the separation and protection of the person from the body unleashed.</p>
<p>Later on, within less absolutist liberal cultures, this logic is replicated with only a minor twist. Within liberalism, sovereignty over one’s body does not belong to any external entity but is delegated to the very same person who inhabits the body. Nevertheless, this does not remove the fundamental problem. Within liberalism, genuinely all-encompassing rights become impossible because the notion of the person is incapable of articulating rights and life. Within liberalism, the differentiating function of the notion just moves further inside an individual, who is now considered to be divided into two layers in a more fluid fashion than within Hobbes’s philosophy. One is the center of juridical imputation as far as one is able oneself to domesticate one's body, the animal layer inside the man. However, of course, not everyone is considered capable of doing this and thus we see
<disp-quote>
<p>a series of intermediate steps, characterized by a presence of personality, which increases or decreases according to the point of view adopted. At its apex one finds the healthy adult, to whom can be awarded the title of being truly and properly a person; next there is the infant, who is considered to be a potential person; and then the elderly invalid, who is reduced to a semi-person; to the terminally ill to whom the status of non-person is given; to finally the madman who has received the role of anti-person.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0304375413497847">20</xref></sup>
</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition, since in liberal thought the relation between the person and the body is defined by property, the more defective a person is, the more one is subjugated under the ownership of persons proper and thus reduced to thingness. The person and the thing emerge “as complementary sides of a single immunitary current aimed at the preservation of a privilege threatened by those who are excluded from it.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0304375413497847">21</xref></sup> Consequently, the thanatopolitical potential of the liberal culture emerges as a by-product of the emphasis on the basic rights of human beings, arising out of the need to divide life into two, as the notion of the person can never refer to all living individuals as such. On the contrary, even in its liberal form the notion carries within itself, although in an inverted form, a remnant derived from the Roman legal tradition which was never aimed only at granting the rightful status of the person to its subjects but also to turn other people under its rule into things, most explicitly realized in the figure of the slave, to the extent that experience of personhood became characterized by keeping, or pushing, “other living individuals to the edge of thingness.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0304375413497847">22</xref></sup> Thus, it is this fundamental zone of indistinguishability between thingness and full personhood which also emerges at the borderlines of personhood in its liberal variation; this zone in which the notion of the person calls forth a decision to define the limits of life worth preserving and protecting. In other words, in this zone the notion of the person calls forth a mixture of sovereignty and biopolitics with all its deadly potential.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0304375413497847">
<title>Liberal Thanatopolitics and the HIV/AIDS Pandemic</title>
<p>The actualization of the thanatopolitical potential of liberalism may be observed empirically in the contemporary liberal dealings with the global HIV/AIDS pandemic. This is not to say that it is <italic>only</italic> liberalism that has defined the response to the pandemic for the past thirty years, even within the stronghold of the liberalism itself: the West. On the contrary, especially in the early years after the first diagnosis of AIDS, when the panic about the illness was at its height, the blame for its existence and spread was cast arbitrarily in different directions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0304375413497847">23</xref></sup> This blaming of different others was a result of the fact that AIDS not only made a mockery out of the borders of states and other communities but also the immune system itself, which, according to Donna Haraway, was the ultimate twentieth century “map drawn to guide recognition and misrecognition of self and other in the dialectics of Western biopolitics.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0304375413497847">24</xref></sup> Consequently, as is typical in the face of border-ravishing pandemic threats, conservative ideas about the nation, race, and sexual behavior stepped to the front and AIDS was projected outside what was perceived as the healthy core of the Western body politic by giving the disease meaning through connecting it, for instance, to Africans, Haitians, immigrants, homosexuals, or drug users.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0304375413497847">25</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Yet, as the years have passed, the panic has faded gradually to the background. Again, this is not to say that the conservative ideas have completely lost their relevance, as exemplified, for instance, by President George Bush’s Emergency Plan for HIV/AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), when religious ideologies influenced the introduction of global prevention strategies based on demands for premarital abstinence and marital fidelity. However, on a more general level, as it has become clear that the HIV virus is not radically contagious and that there have emerged treatment options that can turn HIV infection to a chronic condition that is not an immediate threat to life, and so conservative positions have lost much of their force. In addition, strong activist campaigns in different national contexts and at the global level have shifted the tide more and more toward rights-based liberal individualism by demanding that the voices of the HIV-positive people should be heard and their rights respected when planning and implementing public health policies in order to guarantee the applicability of these policies to many different situations in which people who are already infected and people who are at risk find themselves.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0304375413497847">26</xref></sup> Furthermore, recently prevalent ideas about the use of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) not only for treating the already infected but also as a pre-exposure prophylaxis for those who are HIV negative, as well as the use of male circumcision as a prevention method, have moved the focus away from the need to produce a sexual behavioral change, even within the Global South, which has traditionally been the site of promiscuous and reckless sexual behavior in the collective fantasies of the West.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0304375413497847">27</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Thus, while the beginning of the era of AIDS was characterized mostly by prejudices, racism, and worries about national body politics, this disposition has since waned. Rather, in the Western liberal realm itself and also in the Global South, the liberal response, with its emphasis on multilateral governance and respect for individual rights, was placed at the center of responses to the disease to the extent that even when conservative ideas did enter the frame the implementation of these ideas was often pursued along the liberal guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0304375413497847">28</xref></sup> However, perhaps the best example of the triumph of the liberal response has been its persistence even when the connection between the HIV/AIDS pandemic and matters of high security was articulated and widely discussed. This persistence of the liberal response made AIDS an historical exception among infectious diseases because, surprisingly, as has been noted by Stefan Elbe, this securitization did not culminate in “a draconian response to the AIDS pandemic along the lines of historical state responses to other infectious diseases (such as leprosy, cholera, or even SARS more recently).”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0304375413497847">29</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Despite the exceptional triumph of the liberal response within the HIV/AIDS pandemic, especially when compared to responses to other infectious diseases, there have been some “illiberal” exclusions. These exclusions have been concentrated around the disparity of life chances resulting from the fact that successful treatment, which in prosperous Western liberal realms has made HIV infection more a chronic condition than an immediate threat to life, has not been as widely accessible in the Global South. While commitment to universal treatment has been affirmed for a long time, the concurrent protection of patent rights by pharmaceutical companies and the protection of Western health care systems from a flood of HIV-positive immigrants through various travel restrictions and immigration requirements has frequently produced contrary consequences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0304375413497847">30</xref></sup> As a result, at least those HIV-positive people who have found themselves excluded from access to treatment can be considered, from a biopolitical perspective, to be embodiments of life abandoned to death in an Agambenian sense. These people have been subjected to the sovereign exception and thus excluded from all the positive content of the global HIV/AIDS community by being captured in the “zone of indistinction between outside and inside, exclusion and inclusion.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0304375413497847">31</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>On the other hand, as many now suggest, in the recent years the relevance of the biopolitical production of abandonment through sovereign exception in the case of HIV/AIDS pandemic has decreased.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0304375413497847">32</xref></sup> This indeed seems to be the case as on more and more occasions the campaigning and lobbying of the global AIDS activist and influential international organizations, such as the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), has been able to change how things are done. For instance, through campaigning and lobbying, the access to treatment was framed as a human right, which made it possible to impose certain limitations on the implementation of intellectual property rights regarding ARVs. Consequently, a space was opened for the production and purchase of much cheaper generic drugs. This has been capitalized on by states outside the prosperous West, most notably Brazil, which has become a model of efficiency in providing nearly universal ARVs by cooperating with activists, development agencies, and the pharmaceutical industry itself. As people grow more resistant, questions about the future availability of newer drug therapies remain. Nevertheless, Brazil’s model has become celebrated not only within the Global South but also gradually accepted, at least to a certain extent, among the governments of the West, who now mostly prefer generic drugs within their global health initiatives, as well as among the pharmaceutical companies themselves.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0304375413497847">33</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In addition, in the case of the HIV/AIDS-related travel restrictions and immigration requirements, the activists and the international expert organizations seem to have attained many of their goals. This is true especially regarding the liberal democracies of the Western world: in these countries, at present there is a strong compliance with individual rights when dealing with foreign HIV-positive people whose condition is no longer considered to be worth special attention. As has been recommended by expert organizations and demanded by activists, in these countries HIV infection of a foreigner does not bring on the suspension of one’s basic right to mobility, as the foreigner is treated in the same way as any other visitor/immigrant regardless of HIV status.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0304375413497847">34</xref></sup> Recently, also the United States, the most notable exception to the rule in this regard within the liberal realm, eliminated its travel restrictions based on HIV status and thus finalized the process that was already launched by the George Bush administration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0304375413497847">35</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>What should we, then, make of the prospects of the increased extension of rights even into the traditional zones of abandonment in the case of the HIV/AIDS pandemic? Does the penetration of rights into these zones have the potential to prevent the rendering of people as embodiments of life abandoned to death? The answer, unfortunately, is no. In an aporetic fashion, the penetration of rights to these traditional abandonment producing zones only changes the form in which life abandoned to death is produced within the pandemic. As a consequence, the foundational abandonment is no longer produced through the Agambenian type of exception but becomes an inherent quality of the liberal policies themselves, making it possible to speak about a liberal thanatopolitics.</p>
<p>This becomes evident when the consequences of the penetration of rights into the abandonment-producing zones are viewed from the perspective of how the dispositif of the person clashes with the dehumanizing tendencies of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. In order to bring out this clash, it is necessary to emphasize three points.</p>
<p>First, it must be stressed that AIDS ravages the subjectivity of an individual as “the disease destroys the very idea of an identity-making border: the difference between self and other, internal and external, inside and outside.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0304375413497847">36</xref></sup> This refers to the fact that an immune system’s CD4 T cells, in which the HIV virus resides, have under normal conditions the task of activating and directing the immune defenses, but in the case of the HIV virus the activation of these cells paradoxically makes them more hospitable to the virus and actually helps the virus to replicate. It is therefore incorrect to say that the virus simply evades the immune system; rather, the virus <italic>uses</italic> the immune system’s own mechanisms to harm it. What gets affected is not just health but the entire ontological scheme, as the defense mechanism that is thought to guarantee individual’s integrity in the face of other organisms reveals its deficiencies by itself assisting the progression of the virus which eventually will undermine the system completely, exposing the body to every germ, and causing the body to implode. Thus, functioning in the mode strictly opposed to that of immunity, which internalizes the external, AIDS turns the body inside out by “externalization of the inside.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0304375413497847">37</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Second, and against the first point, it is necessary to understand how the liberal framing of access to treatment as a human right functions along the lines of the dispositif of the person. As a result, the logic of intervention and the limit that would need to be transgressed in order to overcome AIDS once and for all become fundamentally the same. This is a consequence of the foundational fracture experienced by the idea of a strictly bordered individual, which, in a paradoxical manner, becomes remedied by framing the access to treatment as a right of everyone as far as one is this strictly bordered individual, that is, a person. The paradoxical consequences of the framing become visible especially in the resource-poor settings of the Global South where this framing inadequately pharmaceuticalizes health in an individualizing manner.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0304375413497847">38</xref></sup> As the pandemic has followed the fault lines of the long-term economic processes, these are settings in which the health infrastructure does not exist and the rolling out of HIV/AIDS drugs becomes a matter of innovative projects and people’s ability to attach themselves to these projects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0304375413497847">39</xref></sup> This is more easily said than done, as the treatment of HIV infection with ARVs has a long-term therapeutic character requiring that patients fully adhere to their treatment and that there is a medical apparatus in place that documents and monitors patients’ response to the drugs. This is essential as over time the HIV in patient’s body becomes resistant to certain ARVs, and thus the drug cocktail that one is using has to be altered from time to time in order to keep one in shape and alive. Thus, what is demanded from these poor and marginalized people, who form the majority of the HIV-positive people in the world, is self-discipline and will to overcome their physical and social situation. What is demanded is that they actively follow and keep attending the treatments and thus maintain their personhood, their control over their body, their animal layer inside them. If they are not able to do this, they fall outside the benefits of their right to treatment, their right to life, and the virus will finalize their destiny by making their body take control over them. These people, as João Biehl has written, “are trapped between two possible destinies: dying of AIDS like the poor and marginalized do—that is, being animalized—and living pharmacologically into a future, thereby letting the animal sleep and preventing it from consuming their flesh.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0304375413497847">40</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Yet, third, the paradoxical consequences grow even more mind-twisting when the disappearance of the state-imposed HIV/AIDS-related mobility restrictions from the Western liberal realm is addressed. As the right of the HIV-positive people to be treated as individual persons even beyond the old sovereign demarcation between the Global South and the prosperous liberal realm of the West is respected, a space is opened inside this liberalized realm: a space in which there is little room for those who are not “proper persons” but considerable scope for more direct forms of violence against these same individuals. The absence of state-imposed mobility restrictions does not simply mean enhanced life changes for everyone; for example, for failed asylum seekers, illegal immigrants, and other foreigners without proper authorization, access to the health services that HIV-positives need to stay alive is made difficult if they lack money or other legitimate ways to cover their health expenses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0304375413497847">41</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Consequently, the possibility of living in a liberal realm is granted mainly to those HIV-positive people who can be trusted to take responsibility for themselves and for the costs of their own care. For others, access to adequate health services remains blocked. Respect for their right to be treated in the same manner as any other individual person means making them liable human subjects in spite of their dehumanized condition, pushing them even more certainly toward abandonment. The more the global efforts to provide assistance have failed, the more “illegal” or “unauthorized” these people become in relation to their access to further assistance. This is where, despite liberal attempts to keep it in check by emphasizing personal rights, sovereign violence reappears through the opening created by this very same emphasis on personal rights. HIV-positive people in their entirety can never be ensured protection through respect for their rights because it is these rights that ensure that many of them inevitably fall into a zone of indistinguishability between full human existence and merely being alive, a zone in which these people are rendered as targets of violence.</p>
<p>It is ultimately here in the zone of indistinguishability between full human existence and merely being alive that the thanatopolitical potential of liberalism is actualized. The emphasis on human rights and non-discriminating policies ends up turning against, and even bringing death to, those promised enhanced life changes. In the case of the HIV/AIDS pandemic in particular, life as a whole simply cannot be immunized through efforts premised on the primacy of, and control by, the personified human life over the body and the animal layer of life; the progression of the virus has made it impossible to maintain this distinction. The insistence on the primacy of the personified human life leads to HIV-positive people being pushed further from the designated standards of living by placing these standards beyond their reach. Thus, the dynamics of the HIV/AIDS pandemic are the same for the liberal immunitary dispositif of the person as the HIV virus itself is for the immune system. The dynamics of the pandemic and the virus itself are both something that these two immunization mechanisms cannot handle in the way they are supposed to. In both cases, immunity is unable to fully protect life.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in both cases, the mechanisms of the immunization do not only fail but begin in themselves to contribute to the gradual destruction of that which they should try to protect. In the case of the HIV virus, the mechanisms of the immune system help the virus to replicate and thus destroy the body's integrity in the face of harmful infections. In the case of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, the immunitary mechanism of the person begins to produce paradoxical results as by including people under its projection it begins to abandon those same people to the mercy of the HIV virus.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Despite Esposito’s reluctance to use the term “liberal thanatopolitics,” the term seems appropriate when describing and conceptualizing liberal responses to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. This is especially the case for recent liberal responses to the disparity of life changes between the prosperous West and the Global South. When the extension of rights-based policies to traditional abandonment producing zones is explored from the perspective of Esposito’s immunitary reading of biopolitics and his elaboration of the dispositif of the person, it becomes clear that liberal policies are unable to prevent producing abandonment themselves. This is a result of the insistence on the primacy of personified human life over living matter as such in the face of the dehumanizing pandemic, which ends up pushing many HIV-positive people into a zone of indistinguishability between full human existence and merely being alive. The power of <italic>thanatos</italic> is no longer expressed as an exception but has become an inherent quality of liberal policies.</p>
<p>Given this inversion of liberal biopolitics into liberal thanatopolitics, it is clear that a new course is needed. However, the persistence of the production of abandonment despite the extension of rights within abandonment-producing zones means that innovation will be more difficult than many are willing to admit. Better policies will not come from further extension or creation of new rights to people who are now abandoned. This is because to be fully human is to be in a relational condition that derives its intelligibility from the subjugation a person enjoys over the biological layer of life which connects one to other living beings and things. As the HIV/AIDS pandemic places this subjugation in doubt, anything that tries to protect only the human person is bound to push at least some HIV positives toward abandonment. Consequently, innovation must move in the opposite direction, also set out by Esposito, a direction that tries to work with immunity’s etymological and practical horizon, the community. As the thanatopolitical inversion of immunity makes plain, community is not only a contagious relationship with others, thereby representing a risk of self-dissolution, but also something that, like immunity, protects us. Community protects us from the excess of immunity that appears destined to have thanatopolitical consequences. From this perspective, community is not something that can be removed without destroying that which was sought to be protected from the excess of community in the first place. Thus, contemporary global efforts to halt the spread of HIV/AIDS pandemic can only benefit from reactivating the idea of community. What must be found is the way to place the communal, the impersonal force of life, rather than the notion of the person, at the center of protection.</p>
