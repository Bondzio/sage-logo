<abstract>
<p>A lack of a consistent and valid approach to screening within the jail often hinders identification and treatment. Furthermore, screening instruments developed for jail populations are often inadequate in detecting serious depression and anxiety disorders in women. While the remedy thus far has been the use of separate screening instruments for men and women, others have suggested that the K6, a six-item measure validated in large epidemiologic studies, may hold promise. Building on prior research, this study assesses the validity of the K6 in detecting depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and anxiety disorders among 494 male and 515 female jail detainees. The authors found that 15% of males and 36% of females meet criteria for serious mental illness on the K6, with receiver operating characteristics–area under the curve scores of .84 and .93, respectively. This study not only establishes the validity and efficiency of using the K6 for screening within jails but also suggests a need for adjusting scale cut points.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Local jails, in contrast to state and federal prisons, house individuals for shorter periods of time and often rapidly cycle individuals through the booking and screening process. Some of these detainees will be held for less than 24 hr, whereas others will be held within the jail until their court date or to serve brief sentences. Individuals with a serious mental health disorder are more likely to interface with the criminal justice system than those without (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306624X11420106">Solomon, Draine, &amp; Marcus, 2002</xref>), and the jail-booking process presents an opportune time to identify such disorders. However, most jails do not have a valid or consistent approach to screening serious mental health disorders. Although many tools have been developed for such purposes, issues of validity in samples of female detainees have hindered application or required recommendations of separate instruments for male and female populations. As the use of two different screening tools may be impracticable for some, particularly those in large urban jails, there is a need for validation of one screening tool that can be used for both populations. This article examines the validity of using a tool widely accepted in epidemiologic studies, the K6, as a second-level screening for males and females within an urban jail setting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0306624X11420106">
<title>Background</title>
<p>The number of individuals within the U.S. criminal justice system is on the rise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0306624X11420106">Harrison &amp; Beck, 2006</xref>). In addition, there has been a substantial increase in the proportion of inmates presenting mental health needs to correctional staff. A recent U.S. Department of Justice report concerning the mental health of jailed individuals found that 64% (75% of women and 63% of men) reported mental health problems (i.e., were diagnosed by a mental health professional, had an overnight hospital stay, used psychotropic medications, received therapy, or exhibited symptoms of a serious mental health disorder) in the 12 months prior to their interview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11420106">James &amp; Glaze, 2006</xref>). Limiting the problem definition to include only those who reported having been “diagnosed with a mental health disorder by a professional” resulted in a much smaller proportion of detainees identified with a disorder (11% overall; 23% of women vs. 9% of men), but nonetheless a serious concern for jail staff.</p>
<p>Those with a mental health disorder are more likely to be involved in the criminal justice system than those without a mental disorder and generally present management challenges to jail staff, including greater risk of suicide and other self-injurious behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0306624X11420106">Ruddell, Decker, &amp; Egley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0306624X11420106">Smith &amp; Kaminski, 2010</xref>). Moreover, individuals with a high level of psychological distress, particularly at jail admission, also pose a risk for suicide, and mental health screening is part of an overall plan of prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0306624X11420106">International Association for Correctional and Forensic Psychology, 2010</xref>). In addition, because jail stays are usually of brief duration, identification of mental health disorders may enhance efforts in linking individuals to the community mental health system, decrease disruption in medication regiments, and enhance the continuity of care.</p>
<p>Although the majority of jails screen for mental health disorders, few use valid mental health screening and assessment tools or a consistent process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0306624X11420106">Steadman &amp; Veysey, 1997</xref>). The American Psychiatric Association’s (APA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306624X11420106">2000</xref>) <italic>Guidelines for Psychiatric Services in Jails and Prisons</italic> distinguish between phases of screening and assessment within confined settings. In most jails, there is an initial screening conducted by staff as the person is confined. This is generally an observational screening to determine risk for causing harm to self (e.g., suicide) or others. It is recommended that the second-stage screening incorporate a consistent and systematic approach that uses a valid and reliable instrument. If the individual meets the threshold for a serious mental health disorder, the APA recommendation is a referral for a more thorough professional assessment—or third-level screening. To be clear, the subject of this article is the second stage of the process—the use of a valid screening measure that can be implemented by nonprofessional staff member to determine if a more in-depth mental health assessment by a professional is warranted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0306624X11420106">
<title>Mental Health Screening Tools</title>
<p>In recent years, several screening tools specifically for use within jail systems have been developed and tested against well-established mental health measures. Among these are the Brief Jail Mental Health Screen (BJMHS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0306624X11420106">Steadman, Scott, Osher, Agnese, &amp; Robbins, 2005</xref>) and the Correctional Mental Health Screen (CMHS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306624X11420106">J. Ford &amp; Trestman, 2005</xref>). Each of these measures is brief, easily scored by nonclinical staff, cost-effective, and practical in a fast-paced setting such as a county jail’s booking unit. However, several concerns have emerged regarding the use of these measures in detecting serious mental health concerns in women. Although women comprise a substantially smaller proportion of the jail population as a whole, when compared with men, they consistently exhibit greater symptoms of mental illness and more often meet diagnostic criteria for a wide range of mental health disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306624X11420106">Ditton, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11420106">James &amp; Glaze, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0306624X11420106">Teplin, Abram, &amp; McClelland, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0306624X11420106">Trestman, Ford, Zhang, &amp; Wiesbrock, 2007</xref>). Therefore, a review of validity and reliability concerns in current tools is prudent.</p>
<p>The BJMHS, an easily scored 8-item revision of a first-generation tool, the Referral Decision Scale (RDS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0306624X11420106">Teplin &amp; Swartz, 1989</xref>), has proved promising for use with male detainees (accurately detecting 75% needing further assessment), when compared with the Structured Clinical Interview for <italic>DSM</italic> (SCID). However, when used with women (again in comparison with the SCID), this measure resulted in high proportions of false positives and false negatives, only correctly classifying 62% of female detainees (sensitivity = 46%, specificity = 73%; receiver operating characteristics–area under the curve [ROC-AUC] = .594; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0306624X11420106">Steadman et al., 2005</xref>). A modified version was developed to remedy these issues by adding items to assess trauma-related symptomology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306624X11420106">Steadman, Robbins, Islam, &amp; Osher, 2007</xref>). However, the 12-item revised BJMHS classified only 66% of women successfully (sensitivity and specificity were 65% and 66%, respectively), with extremely high rates of false positives when compared with the SCID. Based on these findings, the authors recommended use of the initial BJMHS instrument over this revised version.</p>
<p>The CMHS was developed specifically to address these gender variations among incarcerated populations. The two versions, an 8-item women’s (CMHS-W) and a 12-item men’s (CMHS-M), were validated against a composite screen, comprising a 24-item module from the SCID, Patient Version (SCID-P; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306624X11420106">First, Spitzer, Gibbon, &amp; Williams, 1997</xref>), the 4-item Primary Care Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306624X11420106">Prins et al., 2003</xref>), the 14-item Iowa Personality Disorders Screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0306624X11420106">Langbehn et al.,1999</xref>), and the 14-item RDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0306624X11420106">Teplin &amp; Swartz, 1989</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306624X11420106">J. D. Ford, Trestman, Wiesbrock, and Zhang (2007)</xref> found that between 70% and 80% of women and 75% to 80% of men are correctly classified by the CMHS. However, the CMHS-W did not perform adequately, and it offered no improvement over the RDS and BJMHS for Black women, who are disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306624X11420106">J. D. Ford et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>With the exception of the CMHS, which was developed specifically to address gender variations in the manifestation of mental health disorders, the RDS and BJMHS tend to overlook the symptoms indicative of anxiety- and trauma-related disorders common to incarcerated women. The high rate of false positives adds an unnecessary burden to the criminal justice system, potentially allocating scarce resources to those individuals not primarily in need of them, while high rates of false negatives overlook those presenting high levels of psychiatric distress. Although use of the CMHS may alleviate some of these concerns, some jails may prefer to use one screening instrument rather than separate male and female versions, which could inadvertently introduce error into the screening process. Therefore, additional attention is needed to identify and empirically test brief, practical screening tools that adequately serve male and female criminal justice populations and eliminate the need for separate measures.</p>

<title>The Current Study</title>
<p>The current study investigates the use of a brief mental health screening tool, the K6, in identifying anxiety, depression, and PTSD among a sample of incarcerated men and women. The K6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306624X11420106">Kessler et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306624X11420106">2003</xref>) is a nationally and internationally used six-item screening tool designed to detect any past-year diagnosis of a <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed.; <italic>DSM-IV</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0306624X11420106">APA, 1994</xref>) Axis I disorder and a Global Assessment of Functioning Score (GAF) at or below 60, which is indicative of serious impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306624X11420106">Kessler et al., 2002</xref>). The researchers recommend the use of a specific cut score, 13, when there is an assumption that prevalence rates will be similar to those in general population samples. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306624X11420106">Kessler and colleagues’ (2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306624X11420106">2003</xref>) validation studies of the K6 used the nonpatient, 12-month Structured Clinical Interview for <italic>DSM-IV</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306624X11420106">First, Spitzer, Gibbon, &amp; Williams, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, Swartz and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0306624X11420106">Lurigio &amp; Swartz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0306624X11420106">Swartz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0306624X11420106">Swartz &amp; Lurigio, 2005</xref>) have advocated for the use of the K6 as a screening tool among incarcerated populations. Using a sample of individuals with prior criminal justice involvement from the National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0306624X11420106">Swartz (2007)</xref> found the K6 to accurately detect mental health disorders in men and women (ROC-AUC = .88 when compared with the Composite Diagnostic Interview Schedule Short Form) and found the K6 to have acceptable reliability across various racial/ethnic and age groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0306624X11420106">Lurigio &amp; Swartz, 2006</xref>). However, limited empirical evidence exists examining the validity of the K6 among incarcerated populations because the aforementioned studies were conducted using a subsample of individuals recently arrested or on parole or probation and did not include those in institutional settings. Swartz and colleagues have argued that the performance of the K6 should be assessed within an incarcerate setting to determine whether such results can be replicated. Furthermore, there has been little attention to the feasibility of using such a measure during the booking process within jail.</p>
<p>Although the K6 is limited in detecting specific disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0306624X11420106">Veldhuizen, Cairney, Kurdyak, &amp; Streiner, 2007</xref>), the inability of many jail screening instruments to accurately assess depressive and anxiety disorders in women led to a recent study focused specifically on the correct classification of depressive and trauma-related disorders among women. Researchers found that the K6 performed well overall with a cumulative ROC-AUC of .93 for detecting either major depression or PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0306624X11420106">Kubiak, Beeble, &amp; Bybee, 2010</xref>). As the K6 is easily scored with brief administration time, and institutions are more likely to use one screening tool for men and women, it is important to test the validity of the K6 with both groups. Therefore, in the current study, we sought to investigate and compare the validity of the K6 in detecting anxiety, depression, and PTSD by gender in a large urban jail. A secondary aim is to determine the accuracy of the instruments’ suggested cut scores in a specialized population.</p>

<p>Purposeful sampling strategies were used to ensure an equivalent number of males and females participating in this study, but convenience sampling within gender was used to obtain what would typify samples of men and women as they entered the jail. Our data collection approaches for men and women varied slightly because of the nature of the facility and the limited number of female detainees entering the facility on a given day. When collecting data from women, we attempted to minimize burden on correctional staff by limiting the presence of the research staff on the units. Therefore, three rounds of data collection were completed over 6 months, allowing approximately 4 weeks in between each round to allow for turnover. Male data collection was done in one continuous round lasting approximately 3 months. (See authors, 2010, for further procedural detail.) The use of a unique identifier formed by the detainee, using a consistent algorithm created by researchers, prevented duplication.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section10-0306624X11420106">
<title>General mental health</title>
<p>The K6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306624X11420106">Kessler et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306624X11420106">2003</xref>), a brief six-item screening measure often used in general population studies, was used to assess general symptoms of distress. The instrument is available publicly free of charge. The K6 measures the extent to which individuals feel (a) nervous, (b) hopeless, (c) restless or fidgety, (d) so depressed that nothing could cheer them up, (e) that everything was an effort, and (f) worthless during the 4 weeks preceding their screening. Item responses were based on a 5-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 0 (<italic>none of the time)</italic> to 4 (<italic>all of the time</italic>). All responses were summed into an overall scale, with scores ranging from 0 to 24. Cronbach’s alpha for the K6 was .95 (<italic>M</italic> = 7.99; <italic>SD</italic> = 7.84). A recommended overall cut score of 13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306624X11420106">Kessler et al., 2003</xref>) distinguishes those with serious mental illness (SMI) from those without. The K6 identified 259 men and women (25.70%; 72 males, 187 females) as having a serious mental health disorder.</p>

<sec id="section11-0306624X11420106">
<title>Depression</title>
<p>The Patient History Questionnaire Depression subscale, comprising nine-items (PHQ-9; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306624X11420106">Kroenke &amp; Spitzer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0306624X11420106">Spitzer, Kroenke, &amp; Williams, 1999</xref>) was used to screen for major depressive disorder (MDD). Validation studies of the PHQ-9 used the Structured Clinical Interview for the <italic>DSM-III-R</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0306624X11420106">Spitzer, Williams, Gibbon, &amp; First, 1992</xref>) and found an overall accuracy score of .93 (specificity = .96, sensitivity at .73) when compared with the clinical interviews. Participants were asked to report on the frequency at which they experienced symptoms during the preceding 2-week period. Sample items included the following: “Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?” and “Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you thought that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way?” Item responses were based on a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (<italic>not at all)</italic> to 3 (<italic>nearly everyday</italic>). Diagnostic criteria for MDD required that the participant (a) reported feeling down, depressed, or hopeless <italic>or</italic> had experienced little interest or pleasure in doing things and (b) experienced five or more symptoms at least <italic>more than half the days</italic> (scored as 2). Among this sample, 289 (28.60%) met diagnostic criteria for MDD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0306624X11420106">
<title>Anxiety</title>
<p>The PHQ Anxiety subscale, comprising seven-items (PHQ-7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0306624X11420106">Spitzer et al., 1999</xref>), was used to assess current symptoms of anxiety-related disorders. In validation studies, the PHQ Anxiety subscale had an overall accuracy of .91 (specificity = .97, sensitivity = .63) in detecting any anxiety disorder when compared with a diagnostic interview by a mental health professionals using the SCID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0306624X11420106">Spitzer et al., 1992</xref>). The first item was used to screen participants to determine whether, and to what extent, they had experienced symptoms of anxiety within the prior 4-week period. Participants were asked, “Over the last 4 weeks, how often have you been feeling nervous, anxious, on edge, or worrying a lot about different things?” Any indication of the presence of symptoms, regardless of severity, was used to direct participants to complete the remaining six items (e.g., “Think about the last 4 weeks, how often have you become easily annoyed or irritable?” “Think about the last 4 weeks, how often have you been having trouble concentrating on things [reading a book, watching TV]?”). All item responses were based on a Likert-type scale (0 = <italic>not at all</italic> to 3 = <italic>nearly everyday</italic>). Diagnostic scoring guidelines for the presence of an anxiety disorder require that the screening item and at least three additional items are scored as 2 (<italic>more than half the days)</italic> or greater. Among this sample, 298 participants (29.50%) met criteria for an anxiety disorder.</p>

<sec id="section13-0306624X11420106">
<title>PTSD</title>
<p>PTSD was assessed using a modified version of the Short Screening Scale for <italic>DSM-IV</italic> PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306624X11420106">Breslau, Peterson, Kessler, &amp; Schultz, 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306624X11420106">Breslau and colleagues (1999)</xref> validated this brief screen using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), from which it was derived. Sensitivity and specificity were 90.1% and 96.5%, respectively, with a positive predictive value of 68.4% and a negative predictive value of 99.1%. This seven-item scale was preceded by one item to screen for prior trauma exposure, “In your life, have you ever had any experience that you considered frightening, horrible, or upsetting?” Exposure to at least one traumatic event guided participants to complete the remaining items (e.g., “Because of this experience, how often over the last 4 weeks have you lost interest in activities that were once important or enjoyable?” “Because of this experience, how often over the last 4 weeks have you become jumpy or got easily startled by ordinary noises or movements?”). Item responses were based on a Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 3 (<italic>nearly everyday</italic>). The number of present symptoms (items for which participants responded either 1 [<italic>several days</italic>], 2 [<italic>more than half the days</italic>], or 3 [<italic>nearly everyday</italic>]) were summed to create a scale score, ranging from 0 to 7. Cronbach’s alpha for this scale was .92, with <italic>M</italic> = 2.79 and <italic>SD</italic> = 2.77. A score of 4, as the recommended cut point, was used as the lower limit to indicate the probable presence of PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306624X11420106">Breslau et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306624X11420106">Kimerling et al., 2006</xref>). A total of 405 participants (40.10%) met diagnostic criteria for PTSD.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>To test the validity of the K6 against established screening measures for MDD (PHQ-9; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0306624X11420106">Spitzer et al., 1999</xref>), generalized anxiety disorder (PHQ-7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0306624X11420106">Spitzer et al., 1999</xref>), and PTSD (Short Screening Scale for <italic>DSM-IV</italic> PTSD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306624X11420106">Breslau et al., 1999</xref>), ROC analyses were conducted. ROC analyses are increasingly used to examine the accuracy of mental health screening devices in clinical settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0306624X11420106">Streiner &amp; Cairney, 2007</xref>). The AUC reflects the accuracy of the tested instrument’s ability to predict the dichotomous outcome of interest (i.e., presence or absence of a mental health disorder) across all possible scores of the tested instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306624X11420106">Lasko, Bhagwat, Zou, &amp; Ohno-Machado, 2005</xref>). ROC-AUC values may range from 0.0 to 1.0, with higher values closest to 1.0 reflecting greater accuracy. Generally, values exceeding 0.80 indicate reasonable accuracy and those above .90 indicate high accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0306624X11420106">Streiner &amp; Cairney, 2007</xref>). To compare the overall accuracy of the K6 in detecting major depression, anxiety, and PTSD in samples of men and women, we used a test for the significance of the difference between the areas under two independent ROC curves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0306624X11420106">Hanley &amp; McNeil, 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>For each possible score on the tested instrument (i.e., the K6), ROC analyses produce values of sensitivity and specificity, which reflect the proportion of participants who have been correctly classified by the tested instrument. Sensitivity represents the proportion of cases with an actual disorder that were correctly identified by the K6 criterion (i.e., true positives), whereas specificity represents the proportion of cases correctly left unidentified by the K6 (i.e., true negatives). The sum of the false positives (i.e., cases incorrectly identified as having a disorder) and false negatives (i.e., cases incorrectly identified as not having a disorder) yields the total errors of classification.</p>

When examining the odds of having a diagnosis or having been identified as being seriously mentally ill per the K6 standards, we found that women present far more risk for a mental health disorder. For instance, women had 3.30 greater odds than men of being identified by the K6 as having a SMI. Similarly, when compared with men, women were 4.80 times more likely to be diagnosed with major depression, 4.62 times more likely to be diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, and 3.02 times more likely to be diagnosed with PTSD.</p>

<p>Using the conventional cut score of 13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306624X11420106">Kessler et al., 2003</xref>), nearly 37% of the women were identified as screening positive on the K6; at this cut score, sensitivity and specificity values for women meeting criteria for any diagnosis (i.e., major depression, an anxiety disorder, or PTSD) were .54 and .98, respectively. At the cut score of 13, the K6 misclassified 48% of the women, whether through false positives or negatives. A score of 6 was found to be optimal in its ability to minimize classification errors to 28%, reflecting sensitivity and specificity levels of .88 and .84, respectively.</p>
<p>When assessing the ability of the K6 to identify individuals with particular diagnoses, the sensitivity and specificity of the K6 in detecting major depression was .67 and .87, respectively. The conventional cut score of 13 resulted in 47% of women being misclassified; a score of 9 was found to be optimal for minimizing classification errors, reducing the error rate to 40%. Similarly, sensitivity and specificity of the K6 in detecting an anxiety disorder were .69 and .89, respectively, with 42% of women being misclassified. A cut score of 9 was found to be optimal for detecting anxiety in women, reducing the error rate to 40%. Finally, for detecting PTSD, sensitivity and specificity values were .59 and .89, respectively. Approximately 53% of women were misclassified by the K6 using the conventional cut score. A cut score of 6 was found to be optimal, reducing errors in classification to 40%.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study tested the psychometric properties of the K6 when used in an urban jail setting with male and female detainees. The encouraging outcomes of several prior studies investigating the utility of the K6 with criminal justice–involved individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0306624X11420106">Lurigio &amp; Swartz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0306624X11420106">Swartz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0306624X11420106">Swartz &amp; Lurigio, 2006</xref>) led to the need for additional validation studies within incarcerate settings. This study builds on previous studies of the validity of the K6 in female detainees (Authors, 2010) intentionally replicating measures and by comparing the concurrent validity of the K6 when assessing PTSD, anxiety, and depressive disorders in male and female jail detainees.</p>
<p>We found that 26% of those within this urban jail have symptoms indicative of a serious mental health disorder, per the K6 criteria. In comparison, the National Comorbidity Study–Replication (NCS-R) determined that in 12-month prevalence estimates approximately 5% of the population had a serious mental health disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306624X11420106">Kessler, Chiu, Demler, &amp; Walters, 2005</xref>). Like other studies, we found that females in jail settings are much more likely to have symptoms commensurate with a mental health diagnosis than their male counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11420106">James &amp; Glaze, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0306624X11420106">Teplin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0306624X11420106">Trestman et al., 2007</xref>). Women in the jail were nearly 5 times more likely to meet diagnostic criteria for MDD and/or anxiety disorder and 3 times more likely to meet criteria for PTSD than men in the jail. Although women in community samples have higher rates of these disorders than men, the differences are not as profound. National epidemiologic data illustrates the following differences among community samples of men and women, respectively: major depression 5% versus 9%, generalized anxiety disorder 2% versus 3%, and PTSD 2% versus 5% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0306624X11420106">NCS, 2011</xref>). Similarly, the odds were 3 times as great that women met criteria for serious mental health disorder—using the conventional cutoff of 13 on the K6—than were men (37% of women and 15% of men). Significant differences between groups on age and length of incarceration may have some bearing on these results. Males were younger (<italic>M</italic> = 32 vs. 34 years) and had been in jail for less time than females (<italic>M</italic> = 18 vs. 45 days) when surveyed. However, previous analysis of mental health screening of female detainees has demonstrated no significant effects by age or by length of jail stay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306624X11420106">Kubiak, Beeble, &amp; Bybee, 2009</xref>), so it is unlikely that these variables explain the gender differences in mental health disorders.</p>
<p>The prevalence of SMI in this study was higher, particularly for women, than that found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0306624X11420106">Swartz (2007)</xref> in his validation of the K6 for criminal justice populations. Swartz found that 14% of men and 26% of women met the threshold for SMI using the conventional cut score of 13 on the K6, compared with our 15% and 37%, respectively. These differences, as Swartz suggested, are likely to be those between institutionalized and noninstitutionalized criminal justice populations. Individuals on probation and parole with a working telephone responding to a random telephone survey (e.g., NSDUH) may be less functionally impaired than a sample within an institutional setting.</p>
<p>However, similar to previous studies, the K6 performed reasonably well, with a cumulative ROC-AUC score of .93 for women and .84 for men. Diagnosis-specific ROC-AUC scores for men and women were consistently above the .80 threshold of reasonable accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0306624X11420106">Streiner &amp; Cairney, 2007</xref>) across major depression, anxiety, and PTSD. When comparing the overall accuracy of the K6 in detecting depression, anxiety, and PTSD, separately, we found that this brief screening tool performed equally well for men and women. However, when considering the presence of any of the aforementioned diagnoses, we found that the K6 performed somewhat better with women. That is, the K6 was significantly more accurate in detecting the presence of any given mental health disorder in women when compared with men, although accuracy rates were high for both. This is in slight contrast to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0306624X11420106">Swartz (2007)</xref> study, where ROC-AUC values were .88 for men and women, and there were no significant differences in performance by gender. We believe that the differences here may be attributable to the variation in validation instruments used. In the cross-validation study by Swartz, the CIDI–Short Form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0306624X11420106">Kessler, Andrews, Mroczek, Ustun, &amp; Wittchen, 1998</xref>) was used to assess eight diagnostic categories of mental illness (nonaffective psychosis, bipolar disorder, MDD, generalized anxiety disorder, PTSD, social phobia, agoraphobia, and panic disorder). Our study was limited to measures of MDD, PTSD, and generalized anxiety disorder. The more favorable psychometric results for women in our study may be attributable to the focus on disorders more commonly found in women than in men, resulting in higher rates of misclassification in males.</p>
<p>When investigating the overall use of the K6 within this jail setting, our study also suggests that cut scores that are valid in general population studies may need to be adjusted for this unique population that often present with SMI and/or significant psychological distress when incarcerated. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306624X11420106">Kessler and colleagues (2002)</xref> recommend the use of a cut score of 13 only when there is an assumption that prevalence rates will be similar to those in general population samples. In clinical populations, the recommendation is to use the results of the specificity and sensitivity analyses to determine the best possible cut score. This follows a general recommendation that less stringent criteria should be applied when base rates are high; that is, in settings where disorders are more prevalent, such as jail, diagnostic cut points should be adjusted downward, to identify the higher proportion of individuals who are expected to have a disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0306624X11420106">Swets, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>The traditional general population-based cut score of 13 was somewhat problematic among this sample, as it resulted in a high proportion of false negatives or cases incorrectly identified as not having mental health problems. Results indicate that the K6 was most accurate in identifying individuals with any of the three disorders using a cut score of 6. However, this has significant implications for practice. Adjusting the cut score downward will substantially increase the number of individuals identified with mental health needs. Because screening for SMI is only one step in a process of mental health assessment and potential service provision, and jails have finite financial and staffing resources to devote to mental health treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0306624X11420106">Veysey, Stenius, Mazaden, &amp; Schacht, 2007</xref>), we must weigh the K6’s psychometric properties against the clinical detection and decision-making limitations inherent in the jail setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306624X11420106">Alexander, Haugland, Lin, Bertollo, &amp; McCorry, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0306624X11420106">Zimmerman, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, we should consider that our analysis was based on whether a few specific disorders were present or absent and not necessarily the symptom intensity or functional impairment experienced as a result of the disorder. Not all individuals in incarcerate settings meeting diagnostic criteria for depression or anxiety disorders are experiencing acute distress that results in significant impairment (e.g., GAF scores below 60). In some instances, the <italic>distress</italic> presented by individuals in jails causing them to meet diagnostic criteria may be situational as a manifestation of the setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0306624X11420106">Lindquist &amp; Lindquist, 1997</xref>). Subsequent research within a jail setting may be necessary to untangle some of this complexity.</p>
<sec id="section22-0306624X11420106">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study offers substantial insight into the process of screening for mental health needs among criminal justice populations; however, it is not without its limitations. Detainees were not randomly selected for participation and had varying lengths of stay at the time of assessment, indicating the need for future research to use sampling strategies that enhance the generalizability of findings. It is possible that more time in jail may increase (or decrease) distress compared with those just entering the facility, and a more systematic assessment—for example at jail entry—would increase the generalizability of findings to typical jail settings. However, a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306624X11420106">Steadman, Osher, Robbins, Case, and Samuels (2009)</xref> across two time periods in five jails situated in two states found similar prevalence rates. Using the SCID, with the PTSD module, prevalence estimates for SMI among women averaged 34% and 17% among males. In their study, the SCID was administered during booking period, thus eliminating variation due to time within the institution. That these estimates, holding time constant and using the SCID, so closely mirror our results give us further confidence in the K6.</p>
<p>Another limitation of this study was the absence of the SCID or other “gold standard” comparative measure to assess the validity and psychometric properties of the K6. However, the use of the disorder-specific measures builds on our understanding of the K6 and the specific mental health needs of the jail population. Moreover, our disorder-specific comparative measures (i.e., PHQ) have high overall accuracy when validated against the SCID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0306624X11420106">Spitzer et al., 1999</xref>) and have been widely used in research and practice. Furthermore, the initial establishment of validity on the K6 in a criminal justice–involved population, as established by Swartz and colleagues’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0306624X11420106">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0306624X11420106">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0306624X11420106">2007</xref>), used the SCID in comparative analyses. Finally, our study did not vary the order of the K6 with the touchstone instruments, leading to the possible priming of mental health symptoms among participants. Future research should attend to this limitation.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In jail settings, the use of an accurate and reliable screening instrument that is easy to administer and score by nonprofessionals is imperative. Although much recent attention has been directed to developing and empirically testing brief screening tools specifically for use in incarcerate settings, many of the instruments currently used in practice are of limited use with female detainees, leading some to suggest the use of two different instruments. However, this study supports previous research suggesting that the K6 may serve as an easily scored and administrated screening tool that can be used with male and female detainee populations in jail settings. Decisions about appropriate cut points within these settings must be made while balancing overall psychometric properties with the philosophical, fiscal, and resource limitations of the setting. Researchers, acting in concert with local institutions, may provide guidance to jail and mental health administrators as they struggle with this delicate balance.</p>
