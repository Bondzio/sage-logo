<abstract>
<p>In basement wall systems, airspaces can contribute in obtaining a higher thermal resistance, if a low-emissivity material such as reflective foil is installed within a furred-airspace. In this study, numerical simulations were conducted using the hygrothermal model ‘hygIRC-C’ that was developed at the National Research Council of Canada’s Institute for Research in Construction to investigate the steady-state and transient thermal performance of basement wall systems. This model solves simultaneously the energy equation in the various material layers, surface-to-surface radiation equation in the furred-airspace assembly, Navier–Stokes equation for the airspace, and Darcy and Brinkman equations for the porous material layers. The wall systems used in the simulations incorporate a low-emissivity material (foil with emissivity = 0.04) bonded to a moulded/expanded polystyrene foam that is installed in a furred-airspace assembly. The furring is installed horizontally and covered with a gypsum board. The structural element of the wall (external layer) is a poured-in-place concrete. Walls with and without furred-airspace assembly were considered in this study. Also, consideration was given to investigate the effect of the above-grade and below-grade portions of the wall on the thermal performance when these walls are subjected to two different Canadian climates. Results showed that at steady-state condition, the effective thermal resistance (<italic>R</italic>-value) of the wall with a furred-airspace assembly depends on the soil, outdoor, and indoor temperatures. Additionally, these wall configurations resulted in an energy savings of ~17% compared to walls without furred-airspace assembly when these walls are subjected to two different climate conditions.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>In many parts of the USA and other warmer countries, the house basement is considered to be outside the building envelope, whereas in Canada, the house basement is presumed to be inside the envelope. Over the past decades, a large proportion of newly built Canadian basements have become used as habitable space. This trend continues to drive builder marketing and energy performance requirements for new houses in many regions of Canada. Although not necessarily lived in, the basement spaces (and heated crawl spaces) are connected to the above-ground spaces through open stairwells and air circulation ducts in houses with forced-air systems. Indoor air in the basement, including its relative humidity, temperature, and its contaminants, is shared with the rest of the house. The National Building Code of Canada includes minimal requirements for basement spaces and recognizes this aspect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744259111411652">CMHC-Research Highlight, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Fundamental performance requirements for basements have been detailed in earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744259111411652">Kesik, 1997</xref>). However, a new development in reconciling expectations and requirements emerged during the early phases of the Basement Guidelines Project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744259111411652">Swinton and Kesik, 2005</xref>). It became apparent that in Canada, there exist diverse uses for basements, as well as diverse expectations on how it should perform. In the Basement Guidelines project, it was proposed that the marketplace would be well served by a classification system based on the intended use of the basement and the severity of environmental loads (e.g., accounting for locations that are subject to periodic flooding).</p>
<p>Heat loss from basements can account for a significant portion of the total heat loss from a home. It is clear that a home with a basement must have insulated basement walls. In older homes, heat loss from an un-insulated basement was estimated to account for up to one-third of the heating cost in some cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1744259111411652">Timusk, 1981</xref>). This varied depending on many factors, such as the air tightness of the building envelope, the amount of insulation in the house, and the height of the above-grade and below-grade portions of the basement wall systems. The need for basement wall insulation resulted in the development of many insulated basement systems now available to builders and consumers in the marketplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744259111411652">Swinton and Kesik, 2005</xref>). By improving basement thermal performance, the net cost of owning and operating homes can be reduced and moisture-related problems can be minimized as well.</p>
<p>Two questions can properly be raised: how much basement thermal insulation should be provided, and on which side of the wall should it go? While thermal insulation may be placed in three positions: on the inside, on the outside, and in the middle of the basement wall, the material choice and the insulation placement may affect the overall performance of the basement wall system. Some external insulation systems, in addition to controlling heat losses, may also increase the durability of the basement wall.</p>
<p>Exterior basement insulation performs many functions. It provides not only thermal resistance between the soil and the interior but also protects the structure from a challenging environment (e.g., moisture from wet soils, heaving, and adhering soils due to frost action). It provides a means of water management at the interface of the soil and insulation, while promoting drying out of the structure.</p>
<p>Assessing the thermal and moisture performance of exterior insulation basement systems was one among a range of investigations carried out within the basement guidelines project at the National Research Council Canada’s Institute for Research in Construction to assess their moisture control and thermal effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744259111411652">Swinton et al., 1999c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1744259111411652">2000a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1744259111411652">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1744259111411652">c</xref>). A detailed discussion of the results of these field investigations is available in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1744259111411652">Swinton et al., 1999b</xref>). Subsequently, the project consortium commissioned an economic study to assess the cost effectiveness of a number of basement systems employing a range of moisture protection and thermal insulation strategies, both exterior and interior. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744259111411652">Kesik (2000)</xref> represented the first opportunity to synthesize results from these related studies and to provide a comprehensive discussion of the findings.</p>
<p>Of the three insulation placement options (inside, outside, and in the middle of the foundation wall), the most common approach in Canada has been to insulate basements internally. It is believed that this market trend is driven mainly by economic considerations. Externally insulated basements have a major cost factor associated with protecting the exposed above-grade portion of the insulation assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744259111411652">Kesik, 2000</xref>) which, in the case of new construction, can involve shifting the house structure outward to compensate for the thickness of the exterior basement insulation.</p>
<p>As well, internally insulated basements are often coupled with interior basement finishing and therefore offer a ‘higher perceived value’ to the homebuyer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1744259111411652">Yost and Lstiburek, 2002</xref>). As such, the focus of this article is on innovative internally insulated basement wall systems, and specifically those featuring reflective foils facing air spaces in the basement wall assembly.</p>
<p>In this study, the NRC-IRC’s hygrothermal model ‘hygIRC-C’ is used to investigate both steady-state and transient thermal performance of basement wall systems. This model solves the 2D and 3D heat, air, and moisture (HAM) transport equations. This model was benchmarked against the hygIRC-2D model that was previously developed at NRC-IRC, and test results in a number of projects.</p>
<p>In the case of accounting for HAM transport, the 2D version of the present model was used to predict the drying rate of a number of full-scale wall assemblies subjected to different time-dependent exterior and interior boundary conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744259111411652">Saber et al., 2010c</xref>). The results showed that the overall agreements between the present model and the hygIRC-2D model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744259111411652">Maref et al., 2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744259111411652">b</xref>) as well as the experimental measurements were good.</p>
<p>In the case of accounting for heat and air transport (no moisture transport), the 3D version of the present model was used to conduct numerical simulations for different full-scale wall assemblies with and without penetration to represent a window in order to predict the effective thermal resistance (<italic>R</italic>-value) with and without air leakage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744259111411652">Elmahdy et al., 2009</xref>). The predicted <italic>R</italic>-values for these walls were in good agreement (within ±5%) with the measured <italic>R</italic>-values in guarded hot box (GHB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744259111411652">Saber et al., 2010b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744259111411652">2011a</xref>). Also, the present model was used to assess the dynamic heat transmission characteristics through two insulating concrete form wall specimens installed in the NRC-IRC’s field exposure of walls facility (FEWF). The results showed that the present model predictions were in good agreement with experimental data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744259111411652">Saber et al., 2010a</xref>).</p>
<p>For foundation wall systems, airspace can contribute in obtaining a higher <italic>R</italic>-value, if a low-emissivity material such as aluminum foil is installed within a furred-airspace assembly (FAA). The impact of low-emissivity on <italic>R</italic>-value was examined in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744259111411652">Saber and Swinton, 2010</xref>). In that study, the 2D version of the present model was used to conduct sensitivity parametric analyses in order to investigate the effect of low emissivity of foil laminated to extruded polystyrene foam when used within a furred-airspace assembly. In that work, furring strips made of spruce (19 × 38 mm<sup>2</sup>) were installed horizontally. Since there were no vertical studs in the wall assembly, the 2D version of the present model was suitable for this study. The results showed that the modeled foundation wall system with foil of emissivity 0.05 increased the effective <italic>R</italic>-value by ∼10% in the case of the indoor and outdoor temperatures of +20°C and –20°C, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744259111411652">Saber and Swinton, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744259111411652">Saber et al., 2011b</xref>), the 3D version of the present model was benchmarked against the experimental data of a full-scale above-grade wall system consisting of 2″ × 6″ wood frame construction with stud cavities filled with friction-fit glass fiber batt insulation and a foil bonded to wood fiberboard installed in a furred-assembly (the foil is facing the airspace and the interior finishes). Results showed that the predicted <italic>R</italic>-value of this wall specimen (4.19 m<sup>2</sup> K/W) was in good agreement with the measured value (4.24 m<sup>2</sup> K/W) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744259111411652">Saber et al., 2011b</xref>). Thereafter, the present model was used to quantify the contribution of low foil emissivity to the wall <italic>R</italic>-value. The results showed that a wall system with foil emissivity of 0.04 can increase the wall <italic>R</italic>-value by 0.34 m<sup>2</sup> K/W (2 ft<sup>2</sup> h°F/BTU) compared to the case of no foil installed in the wall system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744259111411652">Saber et al., 2011b</xref>).</p>
<p>The objective of this article is to use the present model to investigate the change in the effective <italic>R</italic>-value at steady-state conditions and transient thermal response of full-scale foundation wall systems (including the above-grade and below-grade portions of the wall) with low-emissivity material and furred-airspace assemblies when these walls are subjected to different Canadian climates. Additionally, the present model is used to conduct transient simulations in order to determine the energy savings due to having foundation wall system with FAA compared to a foundation wall system without furred-airspace assembly. No moisture transport is accounted for in this study. The present model solves simultaneously the energy equation in the various material layers, surface-to-surface radiation equation in the furred-airspace assembly, Navier–Stokes equation for the airspace, and Darcy equation (Darcy number &lt; 10<sup>–6</sup>), and Brinkman equation (Darcy number &gt; 10<sup>–6</sup>) for the porous material layers. The full descriptions of the present model are available in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744259111411652">Saber and Swinton (2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744259111411652">Saber et al.

<title>Wall description, assumptions, and initial and boundary conditions</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1744259111411652">Figure 1</xref> shows a basement wall system with foil bonded to expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam in a FAA having airspace next to the foil. The measured foil emissivity of 0.04 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744259111411652">Saber et al. 2011b</xref>) was used in this study. The FAA consists of 19 × 64 mm<sup>2</sup> wood furring strips installed horizontally at 406 mm (16″) center-to-center and was closed with a gypsum board (12.7 mm thick). The structural element of the wall (external layer) is a poured-in-place concrete (200 mm thick). Two basement walls were modeled with above-grade and below-grade heights of 598 and 1,840 mm (Wall-FAA1), and 495 and 1943 mm (Wall-FAA2), respectively. Consideration was given to investigate the effect of the climate conditions on the wall thermal performance. The soil temperatures were measured at ∼2 m away from the walls at five different elevations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1744259111411652">Figure 1</xref>). In order to quantify the contribution of having a FAA with foil bounded to EPS foam on the energy savings, two reference walls were considered. These reference walls are Wall-R1 and Wall-R2, which are identical to Wall-FAA1 and Wall-FAA2, respectively, but without FAA. It was assumed that all material layers and the soil are in good contact. Since there were no vertical studs in the wall assembly and that the furring is installed horizontally, the 2D version of the present model is suitable for this study.</p>

<p>An initial and uniform temperature of 10°C was assumed in the different components of wall systems and soil. The boundary conditions used in the numerical simulations are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1744259111411652">Figure 1</xref>. At the left boundary of the soil (2 m away from the wall), the temperature was measured at five locations (at <italic>y</italic> = 0, 500, 1100, 1570, and 1690 mm for Wall-FAA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744259111411652">Swinton et al., 1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744259111411652">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744259111411652">Maref et al., 2000</xref>), and at <italic>y</italic> = 0, 483, 1092, 1549, and 1943 mm for Wall-FAA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744259111411652">Armstrong et al., 2011</xref>)) and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1744259111411652">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1744259111411652">3</xref>, for Wall-FAA1 and Wall-FAA2, respectively. These measured temperatures were taken as temperature boundary condition at the left boundary of the soil. Between these measured locations, however, the temperature of the soil at the left boundary was evaluated from the measured temperatures by linear interpolation. Both the top boundary of the soil and the left boundary of the above-grade portion of the wall system are subjected to convective boundary conditions with an effective heat transfer coefficient of 22.1 W/(m<sup>2</sup>K) and an air temperature equal to the measured outdoor temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1744259111411652">Figure 4(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1744259111411652">(b)</xref>). Similarly, the interior surface of the gypsum board is subjected to a convective boundary condition with an effective heat transfer coefficient of 7.11 W/(m<sup>2</sup>K) and an air temperature equal to the measured indoor temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1744259111411652">Figure 4(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1744259111411652">(b)</xref>).

<p>The boundary condition on the bottom boundary of the walls and soil is assumed to be adiabatic. During some periods within the year, the bottom boundary may lose/gain heat. As such, the predicted thermal performances of different wall systems in this study are qualitative performances. To predict the quantitative thermal performance, however, the soil temperature under the wall systems needs to be measured and taken as a temperature boundary condition instead of applying adiabatic boundary condition at the bottom boundary of the wall systems. On the other hand, these temperatures were not measured. Because all boundary conditions described in this section for walls with FAA (Wall-FAA1 and Wall-FAA2) are taken to be the same as for walls without FAA (reference walls: Wall-R1 and Wall-R2), it might be urged that the difference in the thermal performance of these walls would reflect the contribution due to the FAA.</p>

<title>Material properties</title>
<p>The properties of the soil depend on the type of soil and its moisture content. Even for the same type of the soil, these properties change widely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744259111411652">Ren et al., 2003</xref>).

<p>To account for the heat transfer by radiation in the furred-airspace assemblies, the opacity of the airspace is considered as transparent so that the radiation rays from the surface boundaries of the airspace enclosure (foil, furring, and drywall) are not blocked. Since there is no radiation through the solid material layers, both furring and drywall are treated as opaque bodies. The accumulation of dust particles and/or condensation on the surface of the foil will affect the foil emissivity. In previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744259111411652">Saber and Swinton, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744259111411652">Saber et al., 2011b</xref>), numerical simulations were conducted to obtain the <italic>R</italic>-value as a function of the foil emissivity (ranging from 0 up to 0.9). The results showed that increasing the foil emissivity from 0.04 (measured value for a clean foil) to 0.9 (foil surface is fully covered by dust, or no foil installed in the wall system) resulted in a decrease in <italic>R</italic>-value by ∼9% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744259111411652">Saber et al., 2011b</xref>). In this study, a foil emissivity of 0.04 was taken equal to the measured value and the emissivity of the furring and drywall was assumed equal to 0.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744259111411652">Saber et al., 2011b</xref>).</p>

<p>It was shown in previous studies for above-grade wall systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744259111411652">Saber and Swinton, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744259111411652">Saber et al., 2011b</xref>) that a foil with low emissivity has two interactive and competing effects on the wall <italic>R</italic>-value, namely: (1) an increase in wall <italic>R</italic>-value due to lower net radiative heat flux in the furred-airspace assembly, and (2) a decrease in <italic>R</italic>-value due to stronger convection currents in the airspace. The former effect outweighs the latter effect, resulting in a net increase in the effective <italic>R</italic>-value for a wall system with low foil emissivity. In this study, the effect of both above- and below-grade portions of the wall on the effective <italic>R</italic>-value as well as the transient thermal response of walls with and without FAA are investigated. The numerical simulations were conducted for a period of 2 years for all wall systems.

<p>In the above-grade portion of the wall at <italic>t</italic> = 7 days, the outdoor temperature (22.6°C) is close to the indoor temperature (20.7°C). As such, the temperature distribution in the upper two airspaces is approximately uniform, resulting in no convection current in these airspaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1744259111411652">Figure 7(a)</xref>). In the below-grade portion of the wall at this time (<italic>t</italic> = 7 days); however, the lowest soil temperature occurred in the lower portion of the wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1744259111411652">Figure 5</xref>). As such, the temperature gradient across the FAA decreases with the distance along the wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1744259111411652">Figure 6(a)</xref>), resulting in a stronger convection current in the lower airspaces than in the upper airspaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1744259111411652">Figure 7(a)</xref>). Conversely, in the above-grade portion of the wall at <italic>t</italic> = 147 days, the outdoor temperature (5.4°C) is lower than the indoor temperature (22.2°C) resulting in a high-temperature gradient across the upper portion of the FAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1744259111411652">Figure 6(b)</xref>). As such, strong convection current occurred in the upper two airspaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1744259111411652">Figure 7(b)</xref>). In the below-grade portion of the wall at this time (<italic>t</italic> = 147 days), the highest soil temperature occurred at the bottom of the wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1744259111411652">Figure 5</xref>). As such, the temperature gradient across the FAA increases with the distance along the wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1744259111411652">Figure 6(b)</xref>), resulting in a stronger convection current in the upper airspaces than that in the lower airspaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1744259111411652">Figure 7(b)</xref>).</p>
<p>A similar trend in terms of the temperature and velocity distributions in the FAA occurred in both the above- and below-grade portions of the wall at <italic>t</italic> = 231 days as that at <italic>t</italic> = 147 days. However, because both outdoor and soil temperatures at <italic>t</italic> = 231 days are lower than that at <italic>t</italic> = 147 days, the convection current in the airspaces at <italic>t</italic> = 231 days is stronger than that at <italic>t</italic> = 147s day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1744259111411652">Figure 7(b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1744259111411652">(c)</xref>). For example, the highest vertical upward velocity at <italic>t</italic> = 231 day is 38.91 mm/s, which is about 71% higher than that at <italic>t</italic> = 147 days (22.69 mm/s). As such, the thermal conductance of the FAA at <italic>t</italic> = 231 days is greater than that at <italic>t</italic> = 147 days, resulting in a lower <italic>R</italic>-value at the former than at the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1744259111411652">Figure 8</xref>).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1744259111411652">Figure 8</xref> shows the dependence of the effective <italic>R</italic>-value of Wall-FAA1 on the environmental conditions (soil, outdoor, and indoor temperatures) during the first year of simulation at steady-state conditions. As indicated earlier, the temperature measurements of the soil, outdoor, and indoor were averaged over a period of 2 weeks. Because the outdoor and indoor conditions affected the radiation and convection in the airspace for Wall-FAA1, the obtained <italic>R</italic>-value is affected by these conditions. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1744259111411652">Figure 8</xref>, the lower temperature gradient across the wall results in a higher effective <italic>R</italic>-value. The highest effective <italic>R</italic>-value of this wall was 2.81 m<sup>2</sup>K/W which occurred at <italic>t</italic> = 91 days. Additionally, the lowest effective <italic>R</italic>-value (2.73 m<sup>2</sup>K/W) occurred at <italic>t</italic> = 231 day, at which Wall-FAA1 was subjected to the highest temperature gradient across it. During the first year, the maximum change in the effective <italic>R</italic>-value was ∼3% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1744259111411652">Figure 8</xref>). Similarly, the <italic>R</italic>-value for wall without FAA (Wall-R1) was calculated at different outdoor and indoor conditions. However, for Wall-R1 (200 mm concrete, 76.2 mm EPS, and 12.7 mm gypsum), the <italic>R</italic>-value is not affected by the outdoor and indoor conditions. This is because the thermal conductivity of the different layers was taken constant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744259111411652">Table 1</xref>). The obtained nominal <italic>R</italic>-value for Wall-R1 was 2.28 m<sup>2</sup>K/W, and the yearly average <italic>R</italic>-value of Wall-FAA1 was 2.77 m<sup>2</sup>K/W, which is 21.5% higher than Wall-R1. As such, it is expected that the heat loss from Wall-FAA1 will be smaller than that from Wall-R1 as explained below.</p>

<title>Transient simulations for predicting energy use</title>
<p>Four transient numerical simulations were conducted for a period of 2 years in order to quantify the contribution of having FAA with low foil emissivity (0.04) bonded to EPS foam on the energy savings.

In these figures, positive and negative heat rates represent heat gain (i.e., heat into the building) and heat loss (i.e., heat out the building), respectively. As shown in these figures, the rate of heat loss from walls with FAA (Wall-FAA1 and Wall-FAA2) is lower than that for walls without FAA (Wall-R1 and Wall-R2). For example, the heat loss from Wall-FAA1 at <italic>t</italic> = 270 day is 1510 KJ/(d…m), which is about ∼16% lower than that for Wall-R1 (1745 KJ/(d…m)). Furthermore, for Wall-FAA1 and Wall-R1, the heat gain during 2 years is approximately 0 (i.e. no cooling load is needed). While, for Wall-FAA2 and Wall-R2, there is heat gain during the summer of the first year (i.e., cooling load is needed) and approximately no heat gain during the summer of the second year.</p>

<title>Summary and conclusions</title>
<p>The present model was used to conduct numerical simulations in order to investigate the steady-state and transient thermal performance of a foundation wall system (including the above-grade and below-grade portions of the wall) having a FAA that incorporates a low-emissivity material (foil). This model was benchmarked in a previous study by comparing its predictions against experimental data generated by a commercial laboratory for an above-grade wall assembly. The external layer of the foundation wall is poured-in-place concrete and the internal layer is gypsum board. In order to quantify the contribution of a FAA with foil bounded to EPS foam on the energy savings in foundation wall systems (Wall-FAA1 and Wal-FAA2), two reference walls were considered in this study (Wall R1 and R2). These reference walls are identical to Wall-FAA1 and Wall-FAA2 but without FAA. Walls with and without FAA were subjected to two different climate loads where the measurements of soil temperature (2 m away from the wall), outdoor temperature, and indoor temperature were used. Results showed that at steady-state condition, the effective <italic>R</italic>-value of wall with FAA can vary by as much as ∼3%, depending on the soil, outdoor, and indoor temperatures through the year. Moreover, these wall configurations resulted in an energy savings of ∼17% compared to the walls without FAA. This is on-going research. The present model will be used to investigate the transient thermal response of foundation wall systems with furring installed vertically, and subjected to different Canadian climate conditions. The results of this effort will be reported at a later date.</p>
