<abstract>
<p><italic>Background</italic>: Computerized software programs reduce errors and increase consistency when ordering parenteral nutrition (PN). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of our computerized neonatal PN calculator ordering program in reducing errors and optimizing nutrient intake. <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>: This was a retrospective study of infants requiring PN during the first 2–3 weeks of life. Caloric, protein, calcium, and phosphorus intakes; days above and below amino acid (AA) goals; and PN ordering errors were recorded. Infants were divided into 3 groups by birth weight for analysis: ≤1000 g, 1001–1500 g, and &gt;1500 g. Intakes and outcomes of infants before (2007) vs after (2009) implementation of the calculator for each group were compared. <italic>Results</italic>: There were no differences in caloric, protein, or phosphorus intakes in 2007 vs 2009 in any group. Mean protein intakes were 97%–99% of goal for ≤1000-g and 1001- to 1500-g infants in 2009 vs 87% of goal for each group in 2007. In 2007, 7.6 per 100 orders were above and 11.5 per 100 were below recommended AA intakes. Calcium intakes were higher in 2009 vs 2007 in ≤1000-g (46.6 ± 6.1 vs 39.5 ± 8.0 mg/kg/d, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and &gt;1500-g infants (50.6 ± 7.4 vs 39.9 ± 8.3 mg/kg/d, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Ordering errors were reduced from 4.6 per 100 in 2007 to 0.1 per 100 in 2009. <italic>Conclusion</italic>: Our study reaffirms that computerized ordering systems can increase the quality and safety of neonatal PN orders. Calcium and AA intakes were optimized and ordering errors were minimized using the computer-based ordering program.</p>

<p>Early nutrition support of very low birth weight neonatal patients has been a primary concern in the newborn intensive care unit (NICU). Most infants with birth weights ≤1500 g as well as infants with gastrointestinal (GI) abnormalities are unable to tolerate oral feedings in amounts that promote growth during the first days and weeks after birth and, therefore, require support with parenteral nutrition (PN). The issue of postnatal malnutrition due to increasing protein and caloric deficits that accrue during the first 1–2 weeks in low birth weight preterm infants was identified by Embleton et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533613490741">1</xref></sup> Many very low birth weight infants are below the 10th percentile for growth at the time of discharge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533613490741">2</xref></sup> More recently, studies have indicated that earlier provision of increased parenteral amino acids and calories can positively affect growth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533613490741">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533613490741">4</xref></sup> Early growth in the NICU has been shown to correlate with neurodevelopmental outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533613490741">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533613490741"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533613490741">7</xref></sup></p>

<p>We have developed a neonatal PN calculator/order program for the NICU at Randall Children’s Hospital. The calculator/order program was introduced into the NICU in January 2008. During 2008, with input from dietitians, pharmacists, physicians, neonatal nurse practitioners, and nurses caring for infants in the NICU, the calculator was modified to maximize ease of use, work flow, and safety features. The purpose of this study was to perform a before-and-after evaluation of the effectiveness of the calculator to decrease the need for pharmacy to contact healthcare team members to ensure appropriate orders and optimize nutrient intake in the first 2 weeks of life for patients in the NICU.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-0884533613490741">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>This study was a retrospective study comparing PN orders for infants admitted to the NICU at Randall Children’s Hospital at Legacy Emanuel during 2007, the last full year prior to introduction of the calculator/order program, with those for infants admitted to the NICU during 2009, the first full year after all significant modifications of the program were completed. All infants with a birth weight (BW) ≤1500 g, as well as larger infants with GI abnormalities requiring surgical intervention, who received support with PN for at least 5 days and also survived until at least day of life (DOL) 8, were included in the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0884533613490741">
<title>PN Calculator/Order Program</title>
<p>The program was developed using an Excel (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA) spreadsheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0884533613490741">Figure 1</xref>). Cells with a red background are those that require input when completing the form. Cells with a red or blue border are optional. Areas with a green border contain recommended doses or limits for amino acid (AA), mineral, and electrolyte intakes, as well as osmolality of the ordered PN solution. The recommended AA intake is calculated based on a minimum nonprotein calorie to gram of AA ratio of 18:1. The maximum appropriate amount of AA is ordered by the calculator unless the ordering provider selects an indication and then modifies the dose using the key in the green section on the order form. In addition, total protein intakes (the sum of AA and enteral protein) are limited based on the infant’s BW. For BW ≤1500 g, the limit is 4 g/kg/d; for 1501–2500 g, it is 3.5 g/kg/d; and for &gt;2500 g, it is 3 g/kg/d.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533613490741">12</xref></sup> Enteral caloric, protein, and electrolyte intakes are calculated based on the choice of milk. The milks in each category are grouped due to similar content of these constituents. Total intakes of fluids, calories, protein, and electrolytes include those from PN plus enteral intake.</p>

<p>The calculator accepts a maximum intake of 2 mmol/kg/d of phosphorus (P) but recommends a suggested intake based on the AA concentration of the PN solution and the appropriate calcium (Ca)/P precipitation curve to optimize the Ca intake. We use calcium chloride (CaCl) preferentially due to the lower aluminum content.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533613490741">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Maximum electrolyte intakes are based on limits determined by the type of intravenous (IV) infusion line. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0884533613490741">Figure 2</xref> illustrates a completed order form. For all entries, limits are set by using the “data validation” feature of the Excel software, and an entry is rejected and an error message appears if these limits are exceeded. It should be noted that the trace metal orders in our calculator/order form were modified in 2011 to reflect recent changes in trace metal recommendations for neonatal PN. We no longer routinely use multitrace preparations due to the high manganese and chromium content of these preparations.</p>

<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Patient medical and NICU nutrition records were reviewed for data collection. BW and gestational age (GA) at birth, average weight gain through DOL 28, and peak plasma alkaline phosphatase (AP) levels at DOL ≤30 were recorded. Ordered parenteral and enteral fluid, calorie, and total protein intakes, but only parenteral Ca and P intakes, were recorded from PN order sheets. DOL on which minimal optimal caloric as well as AA intake was initially ordered was also recorded. For infants ≤1500 g BW, these goals were 90 kcal/kg/d and 3.5 g/kg/d, respectively. For larger infants, the goals were 90 kcal/kg/d and 2.5 g/kg/d.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533613490741">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533613490741">14</xref></sup> The study was approved by the investigational review board for Legacy Hospital Systems.</p>
<p>Days above goal for AA intakes were defined as those where the AA intake exceeded that based on a minimum nonprotein calorie to gram of AA ratio of 18:1 by at least 0.5 g/kg/d or exceeded the maximum total protein intakes for BW as defined above. This was determined for 2007 by entering the ordered intakes from a copy of the infant’s actual paper order form into the calculator/order program and comparing the 2 orders. Days below goal for AA intakes were defined as being at least 0.5 g/kg/d less than the optimal intake based on the recommended intake computed by the calculator. Any instance where the NICU pharmacist had to return the order to the provider for modification due to incompatibilities or for ordered intakes exceeding limits on the Baxa Exactamix 2400 Compounder (Baxa Corporation, Englewood, CO) was also recorded. Data for analysis were compiled from patient records by neonatal dietitians and the lead author (RKH).</p>

<sec id="section5-0884533613490741">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Data were entered into an Excel (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA) spreadsheet by the lead author (RKH). Subjects were grouped according to BW as follows: ≤1000 g, 1001–1500 g, and &gt;1500 g. Primary outcomes were DOL minimal optimal calorie and DOL that minimal optimal AA intake were ordered; average calorie, protein, Ca, and P intakes; average 28-day weight gain; and peak AP level during the first 30 days. Means and standard deviations were computed using the Excel software. Comparisons were made between years (2007 vs 2009) for each group using Student <italic>t</italic> tests performed with the Excel software.</p>

<title>Baseline Characteristics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0884533613490741">Table 1</xref>)</title>
<p>There were no significant differences in these parameters when comparing 2007 with 2009 for any of the 3 study groups except for a lower PN fluid intake for 2009 compared with 2007 in the 1001- to 1500-g BW group. This was due to decreased total fluid intake in 2009 for this group. The most common surgical diagnosis in the &gt;1500-g group for both years was congenital diaphragmatic hernia (44% for 2007 and 2009) followed by gastroschisis (22% in 2007 and 38% in 2009). The remaining infants had esophageal atresia, intestinal atresia, or omphalocele.</p>

<p>There were no significant differences in P intakes or AP levels. Ca intakes were significantly higher in 2009 compared with 2007 in the ≤1000-g and &gt;1500-g groups. In 2009, the calcium intake in the 1001- to 1500-g group was lower than that of the other 2 groups. The lack of a significant increase in Ca intake in 1001- to 1500-g infants is likely due to the decreased PN fluid intake in 2009.</p>

<p>Only 1 order was returned to the ordering provider by the pharmacist in 2009 compared with a total of 40 in 2007. The issue in 2009 was due to a high sodium intake.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study reveals that the PN calculator/order program, as we designed it, did not significantly affect calorie or total protein intake during the first 2 weeks or weight gain through DOL 28. After introduction of the calculator, protein intakes were closer to goals for weight group and more appropriate based on the nonprotein kcal/g AA, however. The need for an appropriate nonprotein calorie to gram of AA ratio has been discussed by Kashyap and Schultz.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533613490741">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533613490741">16</xref></sup> A recent study reporting decreased postnatal growth failure in extremely premature infants demonstrates the importance of providing adequate early nonprotein calories in addition to adequate protein intake.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0884533613490741">17</xref></sup> This need appears to be supported by the works of Blanco et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533613490741">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0884533613490741">19</xref></sup> which report high plasma AA levels in infants ≤1000 g BW receiving 4 g/kg/d of AA compared with controls on study day 3, when the nonprotein calorie to gram of AA ratio is 12:1, but AA levels similar to controls on study day 7, when the ratio has increased to 18:1. Making this calculation is time-consuming. There is also a need to include enteral as well as parenteral protein intake when configuring nutrition orders for neonatal patients to prevent excessive protein intake, as has been noted by Balakrishnan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0884533613490741">20</xref></sup> The calculator program makes these calculations and orders the appropriate amount of AA in all orders.</p>
<p>Our study indicates that the Ca chloride intake can be increased when a calculator program is used to optimize intakes based on the AA concentration and an appropriate precipitation curve. Porcelli and Block<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0884533613490741">21</xref></sup> have reported a similar increase in Ca gluconate intakes in neonatal patients using a computer program that included calculations based on the AA concentration and an appropriate precipitation curve.</p>
<p>Lehmann et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533613490741">10</xref></sup> have reported the ability to decrease the incidence of inappropriate orders from 10.8 per 100 to 1.2 per 100 using an online computer-based ordering system for neonatal PN orders. We were able to reduce the incidence of inappropriate orders from 4.6 per 100 to 0.1 per 100 using our program. Most of the errors we found in 2007 were related to Ca/P orders. The potential risk from incompatible Ca/P orders has been discussed recently.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0884533613490741">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0884533613490741">23</xref></sup> The ability to eliminate incompatible Ca/P orders by using a computerized ordering system that integrates the appropriate Ca/P precipitation curve into the calculation provides a significant degree of added safety for PN ordering systems.</p>
<p>Costakos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533613490741">11</xref></sup> has discussed the issue of providing a means for safe and efficient PN ordering systems for neonatal patients and notes the trend for the increasing use of computerized ordering systems for neonatal PN orders. The unique requirements of neonatal patients have led to the implementation of institution-specific approaches to computerized ordering systems for neonatal PN. Industry-produced hospital computerized ordering systems have been based on adult PN ordering practices and have not met the needs of neonatal patients.</p>
<p>However, industry-based ordering systems that are integrated into computerized medical record systems may decrease inconsistencies when transferring patients within or between institutions, as well as reduce potential errors in system development. Software errors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0884533613490741">24</xref></sup> have led to federal regulations to validate accuracy, reliability, and performance for medical devices (Title Code 21). A comparison of the potential advantages of individual unit–produced vs industry-produced ordering systems is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0884533613490741">Table 4</xref>. Although we have structured our electronic medical record–based ordering system (EPIC Systems Corporation, Verona, WI) and our compounder so that PN orders in these 2 programs are entered in the same order and in the same units as our calculator/order program, the pharmacist still has to enter orders separately into each program after receiving the calculator-based order, which can increase the risk of order entry errors. We believe that the volume of neonatal PN orders produced daily in the neonatal patient population, combined with the potential for decreasing errors and improving the quality of orders that can be achieved by having an industry-based computerized ordering system that meets the needs of neonatal patients, should be an incentive for industry development of such a system. Ideally, combining the advantages of the currently available options as noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0884533613490741">Table 4</xref> would be a goal in program development.</p>

<p>Our study is limited by being a retrospective study with small numbers of patients in each study group. The study is complicated by the fact that our goals for total protein intakes were decreased in 2009 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0884533613490741">Table 2</xref>). This was due to some concerns in the literature at that time with regard to possible elevated AA levels and metabolic intolerance related to higher early AA intake.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533613490741">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0884533613490741">25</xref></sup> A strength of our study is that our results appear to be consistent across a range of BW groups.</p>
