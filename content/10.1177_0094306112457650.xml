<p><italic>Numerical Context for What Follows</italic>: About 14,000 people pay annual membership dues to the American Sociological Association these days in a country of about 315M (about .00044 of the total population), whereas in 1921 when the U.S. population was 108M, 923 did so (.0000854 of the total), ballooning to 1,567 in 1931, retreating to 999 in 1939, and slightly regaining ground to 1,082 in 1943 in a country of 137M (.0000072 of the total) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0094306112457650">Rosich 2005</xref>, p. 140; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094306112457650">Camic 2007</xref>, pp. 229, 242; Census Bureau.) Meanwhile, in 1920 fewer than 600,000 students occupied college and university seats (.0056 of total population), 100,000 fewer attended during the Depression, with growth to 1.1M by 1944 (.0079 of total population) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0094306112457650">Hinkle 1994</xref>, p.13). Today about 19.7M people are enrolled in U.S. higher educational institutions, about 6.25% of the total population, meaning that compared with 1921, the proportion of the total population who are college students now is about 11 times what it was then.</p>
<p><italic>What Follows</italic>: It was once widely known among sociologists that in 1921 Robert E. Park and Ernest W. Burgess persuaded their colleagues at the University of Chicago Press (who probably trembled at the palpable risk) to publish a 1,040-page doorstopper called <italic>Introduction to the Science of Sociology</italic>, weighing several pounds. They had the moxie to press the issue because twelve years earlier their senior colleague, W. I. Thomas, had used the same publisher to print his 948-page <italic>Source Book for Social Origins</italic>, and they had expressly imitated his model, then improved on it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0094306112457650">Faris 1970</xref>, p. 38; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0094306112457650">Janowitz 1969</xref>, p. vii].) Before it was declared out of print in June, 1943 (when the metal plates used to fabricate the book were possibly requisitioned for war use, as had been those prepared by McGraw-Hill for Talcott Parsons’ <italic>The Structure of Social Action</italic> in 1937), the book had sold over 30,000 copies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0094306112457650">Janowitz 1969</xref>, p.vii). Using enrollment proportions from 1943, this would be equivalent to an “intro soash” book today selling 332,000 copies or more, given the popularity of sociology courses now relative to then.</p>
<p>But this compendium was not just another beginner’s textbook, of which by that time there were already a number in print. This <italic>Introduction</italic> single-handedly shaped the Chicago tradition at its best in a way that no other textbook or sourcebook has since influenced any other major sociology department, not even Parsons’ 1937 masterpiece at Harvard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094306112457650">Abbott 1999</xref>, pp. 70, 96, 201; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0094306112457650">Faris 1970</xref>, pp. 37-50). It became the totem for the Chicago tribe, and was perceived as such from the beginning. The originator himself of Chicago sociology, Albion Small, correctly predicted when writing the president of the University in 1921 that “the book is such a decided advance upon anything previously produced as a college textbook that it cannot fail to be the foremost standardizer of college teaching of sociology for a long time to come” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094306112457650">Bulmer 1984</xref>, p. 112). As it turned out, this understated the case. The book delivered to the Chicagoans and all their academic followers across the country a ready-made scholarly <italic>Weltanschauung</italic> which propelled them to produce exemplary studies.</p>
<p>As Janowitz pointed out in his introduction to the reissued edition, “There was no conscious effort at popularization of an academic specialty to reach a wider undergraduate audience. It contained no photographs or wide margins as has become the practice for social science textbooks. There was no doubt that it was designed for the classroom and the increasing numbers of undergraduates . . . As a treatise, it was simultaneously addressed to graduate students throughout the country for whom it became known as ‘the green bible’ as they prepared for their doctoral examinations and research endeavors. Park and Burgess thought of it as a reasoned statement of the theoretical state of the discipline, and they were prepared to have it evaluated as such by mature scholars in the field” (<italic>ibid</italic>., p. v). Janowitz, godfather to the vast Heritage of Sociology Series in which he placed the reprinted <italic>Introduction</italic>, was wise enough to edit the full 1,040-page original down to a mere 450-page “student edition” in paperback. For this ancillary volume he wrote a feisty introduction wherein the Chicago style of fieldwork, combined with social psychology, stood its ground against the challenges posed to it by Harvard, Columbia, and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Judging from the four copies currently available on the international secondary market, the paperback abridgement did not sell well, and nor did the clothbound complete edition from 1969. There are three copies being offered for sale at this writing: one in the United Kingdom, one in Germany, and the last in Massachusetts, with an asking price of $525. Thus it seems that Janowitz’s hope of relegitimating the “Chicago style” of sociology by reprinting its single greatest proselytizing text did not succeed which, given the flavor of campus life in 1969, and particularly at Chicago, conforms to expectations.</p>
<p>Many scholars during the last several decades have written about sociology at Chicago during its heyday, and not a few of them criticize its founders’ patriarchalism, its political-economics, stance toward European theorizing, racism when judged by our tastes, and so on (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094306112457650">Deegan 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094306112457650">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0094306112457650">Harvey 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0094306112457650">Smith 1988</xref>; for a review of this literature see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094306112457650">Abbott 1999</xref>: pp. 10-18). Fewer commentators have examined “The Green Bible” specifically, none with more insight than Robert E. Lee Faris, who followed his father through the Chicago graduate program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0094306112457650">Faris, 1967</xref>, pp. 37-50). He points out that the book did not advance a “new” theory, but it did organize an astonishing range of “materials,” as they called them, under headings and with introductions that made applicable sense to students and their teachers at the time. Burgess wrote rough drafts, Park refined or rewrote them, and Burgess polished their commentaries, which were filled with admonitions to prospective social researchers. As Faris noted, “The entire treatment of human nature. . . satisfactorily supported the main theme—human nature is a product of social living. Sociology was thereby freed from the excessive and unrewarding dependence regarding this subject on specialists in the field of biology” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0094306112457650">Faris 1970</xref>: 47). This very debate, from <italic>The Bell Curve</italic> forward, has returned in more subtle form, as does virtually every important angle on understanding human motivation and action.</p>
<p>Park and Burgess thought that sociology had to move out of the nineteenth century, away from the speculations of Sumner, Ward, and Giddings, and into new, empirically testable terrain based on fieldwork and what came to be called “grounded theory”: “Sociological research is at present in about the situation in which psychology was before the introduction of laboratory methods” (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0094306112457650">Short 1971</xref>, p. xiii). But more than that, they introduced sociology to thousands of students and their teachers by means of a very broadly defined body of seminal texts. Rather than cutting sociology off from other “competing” fields of learning and locking it into its private, separate zone of endeavor, jealously guarding its borders, Park and Burgess used their own capacious reading and study to weave the sociological vision into already existing literatures, far-flung and fascinating. In this pivotal mode of thinking, they distanced themselves from other textbooks of the time and also, more importantly for us, from every introductory textbook that has been published for the last 50 years. One can reasonably argue that today’s college students, most of the 20 million, are not equipped to comprehend the kinds of “materials” that filled the 1,040 pages of the Green Bible, which is perhaps one reason why Janowitz’s reprints of the book sold poorly. This is appealing but not entirely plausible. Students comprehend difficult subject matter in many courses, but what they are now asked to learn in sociology’s first course would, I am sure, embarrass Park and Burgess to read—not because today’s textbooks are vacuous, but because they are narrow. Park and Burgess had the great luxury of breadth, which for students at all levels is a great gift.</p>
<p>“Sociology and the Social Sciences” (in part an <italic>AJS</italic> article by Park) consumes the first 57 pages of the book, followed by a bibliography of 48 items with subheads, 15 journals in four languages, and 50 questions for discussion (“No. 24. What is the difference between group mind and group consciousness as indicated in current usage in the phrases ‘urban mind,’ ‘rural mind,’ ‘public mind,’ ‘race consciousness,’ ‘national consciousness,’ ‘class consciousness’?”). Consider the sources quoted in the footnotes to the first 20 pages of the book: Harriet Martineau, Montesquieu, Hume, Condorcet, Paul Barth, Saint-Simon, Heny Adams, James Harvey Robinson, a long quotation from Park’s dissertation director in Germany, Wilhelm Windelband, regarding the <italic>Geisteswissenschaften</italic> versus the <italic>Naturwissenschaften</italic>, Heinrich Rickert, Simmel, Croce, Arthur Thomson, Karl Pearson, Weber on objectivity, Robertson Smith, Westermarck, Jane Ellen Harrison, Robert H. Lowie, Wundt, and Tarde. This is not the B Team. The editors were not afraid to bring the best minds they could find, no matter their points of origin, into The House of Sociology, in order to enrich the empirical research for which the Chicago School became famous during the succeeding 20 years. If it is true, as so many Chicago sociologists claimed it was, that The Green Bible gave them the basic framework out of which they created their innovative monographs, there must have been something pragmatically inspiring to Park and Burgess’s disciplined eclecticism.</p>
<p>Defining “Human Nature” occupied pages 64-160, a topic which is skirted in modern sociology textbooks for fear that one constituency or another will be offended no matter how delicately the subject is handled. Imagine the classroom discussions one could have if graduate students were asked to read arguments by Edward Thorndike, John Dewey, Milicent Shinn, Albert Moll, C. S. Myers, W. E. Hocking, Sumner, Tönnies, Viscount Haldane, Alfred Binet, William James, Albert Keller, and a dozen other smart people, many of whom we would now regard as wrong, but each of whom had thought seriously about the topic, and offered their own distinctive verdicts at a time when these matters were taken seriously.</p>
<p>Chapter IV (pp. 226-279) is called “Isolation,” a topic which has disappeared from sociological discourse entirely, and been turned over, if at all, to psychology. They quote Thoreau: “The reason of isolation is not that we love to be alone, but that we love to soar; and when we soar, the company grows thinner and thinner until there is none left” (p. 229). They explain that “conflict groups, like sects and parties, and accommodation groups like castes and classes depend for survival upon isolation. Free intercourse of opposing parties is always a menace to their morale” (<italic>ibid</italic>.) Whether or not such observations are correct by our lights, they are intriguing enough to stimulate thought, and to challenge the commonplaces of media “analysis” that increasingly dominate even sophisticated discussion. Shortly thereafter: “Thus Rousseau constructs an ideal society in the solitude of his forest retreat. The lonely child enjoys the companionship of his imaginary comrade. George Eliot aspires to join the choir invisible. The mystic seeks communion with divinity” (p. 231). The Green Bible sports hundreds of such empirically and historically derived apothegms.</p>
<p>Note that I am not pushing Park’s famous theory of ethnic succession stages as laid out in detail (pp. 504-784), nor any other of the hundred theoretical programs enunciated in the book. My only point is this: one reason why the <italic>Introduction to the Science of Sociology</italic> formed the scholarly worldviews of Chicago sociologists for more than 20 of its most fruitful years is because it forced novices, graduate students, and their teachers to reflect on the actual words written by the likes of Spencer, Simmel, Durkheim, Sorel, Lippmann, Charles Ellwood, Mary Austin, Le Bon, William E.H. Lecky, Schopenhauer, Dewey, Ward, Santayana, Bergson, Aristotle, Comte, Hobhouse, and many other worthies, very few of whom have been “proven” to be categorically wrong, but instead have been sidestepped in our rush to find the next New Thing.</p>
<p>Recently a notable sociologist spontaneously wrote me with similar sentiments, inspired by Taine’s famous reflections on literature, and since this seconds my own view but with different examples, I will quote without attribution (I have corrected some errors in the quoted material by consulting the original), and allow my correspondent the last word: “Hippolyte Taine, in the introduction to the <italic>History of English Literature</italic>, wrote: ‘It is mainly by studying literatures that we are able to produce moral history, and arrive at some knowledge of the psychological laws on which events depend. . . . Nobody has taught us better [than Stendhal] how to observe with one’s own eyes, first, to regard humanity around us and life as it is, and next, old and authentic documents; how to read more than merely the black and white on the page; how to detect under old print and the scrawl of the text the veritable sentiment and the train of thought, the mental state in which the words were penned. . . . If this document is rich and we know how to interpret it, we will find the psychology of a particular soul, often that of an age, and sometimes that of a race. In this respect, a great poem, a good novel, the confessions of a superior man, are more instructive than a mass of historians and histories; I would give fifty volumes of charters and a hundred diplomatic files for the memoirs of Cellini, the epistles of Saint Paul, the table-talk of Luther, or the comedies of Aristophanes. . . . I have undertaken to write a history of a literature and to ascertain the psychology of a people.’ Taine wrote this in 1863, simultaneously with the great sociological novels being written by Turgenev, Tolstoy, and Dostoyevski, and in France by Flaubert and soon after by Zola [not to mention Dickens, George Eliot, and the early pioneer Balzac]. What Taine called ‘the psychology of a people’ was a crude early conception, but it is what Durkheim and others would begin to analyze sociologically 30 years later. For a further half century, novelists would still be our best empirical sociologists. Thus the first great era of sociological observation took place under a different name, the novel roughly from Jane Austen to Hemingway.”</p>
