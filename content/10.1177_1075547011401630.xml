<abstract>
<p>The common scientific metaphor linking microscopic phenomena to new or subvisible worlds in images and text has also been used to describe nanoscale phenomena. However, on closer examination, some images of the nanoscale reveal a shift away from the trope’s association with microscopic worlds and toward participatory, computer-generated worlds. This shift articulates different relations between the nanoscale and the macroscopic scale, relations that also affect how we position ourselves in relation to nanoscale phenomena and so affect the formation of nanotechnology. These different relations also create different ways to understand the nanoscale, scientific communication, and the shaping of scientific knowledge.</p>

</p>
<p>In a speech that many nanotechnology proponents<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1075547011401630">1</xref></sup> consider the field’s founding articulation, “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom,” physicist Richard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1075547011401630">Feynman (1961)</xref> employs a common scientific figuration: In describing the “room at the bottom,” he comments, “[I]t is a staggeringly small world that is below.” Feynman’s expression of this room as an entire world, albeit a “staggeringly small” one, efficiently and powerfully communicates to scientists and nonscientists alike<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1075547011401630">2</xref></sup> as it conveys the importance of that room and suggests possibilities for how humans should understand the nanoscale. One reason that Feynman’s evocation of a subvisible world is so effective is that it creates a seemingly tidy analogy between the nanoscale and microscale through his reference to a scientific trope that associates microscale phenomena with small—often called subvisible—worlds. This trope, which creates associations between what is seen with a microscope and possible views of other worlds, has been used from the earliest days of microscopy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1075547011401630">Feynman (1961)</xref> thus suggests that we can relate to nanoscale phenomena as we relate to phenomena on the microscale—that is, according to the conventional trope, in a way similar to how we relate to phenomena on our more macroscopic scale. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1075547011401630">Brauman’s (1991)</xref> suggestion, above, that we are beginning to move in to that room in his introduction to Feynman’s reprinted speech in a 1991 <italic>Science</italic> issue makes explicit the human role that Feynman’s analogy implies. As I will argue further below, this and subsequent uses of the trope of subvisible worlds to describe the nanoscale are more complicated than they seem; in visual images of the nanoscale, the referent to worlds has shifted from the conventional trope. As I will suggest below, this shift indicates wider issues relating to how we articulate the nanoscale and how we position ourselves in relation to nanoscale phenomena, which then shed light on the shaping of scientific knowledge.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1075547011401630">Brauman’s (1991)</xref> reference to Feynman is an indication of the role of this trope in articulations of nanotechnology—indeed, the figuration of small, or subvisible, worlds appears in both textual and pictorial descriptions of nanoscale phenomena. For example, authors of scientific articles (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1075547011401630">Binnig &amp; Rohrer, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1075547011401630">Kushmerick, Kandel, Han, Johnson, &amp; Weiss, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1075547011401630">Salling &amp; Lagally, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1075547011401630">Stoll, 1991</xref>) describe nanoscale data features in terms of terrain, such as “hills,” “steps,” and “terraces.” Additionally, Binnig (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1075547011401630">Binnig &amp; Rohrer, 1987</xref>), one of the inventors of the instrument that has spurred nanotechnology by imaging at the atomic level, the scanning tunneling microscope (STM), has used the analogy in his and coinventor Rohrer’s Nobel Prize acceptance speech, describing his reaction to their first imaged 7 × 7 silicon images: “I could not stop looking at the images. It was like entering a new world. This appeared to me as the unsurpassable highlight of my scientific career” (p. 399).</p>
<p>Images of nanoscale phenomena created by the STM and related visualization technologies also evoke landscapes and worlds through figurative means using techniques such as false color and false perspective or shadowing. These communications are particularly noteworthy as they present images of what are literally always invisible—phenomena that are smaller than the minimum possible resolution of light (0.2 micrometers, or 2,000 angstroms). One example of this analogy to a landscape appears in an image of a copper surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1075547011401630">IBM Almaden Image Gallery, 1995a</xref>), whose creators use false shadowing and false colors of coppers and browns to indicate a rocklike surface against a light blue background. Evocations also appear in composite images such as the cover of the National Science and Technology Council (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1075547011401630">NSTC, 1999</xref>) publication <italic>Nanotechnology: Shaping the World Atom by Atom</italic>, which presents a corrugated “planet” surface against a starry black sky replete with a comet, an Earthlike planet and a moon.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1075547011401630">3</xref></sup> Hosoki (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1075547011401630">Grey, 1993</xref>, p. 705) has even used the STM to create an image of letters that spell out “nanospace” seemingly in three dimensions, thereby articulating a place where one can not only read and write but also that one can enter.</p>
<p>On a general level, in these textual and pictorial examples, this trope of subvisible worlds functions in a similar way: to communicate information about nanotechnology by providing a frame for understanding the scale of atoms and small molecules. Moreover, this trope helps communicate a context for nanotechnology by articulating how humans can relate to nanoscale phenomena. For example, the combination of writing and conventions of three-dimensional perspective in Hosoki’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1075547011401630">Grey, 1993</xref>, p. 705) “nanospace” image allows viewers to draw analogies between the space depicted in this image and the perspectival space with which they are familiar. Such analogies help viewers see themselves as not only becoming familiar with this space but also “moving in” to inhabit it. Additionally, even a closer look at the textual descriptions of new worlds in relation to nanotechnology shows that they seem to be in accord with the conventional trope.</p>
<p>However, what the trope of subvisible worlds communicates more specifically about nanotechnology—and humans’ role in relation to nanotechnology—is less clear than it may seem at first glance. For starters, the comparison of the nanoscale with the macroscale is more tenuous than that of microscale with macroscale because of the nature of the differences between nanoscale phenomena and those on the macroscale. These differences are significant; indeed, much of nanotechnology’s promise relies on the fact that atoms and molecules behave differently at the nanoscale than they do in larger masses at the micro- or macroscale. The laws of physics that explain human scale events, including fundamental laws such as the second law of thermodynamics, do not necessarily operate at the nanoscale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1075547011401630">Chalmers, 2002</xref>). Some researchers suggest, in fact, that the transition between macroscale and nanoscale may constitute a major problem in actually using techniques that some tools seem to make possible, such as, atom manipulation for practical applications such as molecular computers (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1075547011401630">Mulhall, 2002</xref>). As nanotechnology researcher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1075547011401630">Mirkin (2001)</xref>, for example, has observed, “The realization of many of these [nanotechnological] notions is hampered by a fundamental inability to wire up and interface structures on the nanometer-length scale with macroscopically addressable components” (p. 185).</p>
<p>As I will discuss further in this article, images of the nanoscale that refer to subvisible worlds provide a different version of the trope that takes into account some of these characteristics of the relation between nanoscale and our human macroscale. While visual references to landscapes in images of the nanoscale such as those mentioned above provide rhetorical frames for making the nanoscale familiar, the “worlds” summoned through images of nanotechnology bear more resemblance to participatory worlds primarily associated with computer-generated graphics and simulation programs, not microscopy. In associating the nanoscale with a participatory “world,” this figuration sets the nanoscopic and macroscopic into an analogical relation that differs from that created by conventional microscopes. These different relations create different ways to understand the nanoscale as well as nanotechnology’s promises and possibilities. This shift in trope not only takes into account some of the difficulties mentioned above but also shows the influence of the relatively new medium of the computer-generated digital image on the shaping of science communication. What sense of the nanoscale, then, does this shifted trope communicate? What context does it articulate for nanotechnology, for humans’ relation to nanoscale phenomena? Following these questions reveals a story about the shaping of scientific communication; following these questions also highlights a corresponding, significant aspect of the shaping of scientific knowledge.</p>

<title>Shaping Communication, Shaping Knowledge: Tropes, Images, and Nanotechnology</title>
<p>Scholars have long been studying the influence of tropes, particularly metaphors, on shaping communication and knowledge in science, often building on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1075547011401630">Black (1962)</xref>, who reenergized consideration of how metaphors function to communicate new ideas. Metaphors do so through building associations between the subject described (the tenor) and the subject associated with it (the vehicle); Black argued that not only is the use of one subject to illuminate another an important mental exercise but also this exercise demands “simultaneous awareness of both subjects but not reducible to any comparison between the two” (p. 46). Additionally, drawing from the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1075547011401630">Richards (1936)</xref> on interaction, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1075547011401630">Black (1962)</xref> argued for an interactive view of metaphors in which metaphors are transformative of both subjects. Following Black, many scholars (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1075547011401630">Brown, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1075547011401630">Hayles, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1075547011401630">Keller, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1075547011401630">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1075547011401630">Lakoff &amp; Johnson, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1075547011401630">Lopez, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1075547011401630">Maasen &amp; Weingart, 1995</xref>) have argued that figurative language, such as metaphor, also plays a critical role in creating mental models, envisioning ourselves and objects, and shaping fields of knowledge, including scientific fields. There is not enough space here to fully recount all the research on this topic,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1075547011401630">4</xref></sup> but a few words about characteristics of metaphors (and tropes) in science from previous studies can further focus the larger importance and implications of this study for understanding the dynamics of tropes in language, the case for finding tropes in scientific images, and the shaping of nanotechnology.</p>
<p>The influence of metaphors on understanding exists partly because of metaphors’ abilities to link complex, sometimes non-intuitive, or new ideas in science. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1075547011401630">Miller (2000)</xref> has observed, the concepts or domains that such metaphors link are often quite complex in their own right and “are partially represented in non-propositional modes of thought, such as mental imagery” (p. 147). The ability of metaphors to convey nonpropositional concepts then adds to the linguistic capacities of language to express new or complex ideas. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1075547011401630">Brown (2003)</xref> has argued that metaphors help shape scientific thought not only in theory but also in experimental science. Brown has described the role of metaphor in experiment:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>There is an interaction between the metaphorical frame of thought and the literal observation system in which experiments are performed. An apt metaphor suggests directions for experiment. The results of experiment in turn are interpreted in terms of an elaborated, improved metaphor or even a new one. (p. 26)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Therefore, exploring extant metaphors or other tropes can also help determine how a particular field or concept is framed within scientific discourse.</p>
<p>Metaphors shape our understanding by focusing attention toward certain aspects of the object or idea under scrutiny and away from others. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1075547011401630">Black (1962)</xref> explained, the reason for directing attention is to not only emphasize or suppress qualities of the original object but also organize them (p. 44), so that the metaphors behave, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1075547011401630">Burke (1966)</xref> described, as “terministic screens” (p. 45). This dynamic can have some negative consequences, for metaphors also constrain thought: as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1075547011401630">Edie (1976)</xref>, for example, has argued, once people “have unwittingly chosen their metaphor, they tend to think within the cultural-linguistic bounds that they have unwittingly set up for themselves” (p. 171). (Also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1075547011401630">Schön, 1993</xref>.) This tendency explains some of metaphors’ power in shaping thought and knowledge.</p>
<p>Another reason to look at metaphors closely is that they can shift depending on their cultural contexts: Because metaphors rely on a familiar or given subject—the vehicle—with which to describe the new or complex term or phenomenon, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1075547011401630">Black (1962)</xref> has noted, they only work as long as the associations they evoke are common and readily brought to mind by readers. Therefore, tropes may shift readily: For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1075547011401630">Brown (2003)</xref> has found in a study of the metaphors associated with global warming that scientific metaphors changed as they moved beyond scientific discourse to wider contexts. Following this view, tropes may also shift within new scientific contexts, given cultural or scientific changes. Therefore, following tropes with attention to how they change also provides insight into how they may affect not only science communication but also how the fields in which they are deployed may be developing.</p>
<p>While most of the research on metaphors has focused on linguistic metaphors, there is a case to be made for the study of metaphors and other tropes that exist in visual images, especially in science. This case starts out with the importance of visual images in science communication, a topic about which there has been much research.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1075547011401630">5</xref></sup> In one explanation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1075547011401630">Gross (2007)</xref> has argued for the importance of studying visual images in science by explaining how scientists have used means of communicating in artificial (as opposed to “natural”) language, such as mathematics or logic. He has asserted, “Science has found that ‘things’ (in the form of scientific visuals) are as indispensable to its communication as is natural language” (p. 52). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1075547011401630">Latour (1986)</xref> has also argued for the importance of images as examples of what he calls “immutable mobiles,” things that scientists can muster in arguments and can travel from place to place, yet are stable (or immutable) enough to be able to present to others as evidence (p. 7). Following these views, images in science can be seen as the ordered and purposeful arrangement of data or evidence to communicate knowledge—not in textual but in visual form.</p>
<p>The fact that images form a major component of scientific communication—and indeed form something akin to language, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1075547011401630">Gross (2007)</xref> argues, or as evidence, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1075547011401630">Latour (1986)</xref>, for example, argues—suggests a closer look at how they communicate persuasively. Following the line of thought that metaphors and other tropes are conceptual and help shape knowledge suggests that images may also contain metaphorical material.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1075547011401630">6</xref></sup> Some research on visual images in science finds that the conceptual rhetorical terms are useful to describe scientific images. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1075547011401630">Fahnestock (1999)</xref> has found that scientists often use visual figures in their arguments and may even use the same kinds of rhetoric in both text and visual figures (p. xi). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1075547011401630">Pauwels (2006)</xref> also includes attention to metaphors as “conceptual structures” in his framework for understanding scientific images (p. 3). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1075547011401630">Nerlich (2008)</xref> even argues that visual images themselves function like metaphors in that they do not only bridge between the new and unfamiliar but also “invite expectations and reactions” (p. 289). While some may argue that visual images cannot function as arguments (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1075547011401630">Gross, 2009</xref>, for a brief summary of this view) and so cannot be persuasive, viewing metaphors and other tropes as conceptual, not just linguistic, structures, opens up the way to more closely examine how images may function in—and as—scientific communication.</p>
<p>Analysis of metaphors and other tropes can be particularly useful for understanding the development and structuring of emerging fields such as nanotechnology. Indeed, the ability of metaphors not only to explain complex ideas but also to help develop understandings of new ideas gives them great explanatory power and potential in nanotechnology, where all phenomena are not verifiable by the unaided eye. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1075547011401630">Lopez (2008)</xref>, for example, argues that the metaphor of nanotechnology practitioners as master builders functions to organize multiple types of narratives in nanotechnology. Adding to this explanatory potential of metaphor, the very definition of nanotechnology is a contested, complex, and evolving issue (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1075547011401630">Selin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1075547011401630">Shew, 2008</xref>; and see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1075547011401630">Lopez, 2008</xref>, pp. 1270-1273, for a useful summary). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1075547011401630">Brown’s (2003)</xref> explanation of the role of metaphor in the experimental process mentioned above may also be an apt application to how metaphors may help develop a field of knowledge as well; the fact that the field is still emerging suggests that metaphors and other tropes may play a larger role in shaping the concept of a field than a field that is more established.</p>
<p>Studying images in nanotechnology also becomes important to the study of the public understanding of science because images of nanospace slip into discourses other than those in articles or journal covers on which they might appear at first. For example, one series of images of what its creators call a “quantum corral” has won the “cover-page ‘triple crown,’” as physicist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1075547011401630">Eric Heller (2000)</xref> puts it, appearing on the cover of the <italic>Science</italic> issue in which the article appears (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1075547011401630">“Quantum Corral,” 1993</xref>), as well as on the covers of <italic>Nature</italic> (Vol. 363) and <italic>Physics Today</italic> (November 1993). In addition to reaching a general scientist audience, the image also appears on the cover of an edited collection of predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1075547011401630">Crandall, 1996</xref>) for the general public, a textbook (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1075547011401630">Timp, 1999</xref>), and in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1075547011401630">NSTC (1999)</xref> brochure <italic>Nanotechnology: Shaping the World Atom by Atom</italic> that is “intended for public use” as well as on various websites (as an image search will unearth): Therefore, images such as this one reach a nonscientific (or nonexpert) audience as a representative image of nanotechnology. In fact, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1075547011401630">NSTC (1999)</xref> brochure also contains two other images that evoke a nano-landscape, which reinforce the trope for the public audience of the brochure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1075547011401630">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>To follow the subvisible world tropes evoked by images of nanotechnology with attention to what they may communicate about the nanoscale as well as nanotechnology, I will first discuss the conventional microscope trope of subvisible worlds and then examine how the examples from nanotechnology deviate from this trope. In so doing, I will also focus on the fact that figurations help establish the boundaries of the room at the bottom that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1075547011401630">Brauman (1991)</xref> asserts we are beginning to move into, and so such figurations also help frame our relations to the material world of atoms as well as to nanotechnology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1075547011401630">8</xref></sup> I will then examine the newly emerging trope of the nanoworld found in images of nanotechnology.</p>

<sec id="section2-1075547011401630">
<title>From Microworld to Nanoworld? The Conventional Trope of Subvisible Worlds</title>
<p>One way of reading nanotechnology researchers’ and proponents’ recurrent connections to landscapes or worlds is in terms of a common trope in microscopy since at least 1631 in the Netherlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1075547011401630">Alpers, 1983</xref>, p. 7) and in England since the 1665 publication of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1075547011401630">Hooke’s (1665)</xref> popular <italic>Micrographia</italic>. Like those creating evocations of the nanoworld, Hooke, too, was engaged in the task of presenting information about what had not been seen before as well as what information a new instrument could produce: In the mid-17th century, the microscope was still a new instrument, having emerged in Europe around 1610 at the same time as the telescope. Hooke deployed this trope of new worlds in the text, such as in the preface: “There is a new visible World discovered to the understanding” (unpaginated). Hooke also used pictorial landscape conventions to frame some of his drawings of microscopic observations, such as an image of blue mold (plate opposite p. 125). This plate’s two separated views resemble landscape drawings in that the first depicts what seem to be leafless flowers and buds growing out of a grassy substance against a dark background, while the other view resembles map drawings of islands. This connection to a landscape or other world provides a conceptual frame for communicating two intertwined ideas about not only microscopic phenomena but also the promise of microscopic exploration.</p>
<p>The use of the conventional subvisible worlds trope allows microscope users to explain the less imaginable—the microscopic—in terms of the imaginable. This trope therefore helps render the “landscape” as a recognizable given, a backdrop against which objects may appear. For example, early microscopists linked their explanations of microscopical phenomena to a concept whose existence, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1075547011401630">Zwierlein (2000)</xref> has argued, was anticipated in fiction. Using a previously established trope of subvisible worlds to explain microsocopical phenomena lent Hooke’s (and other microscopists’) observations credibility, as their viewers could then understand the strange in terms of the familiar forms. (Of course, this also most likely shaped what they themselves expected to see.) Their observations and the analogy to a new world also gained credibility through the association with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1075547011401630">Bacon’s (1620/1863)</xref> conception of the scientist as an explorer searching for new land (see, e.g., sec. CXIII and sec. CXIV).</p>
<p>The subvisible worlds metaphor also helped <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1075547011401630">Hooke (1665)</xref> and other early microscopists explain what microscope users should see, an important job considering that anyone who did use a microscope to see mold similar to Hooke’s example would discover a large difference between Hooke’s image and what they saw: Early microscopes themselves frustrated any idea of transparent viewing, partly because of optical illusions and distortions that were an integral part of these instruments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1075547011401630">9</xref></sup> Also, viewers cannot confirm with their eyes that what they see with a microscope exists. The subvisible worlds trope then allows microscope image viewers to imagine similarities between the world they know and what the microscope images describe, and so imagine they are navigating microscopic space. The trope then helps the microscopists gain credibility for their work while also addressing the questions of authenticity that have always accompanied descriptions of objects unverifiable by the unaided eye.</p>
<p>This conventional trope of subvisible worlds also helps communicate what has been learned about phenomena and imply what is still left to explore, which helps evoke wonder and excitement about what is already discovered and what is left to discover. In framing the images of microscopical observations in terms of part of a world instead of something more bounded like an object, microscopists such as Hooke suggested that there was much more to discover. Additionally, this analogy communicates that this discovery is not only an intellectual one; it also describes a bodily relation between this subvisible world and the viewer. By suggesting a world, the experiential aspect thus becomes important—one might go and see for oneself by then turning to the microscope. Or, as the philosopher of science <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1075547011401630">Hacking (1983)</xref> has explained as he used the figuration to talk about how we learn to use microscopes: “In short, we learn to move around in the microscopic world . . . we enter the new worlds within worlds that the microscope reveals to us” (p. 209). However, the specific details of this bodily relation are not articulated in this analogy but are left up to the viewer or reader to imagine. Here, some of the limits of the analogy appear: While the viewer of microscale landscapes can imagine himself or herself an explorer of new worlds, the credibility of what is presented in microscopical images depends on objective presentation, so that the images present these new worlds in a pristine, untouched state. The viewer does not—cannot—go to the new worlds, for the images must remain objective. Instead, the viewer is invited to view the subvisible world’s vistas. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1075547011401630">Stafford (1994)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1075547011401630">Keller (1996)</xref> explain, while there is always some manipulation of samples to actually use microscopes, microscopists de-emphasized the importance or impact of their manipulations of the samples, for what was true was to be conveyed objectively, without bodily action, only to the eye.</p>

<title>Seeing the Nanoworld: Tropes and Scanning Tunneling Microscopes</title>
<p>At first, the conventional trope of subvisible worlds seems to directly align with references to new worlds or small worlds in researchers’ visual and verbal descriptions of nanoscale phenomena. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1075547011401630">Binnig and Rohrer’s (1987)</xref> statement that seeing the silicon 7 × 7 images was like “entering a new world” (p. 399) can be read in the tradition of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1075547011401630">Hooke’s (1665)</xref> description of a “new visible World discovered to the understanding” (unpaginated). Indeed, even the raw data the STM collects look topographical, since they appear on a computer screen in a spatial matrix pattern (regardless of whether it is presenting topographic or electronic data). The visual format of the data thus lends itself to being treated as a landscape even in the formation of the images: As researcher Brodbeck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1075547011401630">Frankel, 2005</xref>) has observed,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>[f]rom an image creator’s point of view, what I always liked about working with STM data was the fact that the surfaces are very similar to landscapes, and that you can apply the same design guidelines and intuition as you do in landscape photography. (p. 261)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>However, on closer inspection, this trope loses its expressive power because it stops communicating the new or unique knowledge about the nanoscale that researchers have claimed is what makes the nanoscale exciting. Two images that use this landscape metaphor illustrate how this conventional reading falls short of expressing what these images convey. The first image appears in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1075547011401630">Crommie, Lutz, and Eigler’s (1993)</xref> <italic>Science</italic> article “Confinement of Electrons to Quantum Corrals on a Metal Surface,” in which the researchers reported how they arranged iron atoms in a circle to form atomic corrals, thereby creating a space that traps electrons in order to observe their behavior. The article includes two images of the same “corral,” a “top view” of the corral and another image whose perspective is positioned at a slight angle so that viewers see the depth of the concentric ripple-like “wave pattern caused by the interference of incident and scattered surface state electrons” emanating from the center of the image, like water after a pebble has been thrown, emphasized as well by the play of light and shadow. The second image appeared on the cover of <italic>Science</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1075547011401630">“Quantum Corral,” 1993</xref>) and contains the same structure imaged in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1075547011401630">Crommie et al. (1993)</xref> and also appears on the IBM Almaden website. The second image positions viewers so that they peer between red and blue pointed atom peaks across the rippled floor toward a far row of atoms against a stark black background.</p>
<p>Although the “corral” images convey a view of a landscape in a subvisible world, this nanoscale “view” communicates more than the idea of a new world. The website’s text accompanying this image points to this departure: “[T]he discovery of the STM’s ability to image variations in the density distribution of surface state electrons created in the artists a compulsion to have complete control of not only the atomic landscape, but the electronic landscape also” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1075547011401630">IBM Almaden Image Gallery, 1995b</xref>). Here, the “artists” (the scientists who created this image) point out quite explicitly how they have not discovered this “landscape” but instead have created it.</p>
<p>Therefore, while this image’s use of landscape does perhaps at first suggest a three-dimensional landscape similar to the natural, human-scale world, the image works against the convention, especially through the emphasis on the user’s hand in creating the space. This emphasis is communicated in particular through the artists’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1075547011401630">IBM Almaden Image Gallery, 1995b</xref>) mention of “complete control.” This emphasis is curious if read in the context of the conventional trope of subvisible worlds; however, the process of creating these images—how the literally invisible is made visible—not only presents an explanation but also suggests an emerging vehicle for the metaphor that is not based on the similarity of microscale to macroscale.</p>
<p>One of the first tools that consistently produced images of nanoscale phenomena was the STM, which its inventors developed in the mid-1980s (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1075547011401630">Binnig &amp; Rohrer, 1987</xref>, for an account from the inventors’ perspective). The microscope uses nonoptical means to collect data about points on the surface that it samples in a back-and-forth raster pattern so that it produces a data set. The STM measures the interactions between the electrons of the atoms that constitute the tip of its needle probe and the electrons of the atoms of the surface of the material. The STM takes advantage of the fact that electrons tunnel—a behavior not seen in larger scale matter—to be able to gather data at the nanoscale. The STM can measure either electronic properties or topographic properties; the data are often arranged as a grid. This grid, projected on the computer screen that constitutes part of the microscope, creates an image of the surface’s electronic or topographic properties. What is projected depends on the microscope user’s imaging software settings; the user controls how the data are imaged through the microscope. This image, however, does not necessarily signal the end of the experiment or the researchers’ interaction; the computer and image form tools for continuing the interaction with nanoscale phenomena in two important ways. First, researchers can further manipulate the data through the image on the computer to highlight certain values or characteristics, which allows the image to become an interface through which researchers analyze the data as well as present them. Second, researchers can also use the image as an interface with which to interact with nanoscale phenomena, thus creating, for example, the quantum corral. The functions of these images then expand from only presenting data, for example, to forming part of the experimental apparatus, so that the images become, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1075547011401630">Daston and Galison (2007)</xref> call them, “images-as-tools” (p. 385).</p>
<p>If the analogy of subvisible worlds is read conventionally, the emphasis on interaction at the nanoscale—and the promise that it has for conceptions of nanotechnology—is not communicated. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1075547011401630">Keller (1996)</xref> has argued that microscope users have always engaged in some manipulation as they prepare specimen samples for viewing: The STM apparatus and image production processes intensify this engagement between movement and manipulation so that what emerges is in some ways a cocreated nanoworld. The “corral” images, for example, argue for a manipulable nanoworld: What they show is not a “landscape” that STM users have happened upon but a human-made artifact, a “corral” created by the researchers’ manipulation of iron atoms into a circle. This space could be more accurately compared with a coliseum than a landscape in that it was built to test the behaviors of atoms placed within it: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1075547011401630">Crommie et al. (1993)</xref> used the imaging process as part of the experiment construction, not only as part of the experimental results. Indeed, the word “corral” does not entirely fit the description of the image: The low angle of the view in the “corral” image suggests the grandness and accomplishment of the structure itself, creating a focus on the spectacle of the building as well as the wave functions within.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1075547011401630">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The association between the nanoworld and microworld that is suggested by a reading of this trope in terms of the conventional microscope metaphor of subvisible worlds obscures the changes that accompany shifts in scale, which, because of different behaviors of phenomena at the nanoscale, are more difficult to bridge in reality than in image or language. Therefore, the associations created by the microscope’s subvisible worlds trope obscure the nanoscale’s unique characteristics and also suggest an easy, yet less than accurate, comparison with the microworld and, through this, with the world of the human scale. This conventional microscope figuration also hides humans’ participation and role in creating these images—and in the case of the quantum corral, the value of what is portrayed as well. Therefore, the only communicative value of reading this trope as the conventional one stems from the established frame of portraying a new world to explore. While the established frame of linking the nanoscopic to the microscopic and macroscopic scales may seem useful in expressing the excitement of a new field to nonscientists, its communicative value is limited.</p>

<title>Nanospace as Digital Space: Computer-Generated Worlds</title>
<p>However, looking back at the processes by which the nanoscale is made visible reveals another element that may serve as a more relevant vehicle in these images’ spatial metaphors. This element does emphasize the manipulation inherent in visualizing the nanoscale while playing down the simple analogy to the “macro” world. A look back at Hosoki’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1075547011401630">Grey, 1993</xref>, p. 705) image of “nanospace” shows this new element. While the image can be read in terms of conventional microscopists’ subvisible worlds, it also evokes another connotation for contemporary viewers that competes with the trope of subvisible worlds: In Hosoki’s image, the surface depicted is familiar, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1075547011401630">Elkins (1995)</xref> remarks, “very like the surface of a table,” (p. 60) echoing another familiar computer-visualized table surface, the desktop. This image’s association with the computer-generated interface that has trained so many in first world Western cultures to interact with images as they compute is particularly rich in that it not only articulates a visual resemblance to a human-made object but also structures a relation with the viewer in which she or he is solicited to respond. A viewer does not tend to only look at a desktop image; instead, she or he interacts with it, using it as an interface with the hardware and software.</p>
<p>These factors suggest a different referent from the macroscopic world for this analogy; they suggest an analogy to a computer-generated world, enabled by the computer’s properties of allowing interaction with images as interfaces. This interaction creates different effects on viewers and creators than simply viewing an image. One effect of the computer’s use for imaging (and the ability of computer users to alter images they create almost instantly) is that, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1075547011401630">Elkins (1994)</xref> suggests, how we conceptualize space has changed. Writing about artists’ and illustrators’ tendency to create simpler, less complicated computer images, Elkins observes, “The lumpy, crowded spaces of Western painting have been replaced by the sheer, limitless spaces of contemporary graphics” (p. 335). The plane on which the corral rests, a distance evoked by a dark, far horizon, exemplifies this space.</p>
<p>The computer-generated characteristic of limitless space influences the nanoworld trope so that on occasion viewers find themselves moving over a seemingly vast scape in images such as the corral images, especially given their position at one end of the structure. These images do not necessarily refer first to a world discovered to explore; instead, they refer to a built world—a world that the viewer may also alter as he or she explores. In other words, the viewer has already entered into the world, as opposed to standing at the threshold. Eigler’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1075547011401630">Frankel, 2005</xref>) comment about his response to the color quantum corral image he created points to the nature of this experience:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>These things [the standing waves in the corral’s interior] were entirely predictable, and we routinely work them out in our problem sets when we take courses in quantum mechanics. We knew of them in a purely cerebral way. But here they are, alive to our eyes and responsive to our hands . . . quantum mechanics made visceral! The realization that you can build a quantum state of your own design, see the result, and change and shape the quantum state like a lump of clay . . . well that’s just candy to a physicist. (p. 261)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This limitless, manipulable space that the trope evokes figuratively magnifies the nanoscale, which helps to create what Eigler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1075547011401630">Frankel, 2005</xref>) called “a delectable intimacy between us and the quantum world” (p. 261). This intimacy is not the same as the “new visible world discovered to the understanding” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1075547011401630">Hooke, 1665</xref>, unpaginated preface)—knowledge of the “quantum world” exists in the ability to interact within this space. The computer-generated characteristic of limitless space thus presents an alternate mode of expressing knowledge of the nanoscale, a mode of knowledge that is inherently bodily and also interactive. This mode of knowledge is a haptic knowledge generated by seeing and interacting with images—and through images, the nanoscale. What is thus expressed in these images is then not only a vision of a world; what is expressed is a haptic vision of the <italic>experience</italic> of building a world through manipulating atoms and electrons.</p>
<p>This association of nanospace to computer space implies that the relation between nanospace and the viewer is unlike the exploration of other worlds; instead, this trope aligns nano-landscapes with other computer-generated images such as those produced by virtual reality programs whose user also moves across or through a data matrix, allowing the anticipation of an endless participation between pixels and person. The ability to adapt the image also allows image creators and viewers to develop practices of anticipating that the image may change in part because of their responses. This allows both creators and viewers to habitually envision many possibilities for exploration, intensifying the viewer’s sense of immersion, of contact, with what the image shows.</p>
<p>However, association with computer-generated imaging raises questions for scientific images in that issues of authenticity and image credibility occur even more insistently than with traditional microscope images. While traditional microscopists have answered the charge of authenticity and credibility in part with the analogous relation of the “new visible world” to the macroscopic world, as discussed above, this strategy does not work as surely when images—and atoms—can be manipulated. However, making these images overtly computer generated and so linking them to these limitless, digital spaces offers one possible solution to the question of authenticity as well as to the problem of shifting scales through the articulation of what the computer does create as a world.</p>
<p>The tendency to think of what the computer can create as an independent world also lends weight to this changed trope. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1075547011401630">Galison (1996)</xref> has explained, during and after World War II, physicists and engineers began to use the computer to create simulations that they viewed as “an alternative reality” in which they could conduct complete experiments as they designed the hydrogen bomb (pp. 119-120). Simulations, considered self-sufficient worlds within the machine, are, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1075547011401630">Edwards (1997)</xref> has explained in his history of the computer in relation to the Cold War, what make the computer a preeminent tool (pp. 171-172). Further describing the pull of computer-generated simulations as worlds, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1075547011401630">Galison (1996)</xref> has argued that this world, “even in its earliest days, held enough structure on its own to captivate its practitioners” (p. 154). Simulations allow for consistent events to happen within their parameters (their worlds) and do not make a transition between the internal world and the external world; these characteristics led to researchers’ creation of artificial life. Furthermore, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1075547011401630">Helmreich (1998)</xref> has noted, from the 1970s on, computer programmers also began to call simulations “microworlds,” perhaps, as one of Helmreich’s scientist informants suggested, influenced by physicists’ views of quantum mechanics (p. 75-76). As Helmreich observed among the artificial life researchers he studied, “This notion that computers can contain separate, closed worlds came up again and again, and was one of the rhetorical moves people used to grant simulations their own ontology” (p. 78). This linking of worlds, Helmreich has argued, has become stronger as the notion ‘microworld’ has shifted to “artificial world” (p. 71), emphasizing the world’s self-contained independence as opposed to a shift in scale. The link to computer-generated worlds then does not allow for an easy shift from nanoscale to macroscale phenomena. It also gives the subvisible worlds trope in nanotechnology another possible benefit—an association with simulations’ predictability or (relative) lack of complexity—thus encouraging viewers about the possibility of understanding the complex phenomena of the nanoscale.</p>
<p>In addition to this connection with computer worlds, this version of a nanoworld as a separate, contained world aligns with the “microworlds” that 20th-century (and presumably 21st-century) physicists have relied on and also helps elucidate how the trope of nanospace or the nanoworld functions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1075547011401630">Buchwald (2000)</xref> relates how physicists use the existence of a microworld in their microphysical practices in his history of such practices’ origins. Buchwald has noted that the trope of “microworlds” operates as a point of commonality among physicists who use different methods of gathering data about atoms (e.g., the STM and atom collider). Buchwald has found the origins of such a practice in 19th-century chemistry and physics, recounting that the microworld became “real” in the 1890s, emerging from the concept of ether. This concept of worlds then became important in articulating knowledge about what cannot be seen, allowing physicists to discuss and spatially visualize atoms.</p>
<p>In tapping into these two associations as well as into the experiences of both scientists and nonscientists with the computer, the trope of a subvisible nanoworld whose vehicle is a computer-generated world accounts for the gulf between the nanoscale and macroscale by positing a separate world at the nanoscale. This world, like those created through the conventional microscope trope, allows researchers to imagine themselves within it. However, it also allows them to create structures in it at the same time as they explore. Therefore, the images that depict these nanoworlds not only document an area that has been explored, but they themselves also form interfaces for this exploration for the microscope user as well as for the viewer of images of the nanoscale created by the microscope.</p>
<p>The combination of the STM’s digital imaging process and the images’ production process through graphics programs to highlight certain data emphasizes just this exploration: Images of the nanoworld are not only artifacts such as photographs snapped of a foreign land—they are explicitly tools with which experimenters and possibly viewers can build that land as they experiment, much like virtual worlds such as Second Life (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1075547011401630">Milburn, 2008a</xref>, for an exploration of the inclusion of nanotechnology in virtual worlds; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1075547011401630">Daston &amp; Galison, 2007</xref>, for a discussion of these “images-as-tools,” pp. 383-412, as a successor to visual atlases as collections of knowledge). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1075547011401630">Eigler (1999)</xref> also explains, the</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>ability [to fabricate on the atomic scale] can best be viewed as a tool which the scientist can use to explore intellectual terra incognita. It is the excitement that comes from this exploration that ultimately is the real driving force for building things with atoms today. (p. 427)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>It is this action of building, not just looking, that he suggests generates excitement about the nanoscale.</p>
<p>This emphasis on experiment, leaning on computer-generated images’ possibilities for interaction, changes this trope from its focus on recognition—the new visible world that is similar to our world, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1075547011401630">Hooke’s (1665)</xref> images portrayed—to a focus on a world whose limitlessness and invitation to the process of imaging invites its viewers to explore. Here the nano-landscapes’ very artificiality—the different colors and unearthly structures, for example, as well as the image planes stretching into the distance—emphasize this difference.</p>

<title>Conclusion: Building the Nanoworld Through Images</title>
<p>As this article has discussed, while on first glance it seems as if the nanotechnological “room at the bottom” summoned through references to new worlds in texts and images about nanotechnology are examples of the conventional trope of subvisible worlds common to microscopy discourses, images such as the corral images discussed above instead create associations to computer-generated worlds. The reading of the nanoworld as associated with computer worlds thus frames how we not only “see” this other world but also how we relate to and interact with nanoscale phenomena. This shift in trope could be understood as merely another reference to the wider cultural presence of the computer that engages viewers by making fleeting, perhaps decorative, connections to the familiar—or to the fun, in relation to computer games. However, this shift in trope communicates something significant about science as well: a key process of knowledge making in nanotechnology, exemplified in the interactions necessary to visualize atoms using the STM. This rhetorical figure thus indicates an integral articulation of the nanoscale; indeed, this articulation suggests that both content and form of the images of nanotechnology that express this trope are significant for understanding how knowledge of the nanoscale shapes the known and the knower, as well as for communication of and responses to both that knowledge and our relation to it.</p>
<p>The shift in trope to creating associations to computer-generated worlds highlights a way of making knowledge that differs from that found in conventional microscopy, a way that relies on the computer-generated images’ expanded functions as a tool for experiment. More specifically, this shifted trope expresses the experience of cocreating the nanoworld as similar to creating or altering a digital image and, through the image, to creating or altering a computer-generated landscape or world. This trope thus communicates the experience or event of the experiment not only by presenting evidence of nanoscale phenomena and the experiment but also by inviting viewers of the images to participate, whether those viewers alter the image themselves or whether they imagine themselves in the space of the experiment. Just as making nanoscale phenomena visible requires interaction, so too do the images solicit viewer interaction through associations of computer desktops, of video games, or of other virtual worlds. This trope also creates associations between these images and other experiential, computer-generated modes of learning about the nanoscale, such as video games, that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1075547011401630">Milburn (2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1075547011401630">2010)</xref> has discussed in relation to nanotechnology. This changed trope of subvisible worlds thus also presents a strong case of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1075547011401630">Black’s (1962)</xref> interaction theory of how metaphors work in that as we view the nanoscale as a nanoworld associated with a computer-generated world via the digital image, we see it as a space in which to interact, albeit virtually.</p>
<p>Another important aspect of this communication of the nanoworld for science communication is that details of the nanoworld are communicated through images, not words. One way to understand this point is in light of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1075547011401630">Gross’s (2007)</xref> comment about the importance of artificial languages used in science: Those using simulations and computer-generated images have found a way to express the interactive aspect of discovering the nanoscale through visual means, or visual language, as opposed to verbal language. This additional function of images to not only present data but also form an experimental tool at the same time thus expands communicative ranges and aspects of images, and so calls for further attention to how such images communicate—and communicate persuasively—as an integral, not marginal, mode of science communication.</p>
<p>The visual components of digital images that constitute the scientific images of the nanoscale, and here that constitute a seeming allusion to a conventional microscope trope, also form part of the persuasive language of nanotechnology—they help contextualize not only how we see the nanoscale but also how we envision ourselves amidst nanoscale phenomena. As discussed above, the association of the nanoworld to a separate, closed world of computer-generated simulation helps readers conceive of the nanoworld as an authentic space that is not exactly like our world, thus helping researchers overcome questions of both credibility and shifting scales from nanoworld to macroworld. As this study of the change in trope of subvisible worlds also shows, two important and intertwined points emerge about this envisioning that further affect our understanding of the nanoscale as well as how we envision ourselves.</p>
<p>First, the nanoscopic and macroscopic are positioned in a different analogical relation than that of the microscopic and macroscopic. Unlike microscopic worlds whose vistas are depicted in early drawings of microscopical views, the nanoworld is one that can be virtually entered—and constructed, even—which calls forth a haptic response as well as a visual response from viewers. This articulation of the nanoscale as nanoworld creates a relation between nanoscale and macroscale that depends on responses as part of the interactive process—for example, electron responses to other electrons to gather data about nanoscale phenomena that compose the image, responses of researchers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1075547011401630">Crommie et al. (1993)</xref> who created the corral, and responses of researchers to create the image so that it includes elements that create the trope of the nanoworld. The nanoworld thus also becomes framed as a series of events in which the user or viewer is involved. This frame highlights the human hand in the nanoworld, reinforcing the idea of the nanoscale as not only accessible but also manipulable and responsive. This framing also suggests possibilities for envisioning the larger world as not only manipulable but also responsive, aligning with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1075547011401630">Nordmann’s (2004)</xref> observation about the title of the brochure “Nanotechnology: Shaping the World Atom by Atom”: “it is no longer assumed that ‘the world’ is a given, and as such, subject to representation on the one hand [in science], technological intervention on the other [in engineering]. Instead, nanotechnology is constantly shaping and reshaping the world” (p. 52).</p>
<p>This different analogical relation and its emphasis on interaction also reinforce the sense of knowledge about the nanoscale as manipulable and responsive and so affect the shaping of knowledge of the nanoscale as well. The nanoworld trope in these images articulates the nanoscale as a participatory space in which knowledge is not gained by just looking but rather by interacting; in order to see as well as make sense of nanoscale phenomena, one must interact. Researchers thus visually—haptically—cocreate the nanoworld at the same time as they interact in it. Such visualization practice also affects scientific knowledge production. For example, as STM scientists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1075547011401630">Gimzewski and Joachim (1999)</xref> have commented, “By the early 1980s, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) . . . radically changed the ways we interacted with and even regarded single atoms and molecules” (p. 1683). It is interesting that Gimzewski and Joachim first comment on interaction, and then on seeing: Knowledge making becomes associated first with an action, or intervention, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1075547011401630">Hacking’s (1983)</xref> terminology, not observation, in part because of the interaction necessary to visualize the nanoscale.</p>
<p>Second, the focus on interaction that this trope emphasizes also raises questions for further research about its effects on the making of knowledge and its communication, questions that reveal outlines of larger issues that the connected changes in visualization technologies, imaging, and relation to nanoscale phenomena spark. If, for example, as this trope’s shift suggests, knowledge making becomes more explicitly participatory, what responsibilities for communicating and for responding to participants—nanoscale phenomena as well as those who view the images—does this create for researchers? How are researchers also changing as they respond to the nanoscale as they co-create it? While these images present this co-created participatory space of the nanoscale through this shifted trope, how do these images influence or inform current discussions of who should or can participate—and how—in the development of nanotechnology? Do these images extend the rhetoric of participation to viewers of images who are not microscope users in ways that invite or forestall real participation, for example?</p>
<p>This trope’s shift also connects to shifts in understanding the shape of science, especially in regard to researchers’ relations to science. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1075547011401630">Daston and Galison (2007)</xref> posit that nanotechnology departs from ideas of “pure” science (p. 395) and so creates change in the concept of the scientific self, creating a hybrid engineering-scientific self (p. 414), a concept that can be seen clearly in the engineered corral. How such hybrid selves shape and are shaped by nanoscale phenomena and scientific knowledge are questions that will become important to understanding scientific communication and science. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1075547011401630">Barad (2007)</xref> suggests one way to articulate such participatory aspects of the making of scientific knowledge in her framework of “agential realism,” which takes into account roles of “human and nonhuman, material and discursive, and natural and cultural factors in science and other social-material practices” (p. 26). Furthermore, she suggests that our interactions with nanoscale phenomena form a clear example of the deep entanglements that exist in all of our relations with the world. Following her approach, how might we understand scientific communication beyond nanotechnology in light of this different understanding of the shape of science?</p>
<p>In a sense, then, this shifted trope’s rearticulation of the relations between nanoscale and macroscale, and nanoscale phenomena and researchers, through expanded functions of the image, also participates in a wider narrative of science that itself is shifting, as signaled for example by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1075547011401630">Daston and Galison’s (2007)</xref> argument about the change in the role of the scientific self and in objectivity and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1075547011401630">Barad’s (2007)</xref> investigation of entanglements given quantum physical understandings of phenomena. As we have started to enter the “room at the bottom,” we have found plenty to see and touch, but in that experience and process, we also have been touched—as we visualize the nanoscale, we participate in a world we discover as we help create it. We cannot help but touch and be touched—our interaction helps call our vision of the nanoscale into being. What becomes visible then through this trope is expression of a responsive relation not only to that room at the bottom but also to ourselves and the atoms that we touch—the nanoworld that we coproduce.</p>

<p>This narrative occurs in various summaries of nanotechnology’s origins: See, for example, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1075547011401630">National Nanotechnology Initiative’s (2000)</xref> account of nanotechnology and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1075547011401630">National Science and Technology Council’s (1999)</xref> brochure intended for the public, <italic>Nanotechnology: Shaping the World Atom by Atom.</italic> It also appears in general science journals geared toward scientists, such as in <italic>Science</italic>’s special issue on nanotechnology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1075547011401630">Brauman, 1991</xref>), and is mentioned in individual articles, such as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1075547011401630">Gimzewski and Joachim (1999)</xref>. The narrative’s accuracy in relating nanotechnology’s development has recently been questioned: For example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1075547011401630">Toumey (2005)</xref> examines how this account does not hold true, according to the citations of Feynman’s speech and the recollections of some of the scientists involved in major nanotechnology discoveries.

<p>Feynman’s speech, while presented on December 29, 1959, as an after-dinner speech to physicists at the American Physical Society’s annual meeting, has reached other audiences through its subsequent publication in the California Institute of Technology’s magazine <italic>Engineering &amp; Science</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1075547011401630">Feynman, 1961</xref>) and on the Web. Proponents of nanotechnology who have referred to Feynman have also not limited their audiences to scientists (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1075547011401630">Drexler, 1986</xref>). Likewise, many of the other texts and images (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1075547011401630">Binnig &amp; Rohrer, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1075547011401630">Hooke, 1665</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1075547011401630">IBM Almaden Image Gallery, 1995a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1075547011401630">National Science and Technology Council, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1075547011401630">“Quantum Corral,” 1993</xref>) include scientific and nonscientific audiences.
