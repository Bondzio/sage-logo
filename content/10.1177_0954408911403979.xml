<p>The subject of the periodic vortex shedding behind bluff bodies, which exhibits oscillatory behaviour, is of direct relevance to many practical applications, e.g. pipelines and heat exchangers. Repetitive failures were occurring in associated piping components on the suction of a sales gas compressor. Available experimental investigations indicated the occurrences of vibrations at the predominant frequencies of 1500 and 3000 Hz in the compressor strainer pipes. Hence, this study is aimed at identifying the source of such high vibration levels. The study investigated the flow-induced vibrations in the compressor strainer pipe through numerical simulation of the flow in the pipe including the strainer, as well as structural modal analysis calculations for the strainer at steady-state conditions. Three different geometrical configurations were considered. The first strainer has a truncated-cone geometry with uniform size holes. The second is witch-hat geometry with uniform holes, while the third is a modified witch-hat configuration with non-uniform holes. The results obtained from the frequency analysis of the flow field downstream of strainers with the first two geometries indicated dominant amplitudes at 1500 Hz and appreciable excitations at its second harmonic. However, the results demonstrated that the dominant vibration amplitudes have been appreciably reduced for the third case of the modified witch-hat configuration with non-uniform holes.</p>

<p>Flow-induced vibrations (FIVs) are an important subject in fluid engineering due to its relation to the safety of fluid-handling systems. It involves interaction between the fluid oscillations and structural deformation. There are two types of flow-induced vibrations. One is the self-excited vibration, in which the vibrations are produced originally by a mechanical or some other disturbance and the vibration starts at the natural frequency of the body. The other kind is the flow-forced vibration, in which the vibration of the body is caused originally by the unsteady flow field around it and may contain various frequency components. FIV has some major classes; vortex-induced vibration (VIV) is the most common type. It is caused by the oscillating flow separating from a given body or structure. Structures containing circular, cylindrical structures and perforated plates are particularly susceptible to VIV. Breaking the circular or cylindrical symmetry of the structure using strakes, for instance, was found to be an effective way of reducing the amplitude of vibration and the resulting stresses.</p>
<p>A strainer is a device which provides a means of mechanically removing solids from a flowing fluid by utilizing a perforated mesh or wedge wire straining element. Field applications have established the need for strainers in the protection of pumps, compressors, turbines, meters, automatic valves, sprinkler heads, burner nozzles, steam traps, and other pipeline equipment, FCI Standard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954408911403979"><bold>1</bold></xref>]. While strainers remain a relatively low-cost item, they provide invaluable protection when designed properly. It is noted, however, that the strainer under consideration by this investigation belongs to a class of geometric strainers, which includes cone, truncated cone, and flat geometries. Perforated conical strainers are normally inserted into the suction piping of the turbo-compressor that boosts the pressure in natural gas transportation systems. The objective of these strainers is to prevent foreign objects, left in the pipeline after its construction, from striking the compressor impellers. The strainers are also proven to be effective permanent scrubbing devices in most services requiring infrequent cleaning, such as dry and sweet natural gas transportation systems. The strainers that substitute scrubbers offer remarkable construction and design savings for the gas pipeline operators; hence, they are often installed in gas transportation systems. A conical perforated strainer could be installed as close as few metres from the compressor nozzle, or customarily at a distance of about 15 pipe diameters from the compressor nozzle. However, the convenience of strainer installation rather than consideration of its acoustic behaviour frequently dictate its location in the piping system. Therefore, strainers are usually inserted at the flange sets that are installed for a different purpose. The strainer location is rarely analysed, although it frequently contributes to the acoustical fatigue of piping attachments, strainer disintegration, and spectacular noise generation. The flow over conical strainers combines the grazing flow tangential to the perforate face and the through flow across the perforations. Guidelines for selection, installations, and maintenance of pipeline strainers were presented by Shannon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954408911403979"><bold>2</bold></xref>]. Economy and performance of complex fluid-handling systems depend on the reliability of individual components such as valves, regulators, steam traps, meters, pumps, condensers, heat exchangers, and turbines. Because these units have little tolerance for handling inclusions, a strainer or filter should be used to protect them from damage that could result in failure. Because of its vital function, the proper selection of a strainer to match service requirements is essential to a good piping-system design. Pipeline strainers are used to protect downstream mechanical equipment. Although these are relatively low-cost items, the protection they provide is invaluable. In Shannon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954408911403979"><bold>2</bold></xref>], the various types of strainers are presented as well as the important considerations that should be made when selecting a strainer.</p>
<p>The problem of a perforated conical strainer as an example of an acoustic noise generator has been studied by Motriuk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954408911403979"><bold>3</bold></xref>]. A case of noise generation by a conical strainer was illustrated by noise and vibration measurements, which were carried out at several different locations of the studied piping system. Noise and vibration spectral components were identified and mitigated by the proposed recommendations. Noise measurements were carried out at several locations on compressor, yard piping, and piping support. Noise levels were measured using pressure-level methodology. The predominant peaks were defined as signatures of the fundamental screen source pulsation at 1400 Hz and the first harmonic of that source at 2825 Hz. The results showed that the location of the strainer in piping system is very important. When the strainer shell vibration couples with the booster or piping acoustics, it sets up a feedback mechanism which feeds oscillation energy into vortices shed by the strainer wall performance.</p>
<p>The stress analysis of the strainer under the effect of pressure field distribution belongs to a class of elastoplastic analysis of thin-walled perforated structures. It has been recognized that the performance of thin-walled steel structures is influenced by the presence of imperfections, which could be of geometrical or mechanical type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954408911403979"><bold>4</bold></xref>]. Perforations are regarded as imperfections. Such imperfections contribute to the local or sectional instability, the global instability and the interaction between these two instability modes. It is well known that the presence of such perforations reduces the local buckling strength of the individual element and, consequently, the overall buckling strength of the member. The significance of this reduction, however, depends on the geometry and material properties of the member, as well as the boundary conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954408911403979"><bold>5</bold></xref>]. The wide variety of size and configuration of the perforations made it almost impossible to devise a unified approach for calculating the ultimate strength of perforated sections. The American Specification AISI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954408911403979"><bold>6</bold></xref>] provides specific recommendations for perforated sections, while stating some limitations regarding the size (hole diameter) and the diametral distance between holes (pitch) of perforations. Because testing, in general, is costly and time consuming, designers have resorted to numerical procedures in order to arrive at a reasonably accurate calculation of the ultimate strength of perforated structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954408911403979"><bold>7</bold></xref>]. Although some non-linear analytical models of perforated structures have been attempted to tackle some special structures, their applicability remained limited to gaining insight into the stability behaviour of simple structural configurations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954408911403979"><bold>8</bold></xref>]. Other theoretical formulations using the principle of virtual work were employed to address the initial and post-local buckling of rectangular perforated plates, wherein the non-linear equation of post-buckling path is approximated by a function of compressive strains using appropriate Hookean shortening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954408911403979"><bold>9</bold></xref>]. A simple design method to predict the ultimate shear capacity of horizontally curved plate girder webs containing centrally placed circular openings, and subjected to shear, was addressed by Lian and Shanmugam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954408911403979"><bold>10</bold></xref>], who assessed the accuracy of the proposed equation by comparing the results with the corresponding finite element values as well as with available experimental results. A satisfactorily correlation has been observed, which attests to the reliability of the finite element solutions in similar applications. Two-dimensional (2D) and 3D finite element solutions were further utilized to analyse the deformation behaviour of shadow mask of perforated sheet due to thermal and tension loading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954408911403979"><bold>11</bold></xref>], as well as in elastoplastic buckling analysis of perforated plates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954408911403979"><bold>12</bold></xref>].</p>
<p>It is apparent that the finite element method is a reliable numerical technique, which is well-tested and verified for accuracy and efficiency in many similar applications. The finite element technique will be used in this study to determine the nominal failure stress, and whether the member will fail from elastic buckling, inelastic buckling, or yielding. The finite element code ANSYS will be utilized.</p>
<p>It was found that most of the previous work done on FIVs focused on flow around cylinders and flow over perforated plates, while very few were related to strainers. The objective of this study is to investigate the fluid dynamic characteristics of an existing truncated-cone strainer to identify the mechanism of generating high-frequency vibrations in the piping system of gas compressors suction headers. Consequently, the appearance of vibration amplitudes at the predominant frequencies of 1500 and 3000 Hz in some of the compressor strainer pipes could be explained. In addition, a modified strainer geometry, which alleviates the problem of high-amplitude vibrations at such predominant frequencies, can be proposed.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec3-0954408911403979"><title>2.1 The flow domain</title>
<p>This investigation was motivated by the need to study, analyse, and find solution for the high-amplitude FIV, which was monitored at the associated piping components on the suction side of a sales gas compressor of a gas plant. A strainer of the truncated-cone type was fitted into the supply pipe, which experienced repeated failures. Field measurements attested to the fact that the high-vibration amplitudes arise only in the presence of the strainer. To this end, three different geometries of strainers are considered in this study. The first represents the existing truncated-cone configuration with uniform set of holes, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954408911403979">Fig. 1</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954408911403979">Figure 2</xref> presents the strainer–pipeline–compressor system. The second configuration is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954408911403979">Fig. 3</xref> for a perfect cone geometry or witch-hat strainer with uniform holes. Both these strainers have hole diameters of 6.35 and a spacing between holes of 5 mm. The third configuration represents a witch-hat strainer, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954408911403979">Fig. 4</xref>, but with holes of variable dimension (non-uniform hole diameter). The strainer has three different set of holes 6, 7, and 8 mm.

<p>The fluid dynamic characteristics of the strainers are studied numerically by simulating the unsteady flow field in the strainer pipe. To predict the flow pattern and the pressure–time distribution at different locations of the strainer, the 3D unsteady conservation equations for mass and momentum were solved numerically. The 3D unsteady form of such governing equations is reported in Habib <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954408911403979"><bold>13</bold></xref>] and Versteeg and Malalasekera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954408911403979"><bold>14</bold></xref>], and can be presented as follows.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0954408911403979"><title>2.2 The structural domain analysis</title>
<p>The strainer belongs to shell-type structures. In general, shells form a curved surface in space and are simply 3D solids. They are characterized by having one of their dimensions in one direction much smaller than the other two dimensions. Accordingly, a shell may be described geometrically by its thickness and the shape of its mid-surface. Shells are load carrying structures, and display bending and membrane stresses, which are inseparable. The structural integrity of the strainers was examined to address the extent of the strainer deformation under the pressure field distribution. In this regard, the incremental strain can be expressed using variational relationship as

where <italic>β</italic> is the membrane strain, γ represents the change in curvature, and <italic>z</italic> the distance along the shell thickness.

<p>The detailed simulation required large computational resources. It was decided to go with the zoom-in approach. In this approach, small portion of the front plate of the strainer was zoomed-in. This portion is 2 × 2 cm<sup>2</sup> and contains two full holes, two half holes, and four quarter holes for the case of the old strainer, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954408911403979">Fig. 5(a)</xref>. The coordinate system and meshed volume of the old strainer is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954408911403979">Figs 5(a) and (b)</xref>. The whole volume of the region surrounding the chosen portion is meshed.

<p>The equations of conservation of momentum for laminar flow are integrated and solved simultaneously over a typical volume, which is formed by division of the flow field into a number of control volumes, to yield the solution. Calculations are performed with at least 1 000 000 elements considering fine elements in the section of the holes of the strainer. Convergence is considered when the maximum of the summation of the residuals of all the elements for U, V, W, and pressure correction equations is less than 0.1 per cent. The procedure used a hybrid (upwind central) differencing scheme, wherein 40 iterations were used for each time step. A time step of 0.01 ms (equivalent to a sampling frequency of 100 kHz) was used and about 10 000 time steps were considered. This simulated duration of 0.1 s requires an actual computational time of 3 months (each time step takes 12 min). The peaking frequencies of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) spectrum did not show much difference and was analysed for 2024, 4096, 8192 data points. The porous media model was only utilized in predicting the static pressure field at equivalent porosity values.</p>
<p>Although the flow in the region surrounding the strainer holes (external flow) may be treated as laminar flow, the flow in the pipe containing the strainer experiences some unsteadiness. The associated flow pattern is characterized by eddies with a wide range of length and time scales. The largest eddies are typically comparable in size to the pipe diameter representing the characteristic length of the mean flow. The smallest scales are responsible for the dissipation of kinetic energy. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) is used to directly resolve the whole spectrum of the unsteady scales. DNS is not, however, feasible for practical engineering problems. The conventional approach to flow simulations employs the solution of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations which provides a significant savings in computational effort. The large eddy simulation (LES) is situated somewhere between DNS and the RANS approach. Basically, large eddies are resolved directly in LES, while small eddies are modelled. Accordingly, LES model is used in addition to laminar flows to validate the zooming approach considering a laminar flow in the vicinity of the strainer holes.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-0954408911403979"><title>3.2 Structural analysis</title>
<p>The objective of structural analysis was twofold; first, to figure out the structural natural frequencies of the strainer, and second, to figure out pressures at which a partially plugged strainer deforms plastically. For structural analysis, the general purpose finite element code ANSYS was used to model the strainer structure. The finite shell element, SHELL93, is particularly well suited to model curved shells. The element has six degrees of freedom at each node: translations in the nodal <italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>, and <italic>z</italic> directions and rotations about the nodal <italic>x</italic>-, <italic>y</italic>-, and <italic>z</italic>-axes. The deformation shapes are quadratic in both in-plane directions. The element has plasticity, stress stiffening, large deflection, and large strain capabilities. To verify the reliability of the developed FE model, another parallel model using a different finite element, SOLID95 is used. SOLID95 elements have compatible displacement shapes and are well suited to model curved boundaries. The element is defined by 20 nodes having three-degrees-of-freedom per node: translations in the nodal <italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>, and <italic>z</italic> directions.</p>
<p>Both strength and modal characteristics calculations were performed for the truncated-cone configuration using a solid model of the perforated strainer. Due to the special structural configuration of the strainer, in which one of its dimensions (thickness of 0.5 cm) is much smaller than other dimensions (height of 116 cm and base diameter of 57 cm), the finite element solution requires special mesh refinement to improve convergence performance. Another difficulty arose from the large dimensionality due to the very large number of small holes (about 17 000 of 0.6-cm diameter holes), which resulted in a finite element mesh of enormous dimension. Another alternative solution is obtained using the porous media equivalent model.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec10-0954408911403979"><title>4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS</title>
<p>The fluid flow results were conducted for a main flow of an average velocity of 16 m/s and for the fluid of methane having density of 20 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. Measurements of the time variations of the simulated pressure were conducted at different locations of the strainers. The coordinates of these locations are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954408911403979">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954408911403979">2</xref>. The time variation of the simulated pressure as predicted by the computational model for the considered (zoom-in) portion of the currently installed strainer is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954408911403979">Fig. 7</xref> for a point located at a distance of 25 mm (P4) downstream of the inner face of the zoom-in portion, while the corresponding frequency diagram is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954408911403979">Fig. 8</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954408911403979">Figure 7</xref> shows severe fluctuations for the pressure which is resulting from flow unsteadiness created by vortex shedding. It is clear from the figures that the pressure fluctuations are mainly from the turbulent structure of the flow together with a number of peaks caused by vortex shedding. The figures indicates a flow structure similar to that captured at points located at distances less than 25 mm but with a higher level of unsteadiness and with larger peaks. The calculated results confirm the experimental data that were conducted for the compressor piping containing the strainer, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954408911403979">Fig. 9</xref>, which displays peaks at frequencies close to 1500 and 3000 Hz. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954408911403979">Figure 8</xref> exhibits another calculated peak close to 100 Hz, which was also reported by the experimental data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954408911403979">Fig. 9</xref>, and diagnosed as the first acoustic cross-wall natural frequency. This is a pulsation frequency that depends on the speed of sound in fluid and the intake pipe diameter, and was not causing any problem, whereas our focus was on the FIVs at higher frequencies; in the vicinity of 1500 Hz and its higher harmonics.

<p>The pressure variation at a distance of 35 mm (P6) downstream of the strainer hole is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954408911403979">Fig. 10</xref>. It is clear from the figure that the pressure fluctuations at this location are much less (about 50 per cent less) than the fluctuations at points located at less distance downstream of the inner face of the zoom-in portion. This can be attributed to the vortex decay caused by viscous effects and also by interaction between adjacent vortices since this point is located further downstream.
<fig id="fig10-0954408911403979" position="float"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption><p>Simulated pressure signal at point 6</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954408911403979-fig10.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The frequency analysis of the pressure fluctuations was carried out for the same locations and is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954408911403979">Fig. 11</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954408911403979">Figure 11</xref> indicates two large peaks at approximately 1500 and 3000 Hz in addition to a number of smaller peaks at different frequencies. It is also clear from the figure that the amplitudes decrease significantly at higher frequencies. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954408911403979">Figure 11</xref> indicates the same two peaks at approximately 1500 and 3000 Hz but with much smaller amplitudes at higher frequencies when compared with those predicted at point located at a distance of 25 mm downstream of the inner face of the zoom-in portion.

<p>The witch-hat strainer with fixed hole diameters was considered by Motriuk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954408911403979"><bold>3</bold></xref>]. In his study, different conical angles and truncated cones were considered. It was indicated that all the tested strainers (having constant diameter holes) failed the noise or vibration acceptance criteria. It was also shown that the strainer exhibits similar vortex shedding with vibration-predominant frequency of around 1500 Hz.</p>
<p>The computational model was then used to simulate flow through the walls of the new recommended strainer. This strainer has variable-hole diameters. The choice of the strainer configuration stems from the expected correlation of the vibration frequency and the hole diameter and considering variable-hole size is expected to reduce the vibration peaks. The wire-frame drawing of the computational domain used for the zoom-in nine-hole model of the new strainer is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954408911403979">Fig. 6(b)</xref>. In this case, the details of the flow field were obtained for the zoom-in portion (30 × 30 mm<sup>2</sup>) shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954408911403979">Fig. 12</xref> with the strainer holes of variable size. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954408911403979">Figure 12</xref> shows the frequency analysis of the pressure signal at a point located at a distance of 10 mm downstream of the variable-hole strainer. The figure shows large peaks at frequencies below 1000 Hz, while having very small and continuously decreasing amplitudes at higher frequencies. A simple comparison with those for the installed strainer indicates that the flow structure downstream of the strainer holes is totally different. This is mainly due to the different course of interaction between the vortices generated from holes of variable sizes. One should also note the difference in the dominant amplitude in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0954408911403979">Fig. 13</xref> at 1500 Hz for the variable-size holes and that presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954408911403979">Fig. 8</xref> for the constant diameter holes at the same frequency. It should be noted that the points, at which the results are presented, are not correlated between the two studied cases (original strained and variable hole size strainers) since the considered zoom-in geometry is different for the two cases. The ratio between the two amplitudes is approximately about 1/25. The same trend is observed for other points. The frequency analysis at a point located at a distance of 50 mm downstream of the strainer wall is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0954408911403979">Fig. 14</xref>. The figure indicates a number of peaks in the frequency range between 500 and 2000 Hz. However, these amplitudes are less than 4 per cent of the amplitudes for the case of constant diameter holes. The same trend can be observed for the frequency analysis at other points located at the same distance downstream. It is worth mentioning that the witch-hat strainer considered by Motriuk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954408911403979"><bold>3</bold></xref>] exhibited similar vortex shedding with vibration-predominant frequency of 1500 Hz.

<p>The above results indicate that the largest pressure amplitude in the proposed strainer shape (variable-hole size) is much smaller than the corresponding amplitude in the old strainer. In general, the effect of shedding vortices on the unsteady pressure field is strongly influenced by: (a) the size and strength of the shedding vortices; (b) the number of shedding vortices and their distribution; (c) the decay of each vortex in space and time by viscous effects; (d) the interaction between nearby vortices; and (e) the original flow structure upstream of the strainer holes. It is believed that all these parameters are greatly influenced by the variable-hole diameters. The progress of the vortex structure with time is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954408911403979">Fig. 15</xref> for the two cases of strainer geometry; uniform size holes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954408911403979">Fig. 15(a)</xref>) and variable-size holes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954408911403979">Fig. 15(b)</xref>). The figures cover a time period of which a vortex shedding lasts. The figures show clearly the vortex shedding in the case of the uniform size holes and the interaction between the different vortices; thus, influencing the unsteady pressure field, accordingly. It should be noted here that the boundary conditions were the same for all the three strainer geometries. The differences in the results are due to the differences in the shape of the strainer being of variable or uniform hole size. This conclusion is also confirmed by the fact that the change in the strainer head did not lead to reduced vibration amplitudes. Moreover, the current truncated cone and that of Motriuk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954408911403979"><bold>3</bold></xref>] exhibited similar vortex shedding.
<fig id="fig15-0954408911403979" position="float"><label>Fig. 15</label><caption><p>Progress of vortex structure with time for the original strainer (velocities are in m/s): (a) strainer with uniform size holes and (b) strainer with variable-size holes</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954408911403979-fig15.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The stress analysis included conducting stress and modal analyses of the perforated strainer configuration, when it is partially clogged and evaluating the frequency response of the strainer under the excitation of the pressure field with its widespread frequency spectrum. The purpose of the latter task is to examine the vibration amplitude at one of the strainers natural frequencies under the pressure field excitation.</p>
<p>The meshed finite element model of the equivalent porous media strainer is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0954408911403979">Fig. 16</xref>. The equivalent properties for IPA-100 standard perforation are the closest to the strainer perforation. The equivalent properties are <italic>E</italic>* = 0.56 <italic>E</italic>, Poisson's ratio* = 1.1 Poisson's ratio, and density is same. The superscript (*) refers to equivalent properties. Modal characteristics of the solid and porous media are calculated using ANSYS modal analysis capability. It was noted that both the perforated and the equivalent porous media models converged to the same solution, with the equivalent porous media model consuming less than one-tenth the computational CPU time of that used by the perforated model. It should be noted here that the porous media and the perforated plate are equivalent in having same density and Poisson's ratio. It is apparent that two frequencies at 1513 and 3011 Hz are present in the experimentally measured waterfall spectrum of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954408911403979">Fig. 9</xref>. The effect of fluid structure interaction on the deformation mode shapes was negligible, and therefore the strainer structural deformation mode shape was almost identical. It has been recognized, specifically, for perforated structures that the added stiffness due to fluid–structure interaction is negligible, while the added damping effect is insignificant. The mode shapes of deformations at those two frequencies are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0954408911403979">Figs 17</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-0954408911403979">18</xref>, respectively.

<sec id="sec11-0954408911403979"><title>5 CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>In this study, the problem of FIV occurring in the suction pipe of a centrifugal compressor was investigated through the numerical simulation of the flow in the pipe section that houses the suction strainer as well as detailed analysis of the structure integrity of the strainers when operating at steady conditions. This investigation demonstrated how the computational methods of fluid and structural dynamics were utilized in modelling the vibration-induced effects of a complicated strainer system. The causes of high-amplitude vibrations in the piping system at some specific frequencies were identified and properly correlated to the strainer design.</p>
<p>The frequency analyses of the velocity and pressure fields downstream of the strainer holes were carried out for three strainer designs. The first design is exactly the same as the installed strainer with constant diameter holes while the second (witch-hat geometry) has holes of variable size. The third geometry (witch-hat strainer) has a conical shape with constant diameter holes. The results obtained from the frequency analysis of the flow field downstream of the installed strainer indicated dominant amplitudes at 1500 and 3000 Hz with a smaller peak at 3000 Hz. On the other hand, the corresponding frequency analysis of the strainer with the same geometry but with holes of variable size was totally different. This is mainly due to the different course of interaction between the vortices generated from holes of variable sizes. The results indicated that the dominant amplitude at 1500 Hz for the strainer with variable-size holes is much smaller than the ones generated by the installed strainer with constant diameter holes. The results also indicated that the largest pressure amplitude generated by the strainer with variable-hole size is much smaller than the corresponding amplitude generated by the installed strainer. The frequency analysis of a strainer witch-hat shape was found to exhibit similar vortex shedding with vibration-predominant frequency of 1500 Hz. A similar witch-hat strainer was also investigated by Motriuk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954408911403979"><bold>3</bold></xref>] who concluded that the unsteady flow field exhibits similar vortex shedding structure with vibration predominant frequency of 1500 Hz. Stress and modal analyses of the perforated strainer indicated that the strainer has two distinct frequencies close to 1500 Hz and its second harmonic, which were excited by the wide-spectrum pressure field distribution.</p></sec>
