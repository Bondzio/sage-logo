<abstract>
<p>The industry standard for vented gas fireplaces allows the glass fronts to reach temperatures in excess of 1000°F (538C), depending on the type of glass used. Young children have suffered painful burns after inadvertently falling against or touching the hot glass. In many cases, the child’s parent was near the child when the injury occurred. This article explores human factors/ergonomics issues that play a role in burn injuries from gas fireplace glass, including consumer awareness of the hazard, child development, and product placement in the home. The limits of voluntary standards and need for mandatory regulation are discussed.</p>

<p>Injury data and HF/E research bolster the case for enhancing industry standards to better protect children.</p>
<p>On December 21, 2006, 11-month-old Marin Montgomery suffered painful and disfiguring third-degree burns after contacting the exterior glass of a gas fireplace.</p>
<p>Marin lived with her mother and siblings in a rental apartment that had a gas fireplace in the living room. The fireplace glass was flush with the wall and positioned near the ground. Marin had been sitting on the living room floor with her mother, who had just finished wrapping holiday gifts. Marin got up and toddled in the direction of the gas fireplace, which had been on for some time. Unbeknownst to her mother, the fireplace glass had reached a temperature of around 204°C (400°F).</p>
<p>Marin, who had just started walking, tripped and fell forward. Although her mom reached to grab her, the little girl had already stumbled and fallen against the vertical surface in front of her – the glass of the gas fireplace. Her mother immediately removed Marin from the glass, but it was too late. Marin suffered third-degree burns to both palms and scarring burns to her nose and forehead.</p>
<p>The gas fireplace in Marin’s home is called <italic>direct vent</italic>; it is a completely enclosed chamber that vents directly out a sidewall or to the roof. The glass front of a direct vent fireplace is porous, allowing radiant heat to enter the room. In doing so, the glass becomes very hot. The industry standard allows the glass fronts of gas fireplaces to reach 260°C (500°F). Glass that gets this hot creates a danger in the living areas where children play. As this article will reveal, the incidence of severe burns among young children from excessively hot gas fireplace glass is on the rise. But change may be coming as the government considers a mandatory regulation to address the hazard.</p>
<sec id="section1-1064804612445191">
<title>Other Victims</title>
<p>Marin Montgomery is just one example of a child in the United States who have suffered from contact burns as a result of touching the hot glass of a gas fireplace. On the basis of data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) and injuries treated in other settings, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) estimates that about 1,754 children may have been medically treated for glass contact burn injuries associated with gas fireplaces between 1999 and March <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1064804612445191">2009</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1064804612445191">CPSC, 2012</xref>). The associated injury costs equate to $91 million, or an estimated 171 incidents with an injury cost of $8.8 million annually. (Note that because of the small sample size of the NEISS injury estimates, these estimates are subject to variability.) Hands were the part of the body most frequently injured. Arm, finger, lower trunk, and facial injuries are also reported.</p>
<p>Medical professionals report an alarming increase in the number of children seeking treatment for severe burns resulting from contact with gas fireplace glass. One study reported a 15-fold increase in this type of pediatric burn injury from January 1996 through December 2002 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1064804612445191">Dunst et al., 2004</xref>). Researchers found the increased incidence to be highly correlated with the increase in sales of glass-enclosed gas fireplaces during the same period.</p>
<p>Retrospective data analyses shed light on the hazard pattern and those affected. One study identified 27 children, ranging in age from 8 months to 3 years, who were treated for such burn injuries at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto between 1999 and 2002 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1064804612445191">Zettel, Khambalia, Barden, Murthy, &amp; Macarthur, 2004</xref>). More than one third of victims (37%) were injured after they simply lost their balance near the fireplace. Another 30% were injured when they touched the glass front out of curiosity. The remaining injuries resulted when the child walked too close to the glass front.</p>
<p>Another study identified 35 children who were treated between 1994 and 2001, most for burns to the palms and forearms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1064804612445191">Naqui, Enoch, &amp; Shah, 2005</xref>). The authors concluded that because glass plates of gas fireplaces reach temperatures of 245°C (473°F) within 15 minutes, toddlers would have an extremely high risk of sustaining burn injury from such devices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1064804612445191">Naqui et al., 2005</xref>, p. 74).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1064804612445191">Becker and Cartotto (1998)</xref> conducted experiments measuring the glass temperature of gas fireplaces. The maximum measurable temperature for one glass front was 254°C (489°F). The temperature of this glass front was still increasing, but the adhesive metal tape melted, which prevented further measurement. Within an average of 6.5 minutes, the other fireplaces reached 200°C (392°F). Further, an average of 12.3 minutes was required for the appliances to cool from 200°C (392°F) to 100°C (212°F).</p>
<p>On the basis of their findings, the authors reported that
<disp-quote>
<p>a partial-thickness burn could occur with less than one second of contact with the glass front of a gas fireplace that had reached a maximum steady state temperature. Additionally, less than 1 second would be required for a partial-thickness burn 5 minutes after the fireplace had been extinguished. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1064804612445191">Becker &amp; Cartotto, 1998</xref>, p. 87)</p>

<title>The Human–Product Interaction</title>
<p>The hazard posed by hot gas fireplace glass stems from a combination of factors, including the attractiveness of fire to young children and the accessibility of the glass front. Curiosity about fire is believed to be universal among children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1064804612445191">Gaynor &amp; Hatcher, 1987</xref>). The vivid color and dynamic movement of the flames draw children to the fireplace. They may try to reach out toward the fire or toward their own reflection and, in doing so, may lean on or touch the glass (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1064804612445191">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The fireplace, when built into the wall and flush with it, serves as a physical substitute for the section of wall that it replaces. Many fireplaces are situated in a family room or other communal area of the home, approximately 6 inches from the floor. As was the case in Marin’s home, the fireplace glass can cover an area of about 3 feet by 3 feet. Toddlers range in height from 28 to 29 inches. The low height of the fireplace glass and the area of the wall it replaces make it accessible to young children. If a child were toddling near the fireplace, his or her hands and other parts of the body would be within reach of the glass.</p>
<p>Toddlers, who are unsteady on their feet, are particularly vulnerable to inadvertently falling into or contacting the glass. This conclusion is borne out by pediatric data showing that the average age of victims was 13 to 14 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1064804612445191">Dunst et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1064804612445191">Zettel et al., 2004</xref>). Most children walk independently between 10 and 15 months of age and are considered to be toddlers for about a year as they learn to become steady on their feet. Children this age frequently lose their footing when walking or standing. It is foreseeable that a toddler who is walking near the wall where a fireplace is positioned may fall against it.</p>

<title>Instruction, Warnings, and Consumer Awareness</title>
<p>The industry standard for vented gas fireplaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1064804612445191">American National Standards Institute [ANSI] &amp; Canadian Standards Association, 2003</xref>) allows glass fronts to reach temperatures ranging from 230°C -720°C (446°F to 1328°F) depending on the type of glass used. This temperature provision is for the interior surface of the glass front. The CPSC estimates that the maximum exterior temperatures for the different types of glass used in gas fireplaces ranges from 209°C-595°C (409°F to 1103°F). Manufacturers attempt to notify consumers about the hot temperatures of the glass front by placing a warning on the product and in the installation and instruction manual. These warnings advise of high surface temperatures and to stay away to avoid burns or ignition of clothing. For example, a typical warning states, “Hot while in operation. Do not touch. Severe burns may result.” Furthermore, parents are advised to carefully supervise young children when they are in the same room as the appliance. Optional screen guards, available for purchase, are noted in some manuals.</p>
<p>At issue is whether these warnings are adequate to address the hazard. The Safety Hierarchy for Hazard Prevention is a systematic methodology for addressing product hazards. According to the hierarchy, manufacturers should attempt to eliminate dangerous elements or guard consumers from them. Only when such design strategies are not feasible is a warning to be used.</p>
<p>Even the best-constructed warnings are considered a less desirable strategy than a design fix, as the effectiveness of any warning depends not only on the warning but also on the consumer noticing it, reading and understanding it, and ultimately complying at the appropriate time and in the appropriate manner.</p>
<p>Warnings associated with gas fireplaces are not likely to overcome the first hurdle: being noticed. The unit is totally self-contained and does not require the consumer to perform any actions to prepare it for use (e.g., adding wood to a wood-burning fireplace). Use of the product is easy and intuitive – it is operated by an on-off switch. In other words, consumers have no reason to look for a warning or consult the product manual.</p>
<p>Those who are interested in reading an on-product warning will not have an easy time locating it, as the warning tag is typically situated beneath the fireplace and behind a panel at the base of the unit. In other words, it is not visible unless one gets down on the floor, removes the panel at the base of the unit, and looks beneath the fireplace. The likelihood that one will do this with a functioning fireplace is extremely low. In fact, the only reason one has to open the base of the fireplace is to relight an extinguished pilot light, which may never happen. The warning in the installation and instruction manuals is also likely to go unnoticed, given that most consumers do not install or service their own gas fireplaces.</p>
<p>Even if these warnings were conspicuously located, they would not serve as an appropriate hazard prevention strategy for a product that is installed in the living areas of homes, within reach of young children. Furthermore, the warnings do not convey how hot the glass actually gets, that severe burns occur instantaneously, and how long the dangerously high temperatures persist after the product is turned off.</p>
<p>Although one can easily recognize the hazard of an exposed flame or open fireplace, it is not common knowledge that the glass front of a gas fireplace can reach over 209°C (409°F). This lack of knowledge by consumers was expressed in comments of parents whose children have been burned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1064804612445191">Pollack-Nelson, 2009</xref>). One father noted that prior to his son’s incident, he had no idea whether the glass front on the gas fireplace got hot. “It had never crossed my mind.” Another consumer told the manufacturer of the gas fireplace on which his child was injured that he (and other parents he consulted with) “assumed the glass was of such material that it would not get hot!” Another parent reported that she considered the glass to be a barrier between her family and the fire and was not worried about her daughter’s being around it. “I thought the glass protected the heat from the outside. . . . I thought the glass was heat resistant.” In other words, the glass front provided a false sense of security.</p>
<p>The absence of any barrier over the front of the glass contributes to the perception that the glass is touchable. As one angry parent wrote in a letter to a manufacturer, “One would not assume since there is no protective screen/stop around these fireplaces that the glass would get so hot.”</p>
<p>In sum, the average consumer has no reason to suspect that the glass front of a gas fireplace presents an acute burn hazard. Although it is common knowledge that the interior of the fireplace gets hot, many consumers are unaware that the glass poses a burn hazard.</p>

<title>Industry Standards to Address Burn Potential on Accessible Hot Surfaces</title>
<p>Information about the burn potential of hot surfaces and the temperature–time relationship for burns was published in the 1940s (Henriques, 1948; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1064804612445191">Mortiz &amp; Henriques, 1947</xref>). Researchers determined that the level of skin damage caused by the duration and intensity of surface contact could be related by the curve shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1064804612445191">Figure 2</xref>. According to this graph, exposures below the lower curve should not produce permanent injury in normal humans. Exposures above 70°C (158°F), indicated by the top line of the graph, will cause third-degree burns that result in deep, permanent cell death and scarring after 1 second.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1064804612445191-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>A number of voluntary industry standards incorporate these findings into their recommendations. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1064804612445191">ASTM International’s (2003)</xref> Standard Guide for Heated System Surface Conditions That Produce Contact Burn Injuries states that although allowing for the possibility of first-degree burns, “at no time . . . are conditions that produce third degree burns recommended.” The standard suggests surface temperatures below 70°C (158°F). The standard also references <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1064804612445191">Wu’s (1977)</xref> recommendation for a 1-minute exposure limit “for design purposes for persons who have slow reactions (such as infants and the elderly) or who freeze under severe hazard conditions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1064804612445191">ASTM International, 2003</xref>, p. 7).</p>
<p>Other voluntary standards, such the Underwriters Laboratories’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1064804612445191">UL, 2005</xref>) Standard for Household Electric Ranges, also identify maximum acceptable temperatures that are well below that allowed by the ANSI standard for the glass of gas fireplaces. The UL standard limits the glass of electric ranges that are positioned 3 feet or less above the floor to 77.8°C (172°F).</p>
<p>A British voluntary standard instructs a protocol for determining the hazard posed by touchable hot surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1064804612445191">British Standard EN 13202, 2000</xref>). According to this standard, all accessible, touchable hot surfaces are to be identified and a task analysis is to be performed that identifies the activities involved in using the product. Hot surfaces are measured during normal operating conditions of the product. “If the surface temperature is above the burn threshold, cutaneous injury upon contact with the hot surface is to be expected” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1064804612445191">British Standard EN 13202, 2000</xref>, p. 6). This standard specifically mentions “unintentional contact” by children, instructing that their extended reaction time will be longer.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Until 24 months children do not have reflexes which are quick enough to remove their hands from what burns them. They do not always have the ability to get away from hot surfaces therefore. The contact period can be up to 15 s for very young children. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1064804612445191">British Standard EN 13202, 2000</xref>, p. 8)</p>

<title>Addressing the Hazard</title>
<p>Consistent with the Safety Hierarchy, some manufacturers provide an integrated, protective mesh screen with their gas fireplaces to guard against access to the hazardous glass. This type of “passive intervention” does not require consumer action to ensure the safety of the product around children. Passive interventions have been advocated in the published literature for decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1064804612445191">Dershewitz &amp; Williamson, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1064804612445191">Eichelberger, Gotschall, Feely, Harstad, &amp; Bowman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1064804612445191">Ytterstad, Smith, &amp; Coggan, 1998</xref>). A passive intervention, such as a screen, is the only practical and effective strategy for dealing with this hazard, given that consumers are not likely to encounter warnings when using the product.</p>
<p>Providing an integrated screen can effectively mitigate the hazard, but many manufacturers do not incorporate one with the fireplace, and the industry standard does not require it. Yet, inconspicuous warnings are incapable of effectively addressing this hazard, and guarding is feasible. Hoping to effect a change, this author contacted the ANSI Subcommittee for Gas Vented Fireplaces in May 2010, requesting that revisions be made to mitigate the risk. In the ensuing year, industry representatives met to discuss the issue; however, the standard was not revised.</p>
<p>In May 2011, this author petitioned the CPSC, requesting enactment of a mandatory standard to require safeguards on glass fronts of gas fireplaces. The petition was docketed and the public was invited to respond. Comments were received by the commission in support of a physical barrier to guard against the burn hazard. Commission staff responded, stating, “Staff agrees with the petitioner and the supportive comments on this issue” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1064804612445191">CPSC, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In January 2012, industry representatives met with the commission and laid out a plan to address the burn hazard and change the voluntary standard to require a protective barrier be shipped with the fireplace if the outside temperature of the glass front exceeds 78°C (172°F). The physical barrier must not become hot enough to cause a severe burn. Furthermore, the industry plans to undertake a consumer education campaign to inform consumers as to the burn hazard and the importance of the barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1064804612445191">CPSC, 2012</xref>). In April 2012, the CPSC decided to defer action on the petition for six months, awaiting impending revisions to the voluntary standard that will hopefully require a protective barrier to prevent burn injuries.</p>
