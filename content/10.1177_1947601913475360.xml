<abstract>
<p>Ovarian cancer is the most deadly gynecological cancer, with previous studies implicating lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in the progression of approximately 90% of all ovarian cancers. LPA potently stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas, a scaffolding protein, which, upon phosphorylation, recruits an array of signaling molecules to promote tumor cell migration. Our work presented here identifies Gα<sub>i2</sub> as the major G protein involved in tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas in a panel of ovarian cancer cells consisting of HeyA8, SKOV3, and OVCA429. Our results also indicate that the G12 family of G proteins that are also involved in LPA-mediated migration inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas. Using p130Cas siRNA, we demonstrate that p130Cas is a necessary downstream component of LPA Gα<sub>i2</sub>–induced migration and collagen-1 invasion of ovarian cancer cells. Considering the fact that LPA stimulates invasive migration through the coordination of multiple downstream signaling pathways, our current study identifies a separate unique signaling node involving p130Cas and Gα<sub>i2</sub> in mediating LPA-mediated invasive migration of ovarian cancer cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ovarian cancer is currently the most fatal gynecological cancer with a 5-year survival rate of only 45%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1947601913475360">1</xref></sup> This is primarily due to the lack of a clear understanding of the causative factors involved in the genesis and progression of the disease as well as the absence of any early diagnostic biomarkers. In this context, the identification of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) as a novel “ovarian cancer–activating factor” that is present at high concentrations in ascitic samples of ovarian cancer patients is highly significant in that it identifies the LPA-mediated signaling pathway as a potential therapeutic or diagnostic target for the control of ovarian cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1947601913475360">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1947601913475360">3</xref></sup> To this end, LPA has been convincingly linked to ovarian cancer progression and metastasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1947601913475360">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1947601913475360"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1947601913475360"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1947601913475360"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1947601913475360"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1947601913475360"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1947601913475360"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1947601913475360"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1947601913475360"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1947601913475360"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1947601913475360"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1947601913475360"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1947601913475360">16</xref></sup> It has been shown that signaling by LPA involves the activation of different LPA receptors that are rather permissively coupled to several heterotrimeric G proteins. Of these G proteins, the α-subunits of Gi, Gq, and G12 families have been shown to be involved in LPA-stimulated cancer cell survival, proliferation, and invasive migration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1947601913475360">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1947601913475360"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1947601913475360"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1947601913475360">20</xref></sup> Previous studies from several laboratories including ours have shown that LPA stimulates both proliferation and invasive migration in ovarian cancer cells. While our previous studies have established a crucial role for Gα<sub>12</sub> in LPA-stimulated proliferation of ovarian cancer cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1947601913475360">18</xref></sup> studies from several laboratories including ours have also established a role for multiple α-subunits, including those of Gi, G12, and G13, in LPA-stimulated invasive migration of ovarian cancer cells. It is of interest to note here that the downstream signaling pathways regulated by the Gi and G12 families in response to LPA are quite different. Considering the complex array of spatiotemporal signaling networks involved in cell migration, it can be reasoned that the different α-subunits regulated by LPA-LPAR signaling are involved in the regulation of specific signaling nodes in the vast array of interconnected networks involved in cell migration. Based on this rationale, the present study is focused on investigating whether a distinct signaling node can be ascribed to a specific G protein in LPA-stimulated cell migration.</p>
<p>Of the different signaling nodes involved in cell migration, the role of Gα<sub>13</sub> in the regulation of Rho-dependent cytoskeletal changes and the role of Gα<sub>i</sub>/Gα<sub>13</sub> in the regulation of Rac-dependent cytoskeletal changes have been well documented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1947601913475360">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1947601913475360">21</xref></sup> However, the identity of the G α-subunit that mediates LPA-stimulated tyrosine kinase signaling is not fully resolved. Focusing on defining the α-subunit involved in this process, we first sought to identify LPA-responsive tyrosine kinase signaling pathways using an antibody array. Results presented here indicate that LPA stimulates the potent phosphorylation of p130Cas, an adaptor protein that acts as a signaling hub from which signals are sorted out to different kinases, structural proteins, and GTPases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that LPA stimulation of ovarian cancer cells activates Src and directly leads to the phosphorylation of Tyr-410, allowing p130Cas to recruit a host of downstream target proteins involved in invasive migration. Our studies also indicate that LPA stimulates the phosphorylation of p130Cas via VPC32183-sensitive LPA1 and/or LPA3 receptors. Silencing of p130Cas drastically attenuates LPA-mediated migration of a panel of ovarian cancer cells. More interestingly, our studies using Gα<sub>i2</sub>-silenced ovarian cancer cells clearly provide unequivocal evidence that LPA-stimulated activation of p130Cas is mediated by Gα<sub>i2</sub> and not by Gα<sub>q</sub>, Gα<sub>12</sub>, or Gα<sub>13</sub> in the ovarian cancer cell lines tested. Thus, our results presented here demonstrate for the first time a nonoverlapping, unique role for Gα<sub>i2</sub> in LPA-stimulated invasive migration of ovarian cancer cells.</p>

<title>LPA stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas in ovarian cancer cells</title>
<p>To identify proteins that were tyrosine phosphorylated in response to LPA stimulation, we carried out tyrosine phosphorylation profiling of HeyA8 ovarian cancer cells that were stimulated with 20 µM of LPA for 20 minutes using an antibody array containing antibodies targeting 60 different signaling proteins. Results from such tyrosine phosphorylation profiling indicated positive signals with varying strengths of tyrosine phosphorylation for 4 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1947601913475360">Fig. 1A</xref>, lower panel). These spots in descending order of signal strengths are p130Cas (D4), FAK (E2), integrin β3 (H3), and CDC25A (F1), respectively. In contrast, reprobing the antibody array with the lysates from untreated control HeyA8 cells failed to show a strong signal in any of the spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1947601913475360">Fig. 1A</xref>, upper panel), indicating that LPA stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins, including p130Cas, in a highly specific manner. Due to the fact that the p130Cas spot (D4) showed a relatively stronger signal and that the increased expression and/or phosphorylation of p130Cas has been associated with an increased aggressiveness of different cancers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1947601913475360">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1947601913475360"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1947601913475360"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1947601913475360"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1947601913475360"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1947601913475360"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1947601913475360"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1947601913475360">29</xref></sup> we focused on verifying whether LPA stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas in several other ovarian cancer cell lines and then characterized the upstream signaling components of LPA-mediated phosphorylation of p130Cas, specifically focusing on the G protein(s) that lead to p130Cas phosphorylation. To verify the antibody array data, we performed immunoprecipitation of p130Cas coupled with immunoblotting with an antibody that recognizes phosphorylated tyrosine residues in a panel of ovarian cancer cells consisting of HeyA8, OVCA429, and SKOV3 that were stimulated with 20 µM of LPA for 20 minutes.

<title>LPA-stimulated phosphorylation of p130Cas involves the Src family of kinases</title>
<p>p130Cas is a scaffold protein, which has been shown to recruit a multitude of signaling molecules when tyrosine phosphorylated. It has previously been shown that p130Cas is necessary for <italic>v-Src</italic>–mediated transformation of cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1947601913475360">30</xref></sup> It has been well established that Src directly phosphorylates p130Cas on YXXP motifs in the substrate-binding domain of p130Cas, and Tyr-410 of p130Cas is one of the Src-targeted YXXP sites in the substrate-binding domain of p130Cas. Reasoning that the phosphorylation at Tyr-410 of p130Cas should represent a good proxy for total tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas in addition to being indicative of the involvement of Src in this pathway,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1947601913475360">31</xref></sup> we first investigated whether Tyr-410 is phosphorylated in response to LPA using an antibody specific to Tyr-410 of p130Cas. Our results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1947601913475360">Figure 2A</xref> indicate that Tyr-410 of p130Cas is phosphorylated when the cells are stimulated with LPA, demonstrating a potential role of Src in LPA-stimulated phosphorylation of p130Cas. If Src indeed is involved in the phosphorylation of p130Cas, it can be reasoned that LPA is involved in the activation of Src as well. To test this, we monitored the phosphorylation of Src on Tyr-410 as an index of activation in response to LPA. Our results showed that LPA stimulated the activation of Src (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1947601913475360">Fig. 2B</xref>). In order to confirm that Src mediates LPA-induced phosphorylation of p130Cas, we tested whether LPA-stimulated phosphorylation of p130Cas on Tyr-410 was attenuated by PP2, an inhibitor of the Src family of kinases. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1947601913475360">Figure 2C</xref>, treatment of HeyA8 and OVCA429 cells with PP2 inhibited the phosphorylation of Tyr-410 on p130Cas, suggesting that Src or a member of the Src family of kinases is mediating the phosphorylation of p130Cas on Tyr-410.</p>

<title>LPA1 and/or LPA3 receptors mediate LPA-stimulated phosphorylation of p130Cas</title>
<p>The involvement of the Edg family of LPA receptors in ovarian cancer has been well characterized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1947601913475360">32</xref></sup> Since LPA can stimulate at least 6 distinct receptors, we sought to identify the LPA receptor(s) that mediates the phosphorylation of p130Cas. First, we determined the expression levels of the 3 LPA receptors commonly expressed in the panel of ovarian cancer cells utilized in this study using quantitative RT-PCR. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1947601913475360">Figure 3A</xref>, the levels of each LPA receptor varied in these 3 cell lines. HeyA8 cells expressed high levels of LPAR3 with low expression of LPAR1 and LPAR2, while OVCA429 cells expressed high levels of LPAR1 and LPAR2 with low levels of LPAR3, whereas SKOV3 cells showed approximately equal levels of expression of all the 3 LPA receptors. Next, we investigated which LPA receptor(s) lead to the phosphorylation of p130Cas using 2 known inhibitors of LPA receptors, KI16425 and VPC32183. Previous studies have shown that KI16425 inhibited LPA-stimulated responses by inhibiting LPA1, LPA2, and LPA3 receptors in a concentration-dependent manner in the following order: LPAR1 (K<sub>i</sub>: 0.34 µM) &gt; LPAR2 (0.93 µM) &gt; LPAR3 (6.5 µM).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1947601913475360">33</xref></sup> Therefore, we carried out a dose escalation study with the LPA receptor inhibitor KI16425 to assess which endogenous LPA receptor(s) were contributing to p130Cas phosphorylation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1947601913475360">Figure 3B</xref>, inhibition of p130Cas was seen at a dose of 0.5 µM, and maximal inhibition, although not a complete return to basal levels, was seen at a dosage of 1 µM. These results indicated that LPAR1 and/or LPAR3 are the LPA receptors inducing p130Cas phosphorylation in these cell lines. To confirm this further, we used the LPA receptor inhibitor VPC32183 that has been shown to inhibit only LPAR1 and LPAR3 and not LPAR2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1947601913475360">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1947601913475360"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1947601913475360">37</xref></sup> As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1947601913475360">Figure 3C</xref>, treatment of HeyA8, OVCA429, and SKOV3 with 10 µM of VPC32183 reduced p130Cas to nearly basal levels and led to the inactivation of Src, suggesting that LPAR1 and LPAR3 are the major endogenous LPA receptors that lead to p130Cas phosphorylation.</p>

<title>The LPAR1/3-Gα<sub>i2</sub>-p130Cas signaling node plays a critical role in LPA-mediated migration of ovarian cancer cells</title>
<p>It has been previously shown that LPA-mediated cell migration involves the Gi family in many different cell types, including ovarian cancer cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1947601913475360">39</xref></sup> From our results that demonstrate that silencing p130Cas abrogates LPA-induced migration of ovarian cancer cells and that LPAR1/3 as well as Gα<sub>i2</sub> are involved in the phosphorylation of p130Cas, it can be deduced that LPA-mediated migration of ovarian cancer involves the LPAR1/3-Gα<sub>i2</sub>-p130Cas signaling nexus. To establish such a role, first we investigated whether the inhibition of LPAR1/3 led to an attenuation of LPA-mediated migration in ovarian cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1947601913475360">Fig. 7A</xref>). HeyA8, OVCA429, and SKOV3 cells were treated with VPC32183, and the migratory potential of these cells in response to 20 µM of LPA was analyzed using a wound healing assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1947601913475360">Figure 7A</xref>, treatment of these ovarian cancer cells with VPC32183 significantly attenuated their migration. Following this, we verified the role of Gα<sub>i2</sub> in LPA-mediated migration by silencing the expression of Gα<sub>i2</sub> and performing a wound healing assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1947601913475360">Fig. 7B</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1947601913475360">Figure 7B</xref>, knockdown of Gα<sub>i2</sub> led to a significant decrease in LPA-mediated migration in HeyA8 and SKOV3 cells. We also found that knockdown of Gα<sub>i2</sub> significantly reduced LPA-mediated collagen-1 invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1947601913475360">Fig. 7C</xref>). The results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1947601913475360">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1947601913475360">7C</xref> clearly demonstrate that LPA induces invasive migration of ovarian cancer cells in response to LPA and that knockdown of Gα<sub>i2</sub> significantly attenuates this invasive migration. To confirm this further, in addition to establishing a role for p130Cas in this process, we investigated whether the transient expression of the activated mutant of Gα<sub>i2</sub> could stimulate invasive migration of ovarian cancer cells and, if so, whether the siRNA-mediated silencing of p130Cas would abrogate such an anticipated stimulatory effect of constitutively activated Gα<sub>i2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1947601913475360">Fig. 7D</xref>). To test this, HeyA8 cells were transfected with Gα<sub>i2</sub>Q205L, and the migration of these cells was monitored using a collagen-1–coated transwell assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1947601913475360">Figure 7D</xref>, expression of constitutively active Gα<sub>i2</sub> led to a statistically significant increase in invasive migration of these cells compared to the control. More interestingly, when p130Cas was silenced via p130Cas-specific siRNA in the cells expressing constitutively active Gα<sub>i2</sub>, the observed increase in cell migration seen with Gα<sub>i2</sub> was completely inhibited, suggesting that p130Cas plays a vital role in Gα<sub>i2</sub>-mediated invasive migration of ovarian cancer cells. Together with the results obtained from the use of LPA receptor subtype–specific inhibitor VPC32183, our results establish a critical role for the LPAR1/3-Gα<sub>i2</sub>-p130Cas signaling nexus in LPA-responsive invasive migration of ovarian cancer cells.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this report, we have shown that the LPAR1/3-Gα<sub>i2</sub>-p130Cas signaling network is intimately involved in invasive migration of ovarian cancer cells. More importantly, we demonstrate that Gα<sub>i2</sub> mediates the tyrosine phosphorylation of the scaffold protein p130Cas to induce invasive migration of ovarian cancer cells in response to LPA. Although the role of the Gi family in LPA-stimulated migration in multiple cell types, including ovarian cancer cells, has been demonstrated previously,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1947601913475360">39</xref></sup> the specific locus in which Gα<sub>i2</sub> is involved in the regulation of invasive cell migration has thus far not been identified. Our finding here that LPA-Gα<sub>i2</sub> signaling involves Src-mediated p130Cas phosphorylation is a novel and highly significant finding. This gains further significance in light of the observation that p130Cas is a scaffold protein, which has been shown to recruit a multitude of signaling molecules when tyrosine phosphorylated, and that p130Cas is “essential” for the neoplastic transformation of various cell types in response to many different oncogenes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1947601913475360">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1947601913475360">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1947601913475360">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1947601913475360">41</xref></sup> Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that p130Cas is directly involved in the increased aggressiveness of several cancers, including a recent report showing its importance in ovarian cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1947601913475360">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1947601913475360">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1947601913475360">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1947601913475360">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1947601913475360">43</xref></sup> Overall, the critical observations made in this report are that LPA stimulates the Tyr-410 phosphorylation of p130Cas in ovarian cancer cells and that the phosphorylation of p130Cas is dependent on Gα<sub>i2</sub>. What is more, we have conclusively shown that the LPA-LPAR-Gα<sub>i2</sub>-p130Cas signaling network is intimately involved in the migration of ovarian cancer cells. Therefore, this report is the first study to establish that LPAR1/3-LPAR Gα<sub>i2</sub>–mediated stimulation of p130Cas is involved in invasive migration of ovarian cancer.</p>
<p>Analyses of our results also unravel the possible mechanisms through which LPA activates multiple G proteins to regulate distinct signaling nodes to coordinate cell migration in general. Previously, it has been observed that LPA stimulates ovarian cancer cell migration through the activation of Gα<sub>i</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1947601913475360">39</xref></sup> as well as Gα<sub>12/13</sub>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1947601913475360">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1947601913475360">38</xref></sup> suggesting the possibility that the migratory response of ovarian cancer cells to LPA involves a network of interconnected pathways. It has been well established that LPA stimulates Rho-dependent cytoskeletal changes via Gα<sub>12/13</sub>. Likewise, previous studies have linked the Gi family to the activation of Rac. One particular study of a ligand with very similar properties to LPA, S1P, was shown to induce Rac1 activation and invasive migration via a Gi family–dependent pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1947601913475360">44</xref></sup> An additional report demonstrated that Gi family activation via a PI3 kinase–dependent manner led to the activation of Tiam1, inducing the activation of Rac1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1947601913475360">45</xref></sup> What is more, previous studies have shown that when p130Cas is phosphorylated by Src on Tyr-410, it leads to the recruitment of Crk, which then leads to the activation of Dock180 and subsequent activation of Rac1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1947601913475360">27</xref></sup> Indeed, Sharma and Mayer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1947601913475360">46</xref></sup> recently demonstrated that phosphorylation of p130Cas by Src initiates Rac activation and subsequent membrane ruffling and lamellipodium formation. Likewise, it has also been established that LPA can stimulate Rac and subsequent Rac-dependent cytoskeletal changes in some cell types. Considering the fact that the stimulation of a p130Cas-mediated hub can result in the activation of Rac, it is rather tempting to speculate that LPA through specific receptors recruits Gα<sub>13</sub> to stimulate Rho-dependent events and Gα<sub>i2</sub> to stimulate Rac-dependent events. Nevertheless, it has been observed that Gα<sub>13</sub> can stimulate Rac activation in several different cell types.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1947601913475360">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1947601913475360"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1947601913475360"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1947601913475360">7</xref></sup> Similarly, Gα<sub>i2</sub> has been shown to be involved in the activation of Rho as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1947601913475360">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1947601913475360">48</xref></sup> To this end, an interesting possibility relates to the recent observation that Gα<sub>13</sub> can play a determinant role in the inhibition of Rac signaling in dorsal ruffles while mediating its activation in the leading edge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1947601913475360">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1947601913475360">50</xref></sup> While the role of Gα<sub>13</sub> in the dissolution of dorsal ruffles through inactivating Rac has been established, the identity of the G protein involved in the activation of Rac to stimulate dorsal ruffle formation is hitherto unknown. Our observation here that Gα<sub>i2</sub> phosphorylates Tyr-410 of p130Cas, which is well characterized in leading to the activation of Rac and the observed inhibition of this pathway by Gα<sub>13</sub>, may be indicative that Gα<sub>i2</sub> is the α-subunit involved in such locus- specific activation of Rac essential for cell migration. Thus, it is quite likely that LPA stimulates, presumably through distinct LPA receptors, Rac in dorsal ruffles via Gα<sub>i2</sub> while utilizing Gα<sub>13</sub> for Rac inhibition in dorsal ruffles as well as Rac activation in other cellular loci. Based on this reasoning, it can be envisioned that the dynamic spatiotemporally regulated balance between Gα<sub>i2</sub> and Gα<sub>13</sub> signaling, both stimulated by LPA, is required for cell migration, and the overexpression or silencing of one versus another unravels a seemingly antagonistic activity of the respective G protein. This is consistent with the observation that the silencing of Gα<sub>i2</sub> converts the stimulatory effect of Gα<sub>13</sub> into an inhibitory effect on cytoskeletal changes involved in cell migration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1947601913475360">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, recent findings by Nick <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1947601913475360">28</xref></sup> have demonstrated that when p130Cas is overexpressed in ovarian cancer patients, there is a very significant correlation with a decreased survival of these patients. When Nick <italic>et al.</italic>’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1947601913475360">28</xref></sup> findings are paired with the knowledge that over 90% of ovarian cancer patients have high levels of LPA found in the surrounding ascitic fluid, it is tempting to postulate that p130Cas overexpression paired with LPA signaling via a Gα<sub>i2</sub> pathway may be contributing to the decrease in the survival of these patients; yet, this remains to be experientially demonstrated. Therefore, in addition to providing evidence for such a context-specific role for these α-subunits, our findings with the LPAR1/3-Gα<sub>i2</sub>-p130Cas signaling nexus gain greater significance in ovarian cancer in which p130Cas signaling appears to play a critical role. Thus, the identification of this critical signaling node in ovarian cancer pathophysiology as presented here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1947601913475360">Fig. 8</xref>) could potentially lead to the development of novel targeted therapeutics for ovarian cancer, especially those patients who have an increased expression of p130Cas.</p>

<title>Cell lines and regents</title>
<p>The ovarian cancer cell lines SKOV3 and HeyA8 were kindly provided by E. Premkumar Reddy (Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY). The ovarian cancer cell line OVCA429 was kindly provided by Susan K. Murphy (Duke University, Durham, NC). All of the cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Mediatech, Manassas, VA) containing 10% FBS (Gemini Bio-Products, West Sacramento, CA), 50 U/mL penicillin, and 50 mg/mL streptomycin (Mediatech) at 37°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. For serum starvation, the media used were DMEM with 0.1% BSA Fraction V (heat shock, fatty acid ultra free) (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), 50 U/mL penicillin, and 50 mg/mL streptomycin (Mediatech). All cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40 (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mM sodium vanadate, 2 mg/mL leupeptin, 2 mg/mL pepstatin A, and 4 mg/mL aprotinin). LPA was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) and dissolved into 10 mM stock solutions in PBS with 0.1% BSA and stored at −80°C until use. PP2 was purchased from EMD Chemicals (Gibbstown, NJ), dissolved in DMSO, stored at −20°C until use, and used at the indicated concentrations. si-p130Cas (5′-GGUCGACAGUGGUGUGUAUUU-3′) and nontargeting siRNA ON-TARGETplus nontargeting siRNA #1 were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). sh-RNA for Gα<sub>i2</sub> #1 (5′-CCAGAGTAAGTTTGAGGACCT-3′) and Gα<sub>i2</sub> #2 (5′-GCATGAGAGCATGAAGCTATT-3′) was used in all experiments that had a single sh-RNA for Gα<sub>i2</sub> knockdown; Gα<sub>q</sub> (5′-CCATACAAGTATGAGCACAAT- 3′), Gα<sub>13</sub> (5′-GTCTCCATAATTCTGTTCTTA-3′), Gα<sub>12</sub> (5′- CGTCAACAACAAGCTCTTCTT-3′), and nonsense shRNA were purchased from Open Biosystems (Lafayette, CO). Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI), and peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse was purchased from GE Healthcare (Little Chalfont, UK). HRP-conjugated pan-tyrosine antibody (#5465), Tyr-410 p130Cas (#4011), Tyr-419 Src (#2101), Src (#2109), and GAPDH (#2118) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). p130Cas (sc-20029), Gα<sub>i2</sub> (sc-13534), Gα<sub>q</sub> (sc-393), Gα<sub>12</sub> (sc-20), and Gα<sub>13</sub> (sc-410) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).</p>

<title>Antibody array</title>
<p>HeyA8 cells were plated at 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> per plate, allowed to adhere and grow overnight, serum starved for 16 hours and either left untreated or treated with 20 µM of LPA for 20 minutes, and then lysed with RIPA buffer. The lysates (912 µg total protein) were incubated with an antibody array (#HM-3000-100T, Hypromatrix, Worcester, MA) for 2 hours at room temperature, washed in TBST 3 times, and then incubated with an HRP-conjugated pan-tyrosine antibody at 4°C with rocking for 16 hours. After 16 hours, the antibody array was washed 3 times in TBST and developed by a standard chemiluminescence protocol using a Kodak Image Station 4000MM (Rochester, NY).</p>

<sec id="section13-1947601913475360">
<title>Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation</title>
<p>Lysates (500 µg) from HeyA8, OVCA429, or SKOV3 cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation using an antibody specific for p130Cas. Immunoprecipitates containing p130Cas were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblot analysis was carried out using the same phosphotyrosine antibody as used in the antibody array. The blot was then stripped and analyzed for total p130Cas. Immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibodies was carried out following previously published procedures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1947601913475360">51</xref></sup> and developed with a Kodak Image Station 4000MM. The blots were cut at particular molecular weights relevant to each experiment, so that several antibodies could be incubated and developed in parallel. Stripping of membranes was performed at 70°C for 10 minutes in stripping buffer (1 M β-mercaptoethanol, 0.0625 M Tris, pH 6.8, 0.2% SDS). Quantification of immunoblots was performed with Carestream Molecular Imaging Software version 5 (Rochester, NY), and the respective values were imported into GraphPad Prism (La Jolla, CA) for graphing and statistical analysis.</p>

<title>Wound healing assay</title>
<p>All cells were transfected using an Amaxa Nucleofector II apparatus (Cologne, Germany). For knockdown of p130Cas, 100 nM of siRNA that specifically targeted p130Cas or nontargeting siRNA was transiently transfected into 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> HeyA8 or SKOV3 cells and placed into a 6-well plate in triplicate. At 48 hours after transfection, the cells were then serum starved overnight and treated with mitomycin C (10 µg/mL) to inhibit proliferation, and then 3 separate wounds were made per well. Pictures were taken at 3 random fields per wound and marked with a pen, and the cells were then stimulated with 20 µM of LPA for 24 hours. After 24-hour stimulation, pictures were taken of the same location, and cell movement was measured with the CellSens program (Olympus America, Center Valley, PA). For monitoring the effect of Gα<sub>i2</sub> knockdown, 2 different shRNAs that target different regions of Gα<sub>i2</sub> or nonsense shRNA were transiently transfected into 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> HeyA8 or SKOV3 cells, and wound healing was performed as described above. To monitor the effect of LPA on 3 different ovarian cancer cell lines, HeyA8 (5 × 10<sup>5</sup>), SKOV3 (7 × 10<sup>5</sup>), and OVCA429 (7 × 10<sup>5</sup>) cells were plated in 6-well plates and allowed to grow to confluence, and the same wound healing assay was performed as indicated above.</p>

<title>Collagen-1 invasion assay</title>
<p>Collagen type 1 was coated overnight onto 8-mm pore transwells at 4°C. The following day, the collagen-coated cell culture inserts containing 2.5 × 10<sup>4</sup> (HeyA8) or 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> (SKOV3) cells suspended in 200 mL serum-free media were placed in the well of a 24-well companion plate. Each well contained 500 mL media containing serum-free media control or serum-free media containing 20 µM of LPA. The cells were incubated for 20 hours. Nonmigrating cells on the proximal side of the inserts were removed with a cotton swab, and the migrated cells on the distal side of the inserts were fixed and stained with Hemacolor (EMD Chemicals). Images were obtained at 200× in 5 random fields for each group. The experiments were repeated 3 times. Each cell was transfected with the indicated plasmid or si-RNA and plated into 6-well plates for a total of 48 hours. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were serum starved for an additional 24 hours, trypsinized, counted, and plated at the above-mentioned numbers for each cell line.</p>
