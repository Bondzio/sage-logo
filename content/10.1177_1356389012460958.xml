<abstract>
<p>Investment subsidies are the most popular means of public support for enterprises. However, evaluation studies measuring their net effect suggest that their effectiveness is highly debatable. The social mechanism of investment subsidies has been investigated in the article with a flexible, abductive methodological approach. Both methodological and data source triangulations have been applied: qualitative and quantitative methods deployed; and viewpoints of manifold groups (policy-makers, beneficiaries, journalists) reconstructed. The article goes beyond previous findings indicating the small net effects of intervention by investigating the social mechanism accounting for the size of the effects. It also indicates that the permanency of the programme may be explained by the analysis of the programme theories of stakeholders involved in implementation.</p>

<p>It is a popular view among policy-makers<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1356389012460958">1</xref></sup> that investment subsidies serve the public interest by enhancing competitiveness of the national economy. Numerous previous studies have challenged this statement by indicating that net effects of subsidies are small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356389012460958">Bergström, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1356389012460958">Gabriele et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1356389012460958">Trainor and Harris, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1356389012460958">Venetoklis, 2000a</xref>). However, none have thoroughly researched the actual social mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1356389012460958">Boudon, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1356389012460958">Bunge, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1356389012460958">Hedström and Swedberg, 1998</xref>) leading to the negligible scale of the effects. Moreover, the reasons for the popularity of these types of subsidies have not been sufficiently investigated.</p>
<p>The main research question of this evaluative study is: what is the social mechanism of the programme under study? In order to answer the question, the research had to be based on an approach that would combine both the investigation of the mental models of stakeholders and rigorous net effect measurement. This approach allows us not only to investigate what kind of influence investment subsidies exert on both enterprises and economy, but also the social context of the mechanism.</p>
<p>The article is organized as follows: first, the context of the study is discussed, followed by a presentation of the methods used and then the results of applying these methods are shown in order to answer the research questions. The conclusions and discussion of the results are provided in the final section.</p>
<sec id="section1-1356389012460958">
<title>Context of the study</title>
<p>There are two elements that constitute the context of the study: the programme under evaluation and the theoretical framework of the approach.</p>
<sec id="section2-1356389012460958">
<title>Investment subsidies</title>
<p>Investment subsidies are among the most popular means of public support for enterprises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1356389012460958">Communities, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1356389012460958">Thomas, 2007</xref>). While investment subsidies vary across countries, the common support mechanism is unsophisticated: companies have part of their investments paid by public money. Within the current EU programming period (2007–13), more than 2 billion Euros will be spent to support small- and medium-sized enterprises in Poland alone.</p>
<p>The actual intervention being investigated in this article is Measure 2.3 of the Sectoral Operational Programme ‘Improvement of the Competitiveness of Enterprises’, implemented in Poland within the period 2004–6. The subsidies were co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund. While there were 21,737 applications, only 2862 contracts were signed. The total value of the contracts amounted to 426 million Euros. The problem that was supposed to be tackled by the intervention and the official programme theory of subsidies (as depicted in the official documentation of the programme) are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1356389012460958">Table 1</xref>. Basically, a lack of resources among enterprises for investment was defined as the main reason for the low competitiveness of the national economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1356389012460958">Sektorowy, 2004</xref>). Thus, subsidies were provided to enterprises. Having resources, enterprises were supposed to invest more into modern machinery. As a result, they and the whole economy should have become more competitive.</p>

<title>Theoretical framework</title>
<p>It is important to stress that the theoretical background of the study was developed during the process of data analysis. While the framework included detailed categories, only the most important ones will be presented (i.e. general categories of social mechanism and programme theory).</p>
<p>Even though the construction of the theoretical framework is based on the process of data analysis, one needs meta-categories with which to organize it. It is the view of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1356389012460958">Boudon (1981)</xref> that in order to construct the theoretical framework of a process one should consider three elements: mechanism (i.e. juxtaposition of social actions), environment (context) and outcomes of the mechanism. Causal phenomena usually involve complex interactions between preceding factors. On this basis, it appears probable that the influence exerted by the decision of any one of the stakeholders leads to outcomes through interaction with the environment.</p>
<p>More detailed guidelines relating to the research process may be found in the tradition of programme theory evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356389012460958">Chen, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1356389012460958">Pawson and Tilley, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1356389012460958">Rogers, 2005</xref>). A realistic approach to public policy programmes evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1356389012460958">Pawson and Tilley, 1997</xref>) is particularly in tune with the theoretical frameworks proposed by Boudon. Its authors stress the importance of knowledge accumulation through the analysis of causal phenomena. They also use the same categories of context, mechanism and outcome. At the same time, they stress the importance and provide tools to analyse stakeholders’ perceptions of the programme (called programme theories). Programme theories are sets of interrelated hypotheses that stakeholders associate with the programme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356389012460958">Chen, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1356389012460958">Pawson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1356389012460958">Rogers, 2005</xref>). According to this approach, therefore, understanding the mechanism of the programme should start from researching the stakeholders’ perceptions of how the programme works (i.e. their mental models). Next, these mental models shall be broken down into causal hypotheses, which are subsequently examined.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1356389012460958">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>In order to go beyond existing studies and investigate the social contexts of the programme, a pragmatic grounded theory methodology has been applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1356389012460958">Bryant, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1356389012460958">Strauss and Glaser, 1967</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1356389012460958">3</xref></sup> and, further, a sequential abductive process of research and triangulation. Abduction is the process of analysing facts and finding the best explanations that facilitate their understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1356389012460958">Peirce, 1878</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1356389012460958">Reichertz, 2007</xref>). As already indicated, finding explanations is conditioned by a proper theoretical framework. As Yu states, ‘[r]esearchers must be well-equipped with proper categories in order to sort out the invariant features and patterns of phenomena’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1356389012460958">1994</xref>). Abduction is followed by retroduction, in which hypotheses are constantly checked against observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1356389012460958">Levin-Rozalis, 2009</xref>). The utility of abduction in evaluation studies is already well described and documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1356389012460958">Levin-Rozalis, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1356389012460958">2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The project took place in the years 2007–10. Because grounded theory methodology was applied, the process of data collection was conducted in an iterative way. After collecting and analysing each portion of data, the research design could be modified. In order to illustrate the process of abduction, examples of its influence on the research process will be discussed while presenting findings.</p>
<p>The research process contained the following stages:</p>

<title>The influence of abduction on the research process</title>
<p>Four examples of the way abduction influenced the research process will be discussed. They show that the use of this approach provides an opportunity for abductive reasoning and a flexible research process.</p>
<p>On the basis of the first results, a hypothesis was developed that subsidies are provided to the most competitive companies and not necessarily the best projects, contrary to what the official aims of the intervention had claimed. The next stages of the research were designed in a way that would enable the verification of the hypothesis. It was demonstrated that not only did the more successful companies receive subsidies but also that all the stakeholders realized this was the case.</p>
<p>While analysing interviews with the policy-makers it became clear that the journalists are important stakeholders in the phenomenon under scrutiny. Having been asked whether the programme is worth implementing, some policy-makers answered: ‘Yes, the media like it.’ Thus, it was decided that the programme theory of journalists should be researched. It was hypothesized that newspaper articles describing interventions focus rather on the pace of implementation rather than its effectiveness. Therefore, in order to verify the hypothesis, a new research stage was added. Articles in main Polish newspapers concerning investment subsidies were investigated with the use of content analysis and the hypothesis was confirmed.</p>
<p>One of the surprising results from the first interviews was that stakeholders did not pay too much attention to the intervention costs. When the costs were thoroughly analysed they appeared to be relatively high.</p>
<p>The last example refers to the influence of abduction on the process of creation of theoretical framework. During the interviews with beneficiaries, the criteria they used to evaluate an intervention appeared as important as the way they perceived the intervention. Thus, the criteria of other stakeholders were analysed. As a result, the differences between stakeholders in terms of the criteria are thought to be one of the most important factors influencing the implementation of the intervention. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1356389012460958">Table 3</xref> summarizes the examples.</p>

<title>Mechanism leading to the low effectiveness of investment subsidies</title>
<p>On the basis of an evaluation of other similar programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356389012460958">Bergström, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1356389012460958">Gabriele et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1356389012460958">Trainor and Harris, 2005</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1356389012460958">Venetoklis, 2000a</xref>), it was hypothesized at the first stages of the research that investment subsidies are ineffective. The major focus of the research was the identification of the mechanism of the subsidies and factors decreasing their effectiveness. The six most important factors – flaws in the official programme theory – will be presented. They were identified during the research process and then confirmed by the results of other studies. The low effectiveness of subsidies was later confirmed by the official ex post evaluation of the programme. There were no significant net effects in terms of the key indicators of competitiveness (income, investments, productivity)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1356389012460958">4</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1356389012460958">Pokorski, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The programme has a low relevance. The implementation of subsidies stemmed rather from the availability of European funds than problem identification. It is argued in the official documentation of the programme that investment subsidies are greatly needed. It is maintained that they respond to the most important problem of Polish enterprises; that is, a lack of financial resources. Therefore, the State should provide funds for companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1356389012460958">Sektorowy, 2004</xref>). This view is not necessarily true. Rather diverse studies have shown that it is the low quality of regulations than the lack of capital that is the source of the biggest difficulties for both beneficiaries and, in general, enterprises in Poland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1356389012460958">Polish Agency for Enterprise Development, 2007</xref>). There are many reasons for the lack of investments, and the lack of capital is only a minor one. This thesis has been acknowledged by both policy-makers and beneficiaries. While the subsidies have been implemented in Poland, the national public administration has not introduced any intervention that could improve the quality of regulations. Consequently, the programme may fit into the ‘garbage can model’, where the choice of intervention ‘is characterized as the confluence of three streams: problems looking for solutions; solutions looking for problems; and people looking for things to do’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1356389012460958">Goodin et al., 2006</xref>: 22).</p>
<p>Even if some companies really need subsidies to become more competitive, the important question is whether subsidies are actually provided to these companies. Most of the interviewees agreed that the actual beneficiaries of the subsidies are the companies that are the most competitive (as opposed to those that had the best projects). This results from the construction of criteria for the selection of applications for subsidies, which favoured the more competitive enterprises. Subsidies therefore make the best enterprises even better. The effect of the rich becoming richer and the poor getting poorer is well recognized within social sciences and is sometimes labelled the ‘Matthew effect’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1356389012460958">Rigney, 2010</xref>). The mechanism occurs spontaneously in diverse areas of social life and the State’s intervention that facilitates this should not be considered as useful.</p>
<p>Another important issue is the vagueness of the aims that investment subsidies are supposed to lead to. Officially, subsidies should enhance the competitiveness of the national economy. However, as research demonstrates, policy-makers also have other aims (e.g. increasing employment or gaining political support). As a result, the aims are often contradictory, making the whole intervention unproductive. While the programme was designed, the unemployment in Poland was high (circa 20%) and policy-makers wanted to use all possible measures to decrease it. The unofficial aim of the intervention was to decrease the rate of unemployment.</p>
<p>As shown by various studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356389012460958">Bergström, 2000</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1356389012460958">Venetoklis, 2000a</xref>), the enterprises that receive public support to make an investment very often could manage to finance this investment from their own resources (<italic>deadweight effect</italic>). Having saved money, they are able to spend it in other areas (e.g. raising salaries or decreasing the price of their products). State financing of companies’ spendings is not necessarily therefore in the public interest. In the evaluation of this programme only 8 percent of beneficiaries claimed that they would not have realized their investment without subsidies; 23 percent would have realized the investment to the same extent and 69 percent to a smaller extent; 4 percent had difficulties in answering the question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1356389012460958">Pokorski, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, the results of the official programme evaluation question its efficiency. As an example, while creating one full-time job by providing subsidy costs of on average 9000 Euros, a similar effect was achieved by providing consultation costs of 1400 Euros (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1356389012460958">Pokorski, 2010</xref>). Subsidies involve large expenditures and an extensive circulation of monies. Taxpayers pay money, which then circulates within diverse public institutions in order to be given to enterprises. Each transaction involves costs. As rough estimations show (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1356389012460958">Krupnik, 2008</xref>), the costs of the enterprises preparing the applications for subsidies alone may constitute one quarter of the subsidies’ amount (100 million Euros in comparison with 426 million Euros). Therefore, even if there are some positive effects, they are most likely to be small in comparison with the costs that they involve.</p>
<p>The final argument against investment subsidies involves institutional dysfunctionality. Programme theory does not secure the appropriate assessment of the intervention. All stakeholders (i.e. entrepreneurs receiving the subsidies, policy-makers) benefit from them and are interested in their implementation. What it means is that even if the overall subsidies are not worth implementing in terms of public interest, all the actors deciding about it have preferences for implementation. The argument will be elaborated in detail when the reasons for the permanence of the programme are discussed.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1356389012460958">Table 4</xref> summarizes the mechanism leading to the low effectiveness of subsidies. Studies show that the effects are small, especially in relation to costs. However, subsidies are still being implemented. As it will be argued below, the permanency of the programme may be explained by the analysis of the programme theories of actors involved in programme implementation.</p>

<title>Permanence of investment subsidies: Programme theories of stakeholders</title>
<p>The comparison of programme theories of the stakeholders identified two main differentiating dimensions: problem definitions and evaluation criteria. They are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1356389012460958">Table 5</xref>. There were similarities between stakeholders in both dimensions. As an example, they all evaluated the programme positively. However, for the sake of simplicity, only differences are presented and discussed.</p>

<p>Formally the policy problem to be solved by investment subsidies is the lack of financial resources for investment in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). It is on this basis that policy-makers are supposed to apply classic evaluation criteria (e.g. efficiency, effectiveness, sustainability, utility and relevance). The whole programme is perceived as an investment, with the State acting as an investor whose actions, in this case subsidies, should serve the public interest.</p>
<p>However, the actual praxis of programme implementation and the interviews conducted show that the real problem believed to be tackled by the programme was unemployment. Policy-makers wanted to solve two problems with one tool. The actual evaluation criteria inferred from the interviews with policy-makers also differed from the official version presented in the documents. The most important evaluation criterion is the ease of implementation. Interviewees stated that for politicians, media coverage is of upmost importance. Thus, evaluation focuses rather on short-term than on long-term effects. Surprisingly, interviewees claimed that the programme could not be implemented if it was not co-financed from European funds. Thus, the source of financing is also used as an evaluation criterion.</p>
<p>There are also two important stakeholders whose programme theories are needed in order to understand the social mechanism of intervention: beneficiaries of the programme and journalists. According to beneficiaries, there are two factors/problems that lead to the programme. First, the government has European funds to spend. Second, SMEs are treated worse than big companies. Hence, the programme is evaluated positively on the criteria of justice and relative effectiveness. The programme is good because it a) partially compensates for the privileged position of big companies (i.e. now also smaller enterprises receive subsidies), and b) is a much more efficient way of spending the money than leaving it with the government or to be spent on other projects. As one of the beneficiaries stated, ‘Entrepreneurs know what to do with money’. To conclude, for beneficiaries the programme is all about redistribution of resources and they see receiving money as just and relatively effective.</p>
<p>According to journalists, the major problem to solve is the danger of giving money back ‘to Brussels’ in case the funds are not spent. Public institutions are depicted in articles as the barrier to effective (i.e. fast) implementation of subsidies. Thus, the programme is good only if money flows easily and is available to enterprises as quickly as possible. There is no space for the discussion of effectiveness. As an example, while 32 percent of articles discussed administrative problems with subsidies, only 2 percent referred to any doubts relating to the effectiveness of the subsidies. Once again, the programme is all about redistribution.</p>
<p>To conclude, the analysis shows that the programme theories of stakeholders accounts for the persistence and positive evaluation of the policy. While the programme is perceived in terms of redistribution, there is no need to assess its effectiveness.</p>
<p>The presented constellation of stakeholders seems to be an example of ‘low level equilibrium’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1356389012460958">Greskovits, 1998</xref>) between economic and good governance development. According to Greskovits, low-level equilibrium is typical of countries in transformation. However, comparative studies suggest that similar public policies persist within countries with a more advanced political culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1356389012460958">Krupnik, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusions and discussion</title>
<p>The study considers the social mechanism of investment subsidies. The article goes beyond previous findings indicating the small net effects of the intervention by investigating the social mechanisms that account for the effects. It also indicates factors accounting for the persistence of subsidies.</p>
<p>Even though only one case study was examined, and this is clearly a limitation, the comparison with other research suggests that the presented mechanism may in fact be common and, therefore, the issue deserves further study.</p>
<p>One of the important results of this study is also the identification of possible ways to improve the effectiveness of the public policies in this domain. First, the stakeholders involved may become more aware of the real mechanism of the intervention so that they can effectively influence the process. Second, the involvement of other stakeholders (independent experts, taxpayers, and entrepreneurs who are not beneficiaries) is needed. Most of all, this study underlines the importance of evaluations conducted by independent experts. As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1356389012460958">Venetoklis (2000b)</xref>, independent studies conducted by research institutes tend to use more advanced methodologies and produce less ‘enthusiastic’ (and more realistic) results of public policies. Taking into account the global trend of lowering the involvement of citizens in public policy processes, one should be pessimistic about the possibility of public protests. One should be similarly pessimistic in relation to entrepreneurs who are not beneficiaries and are worse off because of the subsidies. The organizations who are supposed to represent them are, at least in the Polish context, relatively weak and interested in receiving subsidies from European funds themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1356389012460958">Anacik et al., 2009</xref>), and, therefore, one cannot expect any protest from them.</p>
<p>It should be the object of further research to investigate the way the policy is presented to the broader audience. The findings from sociological theories of consumption may be of use. As an example, Fevre uses the term of ‘category error’ to describe situations ‘in which people are encouraged to mistake a commercial transaction for one in which different rules of behaviour apply, and so be more easily parted of their money’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1356389012460958">2003</xref>: 78). According to Fevre, within the buyer–seller relations, the categories of ‘market exchange’ and ‘reciprocity’ and the respective rules of behaviour for each are mixed up. In commercial situations buyers are prompted to behave as if they were taking part in the social process. As an example, they are given gifts in order to make them buy something. The present study suggests that we may observe an analogous situation within the State–taxpayer relation. However, in this case, the mistake relates to categories of ‘investment’ and ‘redistribution’. While the aims of the programme are defined in relation to investment, the actual mechanism is more similar to redistribution. This hypothesis also needs further investigation.</p>

<p>The net effect was measured in the quasi-experimental design, in which Propensity Score Matching was used. 755 beneficiaries and 755 enterprises that applied for subsidies and were unsuccessful were compared. The data was taken from: applications for subsidies, the statistical office and survey research. The study was conducted 18 months after the subsidies were accounted for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1356389012460958">Pokorski, 2010</xref>).</p>
