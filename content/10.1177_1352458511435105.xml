<abstract>
<p>Natalizumab is a highly effective immunomodulator in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). Treatment with natalizumab has been associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), an infection of the central nervous system (CNS) caused by a pathogenic form of the normally benign JC virus (JCV). We searched PubMed and used current data from the natalizumab global safety database to assess risk factors and quantify the risk of PML. Natalizumab treatment duration and prior use of immunosuppressive therapies are established risk factors for development of PML in natalizumab-treated patients. With the development of a reliable and validated assay for detection of antibodies in patients with MS directed against JCV, it is now possible to identify persons who are carriers of JCV. The availability of this assay provides an additional option for risk stratification of PML in patients using or considering natalizumab therapy. Recommendations for clinical management of patients with MS and use of natalizumab are provided based on the presence of these three risk factors. The identification of risk factors that increase the likelihood of PML in natalizumab-treated patients can facilitate benefit–risk discussions between health care professionals and patients. Continued research and data collection will further develop our understanding of PML and the mechanisms by which these risk factors contribute to its development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Natalizumab (Tysabri<sup>®</sup>, Biogen Idec and Elan Pharmaceuticals), a selective adhesion molecule inhibitor directed against the α4-integrin receptor subunit,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511435105">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511435105">2</xref></sup> is a highly effective treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458511435105">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511435105">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare opportunistic infection of the brain. PML is associated with immune compromise and is most commonly reported in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection at a rate of 3–5%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511435105">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458511435105">6</xref></sup> PML has been diagnosed in patients with underlying malignancies, organ transplants, rheumatic diseases, and sarcoidosis, but it has not been reported in patients with untreated MS, Crohn’s disease, or severe psoriasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458511435105">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458511435105">8</xref></sup> However, in recent years, the development of PML has been linked to treatment with biological drugs that modulate the immune system for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511435105">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511435105">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Natalizumab was approved in the US for treatment of relapsing forms of MS in December 2004. In February 2005 two cases of PML were reported in the extension of the SENTINEL study in two patients treated with the combination of natalizumab and intramuscular IFN beta-1a,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458511435105">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458511435105">12</xref></sup> and in addition one patient treated with natalizumab for Crohn’s disease was diagnosed with PML.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458511435105">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>PML is the only opportunistic infection that consistently has been associated with natalizumab, but in clinical trials, herpes infections (varicella zoster and herpes simplex) occurred slightly more frequently in natalizumab-treated patients than in patients receiving placebo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511435105">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>In consequence of these cases of PML the drug was voluntarily withdrawn from the market in 2005. Analysis of the clinical trial data including more than 3000 patients treated with natalizumab provided an overall incidence of PML of one case per 1000 patients treated (95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.2, 2.8).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458511435105">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 2006, natalizumab was reintroduced in the United States and released in Europe in conjunction with a global risk management plan including the Tysabri<sup>®</sup> (natalizumab) Outreach: Unified Commitment to Health (TOUCH) Prescribing Program in US and the Tysabri<sup>®</sup> (natalizumab) Global Observational Program in Safety (TYGRIS; NCT 00477113). These programs provide centralized distribution of natalizumab in the US to facilitate appropriate use and provide for the collection of data on the incidence and risk factors of PML. We reviewed current data collected from clinical trials and post-marketing sources to assess and quantify PML risk in natalizumab-treated patients with the goal of shifting the benefit–risk discussion to the level of the individual. The purpose of the present paper is to show how known risk factors for PML occurring with natalizumab treatment can be used for risk stratification in daily clinical practice.</p>

<title>Search strategy and selection criteria</title>
<p>Data for this review were identified by searches of MEDLINE/ PubMed for research papers and of major medical meetings for abstracts and presentations using the terms “natalizumab”, “progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy”, “multiple sclerosis” and “risk assessment”. Limits included English language papers and dates from 2006 to present. Papers and presentations were included only when they related directly to PML risk in natalizumab-treated patients. We supplemented the retrieved papers with articles from the authors’ personal archives and data from the natalizumab global safety databases.

<title>JC virus and PML</title>
<p>Infection with JC virus (JCV) is a prerequisite for the development of PML. The virus is named after John Cunningham, a patient with Hodgkin’s disease from whom the virus was first isolated in the 1970s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458511435105">15</xref></sup> JCV is a DNA virus that belongs to the polyomavirus family, a genus of the papovavirus family. The virus is ubiquitous throughout the world. It is estimated that approximately 50% of the population harbour JCV, primarily in the kidney, and of these one third sheds JCV in urine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458511435105">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458511435105">17</xref></sup> Seropositivity rates for anti-JCV antibodies have ranged from 33–91% in published reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458511435105">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1352458511435105">22</xref></sup> Most of the recent studies using more refined assays, which avoid cross-reactivity to other polyoma viruses, have shown frequencies of JCV antibodies between 50% and 60%, with higher prevalence in men than in women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458511435105">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458511435105">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1352458511435105">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458511435105">23</xref></sup> Following primary infection, the virus persists in many individuals as a chronic infection in the kidneys and perhaps the lymphoid organs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458511435105">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1352458511435105">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>The discrepancy between the widespread prevalence of JCV and the rare occurrence of PML can, at least in part, be explained by the hypothesis that, in addition to an altered immune system, a combination of certain factors are necessary for PML development in patients with MS. Beyond the requisite viral changes, host genetic susceptibility, impaired host immune function (either general or JCV specific) and/or unknown environmental factors may contribute. The benign form of JCV can reside in the kidney and there are substantial differences between the urine-derived virus (archetype) and the virus found in pathologically affected brain tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458511435105">6</xref></sup> The pathogenic form of the virus always has an altered regulatory region and generally (in &gt; 80% of cases) has one of several possible mutations in the major coat protein, VP1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1352458511435105">26</xref></sup> Archetype JCV binds to a form of sialic acid, which is widely distributed, whereas the pathogenic VP1 mutations have diminished binding to peripheral cells, while binding to glial cells remains intact. This may allow the pathogenic JCV to more readily traffic into the central nervous system (CNS) thereby allowing the initiation of PML. Finally the progression of JCV infection into PML occurs at times when the immune surveillance of CNS is weakened, either due to immune dysfunction or drugs interfering with passage of lymphocytes across the blood–brain barrier (BBB), resulting in a disabled adaptive anti-virus T-cell response that would normally clear the CNS from virus that may have entered the brain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458511435105">6</xref></sup></p>

<title>Characteristics of PML in natalizumab-treated patients</title>
<p>During the open-label extension of a phase III studies of natalizumab, PML was diagnosed in two patients with MS. The two MS patients were receiving natalizumab in combination with interferon beta-1a and had received 28 and 37 doses of natalizumab.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458511435105">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458511435105">12</xref></sup> Since the re-introduction of natalizumab several papers have reported occurrence of PML in patients treated with natalizumab as monotherapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1352458511435105">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1352458511435105">30</xref></sup> By 30 September 2011, natalizumab has been administered to more than 92,200 patients worldwide, corresponding to more than 170,000 patient-years of experience<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1352458511435105">31</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biogenidec.ch/Tysabri.aspx?ID=4763">http://www.biogenidec.ch/Tysabri.aspx?ID=4763</ext-link> (accessed 21 December 2011)).</p>
<p>As of 21 December 2011, 193 cases of PML have been confirmed worldwide. The overall incidence of PML in the post-marketing setting (2.02 per 1000 patients) remains within the confidence interval of the original estimate from clinical trials up to 24 months after treatment initiation (0.2–2.8 per 1000 treated patients).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458511435105">14</xref></sup> In patients treated for 24 months the risk of PML was estimated to 3.70 per 1,000 treated patients (95% CI 3.15–4.31), and the cumulative incidence per patient exceeds this number (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://medinfo.biogenidec.com/medinfo">https://medinfo.biogenidec.com/medinfo</ext-link> (accessed 21 December 2011)] [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biogenidec.ch/Tysabri.aspx?ID=4763">http://www.biogenidec.ch/Tysabri.aspx?ID=4763</ext-link> (accessed 21 December 2011)).</p>
<p>With the growing experience of natalizumab use and the occurrence of additional cases of PML, a number of risk factors largely determining the risk have now been identified.</p>
<p>PML associated with natalizumab has a much higher survival rate compared with PML seen in other conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1352458511435105">32</xref></sup> As of 1 September 2011, 29 of 159 (18%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1352458511435105">33</xref></sup> and as of 1 December 2011, 39 out of 193 (20%) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biogenidec.ch/Tysabri.aspx?ID=4763">http://www.biogenidec.ch/Tysabri.aspx?ID=4763</ext-link> (accessed 21 December 2011)) patients with natalizumab-associated PML had died from the disease. An evaluation of 47 survivors who had at least 6 months follow-up from time of PML diagnosis to the time of the clinical assessment showed that 13% had mild disability (Karnofsky scale 80–100), 47% of patients had moderate disability (Karnofsky scale 50–70) and 40% of patients had severe disability (Karnofsky scale 10–40) where 17 out of 19 patients had a score of 40. Predictors of survival included younger age at time of PML diagnosis, less disability (as measured by Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)) before diagnosis, and a shorter time between symptom onset and PML diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1352458511435105">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1352458511435105">34</xref></sup></p>

<title>Risk factors for development of PML</title>
<p>The risk of PML has been estimated for the two known risk factors, duration of natalizumab exposure and prior immunosuppressive therapy, and for a third risk factor, the presence of anti-JCV antibodies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1352458511435105">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1352458511435105">35</xref></sup> Data from 70 confirmed PML cases in natalizumab-treated patients as of March 2011 have been analysed to quantify PML risk and were recently presented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1352458511435105">36</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section7-1352458511435105">
<title>Natalizumab exposure and PML risk</title>
<p>PML incidence was estimated based on natalizumab exposure for intervals of 12 infusions each, based on cumulative exposure and over each interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458511435105">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458511435105">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1352458511435105">31</xref></sup> PML incidence was calculated as the number of PML cases that developed during an interval divided by the number of patients who were ever exposed to natalizumab for that time period (either cumulative duration or 12-infusion treatment interval). Overall, PML risk increased with increasing treatment duration. The greatest increase in PML risk occurred after 2 years of therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458511435105">Figure 1</xref>) or in the third year of treatment, which corresponds to 25–36 natalizumab infusions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458511435105">Table 1</xref>). The numbers of patients treated for 4 years or more are too small to allow meaningful calculation of risk for these longer durations of treatment.</p>

<p>Incidence estimates by treatment duration are calculated based on natalizumab exposure through 30 November 2011, and 193 confirmed cases as of 1 December 2011. The incidence given for a given time period represents the risk of PML occurring in patients, who are entering the period of natalizumab exposure.

<title>Prior use of immunosuppressive agents and PML risk</title>
<p>Out of 125 patients with PML, 47 patients (38%) had been treated with immunosuppressive agents, including mitoxantrone, azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, or mycophenolate prior to receiving natalizumab. The median natalizumab exposure was 31 infusions, with a range of 8–54 infusions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1352458511435105">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>Immunosuppressive agents were used before natalizumab in 45% of natalizumab-treated PML patients compared with 20% of natalizumab-treated patients in TYGRIS. Based on these observations Biogen Idec has estimated the risk of PML in patients who have used prior immunosuppressant therapy to be three to fourfold greater than that in patients who have not used immunosuppressant therapy before natalizumab therapy. The most commonly used immunosuppressive agents in the natalizumab-associated PML patients were mitoxantrone, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, and mycophenolate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1352458511435105">Table 2</xref>). Interestingly, there was no increased mortality in PML patients who had previously been treated with mitoxantrone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1352458511435105">32</xref></sup> As yet, no specific pattern has been evident in the type of immunosuppressive used, duration of use, or washout period between discontinuation of immunosuppressive and initiation of natalizumab.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1352458511435105">31</xref></sup> In addition to some possible long-term changes in the immune system, one other possible mechanism underlying this increased risk could be that immunosuppressive drugs cause the JCV to mutate, which would be consistent with the increased risk of PML even after a long interval between the exposure to the immunosuppressive drugs and natalizumab therapy. The increased risk of PML associated with prior immunosuppressive therapy appears to be independent of the risk associated with duration of natalizumab exposure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1352458511435105">37</xref></sup></p>

<p>It has been suggested that it is crucial that the immune system has recovered completely and become stable before treatment with natalizumab. Intracellular CD4+-ATP concentration (iATP) functionally reflects cellular immunocompetence and inversely correlates with risk of infections during immunosuppressive therapy. Hence, bioenergetic parameters such as iATP may assist in risk stratification under monoclonal antibody immunotherapy of autoimmune disorders.</p>

<title>Anti-JCV antibody serostatus and PML risk</title>
<p>Assessment of blood samples for the presence of anti-JCV antibodies has been evaluated as another means to stratify patients at risk of developing PML because JCV infection is required for PML to occur. A sensitive and reliable two-step enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed and validated by Gorelik et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1352458511435105">38</xref></sup> In more than 800 patients with MS from natalizumab clinical studies, the overall seropositivity rate for anti-JCV antibodies was 54%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1352458511435105">38</xref></sup> In another analysis of nearly 6000 patients with MS from natalizumab clinical studies and the Swedish MS Registry, the overall anti-JCV antibody prevalence was 55% (95% CI: 54–56%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1352458511435105">35</xref></sup> In a Danish cohort of 1073 MS patients JCV antibodies were detected in 52.5 % (95% CI; 49.5–55.5%) (Oturai et al. unpublished), and in a German cohort of 511 patients (56%) tested JCV antibody positive with this assay (Kieseier et al. unpublished). The rate of seropositivity increased with age across both genders, while males had a higher rate of anti-JCV antibody prevalence compared with females. Approximately 1–2% of patients seroconvert per year, indicating that anti-JCV antibody detection by the two-step ELISA was consistent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1352458511435105">38</xref></sup> The false-negative rate was calculated as 2.5% with an upper 95% confidence limit of 4.4%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1352458511435105">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>Among natalizumab-treated patients who developed PML, it was possible to determine JCV antibody status before development of PML in 20 patients from whom blood samples were obtained before PML diagnoses were available.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1352458511435105">35</xref></sup> These 20 patients had clinical characteristics that were similar to the 102 patients with confirmed PML.

<p>PML incidence was estimated for seropositive and seronegative patients using the overall PML incidence and anti-JCV antibody prevalence rates for the general MS population (55%) and for the natalizumab-treated PML patients who had pre-PML samples tested for anti-JCV antibodies before PML diagnosis (100%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1352458511435105">39</xref></sup> Sensitivity analyses were done to estimate the incidence of PML in anti-JCV antibody-negative patients and to show the relative risk of PML between anti-JCV antibody-positive and negative patients. In anti-JCV antibody-positive patients, the incidence of PML was estimated to be nearly twofold greater than that of the overall natalizumab-treated population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1352458511435105">39</xref></sup> In anti-JCV antibody-negative patients, PML incidence was estimated at zero cases per 1000 patients, because no PML patient tested seronegative for anti-JCV antibodies. Therefore, one hypothetical case of PML was assumed to develop in a patient who tested seronegative for anti-JCV antibodies as part of the sensitivity analysis.

<p>The prevalence of anti-JCV antibodies as a risk factor for developing PML does not appear to be affected by the established risk factors of natalizumab treatment duration and prior use of immunosuppressants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1352458511435105">40</xref></sup> In a review of data from the ongoing longitudinal STRATIFY-1 study (NCT 01070823) and from the United States cohort of TYGRIS (TYGRIS-US), the baseline prevalence of anti-JCV antibodies was 56.0% (95% CI: 53.0%, 59.0%) in STRATIFY-1 and was 47.6% (95% CI: 45.0%, 50.1%) in TYGRIS-US. In both study populations, anti-JCV antibodies were detected less frequently in women and their prevalence increased with age. In STRATIFY-1, the prevalence was 56.3% in patients who were exposed to natalizumab and 54.7% in those who were not. Among patients in STRATIFY-1and TYGRIS-US who received previous immunosuppressive therapy (4% and 9%, respectively), anti-JCV antibodies were detected in similar proportions of patients without prior immunosuppressant use, suggesting prior immunosuppressant use does not have a major effect on the JCV humoral response. In these two studies the analytical false-negative rate of the two-step anti-JCV antibody assay was low, at 3.2% (95% CI: 1.2%, 6.9%) and consistent with that determined by Gorelik et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1352458511435105">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1352458511435105">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>The risk of developing PML in natalizumab-treated patients was also assessed using a Markov model of health changes measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) using natural history and clinical trials data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1352458511435105">41</xref></sup> The model evaluated treatment effects on reducing relapses and slowing disease progression and treatment risks of PML and non-PML side effects. Treatment cohorts included natural history (i.e, no disease-modifying drugs), subcutaneous interferon beta-1a, natalizumab, and a theoretical perfect MS treatment. Over 20 years, natalizumab resulted in health gains over the natural history (0.80 QALYs) and interferon beta-1a (0.38 QALYs) cohorts. Based on the model findings, a more than sevenfold increase in currently estimated PML risk over 17.9 months would be required to negate the health benefits of natalizumab below those of interferon beta-1a.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1352458511435105">41</xref></sup></p>

<title>Quantification of PML risk</title>
<p>PML risk was quantified by combining the data on PML risk based on natalizumab treatment duration, use of prior immunosuppressant therapy, and anti-JCV antibody serostatus. A combined risk-factor algorithm was created.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1352458511435105">31</xref></sup> The group at lowest risk of developing PML consists of those who tested negative for anti-JCV antibodies, with an estimated PML risk of 0.11 per 1000 patients (95% CI: 0, 0.59). Patients with all three risk factors (i.e. natalizumab treatment for more than 2 years, prior immunosuppressive therapy, and anti-JCV antibody-positive status) had an estimated risk of PML of 7.8 per 1000 patients (95% CI: 5.2, 11.3).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1352458511435105">31</xref></sup> However, the most recent risk calculation suggests an increased risk of PML in JCV antibody positive patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458511435105">figure 2</xref>).

<title>Management of PML risk</title>
<p>The identification of risk factors for PML and the development of assay tools, such as the two-step ELISA for detecting anti-JCV antibodies, provide an opportunity to individualize the clinical management of MS in patients using or considering natalizumab therapy. Treatment flow diagrams that incorporate the results of PML risk analyses allow for a better understanding of PML risk and the ability to manage that risk based on a patient’s individual risk factors. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1352458511435105">Figure 3</xref> illustrates the use of natalizumab in patients based on anti-JCV antibody serostatus, natalizumab treatment duration, and prior immunosuppressant use.</p>

<p>The algorithm shows how known risk factors for PML can be used for risk stratification, and we have not intended to include comparison of natalizumab with the other second-line treatment, fingolimod, because of the limited experience with this new compound in the post-marketing setting.</p>
<p>Early detection of symptoms and signs compatible with PML leading to early diagnosis of PML is of paramount importance for a reasonable outcome of the disease. Hence, in addition to high clinical vigilance, patient education and assessment of the patient’s capability and willingness to report new symptoms should be taken into consideration in the management of risk of PML.</p>
<p>It is important to consider that PML remains an uncommon event, and even among those patients who are anti-JCV antibody positive only a small proportion will develop PML. Approximately 55% of the population tests positive for anti-JCV antibodies, while the overall incidence of PML is approximately two in 1000 natalizumab-treated patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1352458511435105">31</xref></sup> Even at its highest incidence in HIV patients, PML occurs at most in 5%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1352458511435105">31</xref></sup> The presence of anti-JCV antibodies is not a contraindication for use of natalizumab. Rather, seropositivity for anti-JCV antibodies should be verified as part of an overall assessment of a patient using or considering natalizumab that includes assessment of disease activity, disability, number and severity of relapses, outcomes associated with prior use of other treatments, and available therapeutic alternatives.</p>
<p>All anti-JCV antibody-negative patients may potentially be treated with minimal risk. The risk of developing PML in a seronegative patient is not zero, based on several findings including confidence limits, sensitivity analyses of the hypothetical risk that the next PML patient would be anti-JCV antibody negative, and the false negative rate of 2.5% for the JCV antibody assay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1352458511435105">38</xref></sup> It is currently recommended that anti-JCV antibody status should be re-evaluated on a yearly basis; however, results of ongoing clinical studies will clarify the required frequency of antibody testing. Once a patient tests positive for anti-JCV antibodies, the patient should be considered exposed to the JCV with regards to risk stratification and no further testing is recommended.</p>
<p>The risk of developing PML is very low during the first 12 months of natalizumab therapy and, therefore, any patient, independent of anti-JCV antibody serostatus or prior immunosuppressant use, may potentially be safely treated with natalizumab for 12 months. Natalizumab treatment of JCV antibody-positive patients for 12 months allows an evaluation of the treatment benefit in the single patient. The decision whether to continue natalizumab or switch to another available therapy should be based on a benefit versus risk evaluation in every single patient. Previous disease activity and rate of disability accumulation, and response to other therapies should be compared with clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) disease activity during treatment with natalizumab. The perceived benefit must be weighed against the patient’s calculated risk of developing PML and alternative therapeutic options. For anti-JCV antibody-positive patients continuing natalizumab therapy, an assessment of clinical effectiveness and benefit–risk evaluation should be performed, including MRI, every 12 months. In patients who test positive for anti-JCV antibodies and who have received immunosuppressive agents in the past, other treatments should be considered at the time of treatment initiation or, alternatively, after 12 months of natalizumab therapy.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Analyses of current data from the population of natalizumab-treated patients with PML can be translated to provide clinically useful treatment recommendations based on individual patients’ risk factors. Three PML risk factors have been independently identified: duration of natalizumab treatment, prior use of immunosuppressive therapy, and anti-JCV antibody status. Risk of developing PML is greatest for those with all three risk factors. In contrast, PML risk is lowest for anti-JCV antibody-negative patients and during the first 12 months of natalizumab treatment. Routine patient assessment including JCV antibody measurement is a critical component of managing the benefits and risks of natalizumab. Risk stratification is a dynamic process, and assessment of PML risk may be subject to changes with further experience from post-marketing use of natalizumab. The most recent information about PML risk can be obtained from the natalizumab global safety databases that are updated monthly by the manufacturers of natalizumab (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://medinfo.biogenidec.com/medinfo">https://medinfo.biogenidec.com/medinfo</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biogenidec.ch/Tysabri.aspx?ID=4763">http://www.biogenidec.ch/Tysabri.aspx?ID=4763</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Continued evaluation of PML cases and further research into the complex interaction of factors that lead to PML will build upon the risk stratification algorithms presented here.</p>
