<title>Resume</title>
<p>This article aims to foster a deeper understanding of the current clashes between modernist republicans and Islamic conservatives in Turkey. Through an examination of the relation of conservatism to modernity, I argue that there exists a conservative goal of ‘overcoming modernity’, though in a paradoxical form, which is crucial for our comprehension of this conflict. Central here is the Islamic conservative resistance to the ‘cultural program of modernity’. Indubitably, it would be fallacious to impute to (neo-)conservatism an orientation that challenges modernity <italic>in toto</italic>. Indeed, one need only consider the economy and technology to see how far the modern has captured the conservative imagination. However, the culture of modernity is a different matter and this is the aspect I concentrate on here. After first examining the (old) conservative reaction against the great transformations of modernity, I consider the contention that Turkish society has recently become conservative, and end with an analysis of republican opposition to recent government acts.</p>

<title>Résumé</title>
<p>Cet article tend à une meilleure compréhension des conflits actuels entre républicains modernistes et conservateurs Islamistes en Turquie. En examinant la relation entre conservatisme et modernité, l’auteur soutient qu’il existe une visée conservatrice de ‘surmonter la modernité’, bien que sous une forme paradoxale, et que celle-ci est cruciale pour la compréhension de ce conflit. Ce qui est central ici, c’est la résistance des conservateurs Islamistes au ‘programme culturel de la modernité’. Il serait sans aucun doute fallacieux d’imputer au (néo-)conservatisme une orientation qui remette en cause la modernité <italic>in toto</italic>. Assurément, il suffit seulement de considérer l’économie et la technologie pour voir à quel point le moderne s’est emparé de l’imaginaire conservateur. Cependant, la culture de la modernité est tout autre chose et c’est sur elle que l’auteur concentre son propos. Il examine tout d’abord l’(ancienne) réaction des conservateurs contre les grandes transformations de la modernité, puis il considère l’argument selon lequel la société Turque serait récemment devenue conservatrice. Pour finir, il analyse l’opposition républicaine aux actions récentes du gouvernement.</p>

<p>Tension between modernist republicans and Islamic conservatives has been a central feature of modern Turkish history, and recent transformations have added to these tensions. Recently, Republicans have become ever more worried and concerned about the changes being introduced, while the Islamic conservatives are increasingly imbued with the belief that they are about ‘overcoming modernity’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0539018411425831">1</xref></sup> Aside from these two polarized groups, a third group of intellectuals, so-called liberals, have supported the AKP (the Justice and Development Party) government in order to try and persuade the regime of the benefits of a so-called liberal democracy. The liberals frequently claim that they do not embrace an Islamic regime. Nevertheless, they wholeheartedly support the AKP government, which they view as the best tactic for encouraging and bringing about further democratization of the regime.</p>
<p>The current situation is very serious, with Turkish society having again become polarized over the ‘meaning of modernity’. Such polarization intimates that ‘violence’ may represent the only viable means of resolving the current impasse. At various moments throughout the history of Turkish modernity, society has divided into opposing camps contesting the meaning of modernity. On three occasions, the standoff has been broken by a military coup. Undoubtedly, the antithetical relationship that has developed between different actors in society has occurred because of the propensity of modernity to accommodate many different, or even conflicting, interpretations. My contention here is that it is precisely this essentially contested notion of modernity that has provided the fertile soil upon which such conflicts have grown. By insisting that Turkish society is once more divided into opposing camps over the meaning of modernity, I mean to demonstrate how different social actors interpret modernity and promote these interpretations through their social settings.</p>
<p>Islamic conservatives and republicans have <italic>both</italic> interpreted modernity in their own ways, which are fundamentally opposed to each other. The question of which interpretation is correct has provided the fuel for strained, tension-filled relations and led to violent outbreaks. Islamic conservatives believe in the possibility of resisting modernity generally, despite having failed to do so in fact. Thus, they have been unable to demonstrate the superiority of their interpretation. Likewise, republicans have insisted that modernity is coextensive with societal progress and the good life, and must thus be accepted and developed fully. However, the failure of the good life to materialize has seriously dented this argument too. Currently, society has once more divided into opposing camps, but this time taking a quite different form. Ostensibly, the Islamic conservatives are now on the side of a ‘European modernity’, while republicans represent a defensive nationalist position.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0539018411425831">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Controversy over the meaning of modernity has been informed by relations between (neo-)conservatism, republicanism and religion. It has been argued that, under the rule of the AKP, Turkish society has become conservative. For example, the number of veiled women has risen almost 500% under the rule of the AKP, according to a survey conducted by Tarhan Erdem.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0539018411425831">3</xref></sup> How are we to interpret this state of affairs, given that the Kemalist project of modernity, as with its predecessors in the West, had promised emancipation from religious hierarchy, absolutism and myth? These have remained essential elements of the conservative tradition. What is at stake? Does one have to conclude that the conservatives have now overcome modernity or, in other words, that one of the most powerful secular states has come to an end, or is there a more plausible explanation?</p>
<p>This article aims to understand these questions by looking at current developments in terms of the meaning, or better <italic>meanings</italic>, of modernity in Turkey. After examining the question of conservatism in order to provide a basis for further discussion, I move on to analyze the AKP as a conservative-Islamic party. Finally, I analyze republican reactions in opposition to the dominant governing party.</p>
<sec id="section1-0539018411425831">
<title>What is conservatism’s relationship to modernity?</title>
<p>We can begin by recognizing that conservatism is a powerful argument for <italic>social cohesion</italic>, aiming to preserve, as it does, a <italic>hierarchical society</italic>. It could be argued that conservatism, in its original form, is hostile to modernity. Conservatism came into being as a reaction against the changes produced by the two great revolutions of the late 18th century in Europe, namely the French Revolution and the Industrial Revolution (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0539018411425831">Giddens, 1996</xref>). In its defense of religious values and symbols, as well as of an ‘ethnic’ past, conservatism necessarily flirts with the ‘radical right’, which refuses to countenance some of the basic principles of modernity, such as ‘individual autonomy’.</p>
<p>In its traditional sense, conservatism has demonstrated its desire to ‘overcome modernity’. In fact, Habermas’s understanding of an original conservatism reinforces this. For Habermas, this form of conservatism is a hankering for a return to pre-modern forms of life, which, originally, meant the desire to conserve tradition as the inherited wisdom of the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0539018411425831">Habermas, 1989</xref>). For Burke, the father of modern conservatism, this meant an absolute rejection of the ideals of the French Revolution (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0539018411425831">Nisbet, 2006</xref>). In its attempts to overturn the old regime, the French Revolution attacked the aristocracy and the Church. In turn, and as a reaction, the conservatives at that time staunchly defended the monarchy. Their view of democracy, and modernity at large, was that it was the great destroyer of French traditions. Joseph de Maistre, for example, declared himself to be a manservant of the Church. Nisbet, a neo-conservative author, points out that these old conservatives were either members of the French aristocracy or closely related to the French aristocracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0539018411425831">Nisbet, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The 18th and 19th centuries were times of great transformation for European societies, in which conservatives were wholeheartedly royalist, traditionalist and religious. In fact, the royalist, traditionalist and religious conservative reaction to the great transformations of modernity (see in particular <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0539018411425831">Bayly, 2004</xref>) might be justifiably considered as the original attempts to ‘overcome modernity’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0539018411425831">4</xref></sup> This might be supported through the consideration of the main points of opposition between conservative thought and the project of modernity.</p>
<p>First, the conservatives did not uphold the central tenet of modernity, namely, the individual’s right to an autonomous existence within society. Conservatism, by contrast, insisted on the value of a hierarchical society that by definition was non-democratic. Social cohesion was the indispensable and predefined goal for conservatives, whereas for the project of modernity, social cohesion was to be formed by free individuals. Modernity was impossible without the free individual, who was its prerequisite. For conservatism, by contrast, society prefigured, and was the basis for, all individual development. If individual freedom was the bedrock for the modern project, for conservatism, it was authority. Authority was the basis for all social life, be this school, family or workplace. All of the above provide further examples of the vast chasm between and the incompatibility of conservatism and modernity.</p>
<p>Second, conservatism, in all its guises, is fundamentally opposed to modern rationalism. If the Enlightenment had not occurred, conservatism would most likely have never been born. Conservatism represents a particularistic view that arose in opposition to Enlightenment universalism. Against a universalizing rationality, conservatism aims at defending national, religious, regional and local cultures, traditions and values. In addition, it opposes its religious view of social relations to the Enlightenment’s rationalization of the same. For the conservatives of the time, the power of each society was grounded in its own cultural, religious and moral values. That human values could be subject to a universalizing principle was anathema to 18th-century conservatives, as, indeed, was the principle of rational mastery. Whilst true (scientific) knowledge of nature and society was an indisputable goal of the project of modernity, for conservatives, such knowledge belonged solely to God. For conservatives, religion has always had an intimate connection to forms of human life. Modernity’s secularization and secularism have been opposed by conservatives from the outset. Conservatism, then, had its genesis and <italic>raison d’être</italic> in the project to ‘overcome modernity’.</p>
<p>Third, conservatism could be regarded as implacably opposed to the institutionalization of human spheres. Indeed, its emergence as an ideology was as a comprehensive rejection of the desirability of autonomy for the human condition. It was thus the anti- thesis of modernity, which depended on ‘autonomy of human spheres’ as its driving force.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0539018411425831">5</xref></sup> Conservatism was born as a reaction to this ethos. If the French revolutionaries attempted to instigate autonomy in various spheres of human endeavor, including politics, economics, arts, science and morality, then conservatism was born as a reaction that defended these spheres as part of an organic totality.</p>
<p>The above might suggest that conservatism is inextricably opposed to modernity, precisely because of its opposition to modernity’s twin drivers, namely, autonomy and mastery:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>By modernity … I refer to a self-understanding of human social life that is based on the ideas of autonomy, on the one hand, that is the capacity of human beings to give themselves their own laws, and of mastery and control, on the other, that is the idea that the world can, in principle, be known and controlled (the natural world, the social world and one’s own self). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0539018411425831">Wagner, 2000</xref>: 4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>By rejecting the idea that these three worlds could be shaped and controlled by human beings able to freely apply their reason, conservatism in fact rejects modernity at large.</p>
<p>In all respects, the conservative position seems to be implicitly and explicitly so opposed to modernity that we would surely meet little opposition to the contention that conservatives really reject modernity. However, the analysis cannot stop at this point. The contradictory elements in conservatism’s rejection of modernity must be examined for a social theory of modernity. On another level, though, it might be suggested that the substance of conservatism can contain nothing ‘authentic’, since any escape from modernity is impossible; modernity is our time. Such a critique is perhaps attenuated through the recognition that conservatism was born of <italic>its</italic> era, as an expression of opposition to historically located and emergent trends. Perhaps the most trenchant support for such a view is the fact that ‘new or neo-conservatism’ is seen to be perfectly compatible with modernity (for a critical analysis of neo-conservatism, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0539018411425831">Dubiel, 1998</xref>). However, I do not deal with this issue here. I consider it below when analyzing the current occurrences in Turkey with regard to the ‘conservatization’ of society.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0539018411425831">6</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0539018411425831">
<title>The conservatization of Turkish society</title>
<p>Arguments over what constitute the basic characteristics of the AKP government have been vigorously defended. The party sees itself as a ‘conservative-democratic party’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0539018411425831">7</xref></sup> On the other hand, the republicans regard the AKP as having a certain contiguity with the old ‘Islamist’ Refah (Welfare Party), which was banned by the Constitutional Court because of its anti-secular acts (for a very strict republican view on AKP, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0539018411425831">Savaş, 2008</xref>). Similarly, the chief public prosecutor of the High Court applied to the Constitu- tional Court for an order to ban the AKP. The Constitutional Court ruled that the party is guilty in its acts of attempting to undermine the secular base of the republic. The Court did not disband the party but instead fined it. And this could be taken as a serious warning.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the liberals regard the AKP as an important agent in the transformation of the country from an ‘authoritarian’ republic into a democracy (for how liberals find a great hope in the AKP, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0539018411425831">Şahin, 2008</xref>). Accordingly, an alliance between liberals and the AKP has been struck (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0539018411425831">Şahin, 2008</xref>). From a liberal perspective, it is quite possible that the AKP’s neo-liberal economic stance – that the market should be free from regulation or interference – positively influenced their decision to become bedmates. Both liberals and Islamic-conservatives believed that the state’s remit should be limited to politics and law, upon which stable basis democracy would flourish.</p>
<p>Aside from the Islamic-conservatives and liberals, there are other groups who share their faith in a liberal economy. These intellectuals call themselves libertarian leftists. One such, Öniş, believes that the democratic reforms the AKP has carried out to satisfy EU conditionality have turned the AKP into an agent of democratization and of Europeanization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0539018411425831">Öniş, 2007</xref>: 251). Opposed to the groups mentioned above, the republicans comprise the main opposition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0539018411425831">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In order to understand the polarization that exists between the republicans and the Islamic-conservatives, a brief analysis of the historical background of the attempts of the Islamic-conservatives at ‘overcoming modernity’ must be offered. Niyazi Berkes’ attempt at a deep understanding of the secularization process in Turkey led him to write: ‘secularization and religionization are more or less contemporaries … after each process of secularization pyrexia of religionization starts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0539018411425831">1978</xref>: 18). Religious conservatism needs to be seen as a part of this cycle, because it emerged as a defender of the traditional and religious values at a time when both of these seemed to be under attack from the modernization process.</p>
<p>The defense of religious and traditional values emerged as a reaction to the rise of the West, particularly in the 19th century. At that time, Western Europe had expanded and was further expanding, attempting to export its ideas to the rest of the world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0539018411425831">9</xref></sup> The reaction in the Ottoman Empire to modernization was similar to the conservative reaction to the Enlightenment in Western Europe. Both reactions argued that it was possible to resist the new ideas about society, individuality and politics. The reaction of religious conservatism in the Ottoman Empire during the 19th century was an attempt to preserve the empire in its old form. There had never been any questioning of the political character of the empire in the Islamic Ulema until the emergence of modern ideas about the state and society in Western Europe. However, when modernity issued its challenge to the empire, Islamic conservatives found themselves at the forefront of those who argued that the empire should forever remain Islamic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0539018411425831">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The power of modernity in affecting structured change in societies across the world has been the most important factor behind the emergence of reactionary ideologies and movements in non-Western parts of the world. This is most clearly evident in the case of the Ottoman Empire. The three competing views as to how to reverse the empire’s decline emerged only after Western modernity came to be felt in Turkey. One view was that Islamism emerged as a reactionary ideology to the modern world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0539018411425831">11</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0539018411425831">Tunaya (2003)</xref> described Islamism as a search for an Islamic Renaissance. Islamism came to life as an idea of returning to essential principles of Islam. In order to reinforce a crumbling empire, Islamism offered an authentic Islam as the model for a political system built upon Islamization as its necessary condition. It is very interesting that Islamization was held to be a primary means for restructuring the empire at a time when the modernization of the Western world was occurring apace.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0539018411425831">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite crucial differences between the three competing intellectual perspectives in the late Ottoman Empire, the Islamic-conservatives were in accord with the other two schools in the belief that the empire had become corrupt. In order to restructure the empire into a powerful state, a necessary condition, it was felt, was the development of an underlying social infrastructure. The idea of <italic>development</italic> is no doubt a modern invention. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0539018411425831">Gülalp (2002)</xref> demonstrates that in the 19th-century Ottoman Empire a version of Islamist modernization, one which accepted the necessity of Westernizing reforms, became influential. The all-enveloping character of modernity began to emerge at this point; first, in terms of technological advances embraced even by conservatives, and later in other ways too.</p>
<p>However, the cultural program of modernity, to use Eisenstadt’s formula, was never accepted as an ideal by the Islamic-conservatives. Otherwise, there is no doubt that there would have been an Islamic interpretation of modernity that accepted its developmental logic. For Islamic-conservatives, though, it was crucial that ‘authentic Islamic culture’ be preserved. As I hinted at the beginning of this article, different strands of social life in Turkey are often largely attributable to social divisions that have arisen as the result of different interpretations of modernity. These different interpretations of modernity – Kemalist, Turkist, Islamist, etc. – and the openness of modernity to plural interpretations are often a cause of strained relations between different actors. For example, Navaro-Yasin (2002) demonstrates how Islamist women have developed their own understanding of modernity that distinguishes them from ‘Kemalist modern women’. Thus, the Islamic-conservatives’ version of the modern has developed through a contradictory form that rejects the cultural program of modernity. Here, we must necessarily consider this neo-conservatism that both accepts the technological and economic advances modernity has wrought, but nevertheless rejects ‘normative ideals of modernity’ (on this theme, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0539018411425831">Habermas, 1989</xref>). The normative ideals of modernity hold that the autonomy of the cultural sphere is primary in modern society. The cultural sphere must be freed from traditional and religious values in order to reach a universal state of humanity. Even though conservatism has been forced to adapt to the power of modernity in many areas, the cultural base of the conservatives still appears unchanged. Even if it is necessary to accept that conservatives have had to become reconciled to modernity in terms of its economic development, the question of culture remains. This theme may be thought of as a concern expressed by Bell. His understanding of the social structure as the techno-economic order led him to conclude that culture and the socio-economic sphere are not at all unified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0539018411425831">Bell, 1976</xref>). Therefore, for Bell the ‘cultural contradictions of capitalism’ refer to the disjunction between the techno-economic order and culture. Thus, neo-conservatism accepts the techno-economic developments modernity has brought about, while rejecting normative ideals of modernity.</p>
<p>In exploring the conservative dimension of the AKP government, a sympathetic party author wrote:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Conservatism is a perspective that advocates evolutionary and gradual change against revolutionary change and emphasizes falsity of eradication of traditional social institutions. According to the AKP too social transformation forms the base of all changes. By change is meant a gradual occurrence and implementation of natural development. … In this regard, the potentiality of conservatism to defend traditional structure against revolutionary attempts and to carry the historical gains to the future is important. … With regard to change, conservatism exercises caution. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0539018411425831">Akdoğan, 2003</xref>: 9)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We can read this statement as a sign that the AKP wants to conserve the culture of Islam, even while welcoming changes in the economic and technological realms. The same author, agreeing with Brzezinski and Huntington, argues that in the 21st century, religion will become the key factor for society, even if ‘secularism is the guarantee of religious freedom’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0539018411425831">Akdoğan, 2003</xref>: 99). The argument here is that modernization is possible without secularization. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0539018411425831">Ceylan (2004)</xref> points out, the belief that modernization is possible without secularization infers that modernization of the industrial sphere is independent of cultural prejudices and therefore applicable elsewhere, but secularization is peculiar to Western Europe and therefore not (a) universal. All of the above support my argument that, although modernity infected and affected conservatives in a variety of ways, the question of culture is still alive.</p>
<p>What is particularly interesting about the theme of culture is that cultural relativism constitutes an important facet of the conservative-Islamic arguments. For the conservatives, the Turkish republic has fallen woefully short in recognizing cultural difference in society. According to the Islamic-conservatives, Turkish society has always been characterized by a plurality of world-views.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0539018411425831">13</xref></sup> They argue, further, that since the beginning of the republican era the state has attempted to convert its citizens as to the meaning of the good life. Since the state has pushed its singular ‘totalizing’ view as to what this is, the effect, for Islamic-conservatives, has been the marginalization of different cultures as less than legitimate (for the Islamist understanding of the republican era, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0539018411425831">Dilipak, 1990</xref>). This is seen as the most powerful argument for a ‘re-arrangement of the republic’, which is viewed as a ‘fight’ for a second republic. The second republicans, mostly liberal intellectuals, have supported the Islamists in their call for the transformation of the republic into a so-called democracy. Not only does second republicanism’s advocacy of cultural pluralism manifest itself as a critique of modernity, but the conservatives, through this very movement, are also able to demonstrate their hegemony in the arguments over a multicultural society.</p>
<p>The theme of multiculturalism, then, provides a firm foundation for conservative goals. According to the multiculturalist idea, each culture should determine its own norms, rules and values. Conservatives, then, favor a ‘cultural democracy’ because they believe that this is the most beneficial means of their garnering support and, ultimately, hegemony. If we take seriously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0539018411425831">Touraine’s (2000)</xref> formula of ‘cultural democracy’, then it becomes necessary to distinguish the question of culture from the Islamic-conservative reaction. There is no doubt that, from the beginning, ‘cultural authenticity’ has been promulgated by the conservatives: ‘We could say that Turkish conservatism is basically a cultural conservatism and therefore it transformed social and political categories into cultural categories in order to found itself on the cultural agenda’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0539018411425831">Çiğdem, 2006</xref>: 19). As a conservative social scientist, Çiğdem argues that the rigid political structure of the republic led conservatives to eschew politics and instead situate themselves in the cultural sphere. However, the reality is that, in the technological and economic fields, the conservatives are hostages to modernity. Multiculturalism, then, may represent a powerful means for the attainment of the goals of conservatism in its insistence on a cultural hegemony that may spread by infection, i.e. ‘democratically’, to other areas of life.</p>
<p>The liberals, many of whom hope for further democratization under the rule of the AKP, do not understand that the conservatives argue for cultural freedom as a means for establishing hegemonic rule. Ostensibly, it would appear as if the conservatives respect cultural difference. Their assertion is that they tolerate all world-views and, in return, would expect tolerance for their world-view and culture. However, the lack of clear boundaries between culture and other areas of life means that the decision to choose one’s affiliations – i.e. a negative freedom from interference – becomes much more blurred and favors the pole that is positive towards dictatorialness. The conservatives argue that religious practices in the public sphere, such as in universities, should also be respected because of religion’s privileged place in human beings’ lives. The religious habit, they argue, should not only be worn in the public sphere but should be a cause for celebration therein. They have developed this perspective by arguing that the majority of the population in Turkey is Muslim and that therefore it should be no surprise to see Islamic politicians, bureaucrats, teachers and so on. Such a stance, contrary to liberals’ and their own avowed aims, may well be viewed as an attempt to hegemonize the cultural sphere within Turkish society and beyond it.</p>
<p>The AKP’s instrumental perspective with regard to multiculturalism is very clearly dominated by its relationship with Europe. Such utilitarianism has often been lost on observers. Indeed, the party has been at pains to portray itself as pro-European and has accepted the EU’s conditions for membership. To this end, it carried out some important reforms. The effect was to convince some ‘libertarian leftist’ intellectuals that the AKP was a great enthusiast for Europeanization (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0539018411425831">Öniş, 2007</xref>). However, the AKP’s actions should really be seen as instantiating its instrumental orientation towards Europe. The AKP views Europe in general, and the EU in particular, as a safeguard that undermines domestic opposition to its policies. Good relations with the European Union strengthen its position in domestic politics. This also holds for its position on democracy.</p>
<p>At this point, it is necessary to consider the debate on democracy. Liberals and some ‘optimistic’ intellectuals have argued that the main difference between the Islamists and the republicans lies in their orientation towards democracy. They have invested great hope in the government’s legislation on democracy and human rights (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0539018411425831">Öniş, 2007</xref>). Between 2002 and 2005, the AKP government introduced some important measures for the development of democratic standards. However, the government curtailed such activity when it was re-elected for the second time with a much broader base of support in the 2007 general elections. The apparently abrupt jettisoning of democratic principles, then, leads one to wonder whether the AKP’s democratic activity is not merely a policy followed for much wider purposes. There are huge issues for democratic standards and human rights in Turkey. The government’s vacillation and sometimes contradictory stance leads to a questioning of its intent. On the one hand, for example, the government has paid extraordinary attention to the turban issue. On the other hand, though, Alevi demands for the right to practice and publicly express their religious beliefs have been given short shrift by the government. Side by side, these two examples could be taken as indicators of the AKP’s highly pragmatic, self-motivated orientation towards democracy.</p>
<p>The power of the AKP has led to a series of non-democratic, fascist events taking place. For example, in some high schools, students who chose not to fast during Ramadan were being forced to do so.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0539018411425831">14</xref></sup> Perhaps more serious is the situation currently faced in many cities and towns, where restaurants and bars are prevented from serving alcoholic beverages. For example, in the Keçiören district of the capital city, Ankara, no restaurants are serving alcohol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0539018411425831"><italic>(Vatan</italic></xref>, 29 August 2008). Keçiören is the most densely populated district in Ankara. In another example, the owner of a small market stall in Ankara was physically assaulted because he sold alcohol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0539018411425831"><italic>Radikal</italic></xref>, 18 August 2008). Such fascist acts serve to polarize society into two camps, creating enmity between them. Ultimately, the AKP government must be held accountable for the fact that such events have taken place, because there is a complete lack of direction and response when they occur.</p>
<p>Liberals and optimists need to understand that the rise of anti-democratic sentiment in Turkish society is directly attributable to the weakness of any opposition to the power of the government. The AKP’s hegemony carries a responsibility that has not been fulfilled, and its actions send mixed messages to society at large. However, liberal and ‘libertarian leftist’ intellectuals fail to comprehend that the Islamic-conservatives’ goal of establishing hegemony is problematic. Most of them agree with the conservatives in assessing Turkey’s main problem to be the strict secularism of the state. For example, in considering possible solutions to the ‘secularism problem’, Keyman writes: ‘What is needed in this context is a “democratic secular imaginary” as a more dialogical, tolerant and accommodating strategy of living with difference, enabling us to understand religious claims to difference in their own right and approaching them emphatically and critically’ (2007: 229). In complete disregard of the anti-democratic sentiment fostered by Islamic-conservatism, the author merely asserts that political problems can all be attributed to the malaise of the state, i.e. its strict secularism. He completely ignores the Islamic-conservatives’ culpability for the fascist acts, such as those mentioned above, that are currently taking place. Intellectuals such as he believe that secularization has failed the Turkish experience, and was bound to do so: ‘… in the course of the evolution of Turkish modernity, Islam has never been in a position of a purely individual faith’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0539018411425831">Keyman, 2007</xref>: 224). Such analyses focus on the Kemalist project of modernity in the search for those responsible for the social problems of present-day Turkey. It would appear, then, that there is a positive relationship between Islamic-conservatives and those who criticize modernity.</p>
<p>The critique of modernity can easily become transposed into an anti-modernity. Critics of modernity and Islamic-conservatives share views about the meaning of Kemalist modernity. When modernity is accused of leading to Auschwitz, or to the Balkan War, or to totalitarianism, this is readily taken by conservatives as evidence of the superiority of an ‘organic society of tradition’. Habermas was right when he stated that postmodernists were in fact young conservatives (1989).</p>
<p>What postmodernism and conservatism have in common is no doubt the rejection of the project of modernity as a universalizing model of society and culture.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0539018411425831">15</xref></sup> The Islamic-conservatives have always rejected the possibility of a universal ideal. Rather, their aim is to (re)create bounded communities, which are, of course, divisive. Consequently, when postmodernists attacked the universal principle of modernity, the conservatives wholeheartedly concurred. The anti-modern content of postmodernism was perhaps what appealed most to Turkish conservatives and was readily adopted. The universal ideals in the project of modernity have been viewed as the hubris of an alien civilization that believes other civilizations should be made, forcibly or otherwise, in its own image. The critique of modern universalism thus became a <italic>total</italic> rejection of the cultural project of modernity (on Islamic conservatives’ positive estimation of postmodernism, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0539018411425831">Gülalp, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Research on the conservative nature of society is very important in alerting us to the conservative rejection of the cultural program of modernity. In 2006, Hakan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0539018411425831">Yılmaz’s (2006)</xref> ‘Conservatism in Turkey’ generated startling data. Eighty-five percent of subjects accepted the importance of traditional values; 31% viewed Islam as the essential source of Turkish identity; 73% voiced worries over the defamation of traditional values, with 65% registering disapproval of unmarried couples living together (in <italic>Radikal</italic>, 11 March 2006). All of this evidences how Turkish society has become yet more conservative during the past few years under AKP rule. Even more damning research, utilizing comparative methods, was produced by Tarhan Erdem. This was a replica of the same research that he carried out in 2003. The comparison of attitudes over a 4-year time span (2003–2007) illustrates the seriousness of the current situation.</p>
<p>In 2003, girls wearing turbans comprised only 4.1% of the total population of young females, while in 2007 this had increased to 19.7%. This means that there had been an almost 500% increase in those wearing turbans in just those 4 years. Today 69% of Turkish women are veiled, but 51.9% are veiled in traditional ways. Only 16.2% are veiled according to the Islamic rules.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0539018411425831">16</xref></sup> More interestingly, and more importantly for the current debate over the freedom for girls to wear turbans in universities, 77% of female students do not cover their heads at all (Tarhan Erdem’s results were published in the daily newspaper, <italic>Milliyet</italic>, December <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0539018411425831">2007</xref>).</p>
<p>These findings indicate that the AKP has achieved a significant proportion of its goal towards establishing its hegemony. To support the notion that this is the case in current Turkish society, we could consider a recent action by the government. On January 2011, the government proposed a new law, on alcohol consumption, which shows the seriousness of the current situation in Turkey. This new law prohibits alcohol at open-air weddings, open-air restaurants, concerts and catered events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0539018411425831"><italic>HaberTürk</italic></xref>, 12 January 2011). It also limits consumption of alcohol to pubs and stipulates a minimum legal age of 24. This in all respects shows that the Islamic conservatives are at the stage of consolidating their hegemony. Republicans have responded to the situation with a deep concern for the future of the republic. We therefore now examine the position of republicans in their opposition to the acts of the ruling party.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0539018411425831">
<title>Republicans in defense of the republic</title>
<p>‘The true republic’ should not be built on ‘cultural bases’. It might be argued that this idea summarizes republican fears. For many republicans, recent government acts represent attempts to undermine the foundations of the Turkish republic. The republicans believe that there is an ideal of citizenship that should be adhered to and respected by all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0539018411425831">Güler, 2006</xref>). Failure to do so would result in citizens facing insurmountable problems affecting their ability to live together harmoniously. However, liberals and conservatives believe that the problem of living together has already emerged because of republican objections to religious-conservative actions in the public sphere.</p>
<p>It is conceivable that the distinctions between republicans and Islamic-conservatives revolve around their understanding of democracy. Whilst republicans believe that the possibility of democracy thrives only upon a republican base, Islamic-conservatives believe such a base to be not only superfluous but also positively damaging to the democratic process. Their disagreement invokes different ontologies as to the meaning of a democratic regime: while, on the one hand, civic foundations are seen as the precondition for the emergence and development of democracy, on the other hand, cultural bases are viewed as democracy’s necessary foundations. Here, the tension is between culture and politics: the Islamic-conservatives give priority to culture, whilst the republicans view the political base as primary. The tensions that this creates are reviewed below.</p>
<p>Republicans regard calls for a reformulation of the state in culturally pluralist terms as a retrograde step: modernity abandoned in favor of a return to a medieval stage. They argue that if each culture is equally valid purely because it exists, then the state tends toward the medieval. Rather than progressing, the state reverts to an agglomeration of ‘communities’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0539018411425831">17</xref></sup> Thereby, the modern national character of the state is in danger of being eradicated through the actions of a ruling party that would insist on religious communities as the real basis of the state. Güler, for example, points out that the modern Turkish nation-state was built on the principle that all are equal according to an identity that is secularist and nationalist, while the present government appears to reject this identity in favor of a state that is composed of religious communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0539018411425831">Güler, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Both the liberals and the conservatives assert that the republicans have so far benefited from an ‘authoritarian republic’ at the cost of excluding people deemed as ‘others’. According to them, the republicans are defensive over what they see as an attack on what has been gained, so that their goal is the conservation of what has been won. Thus, both liberals and Islamic-conservatives accuse the republicans of being conservative (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0539018411425831">Şahin, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>More serious no doubt is the fact that liberals and Islamic-conservatives view republican protest movements as the fallout from military intervention in political life. For the Islamic-conservatives, the military is a staunch defender of the republic in its old form. Therefore, any civil-societal defense of the republic is suspiciously viewed as an alliance with the military. Despite the fact that the participants in republican movements insist that they are desirous of neither a military coup nor an Islamic regime, the liberals and Islamic-conservatives persist in holding to the conspiracy theory that sees an alliance between the republicans and the military.</p>
<p>When we investigate the character of these ‘extremely conservative’ republicans, we discover that most of them are neither rich nor do they hold positions in governance. They are mostly teachers, lawyers, academics and workers. One may want to argue that the republicans also include amongst their ranks some generals, high-court members and top businesspeople. This is certainly true, but the majority of those concerned with organizing republican meetings are ordinary people. Such a claim necessarily invokes a reconsideration of the so-called Kemalist elite. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0539018411425831">Gülalp (2001</xref>: 443), for example, insists that, ‘In Turkey, status stratification within the professional middle class has primarily taken place along the lines of whether one has accepted the Kemalist ideology and internalized the Western lifestyle’. Although this was indubitably the case in the early stages of the republican era, in which the core elite saw itself as the main agent of modernization and for which they enjoyed a privileged status, this no longer holds. From the early 1980s, the situation changed, and today the professional middle class is not composed solely of the Kemalist elite. Rather, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0539018411425831">Göle (1996)</xref> notes, the current Islamic professional middle class has emerged as a ‘counter elite’. Even if it is true that the status stratification within the professional middle class is deeply indebted to an acceptance of Kemalist ideology, those who organized protest movements against the government are not drawn from the state elite but are ordinary people from civil society. Their aim is the preservation of a life-style, not the defense of a privileged position in society. The battle is not between the privileged and the excluded but between two different life-styles. There is, of course, no doubt that life-styles develop from an economic base or power source. The conservative-Islamic element itself constitutes a new middle class within the economy. The differentiation and choice for a new life-style, a distinguishing mark, if you will, is signified through association with the turban.</p>
<p>Although Islamism in Turkey is essentially a movement of a social class, for the Muslim businessmen, in the main, it combines different classes with contradictory interests. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0539018411425831">Gülalp (2001</xref>) has insisted that the Islamic movement includes the following class segments:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>1. The peripheral segment of the capitalist class, consisting of small – and medium scale – and mostly provincial businesses … 2. The professional middle class, whose peripheral segment consists of those university graduates who have a conservative and mostly provincial background and who have begun to challenge the ‘core’ professional elite who are the fundamental mainstay of Kemalism … 3. The working class, whose peripheral segment consists of recent immigrants to the cities who have mostly been unable to find secure employment … . (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0539018411425831">Gülalp 2001</xref>: 444–445)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To the question of how Islamism unified these elements, Haldun’s answer is that:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>… different social classes and class segments, with identifiable albeit mutually contradictory interests, nevertheless expressed their interests in a common idiom of opposition to the Kemalist state. Their differing interests were successfully assimilated by the Islamist movement in a discourse of opposition to Kemalism and the demand for an Islamic lifestyle. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0539018411425831">Gülalp, 2001</xref>: 435)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0539018411425831">18</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Therefore, the importance of identity politics for the rise of Islamic business needs to be understood. In other words, in ‘an age of cultural identities’, the Islamist movement appears as a movement demanding recognition for an ‘authentic Islamic culture’ against the republicanism of the project of Kemalism. In order for a class movement to establish its hegemony, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0539018411425831">Gramsci (1971)</xref> explained a long time ago, it is necessary to control the intellectual life of society by cultural means. Thus, Islamism ostensibly argues for recognition of a different cultural identity, and the different classes and class segments find a way of expressing themselves within it. However, it is not contradictory to insist that the new middle class constitutes the actual base of the Islamist movement. For example, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0539018411425831">Navaro-Yaşin (2002)</xref> noted, the identity politics of Islamist women cannot be fully explicated without taking account of market relations and commodities. She demonstrates that the favoring of turbans as essential apparel among female Islamist students was inextricably linked with the creation of an important textile sector.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0539018411425831">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Currently, the turban issue provokes heated debate between religious conservatives and republicans. The republican objection to the wearing of the turban in universities leads Islamic-conservatives and liberals to charge them with being anti-democratic and militarily oriented. What is extremely interesting for the terms of this antagonism is that religious conservatives tend to view republicans as illegitimate invaders of the country. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0539018411425831">Temelkuran (2008)</xref> intelligently argues, the prime minister has used the language of post-colonial discourse as it emerged in the post-colonial era in the old colonies. Accordingly, republicans are viewed as aliens who colonized the Turkish people, such that, with the movement towards decolonization, the true interests of the people are once more reasserted under the guidance of the Islamists. Islamic-conservatism, then, ironically creates a new subdivision and rift through its suggestion that some people, namely those who follow its edicts, are more authentic than others. The true indigenous culture, it insists, is Islamist.</p>
<p>Republicans, though, are not only military men, they are also millions of different people drawn from civil society. These people chanted the slogan at numerous meetings: ‘neither Şeriat (Islamic law) nor military coup’. This suggests that, for them, politics was not a stark choice between the twin poles of Islam and the military. It is necessary to underscore the fact that, in the political project of modernity, Kemalism, one of its important aims has been attained: Turkish civil society actively defends the Turkish republic. Thus, it is not only the bureaucrats and military men who defend the republic’s attainments; more importantly, there are now many civil-societal organizations whose aim is to protect modern life-styles. For example, the organizations that arranged the protest movements against the recent acts of the government are <italic>Atatürkçü Düşünce Derneği</italic> (Kemalist Thought Association), <italic>Çağdaş Yaşamı Destekleme Derneği</italic> (Association Advocating Modern Life), <italic>Kemalist Kadınlar Birliği</italic> (Kemalist Women’s Association), and <italic>Barolar Birliği</italic> (Bar Association). All of these associations openly and explicitly state that their organization and their meetings are driven by the desire to cement and assure modern life-values, and that they have absolutely no wish for a military coup.</p>
<p>The situation can be further illustrated through an observation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0539018411425831">Tuğal’s (2002)</xref>. He analyzed the old Islamist Refah Party on the basis of its understanding of capitalism: ‘The party adopted an anti-capitalist and anti-authoritarian rhetoric … The Turkish state could not tolerate … this restricted criticism of capitalism and the secularist bureaucracy, and the party was closed down in 1998’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0539018411425831">Tuğal, 2002</xref>: 93). The present government, by contrast, subscribes to a neo-liberal model of political economy, under which millions of people from civil society protest against the government. If the old Islamist party was closed down because of its anti-capitalist stance, the present Islamic government has occasioned protest because of its anti-secular and neo-liberal orientation. This illustrates how Islamism has brought together different classes with contradictory interests, while representing a movement of the rising middle class, which has never had any problem with neo-liberal economic policies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0539018411425831">
<title>In conclusion</title>
<p>Having appraised the situation in both camps, I briefly summarize the clashes by way of a conclusion. As I have already suggested, modern Turkish conservatism needs to be understood as a movement that aims to overcome modernity by means of its stress on the cultural sphere. Undoubtedly, in the age of globalization, neo-liberalism and neo-conservatism make cozy bedfellows. Giddens argues that a radical politics today requires a philosophical conservatism – that is ‘a philosophy of protection, conservation and solidarity’ (1996: 227). He argues for this ‘alternative’ against the erratic play of market forces. He certainly fails to recognize that neo-liberalism flirts with neo-conservatism in the cultural sphere, even as it attempts to bind cultural communities to its goals.</p>
<p>Capitalism, without doubt, has been in a deep crisis for the past two decades, during which time neo-conservatism has provided a lifeline and help in surviving. The support offered may accurately be characterized as the medievalization of the world in the pursuit of rescuing capitalism. If the bourgeoisie originally overcame medieval life because of the constraints that restricted progressive growth, it now appears, in some quarters, as the savior of an identity that would attempt to reclaim its roots. The conservatization of Turkish society has to be considered in this light. In other words, the neo-conservatism of Islamism is searching for a practical means of establishing its hegemony. Precisely because of this, Islamic-conservatives can celebrate communitarian political philosophy and a culturalist view of human beings.</p>
<p>Through the priority given to the cultural dimensions of human life, Islamic-conservatives claim to be the true representatives of the democratic ideal. However, creating and/or supporting the bounded communities of religion does not appear to be conducive to democracy in the least. Bounded religious communities, <italic>tarikatlar</italic> and <italic>cemaatler</italic>, have their own interpretations of Islam, all of which claim to be ‘pure Islam’. This necessarily leads to a clash, not only between secularists and Islamists, but also between multiple interpretations of Islam. Living together, therefore, becomes impossible under the rule of bounded communities. It could be shown that, due to this essentialization of bounded communities, a high-school headmaster in the city of Mersin was able to declare that female and male students were banned from getting any closer to each than 45 centimeters. There is no way to consider this sort of undemocratic act to be the basis of living together as a society.</p>
<p>However, the republican model of living together requires a corrective also. Republicans need to be aware that the world is no longer that in which their revolutionary republican ancestors lived. They may need to reconsider the relationship of difference to republican modernity. There is no longer a collective belief in ‘one’ unified world for humanity. On the grounds purely of national unity, the universal ideal needs to be meticulously reconsidered. In other words, cultural diversity and plurality need to be approached more positively, and to be entertained more generously.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the republican ideal of living together under political principles, it could be argued, represents a far better and more generous alternative to the model of cultural plurality championed by Islamists. Rather than prioritizing culture, the political is seen as the essential ground for solving the problems of living together. The republican polity should of course accept cultural difference, but not in a culturalist way. The essentialization of culture, as promoted by Islamic-conservatives, would mean that the struggle for hegemony would be the ultimate goal of religious communities. And this goal would destroy the basis of the idea of living together.</p>

<p>By the ‘goal of overcoming modernity’ I mean the following: in the late Ottoman Empire, an old conservative reaction against the rise of the West indeed believed that it was possible to resist the new ideas about the social world. It was of course not possible to resist modernity, but today their sons – the new conservatives – are in power and claim that they have achieved their fathers’ goal of overcoming modernity.

<p>Islamism emerged in the 19th-century Ottoman Empire when Europe problematized the self-understanding of the empire. Therefore, it is important to emphasize that Islamism is not a purely recent occurrence. For the emergence of Islamism, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0539018411425831">Tunaya (2003)</xref>.</p></fn>

<p>In the 19th century, as a ‘model’ of state and society, the other two political philosophical perspectives were Turkism and Westernism. Turkism is a perspective that aims at unifying all the Turkic countries in the name of Turan, the land of all the Turks, whereas Westernism means that there is no alternative to accepting the Western way of life in all its shades. Both of these views should be seen as different interpretations of modernity. That is, modernity is possible in a Westernist as well as in a Turkist form. It should also be stressed that this article is not about the compatibility of Islam with modernity: Islam and Islamism are not identical. Otherwise, Islam is of course compatible with modernity, as I have explored elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0539018411425831">Kaya, 2004a</xref>).</p></fn>

<p>My discussion of ‘Islamists’ in the Ottoman Empire refers to the Islamic-conservatives. However, there have been other Islamists, contemporary radical Islamists, who are not conservative.</p></fn>

<p>It should be no surprise that the argument for ‘multi-culturalism’ is applauded by the conservatives, since the multi-cultural argument is definitely a product of modernizing periods in the West. I mean that, before modernity, it is difficult to find a culturally plural society. However, there are those who argue, powerfully, that the Ottoman Empire was already culturally plural and that the Turkish republic eradicated this plurality through its nationalist and secularist administration (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0539018411425831">Tezel, 2006</xref>). What these types of arguments fail to appreciate is that a pluralist society is not only one which includes different world-views, but is also one in which different world-views can openly exist. This openness is indeed possible only under conditions of modernity, precisely because it is modernity’s basic principle of autonomy that makes multiple interpretations of the world possible.</p></fn>

<p>In Amasya Anadolu Lisesi (a high-school in the city of Amasya), four female students were forced to fast and, when they refused, were forced to move to another school (<italic>Cumhuriyet</italic> 21 November 2007).</p></fn>

<p>I must insist once again that there is of course no singular model of modernity. Rather, there are plural modernities with their specific interpretations of modernity’s imaginary significations of mastery and autonomy. However, what I argue here is that postmodernism’s and Islamism’s claims against the universalist principle of modernity cannot be taken to mean that another version of modernity is possible.</p></fn>

<p>Here it must be stressed that on the issue of head-covering among women in Islam there is no consensus. Apart from the major group of supporters of head-covering, there is a group of theologians who interpret the Koran as having no rule for this, as remaining silent. For this discussion, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0539018411425831">Filiz (2008)</xref>.</p></fn>

<p>One of the most important figures of the republican protest movements, Professor Birgül Ayman Güler, a political scientist, powerfully argued in a conference that what is at issue now is the attempt of the government to re-found the Turkish state on the basis of ‘religious-communitarian’ principles. That is, the medievalization of the state is the Islamists’ aim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0539018411425831">Güler, 2008</xref>).</p></fn>

<p>It must be noted that Navaro-Yaşin intelligently argues that Islamist veiled women are not anti-modern. On the contrary, they create their own modernity by distinguishing their life-style from that of Westernized women (2002). I agree with her that Islamism could be considered as a ‘different project of modernity’ in the light of the concept of multiple modernities. However, what I argue for in this article is that the cultural project of original, Western modernity is not accepted by the Islamic conservatives and that this rejection occupies an important position in the clashes between the Islamists and the republicans. I have explained elsewhere the possibility and the actuality of an Islamist modernity as a culturalist and ‘totalitarian’ variety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0539018411425831">Kaya, 2004a</xref>).</p></fn>
