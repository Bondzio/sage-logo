<abstract>
<p>The academization of journalism is reliant on the development of the field founded in scholarship demonstrated through the publication of research in peer-reviewed specialist journals. Given the profile of journalism faculty, this means inducting practitioners into a culture of critical research. In Australia at least, this cohort of neophytes is predominantly comprised of middle-aged women who were surveyed about their personal attitudes to research. They were mostly open to the idea of becoming researchers but were inclined to proceed cautiously without necessarily severing their ties with practice. There was evidence to suggest that a generally positive orientation to research was not capitalized on and that they remained uncertain about the role of research. On the other hand, they appeared not to have adopted the orthodoxy of implacable opposition to scholarly inquiry. The change in gender composition in the academy may provide, contrary to historical, but more in line with contemporary, evidence, a renewed impetus to the project of academizing the field.</p>

<p>The academization of journalism – the process whereby vocational training in the workplace grounded in an apprenticeship learning model was supplanted by scholarly study in a critical, research-based higher education environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1464884912453285">Goedegebuure, 1992</xref>: 58) – might have been expected to have facilitated an increase in the numbers of female practitioners as universities applied more equity- and merit-based admissions criteria than traditional employers at an increasingly important juncture in the labor supply chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464884912453285">Bromley, 2009</xref>: 55–56). In turn, given that globally around 85 per cent of journalism academics were recruited from among practitioners, that should have led to a commensurate growth in female faculty in journalism schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464884912453285">Bromley and Neal, 2011</xref>: 56).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1464884912453285">1</xref></sup> Yet while the proportion of female journalists reached about 50 per cent in some countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1464884912453285">Pinto and Sousa, 2003</xref>: 181; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1464884912453285">Strong, 2007</xref>: 8), almost everywhere – one notable exception by 2011 was Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884912453285">Bromley, forthcoming</xref>) – women remained in the minority among faculty in journalism schools. Being a journalism academic was seen as the prerogative of older men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1464884912453285">De Beer, 1995</xref>: 9). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1464884912453285">Splichal and Sparks (1994</xref>: 109–111) noted that the academization of journalism had not transformed women’s employment opportunities simply because journalism was an occupation which discriminated systemically against women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1464884912453285">1994</xref>: 112–114). This attitude, it was argued, then pervaded the journalism academy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1464884912453285">North, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1464884912453285">2010</xref>: 111; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1464884912453285">Rush et al., 2004a</xref>).</p>
<p>Most scholarly attention paid to journalism in the academy has concerned itself with students and graduates, syllabi and curricula, pedagogies and intellectual (non-)alignments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464884912453285">Bromley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1464884912453285">Josephi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1464884912453285">Phillips, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1464884912453285">Willnat and Weaver, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1464884912453285">Zelizer, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1464884912453285">2009</xref>). Features inherent in academization (merit, institutionalization and bureaucratization, becoming more science-like, insisting on formal credentials, professionalization, theory building and critical research, which lay behind the production of new knowledge, new ideas and new skillsets) led to the (re)formation (modernization) of many occupations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1464884912453285">Hodder and Hodder, 2010</xref>: 899–900; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1464884912453285">Shipman and Shipman, 2006</xref>: 7–9). However, they were addressed only partially and obliquely in journalism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1464884912453285">Medsger, 2005</xref>). Journalism straddled the vocational-academic divide more uncomfortably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464884912453285">Bromley, 2006</xref>: 64; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1464884912453285">Tumber and Prentoulis, 2005</xref>: 69–72), confounded by ‘challenges [to] old myths and shared ways of knowing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1464884912453285">Nieminen, 2008</xref>: 127). Journalism simultaneously embraced and rebuffed academization as a way of allowing ‘professionals to distinguish themselves from … amateurs’; of validating qualifications as proof of ‘skill and analytical ability’, and of equipping its graduates with the capabilities to ‘assess wider problems, decide new courses of action and acquire new skills, rather than repeating narrowly defined actions that lost effectiveness when the situation changed’. Journalism had a parallel alternative (oppositional) identity as a craft which was best taught ‘by journalists for journalists’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1464884912453285">Shipman and Shipman, 2006</xref>: 10; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1464884912453285">Wu, 2006</xref>: 134–139; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1464884912453285">Zelizer, 2004</xref>: 34–36), which constrained the role of universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464884912453285">Bromley, 2009</xref>: 56). In many places, journalism as a field was shaped primarily by practitioners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1464884912453285">Dodge and Viner, 1963</xref>: 9; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1464884912453285">Kemsley, 1952</xref>: viii). It was perhaps not surprising that many journalists assumed that the transfer from newsroom to the academy involved no fundamental re-orientation: ‘if you’re teaching journalism or mass communication, you’re still basically a journalist, right?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1464884912453285">Joseph, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>For the most part the distinction between, and the transition in higher education from, professional education (training) and academic field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1464884912453285">Wilson et al., 2010</xref>: 247) remained incomplete. Conversion promised destabilizing ‘new conflicts, orientations, and developments’ which challenged ‘the role, professional identity, and values’ of practitioners, and threatened to denigrate practice as ‘outdated’ and ‘antiquated’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1464884912453285">Nieminen, 2008</xref>: 137–138). Journalist-academics were reluctant participants in the academization process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884912453285">Bacon, 1998</xref>: 80; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1464884912453285">Harcup, 2011b</xref>: 169; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1464884912453285">Leung et al., 2006</xref>: 192–193, 195–197, 199; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1464884912453285">Medsger, 2005</xref>: 209ff). Markers of the academization of the field as ‘a proper and autonomous … discipline’ included publication in specialist peer-reviewed journals generating citation networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1464884912453285">Meyer et al., 2009</xref>: 3.5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1464884912453285">Stephen, 2009</xref>: 785; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1464884912453285">Tankard et al., 1982</xref>). This was in turn dependent on establishing a virtuous cycle of participation in, and production of, critical research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464884912453285">Bromley and Neal, 2011</xref>: 58; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1464884912453285">Meyer et al., 2009</xref>: 1.3) – or, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1464884912453285">Hickson et al. (1989</xref>: 235) put it, research breeding research.</p>
<p>Critical research was arguably the least developed dimension of the academization of journalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1464884912453285">Wilson et al., 2010</xref>: 256) and the most antithetical to established journalism practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1464884912453285">De Beer and Tomaselli, 2000</xref>: 20–21; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1464884912453285">Hartley, 1996</xref>: 36; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1464884912453285">Nieminen, 2008</xref>: 138), both of which were reflected in generally low levels of participation and productivity among journalism faculty (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464884912453285">Bromley and Neal, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1464884912453285">Harcup, 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1464884912453285">2011b</xref>). However, most surveys of research performance among journalism academics did not address gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464884912453285">Bodle et al., 2011</xref>: 121–122). Yet being a woman was broadly negatively correlated with research activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884912453285">Bromley, forthcoming</xref>), and there has been much debate about whether and how certain factors might have contributed to women being less productive as researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464884912453285">Asmar, 1999</xref>: 255–256). Getting started after a career change from journalism was important; holding the PhD correlated positively with a research career (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1464884912453285">Probert, 2005</xref>: 56, 64), as did status, but participation and productivity in research were also highly dependent on ‘a deep-seated personal commitment to research’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1464884912453285">Cole and Bowers, 1975</xref>: 643; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1464884912453285">Schweitzer, 1989</xref>: 413). Female academics appeared to be less ‘passionate’ about research, however (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464884912453285">Asmar, 1999</xref>: 263). Women were less likely to continue as students to a higher degree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464884912453285">Asmar, 1999</xref>: 257). They started their careers at lower levels than men and had fewer years of academic employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1464884912453285">Probert, 2005</xref>: 55). They were less likely to have been given research skills development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464884912453285">Asmar, 1999</xref>: 263). Those who did earn doctorates in the humanities received less assistance from supervisors’ networks after graduating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464884912453285">1999</xref>: 265). Initially, women took on higher teaching and administration workloads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464884912453285">1999</xref>: 260). All the same, they remained more optimistic about doing research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1464884912453285">Probert, 2005</xref>: 54), and subsequently, over the course of a career, women were likely to increase their research productivity more than men did (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884912453285">Bonzi, 1992</xref>: 114–115).</p>
<p>When <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1464884912453285">Hickson et al. (1993</xref>: 227–228) compiled a list in the early 1990s of the hundred most productive active scholars in communication, it contained only 12 women. Overall, these top scholars had each published an average of 35.5 papers, whereas the figure for the top 33 women was 16.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1464884912453285">Hickson et al., 1992</xref>: 353). Nevertheless, they found few substantive differences in the profiles of male and female researchers and the influences on them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1464884912453285">Hickson et al., 1992</xref>: 354–355). Using <italic>Journalism Quarterly</italic> as an indicator, women appeared to be no less active and possibly more productive in publishing in the journalism field. A third of the 33 most prolific active female researchers had published in the journal (the same proportion as among the 22 most prolific male researchers), but more than twice as much of the women’s total output (7.6%) appeared there than the men’s (3.4%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1464884912453285">Hickson et al., 1992</xref>: 354, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1464884912453285">1993</xref>: 229). Almost a decade later it was suggested that women’s output of critical research was accelerating ahead of their representation in the journalism academy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884912453285">Applegate et al., 2011</xref>: 139, 149; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464884912453285">Bodle et al., 2011</xref>: 129), and that the potential of women as critical researchers was evident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884912453285">Applegate et al., 2011</xref>: 152; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464884912453285">Bodle et al., 2011</xref>: 128; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884912453285">Bromley, forthcoming</xref>).</p>
<p>A survey of journalist-academics in Australian universities was undertaken to explore the personal attitudes held by female faculty related to critical research. Data on career status, human capital, alternative commitments and critical research participation and productivity were also collected. This permitted an assessment of the influence of the feminization of the journalism faculty on the academization of the field gauged through manifest rates of, and latent propensity for, participation and productivity in research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464884912453285">Bromley and Neal, 2011</xref>: 59). Australia had particular salience because, as already noted, women were in the majority among journalism faculty. The issue was whether, in line with cross-disciplinary global evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464884912453285">Abramo et al. 2009</xref>: 518–521; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1464884912453285">Padilla-Gonzalez et al., 2011</xref>: 653–654; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1464884912453285">Sax et al., 2002</xref>: 424; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1464884912453285">Tower et al., 2007</xref>: 23–26), a greater presence of women in the journalism academy would further diminish an already poor research record.</p>

<title>Women and the journalism academy</title>
<p>The carry-over into journalism schools of a macho newsroom culture through appointments, paternalism and gender tokenism was well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464884912453285">Beasley, 2007</xref>: 25; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1464884912453285">Chambers et al., 2004</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1464884912453285">De Uriate, 2004</xref>: 16; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1464884912453285">Weinberg, 2008</xref>: 151). In the USA, women were almost twice as likely as men to be at the lowest academic level (instructor). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884912453285">Becker et al. (2003</xref>: 5) recognized that only ‘modest’ advances had been made in rectifying gender imbalance since the 1990s. Indeed, the relative situation of women with regard to academic status either changed slowly or not at all from the 1960s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1464884912453285">Beasley, 1987</xref>: 60; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1464884912453285">Kretzschmar, 2007</xref>: 208, 212). In 2008, US journalism schools were still being urged to appoint more tenured female professors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1464884912453285">Poindexter et al., 2008</xref>: 348). Women comprised about one-quarter of full professors and 28 per cent of departmental chairs. As well as being concentrated in lower ranks, they tended also to be located in less prestigious institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1464884912453285">DeFleur et al., 2010</xref>: 23; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1464884912453285">Rush et al., 2004b</xref>: 117). The Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication reported that its membership in 2011 consisted of 1278 (40.8%) women out of 3131 whose gender was known. In the UK and Ireland the Association for Journalism Education said that, of the 494 members whose gender was known, 142 (28.75%) were women.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1464884912453285">2</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1464884912453285">Okunna (1992</xref>: 51, 54) calculated that in Nigeria women accounted for only six out of 92 academic staff. In Austria, female staff made up between no more than 13 per cent and 30 per cent of academics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1464884912453285">Dorer, 2009</xref>: 88–89). Women remained a minority (48.1%) among members of the Journalism Education Association of Australia (JEAA) to 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1464884912453285">Cokley et al., 2006</xref>: 130). Although by 2011 that had increased to more than 50 per cent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884912453285">Bromley, forthcoming</xref>), of 13 full professors of journalism in Australian universities only three were women.</p>
<p>Female students’ career ambitions were shaped by ‘the continued male dominance of the public world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1464884912453285">Splichal and Sparks, 1994</xref>: 112–114). They were drawn to areas of journalism which were demonstrably more receptive to women (magazines, television), or likely to reject journalism as a career choice altogether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1464884912453285">1994</xref>: 118–128). In the USA, only a half of female journalism students aspired to daily newspaper jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464884912453285">Bulkeley, 2004</xref>: 184). A more recent survey of journalism students in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden came to similar conclusions that women were markedly more attracted than men to work in magazines and much less inclined to seek jobs in national newspapers with minorities of up to 13 per cent intent on entering public relations or more generic communications roles. They exhibited ‘stronger creative ideals … but have less taste for investigative journalism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464884912453285">Bjørnsen et al., 2007</xref>: 12, 24). An Australian survey of more than 400 senior high school students in three states in 2008 found that, on the whole, girls favoured the audio-visual media as offering more scope for creativity than newspapers, and more ‘fun’ as work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1464884912453285">Grenby et al., 2009</xref>: 17). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1464884912453285">Kretzschmar (2007</xref>: 218–220) concluded that in the USA and Europe women had little impact on journalism: they either adapted to, or abandoned, the occupation. This raised questions about whether journalism schools (and their staffs) reflected women’s values in relation to journalism, with impacts on ‘advising, mentoring, and role modeling, not to mention classroom climate and changes to the curriculum’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1464884912453285">Dorer, 2003</xref>: 249; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1464884912453285">North, 2010</xref>: 109–110; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1464884912453285">Rush et al., 2004b</xref>: 106, 114; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1464884912453285">Sarikakis, 2004</xref>: 342–343). The survey responses of journalism graduates of two US schools in the 1980s and 1990s ‘showed a necessity for journalism education to meet the needs of a largely female workforce that will be employed in a wide variety of settings’, and included ‘a clear note of dismay’ with (mainly male) professors. The researchers argued that there was ‘a clear impression that journalism schools do not address the realities of women graduates …’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1464884912453285">McAdams et al., 2004</xref>: 327), even though the presence of female faculty was influential in shaping women students’ study choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464884912453285">Bettinger and Long, 2005</xref>: 156).</p>
<p>Although acknowledged as ‘the main beneficiaries’ of the development of journalism education, women did not appear as academics in the standard survey of Australian journalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1464884912453285">Lloyd, 1985</xref>, 163–169). Australia was hardly unique in this regard. In the UK the system was under the control of men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464884912453285">Bromley, 2009</xref>: 52, 55; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464884912453285">Bundock, 1957</xref>: 227–231). In the USA, 49 per cent of journalism schools listed fewer than three female faculty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1464884912453285">Rush et al., 2004b</xref>: 118). At the beginning of the 21st century, women remained marginalized in discussions about journalism education: drawing on Esser’s integrative multilevel model of influences on journalism, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1464884912453285">Fröhlich and Holtz-Bacha (2003</xref>: 308) nevertheless ignored the ‘subjective sphere’ (the level of individual influence) which included socio-demographics and biographical factors.</p>
<p>By the mid-1990s a shift had occurred, starting in the USA, towards journalism faculty having academic rather than occupational qualifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1464884912453285">Medsger, 2005</xref>: 212–213). The evidence whether this favoured or militated against women was mixed. On the one hand, female journalism academics were well qualified and highly experienced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1464884912453285">Henry, 2004</xref>: 17–18); on the other hand, they were inclined to leave journalism earlier than men did, and to remain in lower level positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464884912453285">Aldridge, 2001</xref>: 7.1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1464884912453285">Fröhlich, 2005</xref>). Even where credentials as a journalist were not required, an ‘old boys’ network’ which excluded women was likely to operate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1464884912453285">Henry, 2004</xref>: 9). Women probably gained overall from increases in faculty positions as a result of the expansion of journalism programs in the late 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1464884912453285">Albers, 2004</xref>: 165, 170), from trends towards higher ratios of tenured (or continuing appointments for) faculty (Carrington and Pratt, 2005: 5), and from a broader tendency to increase faculty numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884912453285">Bromley, forthcoming</xref>).</p>
<p>Experiences of being a journalist – and continuing associations with journalism practice – were likely to influence how journalist-academics executed their roles in universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1464884912453285">Stark et al., 1986</xref>: 27). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464884912453285">Aldridge (2001)</xref> suggested that women’s experiences of working in journalism were qualitatively different from those of men, in that the largest influx of women had occurred when the occupation was changing from one based on the continuous to the contingent career model. Some movement in this direction occurred also in higher education with universities being urged to become more managerialist, more entrepreneurial, more enterprising, more market-oriented and more performance-driven (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464884912453285">Bryson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1464884912453285">Salaran, 2010</xref>: 133–134; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1464884912453285">Schweitzer, 1989</xref>: 410), although this may not always have worked in favour of women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1464884912453285">Probert, 2005</xref>: 69–70). In Australia, women were more than twice as likely as men to hold fractional faculty appointments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1464884912453285">Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, 2009</xref>). On the other hand, a Canadian survey found that although promotion to associate professor and full professor took significantly longer in journalism than in almost all other academic fields, promotion for women came more quickly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1464884912453285">Ornstein et al., 2007</xref>: 9–10, 15, 19). As internal pressures to produce research were formalized as external measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464884912453285">Acker and Armenti, 2004</xref>: 7), the principal method adopted by female staff for coping with what were perceived as the escalating demands of academic work was simply to work harder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464884912453285">2004</xref>: 16), a tactic they may have brought across from the newsroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464884912453285">Aldridge, 2001</xref>: 6.4–6.8).</p>

<sec id="section2-1464884912453285" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>As part of a self-administered, online survey (reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464884912453285">Bromley and Neal, 2011</xref>),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1464884912453285">3</xref></sup> demographic data were collected between the end of 2010 and the beginning of 2011 from 61 respondents with posts associated with journalism programmess in Australian universities, 53 of whom also provided information on their participation and productivity in critical research as measured by publication in peer-reviewed journals relevant to the field. This was a pertinent population, given the suggestion that Australian female faculty were potentially pivotal to improving research performance in journalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464884912453285">Bromley and Neal, 2011</xref>: 65). All the respondents were former or current journalists, or what we term ‘journalist-academics’. Specific proxies were used for a set of variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1464884912453285">Porter and Umbach, 2001</xref>: 172–174): career status (level of appointment and length of time in the academy), human capital (research training) and alternative commitments (type of appointment [research/teaching] and continuing to practise as a journalist).</p>
<p>The ‘vital importance of publication productivity’ was well established as the primary determinant of scholarship: ‘nothing beats publishing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1464884912453285">De Fleur, 2007</xref>: 111; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1464884912453285">Stephen, 2009</xref>: 784). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1464884912453285">Stephen (2009</xref>: 784–785) noted that ‘the foundational activity of scholarship … [was] publication in the peer-reviewed journal literature of one’s field’. National audits, such as Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA), privileged journal articles as the chief measure of research output, and national grant-awarding bodies, such as the Australian Research Council, have traditionally relied heavily on researchers’ ‘track records’ based on publication achievements in assessing and awarding applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464884912453285">Bazeley, 1998</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.arc.gov.au/general/assessment_process.htm">http://www.arc.gov.au/general/assessment_process.htm</ext-link>). In the UK’s 2008 Research Assessment Exercise (RAE), 42 per cent of submissions in media and communication were journal articles and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1464884912453285">Miah (2012)</xref> concluded that ‘The relative lack of book chapters in most of the non-Stem submissions also raises question[s] about their perceived value’.</p>
<p>Personal attitudes were garnered from 51 respondents through a number of questions which invited open-ended, qualitative responses related to the research experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464884912453285">Bromley and Neal, 2011</xref>: 59). Respondents were asked <italic>inter alia</italic> to identify any obstacles to, or opportunities for, research they had encountered, or which they felt existed in the academy. Responses were coded broadly as ‘positive’, ‘negative’ and ‘neutral’ by a single coder. Indicators of a positive personal attitude towards doing critical research included a belief that research built knowledge, improved journalism, informed teaching and inspired students, and that it had brought personal reward. Negative personal attitudes were illustrated by complaints of a lack of institutional and collegial support, problems with bureaucracy, unbalanced workloads, incompatibility with continuing to practice, irrelevance, and a lack of interest in the media industry. For example, one respondent commented, ‘There are better things to do with one’s time.’ Where there was an equal mix of such comments, respondents were ambivalent, or it was unclear whether the respondent was generally positive or negative, responses were coded as neutral (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1464884912453285">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>To enhance confidence in the data, a list of 151 faculty with associations with journalism programmes was compiled from information posted by Australian universities on their websites, and gender data for the 74 Australian faculty members of the JEAA in 2011were accessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884912453285">Bromley, forthcoming</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1464884912453285">4</xref></sup> Women tended to be over-represented in responses to surveys of journalism faculty. For example, one cohort of international respondents, adjusted for those who did not reveal their gender, comprised 40.6 per cent women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1464884912453285">Johnson and Yarnall, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1464884912453285">Brunner et al. (2008)</xref> counted 47 per cent women among their respondents. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1464884912453285">Harcup (2011a</xref>: 38) found 50.8 per cent women in his population of respondents in the UK and Ireland. In our survey, 52.5 per cent of respondents were women. However, the JEAA membership (51.35%) and the data in the online biographies (58.3%) both indicated similar gender representation in the Australian journalism academy. Furthermore, while the respondents not unexpectedly provided a range of opinions, they were not randomly distributed, and only three, quite tight clusters of responses emerged, suggesting that the data were, in a non-scientific sense, reliable and valid enough to support tentative generalization. Finally, the data were used heuristically to provide an empirical basis for an interpretive, inductive analysis of the likely role of women in the academization of journalism as evidenced in actual and potential participation and productivity in critical research measured in terms of the publication of articles in peer-reviewed journals in the field, and through personal attitudes towards this type of research activity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1464884912453285">5</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section3-1464884912453285">
<title>Responses</title>
<p>Unsurprisingly, a shortage of time and the associated pressure of teaching workloads were seen as constituting obstacles to publishing. Two-fifths of responses identifying obstacles mentioned these factors. Continuing to practise journalism was also seen as a time-consuming barrier to establishing a research publication record and as preventing successful adaptation to academic work. As a corollary to this, the need for professional development (most commonly, training in research methodologies and processes), support, mentoring, academic leadership, guidance and collaboration with more experienced researchers were mentioned by nearly three-quarters of respondents. Fewer (less than a third) saw a lack of such things negatively as an obstacle to becoming academic researchers (a small number mentioned journalists’ own inability or unwillingness to negotiate their transfer from one field to another) than positively as means of encouraging and enabling the development of critical research careers (56.6%), and as ways of providing extra support for new entrants to the academy to convert to researchers (49%). Twice as many women as men believed that mentoring and support were both an obstacle when absent, and needed for encouragement. A female lecturer with a publishing record after eight years in the academy wrote:
<disp-quote>
<p>I have had no institutional support and only limited mentoring from one Australian academic. International journalism academics have been much more encouraging and collaborative… . There is also a ‘closed shop’ approach to mentoring [in Australia] which has sexist overtones.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Marginally fewer women thought that providing mentoring and support was necessary to bolster newly appointed academic staff but they still constituted a majority (54%). Another female lecturer in her first year in the academy and without any publications explained:
<disp-quote>
<p>I have a lot of research interests but lack the skills to develop it [critical research] as part of my work … I’d like to do some and have collected a small amount of data, but I would need to work with someone who could develop it academically. I’d love to do this so I could learn the process.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Four of the six professors also supported mentoring, professional development and training as aids to facilitating the development of critical researchers: one specifically mentioned the need for leadership from senior faculty. However, only one professor regarded an absence of mentoring as an obstacle. How then did faculty seek to negotiate through their personal orientations these conditions in which it was evident that they largely appreciated the benefits of research, were enthusiastic about doing research and looked for ways of overcoming (sometimes gendered and hierarchical) impediments to becoming active researchers?</p>
<p>Only one respondent directly said they had ‘strong personal motivation’ to undertake research. However, other comments were that research was ‘rewarding and exciting’ and ‘fun and satisfying’. Overwhelmingly (50/51) respondents agreed that there was a point to academic research in journalism. Nevertheless, when personal attitudes to critical research were tested there emerged weak overall support (61%) for research. More than a quarter of respondents were ambivalent (neutral). There was a big difference in attitude between published and unpublished academics: a positive orientation to research fell from 75 per cent to only 26.5 per cent. Twice as many unpublished respondents held negative attitudes towards research, and more than half were undecided. All teaching-focused faculty, whether published or not, held low levels of positivity towards research (22.2%). Conversely, the most positively oriented to research were professors (100%), and published academics who had received research training (84%); who still practised journalism (77%), and were aged 46–55 (87%) and 36–45 (80%).</p>
<sec id="section4-1464884912453285">
<title>Gender</title>
<p>Women in the sample were concentrated in two of the lower levels of appointment (lecturer and senior lecturer – 61.5 per cent and 26.9 per cent respectively) and in the 36–45 year (40.6%) and 46–55 year (43.75%) age groups. More than 80 per cent held teaching and research positions. Sixty per cent had completed training in research: respondents were not asked whether they held the PhD but close to 40 per cent of women volunteered that they did (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464884912453285">Bromley and Neal, 2011</xref>: 66). Most had been in the academy for fewer than 10 years. They were fairly evenly split between those who were still practising journalism (46%) and those who were not. They averaged a prior 17 or 18 years as practitioners. Nearly 70 per cent were publishing. The profile of female faculty which emerged was of experienced, middle-aged journalists with historically high levels of research credentials for the field moving into the academy in first jobs, or having achieved first promotions, in teaching and research appointments. The majority of these elements were positively correlated with higher than average levels of participation in publishing, and participation increased in line with status (from lecturer to senior lecturer and associate professor). Only those who continued to practice journalism and the small minority who held teaching focused appointments) reported poor participation rates.</p>
<p>On the whole, women participated marginally less in research than men (69 per cent as against 71%). In five instances – among senior lecturers, associate professors, those holding teaching and research positions and those aged 46–55 and 56–65 – the rate of participation among women was greater than average. However, publishing productivity among women was above the average for the total sample of 0.84 paper per person per year in only two categories – senior lecturers and associate professors. These macro-level figures veiled an underlying trend when the key cohort of lecturers and senior lecturers holding teaching and research appointments which represented the majority of women were isolated.</p>
<p>Here women were far more under-represented among research active faculty. Whereas 78 per cent of all teaching and research lecturers, and 82 per cent of senior lecturers, were publishing, only 55.5 per cent and 42 per cent, respectively, of women in these cohorts reported being research active (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1464884912453285">Table 2</xref>). The figures fell to 28 per cent and 8 per cent for women aged 36–45, and 11 per cent and 33 per cent for women aged 46–55. These rates of participation were not directly reflected in levels of research productivity, however. The average output of lecturers and senior lecturers was, respectively, 0.73 and 0.72 journal articles per faculty member per year. Female lecturers (0.45) did not match the average, but senior lecturers (0.98) exceeded it by some margin. Women aged 36–45 at both levels of appointment were relatively and absolutely highly productive. Although the average output for lecturers in this age group was below the overall average (0.49), female lecturers exceeded it (0.51). The mean output among senior lecturers of this age was higher than average (0.87) and women at that level of appointment were more than twice as productive (1.87). Productivity fell off among the older age group of senior lecturers (0.77) and especially among women in that category (0.69), but increased among 46–55 year-old lecturers as a whole (1) although not female lecturers (0.54). Female senior lecturers aged 36–45 with teaching and research appointments who were active researchers, while small in relative numbers, proved to be highly productive. On the other hand, senior lecturers in the older age group (46–55) and lecturers in both of these age cohorts with the same profile, while they were between more than twice and six times as likely to be active researchers, published far less.</p>

<p>Given that these women broadly shared demographic characteristics, career status and types of appointment, and acquisition of human capital, alternative explanations for these differences were explored. Continuing to practice journalism and length of time spent in the academy were both correlated with participation (whether a faculty member had published at all) but impacted less on productivity (how much they published once they had made the transition) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464884912453285">Bromley and Neal, 2011</xref>: 62, 65). Therefore, it seemed possible that personal attitudes towards research may have held the key to why some journalism faculty appeared to embrace research – and the academization of journalism – more enthusiastically than others.</p>
<p>A positive orientation to research was strongly associated with holding a faculty position with a formal requirement to undertake research and being research active (79 per cent – compared to 17 per cent for unpublished teaching focused faculty). There was no detectable gender difference in these views. Positive attitudes to research tracked the status, age and levels of research participation – higher among senior lecturers and 46–55 year-olds than among lecturers and 36–45 year-olds. Negative views – and, by logical extension, neutral ones, too – were correspondingly aligned (the exception being unpublished senior lecturers of whom 50 per cent displayed a negative attitude towards research which we have conjectured over-represented the opinions of a group of men with low levels of research output [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464884912453285">Bromley and Neal, 2011</xref>: 65]). The situation among unpublished faculty was significantly different. A majority (53.5%) held ambivalent (neutral) views about research. The figure was higher among women (62.5%), lecturers (60%), 36–45 year-olds (57%), 46–55 year-olds (60%), and even those who reported having completed research training (56%). However, negative views conformed less to this pattern. Women (nil) and lecturers (10%) fell below the overall mean (13%); 36–45 year-olds marginally above (14%). Only the 46–55 age group (20%) and those who said they had received research training (22%) reported much higher than average negative attitudes. (Senior lecturers were again an exception as explained above.)</p>
<p>Female faculty aged between 36 and 55 with teaching and research appointments as lecturers or senior lecturers, who comprised between three-quarters and 80 per cent of all the women in our survey sample, reported relatively high levels of ambivalence – but either no, or not notably, negative attitudes – to research. That pattern was particularly evident among those who had not published in peer-reviewed journals in the field (although the data were somewhat skewed by negative responses from unpublished senior lecturers). Having completed research training did not necessarily ameliorate this, and continuing to practise journalism seemed to act as a distraction. This suggested that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1464884912453285">Harcup (2011a</xref>: 47) was correct in arguing that journalists found making the transition from practice to the academy daunting, and they hesitated before forsaking their earlier career and enthusiastically embracing critical research as an academic activity. However, there was no evidence that they were particularly hostile to the idea. These female lecturers and senior lecturers represented not only almost a half of the sample population, but also about 40 per cent of all journalism academics in Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884912453285">Bromley, forthcoming</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The academization of journalism is reliant on the development of the field founded in scholarship as demonstrated through the publication of research in peer-reviewed specialist journals. Given the profile of journalism faculty, this means inducting journalism practitioners into a culture of critical research. In Australia at least, this cohort of neophytes is predominantly comprised of middle-aged women. Respondents in this group reported that this process was only partially completed. For their part, they were mostly open to the idea of becoming critical researchers but were inclined to proceed cautiously, especially in their first academic appointments, and without always completely severing their ties to practice. Establishing a research career appeared to be a process of at least three distinctive steps. First, faculty had to be favourably disposed to undertaking critical research, although this did not appear to lead automatically to actually producing any research output. Second, a first article had to be written, submitted and accepted. Third, given that more than 60 per cent of communication scholars historically have not gone on to publish anything else, research productivity had to be sustained through further, regular publishing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1464884912453285">Hickson et al., 1989</xref>: 233–235). Although no questions were asked directly about this, the steps did not always appear to be seamlessly connected. There was strong evidence to suggest that a generally positive orientation to research was not routinely capitalized on, and somewhat weaker evidence that a number of faculty started to publish, and then stopped or at least slowed down.</p>
<p>Women and lecturers (among respondents these groups largely overlapped) aged between 36 and 55, who had not yet begun publishing, showed high levels of ambivalence in their attitudes to research. This more than offset any negative attitudes they held. This probably echoed debates within the field about the value of research, which have been exacerbated by a shift in the focus of funding from teaching to research in the Australian higher education sector with a lobby within journalism pressing the case for practice-based, as opposed to critical, research, which has divided the academy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1464884912453285">Posetti, 2011</xref>). At another level, it may also have reflected an absence of qualified senior scholars providing mentoring to less experienced colleagues, a factor recognized in the formation of a Council of Journalism Professors in 2010 intended to provide leadership in the field around issues raised by the ERA research audit.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1464884912453285">6</xref></sup> Practitioners entering the academy, it appeared, were reserving judgment as an alternative to following the tradition of outright dismissal of critical research.</p>
<p>The halting progress of academization is not confined to Australia, of course (for example, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1464884912453285">Pontes and Silva, 2010</xref>: 171). Insofar as, by transferring into the academy the orientations of practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1464884912453285">Hartley, 2000</xref>: 39–40), journalism has failed to academize as comprehensively or as rapidly as other, comparable (professional) fields, it would appear to be essential – and urgent, in the face of the trend to auditing – that the renewal of its faculty through the recruitment of journalists should lead to greater levels of participation and productivity in research. This survey suggests that this cohort (at least in Australia) is now mainly female, and that these experienced, middle-aged practitioners have yet to be convinced of the value of academization, or of their role in it, but they appeared not (yet) to have adopted the orthodoxy of implacable opposition to scholarly inquiry. Given that the academization of journalism stalled when the faculty were all (or nearly all) men, the change in gender composition in the academy may provide, contrary to historical, but more in line with contemporary, evidence, a renewed impetus to the project. Lastly, and perhaps most crucially, we need to know more about this emerging cohort of women.</p>
