<abstract>
<p>This article analyzes the evolution of human resource management practices in Korea as a self-fulfilling process at a global level. Korean human resource management practices have experienced two paradigm shifts, in 1987 and 1997, going from a seniority-based, paternalistic employment relationship to a performance-based, market-like relationship. These revolutionary changes in human resource management practices occurred when Korean society underwent major social upheavals, which created the conditions for accepting ‘new’ norms and practices. The rapid diffusion of American-style management ideologies and practices to Korean firms can be explained by a self-fulfilling diffusion process taking place through international organizations and local institutions. This study makes a contribution to the literature of organizational learning by conceptualizing the global management diffusion process as a learning process. Further implications are discussed in the line of the change of management discourse.</p>

<p>According to self-fulfilling prophecy, what is said or believed comes true not because it is true, but because people expect it to come true (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1350507611427827">Merton, 1948</xref>). Hence, even a false conception will come true by creating the conditions that cause it to be true (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1350507611427827">Ferraro F, Pfeffer J and Sutton RI, 2005</xref>). The self-fulfilling process prevails at various levels. The self-fulfilling prophecy can be applied at the level of the individual, the organization, or society itself. An example at the individual level is examination neurosis. The initially erroneous anxiety can be converted into an entirely justified fear, which eventually results in a poor examination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1350507611427827">Merton, 1948</xref>). Self-fulfilling prophecy is also observed in the management field. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1350507611427827">Ghoshal and Moran (1996)</xref> argued that self-fulfilling prophecy occurs in transaction cost theory. According to them, managers following transaction cost economics tend to focus on formal control mechanisms to reduce the opportunistic behaviors of employees; these mechanisms, however, only generate more opportunistic behaviors using greater guile. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1350507611427827">Ferraro et al. (2005)</xref> argued that theories themselves can become self-fulfilling. Management theories influenced by economic perspectives create institutional arrangements and management practices within organizations that eventually impose the predicted organizational behaviors on people. For example, social norms such as self-interest and internal competition among organizational members require people in the organization to exhibit behaviors aligned with those norms.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of a self-fulfilling process can appear in more macro settings as well. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1350507611427827">Wood (1972)</xref>, a particular concept of human nature determines the choice of macro societal systems, which in turn generates the behaviors based on the original concept of human nature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1350507611427827">Wood (1972</xref>: 3) argued that:
<disp-quote>
<p>there is a common tendency to justify political, social, or economic systems in terms of their supposed conformity to human nature. … Moreover, social and political systems tend to institutionalize certain conceptions of man by favoring, rewarding, or placing a premium on certain exemplar human types. Indeed, images of man can be self-fulfilling prophecies.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The present analysis goes beyond the individual, organizational, and societal levels to show that the diffusion of neoliberalism has become a self-fulfilling process at the global level. In doing so, we use the evolution of human resource management (HRM) in Korea as a case for our analysis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1350507611427827">Ferraro et al. (2005</xref>: 12) argued that ‘“American-style” philosophies and systems have spread to countries that traditionally have emphasized cooperation and seniority-based rewards’. The evolution of Korean HRM is a good example. We have observed that, since the mid-1990s, many big Korean corporations have changed their employment relationships from a paternalistic model to a market-like model. Seniority has been replaced by performance as the main basis for pay. Individual performance-based pay systems have been heavily adopted, and employment security has been severely eroded. Many firms have also taken a dual approach by employing both top talent and contingent workers at the same time. Many firms have now started to provide special treatment for top talent beyond the normal compensation scheme.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to investigate the evolution of Korean HRM through the lens of the management diffusion process using the theory of self-fulfilling prophecy. This article has a few unique features that make contributions to the literature on HRM, institutional theory, and organizational learning. First of all, we look into how the self-fulfilling process occurs at a global level. As discussed above, previous literature on the self-fulfilling prophecy mostly discussed it at individual, organizational, and societal levels. This article expands the scope of application of the theory to a global level.</p>
<p>Second, we identify the institutional theory of diffusion as a phenomenon of the self-fulfilling process in the case of the evolution of Korean HRM. Since the global diffusion of management paradigms and the evolution of Korean HRM inevitably involve management ideologies and rhetoric, we argue that neoliberalist ideology was diffused through the self-fulfilling process. We discuss further, in the discussion section, the change of management ideologies along the line of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350507611427827">Barley and Kunda’s (1992)</xref> argument on the rational and normative ideologies in managerial discourse. Finally, in addition to the second point, we also perceive the institutional theory of diffusion as organizational learning. More specifically, we recognize that self-fulfilling prophecy and the institutional theory of diffusion underpin the problem of organizational learning. In sum, these features together mean that this article makes a contribution to the study of organizational learning at an institutional and global level.</p>
<p>Why is the evolution of Korean HRM so relevant and interesting? First, Korea experienced rapid economic development and institution of a political democracy simultaneously. Given its limited natural resources, Korea’s economic growth has been attributed to its talented and committed human resources as a main driving force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1350507611427827">Kim, 1997</xref>). The national income per capita also rose from US$87 in 1962 to US$11,735 in 1995, and then to US$20,759 in 2010. Although during the post-crisis period the growth rate decreased, the economy quickly regained its footing to continue growing.</p>
<p>Second, in the course of its economic development, Korea and its people have encountered not only structural changes in the economy, but also a conflict between traditional Korean values and certain Western values. Although Korea has been influenced by Japan, especially in terms of technology, Korean firms have been greatly Americanized. Korea also experienced the 1997 financial crisis, which led to the involvement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the adoption of neoliberal traditions.</p>
<p>Finally, Korean HRM has twice experienced a paradigm shift in the last 25 years. Thus, the evolution of Korean HRM provides a unique context for the analysis of the present framework. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1350507611427827">Guler et al. (2002</xref>: 207) pointed out: ‘Organizational practices tend to diffuse unevenly throughout the world’ because national institutional factors play a critical role in the global diffusion processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1350507611427827">Gooderham et al., 1999</xref>). In the case of Korea, national institutional factors together helped lead to the rapid diffusion of a market-like HRM model after the 1997 financial crisis.</p>
<p>After presenting the framework of self-fulfilling processes, we briefly explain the global diffusion of management ideologies and practices in terms of which elements are diffused and by whom. Then we sketch the evolution of HRM practices in Korea for two different periods (1987–1997 and 1997–present), followed by an analysis of the self-fulfilling process of Korean HRM changes. Finally, we present our discussion and implications of the study.</p>
<sec id="section1-1350507611427827">
<title>The framework of self-fulfilling processes</title>
<p>As mentioned before, self-fulfilling processes are formed when what is commonly said or generally believed comes true because people expect it to come true (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1350507611427827">Merton, 1948</xref>). According to this definition, the starting point of the process is generally accepted ideologies and social norms regarding such things as individual destiny, people’s behavior, theories, institutional design, or organizational arrangements. The generally accepted ideologies and norms perhaps originate from leaders, theorists, philosophers, or even the general public of a particular era. Then, people generate certain expectations, which eventually lead to the expectations becoming reality. At the global level, the neoliberal and market-oriented approach has generally gained acceptance. Before we elaborate further on the self-fulfilling process at the global level, it is necessary to clarify the meanings and usages of neoliberalism and globalization.</p>
<p>The concept of neoliberalism may be analyzed at various levels. We use the term as an ideological stance that defines the principles, policies, and practices of systems based on liberal tradition, especially those based on negative liberty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350507611427827">Berlin and Hardy, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1350507611427827">Harvey, 2005</xref>). Although neoliberalism emphasizes liberty, the universal value, it is usually used with a limited meaning in economics: moving control of the economy away from government to the private sector for free market and free trade. In this article, we generally use it to refer to the nature of public and private policies. Put differently, different ideological stances eventually lead to different strategic choices of systems at various levels of abstraction (i.e. principle, policy, and practice). For example, the neoliberalist approach at the firm level puts priority on market-like employment, wide pay differential, the war for talent, weeding out programs, and so on.</p>
<p>We also need to clarify the concept and usage of globalization because the contents, direction, and timing of global learning are rather varied. Although we argued that ‘American-style’ HRM practices have been transferred to Korea since 1997, globalization tendencies can occur in the reverse direction. Specifically, Eastern practices have been introduced into Western companies. For example, the ideas of Lean Production were popularly introduced to the Western world through the well-known work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1350507611427827">Womack et al. (1990)</xref> of MIT. In addition, Western companies also emulated Japanese management practices such as quality circles and just-in-time production and supply in the 1980s and early 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1350507611427827">Elger and Smith, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1350507611427827">Oliver and Wilkinson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1350507611427827">Ouchi, 1981</xref>). In addition, the globalization movement is not unidirectional; rather, it is bidirectional or multidirectional with dynamic interactions. For example, W Edwards Deming, an American, originally developed a management technique, quality control, which became quality circles in Japan. Total quality management (TQM), a management technique that received much attention from American companies, is grounded in the aforementioned techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1350507611427827">Pfeffer, 2001</xref>). This bilateral adaptation of management practices is well expressed by the terms the ‘Americanization’ of Japan and the ‘Japanization’ of America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1350507611427827">Taira, 1990</xref>). However, we just focus on the transfer of American-style policies and practices to Korea since the 1997 financial crisis. Hence, globalization in this article is time and country specific.</p>
<p>Returning to the discussion of the self-fulfilling processes, ideological stance has influenced Korean firms to adopt market-like organizational arrangements through various routes. First, the generally accepted neoliberal approach has directly influenced local firms to adopt market-like organizational arrangements. Second, international organizations such as the IMF, the teachers of norms, strongly recommended that local institutions (e.g. local governments) establish policies and legal frameworks with neoliberal direction. Eventually, local institutions influenced local firms to adopt market-like organizational arrangements. Finally, the benchmarking activities of local firms have been another route for the adoption of market-like employment relationships. Generally accepted ideologies and social norms first influence global firms. Then local firms of other countries (e.g. Korea) benchmark global best practices.</p>
<p>During these transfer processes, educational institutions (i.e. business schools) and global consulting firms facilitate the learning processes. Through educational institutions, certain ideological worldviews and theories are transferred to industry. Furthermore, global consulting firms translate ideologies and theories into practices and transplant those practices into the recipient country’s firms. Many newly diffused management techniques such as business process reengineering (BPR), TQM, balanced scorecard (BSC), and 6-sigma have been transferred through consulting firms. These three routes, respectively, roughly correspond to the institutional isomorphism: normative, coercive, and mimetic isomorphism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350507611427827">DiMaggio and Powell, 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>Crisis also becomes a facilitator for the transfer processes. In particular, crisis creates conditions that make it easier for both local governments and local firms to accept generally accepted ideologies and social norms as well as globally recognized best practices. At the local government level, crisis facilitates the influence process of generally accepted ideologies and social norms on local governments as well as that of international organizations on local governments. At the local firm level, crisis accelerates the influence process of generally accepted ideologies and social norms on local firms as well as that of global firms on local firms. The facilitating roles of crisis include accelerating the speed of diffusion and lowering the resistance threshold of the recipients. Hence, crisis sets up certain social conditions that allow new ideologies, norms, and management practices to perpetuate.</p>
<p>After certain management practices are transferred to another country (i.e. Korea in this article), self-fulfilling processes at the global level operate when people observe that predicted behaviors, which are expected from generally accepted ideologies and social norms and more closely from national institutional designs, have come to more closely correspond to actual behaviors. Then the feedback loop is formed so that market-like organizational arrangements become more common; and at the same time, generally accepted ideologies and social norms gain more acceptance. Now, original conceptions about the nature and ways of managing firms can become self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p>Locally, another feedback loop can be formed at the micro level. Individual members’ actual behavior does not automatically correspond to predicted behavior. Since the American style of market-oriented HRM policies and practices is different from the traditional Korean approach, local actors (e.g. unions and individual members) demonstrated some forms of resistance at the earlier stages. Korean management took advantage of the financial crisis to transform their HRM systems by adopting market-like organizational arrangements such as the individual performance-based HRM approach. In the period of crisis, the strength of resistance became weak. Furthermore, Korean management effectively had involvement in the change management by unfreezing the status quo and refreezing the new approach. Eventually, predicted behaviors and actually observed behaviors were corresponding with each other more closely, and market-like organizational arrangements gained legitimacy among local actors and were becoming more common through rapid diffusion processes. All these processes are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350507611427827">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<sec id="section3-1350507611427827">
<title>Elements that are globally diffused</title>
<p>The self-fulfilling process occurs from diverse aspects. When a certain management style is undergoing global diffusion, the contents that diffuse include ideologies and social norms, languages and assumptions, and institutional design and management practices (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1350507611427827">Ferraro et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section4-1350507611427827">
<title>Ideologies and social norms</title>
<p>At the ideological level, the neoliberal and market-oriented approach has been gaining power for about the last two decades, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350507611427827">Drori et al. (2006</xref>: 223–224) have discussed: ‘Although alternative models of administrative culture, most notably the Japanese and the communist modes, had some legitimacy in the 1980s, currently the neoliberal Western economic model reigns’.</p>
<p>Hence ‘the rules of the economic game’ have been redefined with a more neoliberal flavor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1350507611427827">Djelic and Quack, 2003</xref>). In this regard, among other social science theories, economic theory has dominated not only in the academic arena but also in political and management realities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1350507611427827">Ferraro et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, we discuss how this economic model has rapidly diffused worldwide.</p>
<p>Some social norms that were once viewed negatively and were quite unfamiliar to many people and firms have come to be interpreted positively and to have gained legitimacy as globally acceptable social norms. These norms include competition among people or among business units within a firm, wide pay differentials based not on seniority but on performance, and dismissal of employees. Once these norms gain legitimacy, that legitimacy further facilitates the conformity of additional firms to them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1350507611427827">
<title>Languages and assumptions</title>
<p>Two generic terms currently prevailing in global business are ‘global standards’ and ‘best practices’. The canon of global standards strongly suggests that organizations and countries that do not follow the standards are a group far below par who are waiting to come up to those standards. In a study of national administrative rationalization, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350507611427827">Drori et al. (2006</xref>: 222) concluded that:
<disp-quote>
<p>[w]ith this mindset deeply ingrained in global business and financial culture and with the anticipation that such orderly conduct will be signaling low risk to foreign investors, countries worldwide are scrambling to improve practices. In doing so, they are standardizing their activities along the parameters set by the implied global model of proper governance.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>‘Best practices’ is another generic term popularly used in the business world, although ‘best’ for one firm is not necessarily also best for another. The problem lies not so much in the term itself as in what people think constitutes best practices. Examples of best practices include individual performance-based pay, flexibility and downsizing, war for talent, and global competition.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1350507611427827">Gill and Whittle (1993)</xref> explained the life cycle of a speculative panacea in terms of the stages of birth, adolescence, maturity, and decline. In the maturity stage, the panacea is routinized, bureaucratized, and institutionalized by consultants and internal staff. In this stage, the languages—or terms such as ‘growth’ and ‘effectiveness’ that have mythical qualities—‘are condensation symbols collapsing a managerial world view into a single word’ (p. 290).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1350507611427827">
<title>Institutional design and management practices</title>
<p>Theories can become self-fulfilling globally through international institutions, especially when those institutions reflect the very conceptions of the institution builders. Ideological worldviews affect the development of social theories, which eventually play a role in designing institutional arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1350507611427827">Etzioni, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1350507611427827">Ferraro et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1350507611427827">Miller, 1999</xref>). One route of global diffusion starts from international organizations and proceeds through each country’s government to the recipient country’s firms. This route proceeds in a two-stage process. First, a certain ideological worldview is incorporated into the institutional design of international organizations. Second, these organizations influence national institutional designs such as labor laws and policies. These institutional designs eventually are translated into management practices.</p>

<title>Facilitators of the global diffusion of management ideologies and practices</title>
<sec id="section8-1350507611427827">
<title>International organizations: Teachers of norms</title>
<p>In a global era, international institutions such as the World Bank, the IMF, and Transparency International play the role of ‘teachers of norms’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1350507611427827">Finnemore, 1993</xref>). International organizations hence play a more active role in shaping new norms because ‘international organizations, once established, produce their own new convergent expectations and norms’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1350507611427827">Finnemore, 1993</xref>: 594).</p>
<p>These days, it is unthinkable that a country or organization would position itself outside a web of international organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1350507611427827">Boli and Thomas, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350507611427827">Drori et al., 2006</xref>). International organizations employ several different strategies to influence national operations and management practices, such as coercion, naming and shaming, and professional pressures strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350507611427827">Drori et al., 2006</xref>). Using one or more strategies, international organizations not only suggest rules and guidelines, but may also evaluate countries to monitor whether they are following the organization’s suggestions. Those countries and corporations that follow these guidelines become winners of the game and are accordingly rewarded. For example, compliance with ISO regulations requires companies to change their work processes. When they successfully meet the standards, they acquire the accreditation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1350507611427827">Mendel, 2006</xref>). In the education system, the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) may play a similar role in management education, although it has recently begun reflecting the more unique needs of each institution and the educational situations of each country (see AACSB International, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.aacsb.edu">www.aacsb.edu</ext-link>). In addition, business schools and MBA programs have also expanded globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1350507611427827">Moon and Wotipka, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1350507611427827">
<title>Local institutions: Mediators of the diffusion</title>
<p>Government agencies play a critical role in the diffusion process, especially during crises. These agencies become involved in the process in several ways. First, the national government can facilitate the global diffusion of management ideologies and practices by adopting these ideas when enacting and amending legislation. This mechanism exerts a coercive force upon further diffusion to the private sector. Second, government agencies can also apply the new ideologies and practices to the public sector, which acts as a signal to the private sector to follow suit. Finally, the national government can also facilitate the diffusion by requiring its suppliers or contractors to hold certain certifications as quality assurance standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1350507611427827">Guler et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Other carriers of global diffusion include (1) business schools, the ‘academic clergy’, and their management training programs at the ideologies and theories level; (2) consulting firms that translate management theories into organizational practices; and (3) professional associations and their international linkages at the practice level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1350507611427827">Meyer, 2002</xref>). Consulting firms often sell commodified or packaged approaches to attract clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1350507611427827">Ernst and Kieser, 2002</xref>). When they acquire a well-known corporation as their client, their approach suddenly gains legitimacy and rapidly diffuses into other major companies, resulting in self-generating legitimacy. The problem here is that no easy way exists to evaluate both the approach and the consultants’ performance. In the next stage, consulting firms generate the next round by ‘creating demand by defining new problem areas that are in need of expertise and by creating management fashions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1350507611427827">Ernst and Kieser, 2002</xref>: 57).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1350507611427827">
<title>Local firms: Learners of norms</title>
<p>Beyond the role of international organizations, the self-fulfilling process is reinforced through the benchmarking processes of multinational corporations. Multinational corporations have been eagerly involved in benchmarking. They benchmark ‘best practices’, although it is not clear what is ‘best’ for whom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1350507611427827">Marchington and Grugulis, 2000</xref>). In many cases, benchmarking is a rather ritualistic and mindless process ‘to conform to the normative definition of “good” management’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1350507611427827">Pfeffer, 1998</xref>: 149). To become a global player, a nation-state or a multinational corporation should join international organizations and accept the norms they generate. Benchmarking leading companies headquartered in economically advanced countries has special meaning for companies in emerging economies. It is not just a rationalization process, but a symbolic activity showing that the company is a member joined to a global club by conforming to globally sanctioned progressive techniques.</p>

<title>When and to what extent Korean HRM practices shifted toward a market-type model</title>
<p>Scholars generally agree that the years 1987 and 1997 became milestones for social transformation in Korea after 1962 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350507611427827">Bognanno, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1350507611427827">Rowley et al., 2001</xref>). In 1987, the ruling party’s presidential candidate who was then elected president, Roh Tae-woo, announced the Democracy Declaration, which marked the beginning of the end of the 25-year-long military reign. The year 1997, which witnessed a financial crisis, was the other historical year for social change in Korea. These two years brought turmoil and crises that affected almost every aspect of society and prompted institutional changes, especially in employment management. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350507611427827">Baron et al. (1986</xref>: 378) observed the role of crises in institutional change in the US as follows: ‘In periods of crises, such as wars, stable institutions are susceptible to revolutionary change. In a sense, crises create some “liabilities of newness,” encouraging managers to catch up with modern organizing techniques and reorient their organizations.’</p>
<p>Likewise, Korean HRM systems experienced two revolutionary changes through the ‘liabilities of newness’ created by two periods of social unrest. Hence, these two social upheavals created conditions that enhanced the malleability of traditional cultures and norms, making it easier for people to accept different ideologies and practices previously unfamiliar to them. These newly created social conditions perpetuated new norms and practices in Korean society.</p>
<p>During the pre-1987 period, the seniority-based, paternalistic HRM model was established, and the basic ideology of Korean business was neo-mercantilism. Since markets were not well established, the authoritarian government took a very active role, becoming a ‘visible hand’ for economic development. Culturally, Confucian traditions prevailed. Confucianism suggests several ethical codes that govern human relations and worker behavior, such as a strong work ethic and emphasis on learning. Confucian tradition is also the basis of such corporate cultures as harmony, paternalism, hierarchical orientation, and collectivism; these are also closely related to HRM policies such as long-term attachment, the seniority-based approach, and job grade by cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1350507611427827">Koch et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1350507611427827">Moore and IsHak, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1350507611427827">Rowley and Bae, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>This initial HRM model worked well in Korea until the mid-1980s. Korean firms first pursued competitiveness based on imitation and manufacturing capability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1350507611427827">Kim, 1997</xref>). Therefore, it was enough to have such core values as cooperation, harmony, seniority, and diligence. But when Korean firms faced competition from foreign firms, the existing HRM model showed some limitations. The first challenge to the seniority-based, paternalistic model stemmed from its authoritarian orientation. This approach tends to focus on the total organization at the expense of the individuality or the authentic commitment of the members. The second challenge to the paternalistic model resided in its inability to adapt to external environments. Unlike cost-based competition, the differentiation strategy that many companies tried to follow in the late 1980s required different types of competencies and behaviors. Now we describe the evolution of Korean HRM in terms of employment relationships, competence management, employment security, and incentive intensity for the following two periods (1987–1997 and post-1997).</p>
<sec id="section12-1350507611427827">
<title>Performance-based balanced HRM, 1987–1997</title>
<p>This period was characterized by political democratization. The constitution was amended to adopt a direct presidential election system and a five-year single-term system for president. This democratic progress led Korean society to experiment with pluralism after 1987 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1350507611427827">Park, 1993</xref>). One critical issue of the economic environment was industrial restructuring. In the late 1980s, the journal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1350507611427827">World Development (1988)</xref> published a special issue focusing on industrial restructuring in Korea. The country also experienced severe labor turmoil after the Democracy Declaration of 1987. There were 3749 union strikes in 1987, more than 13 times the number of the previous year and greater than the accumulated number of all strikes of previous years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1350507611427827">Kim and Bae, 2004</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1350507611427827">Table 1</xref>). The strong labor movement, together with nationwide economic growth, led to an increase in the real wages of workers from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1350507611427827">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>The traditional HRM systems, which once had functioned well, were now perceived as inefficient and rigid. Therefore, many firms sought more effective HRM practices. In the early 1990s many Korean firms experimented with various completely new practices under the name of the ‘New HRM System’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350507611427827">Bae, 1997</xref>). Within a short period a number of companies had adopted these new practices. A 1995 survey of 283 companies with over 50 employees, conducted by the Korea Employers’ Federation, showed that about 20% of the sample firms had introduced new HRM practices, and about 9% were considering adopting them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350507611427827">Ahn, 1996</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section13-1350507611427827">
<title>Employment relationships</title>
<p>Since real wages were increasing and employment was generally secure, employers regarded this as an imbalanced relationship. This perception of over-inducement to contributions led firms to adopt a more balanced approach by linking pay to performance. In addition, firms reduced some benefits such as allowances designed to help employees in need. Therefore, during this period, firms tried to make HRM systems more efficient and rational, while the properties of economic exchange were added.</p>

<sec id="section14-1350507611427827">
<title>Employee competence management<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1350507611427827">1</xref></sup></title>
<p>The newly adopted HRM practices were directed toward competence acquisition and development. For selective staffing, firms introduced internships (18.2%), blind interviews (9.8%), and recruitment specialists (30.2%). After these staffing efforts, firms also provided employees with career development plans (18.8%) and promotion by selection (i.e. fast-track promotion) (33.8%), instead of going up the ladder based on tenure. Big corporations also provided overseas training programs. In addition, firms sent qualified employees to foreign universities for re-education. In Samsung, the region expert program was adopted in 1990, through which junior employees spent a year in other countries with no obligation other than obtaining language skills and making cultural acquaintances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350507611427827">Bae, 1997</xref>). Until 2004, Samsung sent about 2800 employees to around 700 cities in approximately 60 countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1350507611427827">Samsung, 2005</xref>). Since this cost roughly US$100,000 per person, Samsung spent about US$300m.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1350507611427827">
<title>Employment security</title>
<p>During this period, employment security did not erode much. The previous Korean <italic>Labor Standard Act</italic> did not allow the termination of employees without just cause. However, promotion was carefully screened. Those who could not be promoted within a certain period were psychologically pressed to leave. About 17% of 283 companies, in the aforementioned Korea Employers’ Federation survey, responded that they had an early retirement policy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1350507611427827">
<title>Incentive intensity</title>
<p>Two policy directions with regard to performance management involved enhancing fairness and objectivity in performance evaluations, and strongly linking performance and ability to compensation. For the first policy direction, firms used multi-rater evaluations, absolute appraisals, and feedback processes. For the second policy direction, firms introduced incentive systems based on individual or group performance rather than fixed and regular bonuses, and merit pay practices. This marked the beginning of the shift toward ability- and performance-based approaches instead of a seniority-based approach. As of 1995, a survey of 283 firms showed that about 28% had adopted group-performance-based incentives and about 15% individual-performance-based incentives. However, only 7.2% responded they had adopted a merit pay system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350507611427827">Ahn, 1996</xref>). Hence, basic salaries were not yet strongly linked to performance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1350507611427827">
<title>Challenges</title>
<p>The changes in the HRM of this period had some legitimacy in the sense that they pursued rationalization to gain greater productivity and competitiveness by enhancing people’s competence and linking some performance to pay. However, firms lacked a clear direction for the changes and their long-term effects. Many firms adopted ‘new HRM practices “opportunistically rather than strategically” simply because other firms [had] adopted them, without evaluating their own goals, strategies, or capabilities, as institutional theory would suggest’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1350507611427827">Kim and Bae, 2004</xref>: 160). Korean firms turned away from their earlier over-investment, characterized by high employment security and employee development but weak requirements for employee contributions, towards a more balanced employment relationship with contributions on a par with inducements (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1350507611427827">Tsui et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section18-1350507611427827">
<title>Toward a flexibility-based market HRM, 1997–present</title>
<p>The 1997 financial crisis tremendously affected how people and businesses were managed. Since the Korean Government needed an IMF bailout program, the Government and corporations had to pay careful attention to IMF recommendations. Economically, overcoming the financial crisis and restructuring corporations were immediate tasks. The new regime, although it leaned left, emphasized a market economy. Korean employers and management took advantage of the 1997 financial crisis to legitimize their transformation efforts toward more flexible labor markets and performance-based incentives. Neoliberalism and globalization appeared to be the keys to survival.</p>
<sec id="section19-1350507611427827">
<title>Employment relationships</title>
<p>Since the 1997 financial crisis, many firms have lost trust in the relationship between the organization and its people. Few newly employed people regard their current jobs as permanent, while at the same time, few managers expect new employees to have a long-term relationship. Employment contracts tend to be a form of economic exchange and are becoming transactional. Terms of employment are becoming shorter. For example, according to a survey by the recruiting firm Jobkorea of 855 firms in Korea, about 30.1% of newly employed people left within one year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350507611427827"><italic>The Chosun Ilbo</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Another survey, jointly conducted in 2002 by <italic>Korea Joongang Daily</italic> and the Hyundai Research Institute targeting 436 managers and executives of the 100 largest companies in Korea on people’s perception about their jobs, showed that 79.1% of the respondents answered that their sense of a ‘life-time job’ disappeared after the 1997 financial crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1350507611427827">Kim, 2010</xref>). From the same survey, to the question about whether one intended to leave one’s job within the next five years, 45.4% said ‘yes’, while only 12.8% answered ‘no’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1350507611427827">
<title>Employee competence management</title>
<p>Since the financial crisis, Korean firms have engaged in a war for talent and made greater effort to retain those people hired. Big corporations in Korea have always spent huge sums of money to attract the best people. But since the financial crisis, firms have been recruiting the best people even more aggressively. The organizations that have dashed into this war for talent include major business groups such as Samsung, LG Electronics, Hyundai Motor, SK, Hanwha, Doosan, and Kumho. For example, Lee Kun-hee the chairperson of Samsung declared that attracting and developing top talent would account for about 40% of the performance evaluations of the CEOs of Samsung-affiliated companies.</p>
<p>Retention strategies have also become a critical task for the firms. The term ‘retention’ itself was quite foreign to Korean firms before the financial crisis because most employees remained in the same companies they had first entered. After the crisis, firms realized their people could leave for other companies. People began to leave their organizations for two reasons. One was a pull factor from new start-ups, which mushroomed in the late 1990s. New start-ups scouted for experienced engineers from big corporations using strong incentives. The other reason was a push factor, which came from the big corporations themselves. They created the conditions for employee turnovers by adopting earlier retirement programs and downsizing measures. But contrary to their intentions, those employees for whom the retention programs were established left first as soon as they found opportunities outside.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1350507611427827">
<title>Employment security</title>
<p>Korea maintained a generally high level of employment security until the mid-1990s. This tradition was first attacked by the clause on ‘layoffs upon business dissolution’ introduced in the <italic>Labor Standard Law</italic> of 1996. This law was amended to be more lenient in 1997 because of a general strike and was postponed for two years. However, the IMF bailout program required the policy be changed toward a numerically more flexible labor market. This was the beginning of the end of the employment security policy in Korea.</p>
<p>The change in labor law and bad economic conditions provided employers with an excellent opportunity to dismiss their employees, and they took advantage of it. One survey of 286 companies in both 1996 and 1998 showed that, while only two companies had dismissed employees in 1996, that number had increased to 53 in 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1350507611427827">Park and Ahn, 1999</xref>). The other survey of 300 firms conducted by the Korea Labor Institute in 1997 and 1998 also showed that, while 19.7% had adjusted the number of workers through such methods as dismissal, voluntary early retirement, and transfer to affiliated companies in 1997, that percentage increased to 43.7% after the crisis, more than doubling within a year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350507611427827">Choi and Lee, 1998</xref>). Another survey of 168 listed companies in both 1998 and 2002 (using the same companies) showed that the percentage of companies that had downsized within the previous three years was 66.1% in 1998 and 45.8% in 2002 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1350507611427827">Yu and Park, 2007</xref>). Since Korea experienced a financial crisis during the period 1997–8, the percentage from 1998 is striking, given few companies conducted workforce adjustment before the crisis. Another surprising thing is that the percentage of workforce adjustment in 2002 was still high, implying that this has become a continuing measure rather than just a temporary fix.</p>
<p>Major companies such as Samsung Electronics Company (SEC) and Hyundai Motor Company pursued employment flexibility. For example, before 1997, SEC had about 60,000 employees. Under the post-crisis restructuring plans, the workforce was reduced to 40,000, a cut of about one-third, though SEC managed this process with less overt conflict and attention than did Hyundai (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1350507611427827">Kim and Bae, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Another feature of employment during the post-crisis period has been a variety of employment contracts. In particular, the numbers of irregular workers (both temporary workers and day laborers) have dramatically increased. This is an employment strategy for the lower-end workforce. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1350507611427827">Table 2</xref> shows the trends in the workforce for various types of employment. One interesting observation is that the percentage of irregular workers is over 50% for 1999 through 2002. After the financial crisis, the number of day laborers was especially increased.</p>

<title>Incentive intensity</title>
<p>As a basis of pay, performance instead of seniority has gained in significance. According to a 1998 survey of 278 firms, the ratio of firms using performance as the basis of pay was 33.1%, with little variation by sector or size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1350507611427827">Park and Ahn, 1999</xref>). In addition, although 24.5% of the sample firms basically had seniority-based systems, they also used performance in a supplementary manner. These firms either linked their basic salary to performance in part, or used performance as a basis for incentive.</p>
<p>The Korea Ministry of Employment and Labor has also conducted an annual pay survey to find out facts about various pay-related dimensions, targeting firms with 100 employees or more. One item from the survey concerns the adoption of the performance-based annual pay system vis-à-vis the traditional seniority-based pay step system. While only 1.6% of companies used the performance-based pay system in 1996, its usage increased to 57.4% in 2008 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1350507611427827">Table 3</xref>). The increase in the adoption rate reflects the fact that many Korean firms have shifted their HRM systems toward a more performance-based approach.</p>

<p>At SEC, total compensation consists of basic salary, allowances, and performance-based incentives (i.e. productivity incentives and profit sharing). Profit sharing is based on the performance of the business unit, with levels allowed up to 50% of annual salary. Hence, profit sharing has led to deteriorating cooperation and resource sharing among business units.</p>

<title>Challenges</title>
<p>The changes in HRM practices during the post-crisis period have been directed toward a market-like employment relationship, with more emphasis on performance and competition. But this movement has several limitations. The level of cooperation among people and business units has been dramatically reduced. Employee loyalty and commitment has also decreased. In addition, people tend to focus on short-term, quantifiable performance at the expense of longer-term performance. Overall, all these changes may lead to a downward spiral.</p>

<title>Summary of the changes in Korean HRM practices</title>
<p>Thus far, we have sketched the extent to which Korean HRM practices have shifted from a seniority-based paternalistic model through a performance-based balanced model, to a flexibility-based market model. During the pre-1987 period, the employment relationship was characterized by social exchanges and relationships. Employment security and automatic promotion were provided. Firms recruited new graduates annually and provided both general and job-related training for employees. Pay was based on seniority with weak incentive intensity. Most of the workforce consisted of regular employees. Then Korean HRM experienced a transitional type of HRM by adding performance factors and enhancing employee competencies. The post-crisis period has pushed firms to shift their HRM systems toward a flexibility-based market model. Employment relationships are now characterized by transactional and economic exchange. Firms have engaged in a war for talent to obtain top performers, and employment security has been replaced by employability and flexibility. Various types of contracts have been introduced, and contingent workers have increased enormously. Incentive intensity has become very strong based on individual and group performance. The historical trajectory of HRM practices in Korea is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1350507611427827">Table 4</xref>.</p>

<p>We suppose that these changes have been revolutionary. The periods of revolutionary changes are characterized by three unique factors: (1) fundamental questioning of the underlying assumptions and organizing logic of the systems; (2) rapid changes within short periods of time; and (3) increased variance in new forms and modes through wide-spread experimentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1350507611427827">Erickson and Kuruvilla, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1350507611427827">Gersick, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1350507611427827">Hannan and Freeman, 1989</xref>). Judging from these criteria, we argue that Korean firms experienced revolutionary changes in their HRM systems, although the first change was less dramatic in its extent.</p>
<p>First, the organizing logic (i.e. the underlying assumptions and fundamental principles for organizing and managing people) of Korean HRM systems before 1987 was what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350507611427827">Adler (2001</xref>: 216) describes as ‘the hierarchy form [relying] on the authority mechanism’. During the 1987–1997 period, Korean firms experimented with both the market mode through emphasis on performance and the community mode by adopting such policies as empowerment and team orientation. The post-crisis period has been characterized by the market mode. The experiences of Korean firms have also satisfied the second factor to qualify as a revolutionary change because they underwent rapid changes for a short period around the years 1987 and 1997. Finally, as mentioned earlier, many HRM practices have been newly adopted by many firms as experiments.</p>
<p>Although Korean HRM can be classified into three paradigms, it is only the last stage that can be applied to the self-fulfilling processes through the global diffusion of HRM practices in the Korean context. The reason for presenting all three models is to demonstrate and compare the different features of the HRM paradigms in three periods. Globalization itself relates only to the final two stages (i.e. the 1987–1997 and post-1997 periods). However, the nature of globalization is quite different between these two because of the different nature of the crises. The crisis of 1987 concerned Korea-specific domestic issues, yet that of 1997 stemmed from international issues. Hence, while globalization in the second stage (i.e. 1987–1997) was a self-initiated process, the globalization of the last stage (i.e. post-1997) was an externally imposed one. In addition, the former was an outward-bound process because Korean firms went abroad seeking cheaper labor costs given increased real wages in Korea; but the latter was an inward-bound process through which American HRM practices were transferred. Therefore, it is only the last stage to which the conceptual model of this article is directly related.</p>

<title>How global diffusion of management practices became self-fulfilling</title>
<p>As described in the previous section, Korean firms rapidly accepted a market-like employment relationship after the 1997 financial crisis. Korea rapidly adopted what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1350507611427827">Ferraro et al. (2005)</xref> call ‘American-style’ management ideologies and practices. Korean firms have been strongly influenced by American models since World War II. The earlier American influence on HRM came from the US military administration (1945–1948) after independence, then during the economic aid and reconstruction process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1350507611427827">Kim and Bae, 2004</xref>). At first, firms adopted American systems with a time lag, but since the mid-1990s the adoption process has taken place more concurrently because real-time benchmarking has become a norm in the business arena. Unlike the changes of the 1987–1997 period, the post-crisis changes have had more to do with the self-fulfilling process than with a rational strategic approach to gain legitimacy, as institutional theory would suggest. Newly adopted HRM policies and practices were once regarded negatively in Korea, but suddenly gained legitimacy during the post-crisis period.</p>
<p>Why have Korean firms rapidly adopted the American-style management practices? The reason for the shift to a market-like employment relationship cannot be explained solely by competition and/or financial stringency or by national culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1350507611427827">Pfeffer, 2006</xref>). We present four categories of actors to show how they played in the diffusion of, and perhaps resistance to, the new HRM policies and practices discussed above. More specifically, international organizations, as teachers of norms, have actively initiated the global diffusion of management ideologies and practices through influencing national institutional designs, providing accreditation, and evaluating local institutions to see if they have followed the standards suggested. At the same time, local firms have been actively involved in benchmarking activities to imitate best practices and meet global standards. Local institutions such as government, business schools, and consulting firms also have helped to facilitate the diffusion process. In the case of Korea, the crisis situations have made local institutions easy learners of norms by lowering their resistance levels. Finally, individual actors also played some roles in the diffusion processes. Depending on their positions, individual actors showed either facilitating or hindering roles in the global transferring processes.</p>
<sec id="section26-1350507611427827">
<title>Teachers of norms: Influence of international organizations</title>
<p>Before the 1997 crisis, Korean firms could adopt either a community-like employment relationship with more functional flexibility or a market-like employment relationship. It was a matter of choice. But after the crisis, the Korean Government and firms had no choice but to follow the recommendations of the IMF under the post-crisis bailout program. The stance of the IMF was very strong as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1350507611427827">Joseph Stiglitz (2002</xref>: 90) put it: ‘When the crisis broke out, I was surprised at how strongly the IMF and the U.S. Treasury seemed to criticize the countries—according to the IMF, the Asian nations’ institutions were rotten, their governments corrupt, and wholesale reform was needed’.</p>
<p>According to the Letter of Intent and Memorandum on the Economic Program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chosun.com/feature/imfreport.html">www.chosun.com/feature/imfreport.html</ext-link>), two policy issues concerned labor market reform. The first issue was the strengthening of the capacity of the new employment insurance system, which was designed to ease the burden of layoffs and to expedite reemployment. The second issue was the improvement of labor market flexibility by easing dismissal restrictions, especially under mergers and acquisitions and corporate restructuring. The basic assumption underlying these two labor policy directions was that these changes would enhance the adaptability of Korean firms to changing economic conditions.</p>
<p>The employment insurance system was first introduced in Korea on 1 July 1995, and became one of four social insurance schemes along with the national pension, health insurance, and disability insurance programs. Before the financial crisis it played a limited role, but during the post-crisis period its role became critical when unemployment rapidly increased. The coverage of the employment insurance system expanded to all workplaces with one or more employees in October 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1350507611427827">Korea. Ministry of Employment and Labor, 2005</xref>). With regard to labor market flexibility, the clause on ‘layoffs upon business necessity’ was first introduced into the <italic>Labor Standard Law</italic> in 1996; this in turn led to a general strike and severe labor turmoil. As a result, a more lenient compromise appeared and the implementation was postponed. The post-crisis IMF bailout program required a further legislative revision to ease legal dismissal, and the <italic>Labor Standard Act</italic> was revised in February 1998 to reflect the IMF request. In this new revision, the conditions of imminent business necessity included handing over business, mergers, and acquisitions to prevent business dissolution.</p>
<p>The IMF not only set the policy direction, but it also opened a representative office in Seoul to ensure effective program monitoring. In addition, the IMF performed frequent reviews to check the criteria and benchmarks. As a result, the post-crisis IMF bailout program influenced national institutional designs and facilitated the amendment of labor laws to ease dismissal restrictions, which marked the beginning of the eventual dismantling of lifetime employment. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350507611427827">Drori et al. (2006</xref>: 209) described it: ‘[G]lobal financial institutions force countries to rationalize their national governance formats to stabilize and expand global economic interdependencies; with this in mind, global crises, such as the Asian financial crisis of 1997, are blamed on local failures in transparency’.</p>
<p>Subsequent restructuring programs in big Korean corporations regarding governance structure, downsizing, financial transparency, capital account transactions, and reform in the financial sector had to follow the IMF’s recommendations, facilitated by the coercive force of the Korean Government. There may, however, be different strategies for emerging economies due to different institutional factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1350507611427827">Khanna and Palepu, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1350507611427827">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1350507611427827">Kostova, 1999</xref>). The IMF bailout program itself became a source of coercion since the Korean Government was dependent upon its monetary resources. The embeddedness of a country within international organizations will strongly influence that country to expose to and conform to the legitimized models of social action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350507611427827">Drori et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1350507611427827">Gooderham et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1350507611427827">Guler et al., 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Local institutions: Recipient human capital</title>
<p>The Korean Government, Korean business schools, and consulting firms have all played a role in the global diffusion of management ideologies and practices. The State has also played a role in the management diffusion process in other countries, such as the US in the adoption of HRM practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350507611427827">Baron et al., 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1350507611427827">1988</xref>), and Japan in the diffusion of quality control techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350507611427827">Cole, 1985</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section28-1350507611427827">
<title>Local government</title>
<p>Korean Government officials have urged the necessity of labor market flexibility to enhance national competitiveness. Hence, the Korean Government under the IMF bailout program has facilitated the implementation of restructuring; downsizing, including ‘honorary retirement plans’ to remove redundancies; and changing governance structure. More recently, in 2006 the Government widely adopted the BSC for public sectors, which has become a critical evaluation item for department innovation achievements. In the same year, the Korean Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MEST) launched the second Brain Korea 21 research fund with various programs, one of which is for the establishment of professional MBA schools.</p>

<sec id="section29-1350507611427827">
<title>Local business schools</title>
<p>Recognizing the insufficiency of the existing MBA program for training managers,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1350507611427827">2</xref></sup> the Korean MEST launched the day-time MBA program on the condition of closing the evening MBA programs in 1998. Only five institutions received accreditation from the MEST. In 2006, the Korean MEST initiated a new MBA program allowing day-time, evening-time, and weekend classes and accredited six universities<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1350507611427827">3</xref></sup> starting from fall, 2006 and five universities<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1350507611427827">4</xref></sup> starting from spring, 2007.</p>
<p>With regard to the establishment of the MBA program in Korea, several features are salient. First, the MBA program established in 2006 benchmarked the American-type MBA as a model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1350507611427827">Paik and Sohn, 2007</xref>). Even though the degree conferred under the previous MBA program was called an MBA, the quality of the program was far below the standard of the typical American-style MBA program. Second, the credits required for graduation were increased from 24–30 credits in the case of the pre-1998 MBA program to 45 credits for the new MBA program (post-2006). Many 2-unit courses were changed to 3-unit ones and new courses were introduced to the program. Finally, the Korean MEST required institutions with MBA programs to instruct more than half of the day-time (full-time) MBA classes in English. As a whole, the American-style MBA program has become a standard and role model for management training at Korean management education institutions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Korean MEST selected the four best MBA programs (i.e. Korea University, Seoul National University, Yonsei University, and Sungkyunkwan University) and heavily subsidized these programs. Beyond the aforementioned requirements (e.g. offering 45 credits and lecturing over 50% of courses in English), the MEST also asked business schools to select a few business schools for benchmarking purposes. Most business schools selected American business schools as their role models (e.g. in the case of Korea University, University of Michigan was selected). Finally, gaining certification from internationally recognized organizations such as the AACSB also became a criterion for the screening process.</p>
<p>Hence, many Korean business schools started to prepare proposals for accreditation from the AACSB. Within the past nine years, nine business schools have been accredited.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1350507611427827">5</xref></sup> Accreditation itself does not necessarily mean that these schools have changed their curricula to those of American MBA programs; however, several interesting points are worth mentioning. First, the learning goals of MBA programs in Korea have become very similar. The most common learning goals include developing communication capabilities, leadership, ethical behavior, and global perspective. The reason for this similarity comes from the process of meeting the assurance of learning (AOL). Second, most business schools in Korea now have established standardized processes for AOL and other requirements. These processes, like various programs of business process management such as BPR, TQM, BSC, and 6-sigma, made business schools rather homogeneous in terms of learning goals and curricula. Finally, Korean business schools have changed their curricula to adapt to these changes. When the new MBA programs were launched, as mentioned above, the number of required credits was increased to 45 from about 24–30. To fill the gap and to meet the learning goals, many Korean business schools included new courses such as leadership, business ethics, and others which came mostly from the curricula of American MBA programs. In addition, most courses utilized business cases, mainly Harvard or Stanford cases.</p>
<p>The changes at business schools eventually affected management practices through industry education. The top five business schools in Korea have provided extensive non-degree management education programs tailored for specific companies including most major companies in Korea. For example, one of the major business schools has provided these kinds of tailored business education programs for many companies. A few such companies, along with program names, include: KT (KT-MBA; 2000); Housing &amp; Commercial Bank (H&amp;CB Academy; 2001); Shinhan Bank (Marketing Development Program; 2001); Daewoo Securities Co. (Strategic Management Program; 2001–2); Samsung Electronics Company (SEC Finance MBA; 2003–present); Pulmuone (Brand Marketing Strategy; 2005); Hana Finance Group (HFG-KUBS Corporate Governance Program; 2007); and Samsung Insurance (Insurance Leader Program; 2008). In addition, faculty members in business schools often give lectures for the programs operated by companies themselves. Hence, the perspectives and content of business schools in Korea have transferred to the real world through various mechanisms.</p>

<sec id="section30-1350507611427827">
<title>HRM service sector</title>
<p>The HRM-related service sector has also emerged to provide such services as HRM consulting, manpower supply, industry education, provision of HRM information systems, outsourcing for general HRM affairs, compensation and benefits, and dispatching manpower. In addition to foreign firms such as Mercer, Watson Wyatt, and Towers Perrin, many Korean local HRM-related consulting firms have mushroomed.</p>
<p>One specific example is the increase in both the number of workers and sales in the manpower supply and employment agency industry (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1350507611427827">Table 5</xref>). The number of workers in 1998 was 6520 and increased by 3261 workers in just the next year. For the same period, total sales also increased by about 65% (from KRW66.8 bn in 1998 to KRW103.3 bn). The increase in both the number of workers and sales in this industry reflects higher workforce flexibility.</p>

<p>The sudden increase of HRM-related service providers is closely related to the organizational restructuring after the 1997 crisis, increased adoption of new HRM systems characterized as performance-based annual pay and workforce flexibility, and frequent institutional changes in terms of labor laws. All these new environments have made it difficult for firms to assume all these activities by themselves. The problem arises when firms lose their control over trends and solely depend on outside consulting firms for certain activities; this in turn makes the diffusion of certain types of HRM systems much easier and more widespread. Thus, the social upheaval created conditions in which many institutional arrangements have changed, which in turn has led to certain types of HRM approaches becoming taken for granted.</p>

<title>Recipient human capital</title>
<p>Recipient human capital is another critical factor in the rapid diffusion of management ideologies and practices because it contributes to the design of institutional arrangements, which in turn become templates facilitating global diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350507611427827">Drori et al., 2006</xref>). As for institutional factors, most faculty members of major business schools have earned their PhD degrees from universities in the US. For example, in the three major business schools in Korea, 152 (91%) of 166 faculty members had earned their PhD degrees from US institutions as of 2006.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1350507611427827">6</xref></sup> Although not all these faculty members accept the American style of management, they are well acquainted with American faculty and management style. If they are not all champions of the American style of management, they are at least less likely to be foes of it. These faculty members, especially in major schools, have been actively involved in business education, through which they serve as the ‘academic clergy’ of certain types of management styles. Just as international organizations both preach and practice certain modes of ideologies and practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350507611427827">Drori et al., 2006</xref>), business schools not only preach certain styles of management, but also practice the style they teach by adopting internal competition and performance-based promotions.</p>
<p>Before the 1997 financial crisis, large Korean corporations requested faculty members of the major business schools to carry out their management consulting projects. However, in the post-crisis period, management began changing this tradition. Korean firms instead have given their consulting projects to professional consulting firms, especially globally recognized big companies such as McKinsey &amp; Company. Korean firms have also sent their management staff to major universities in Western countries and invited foreign scholars for business education. Beyond the company level, the national economy itself has also been the object of consulting (e.g. <italic>Korea Report</italic> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350507611427827">Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc., 1997</xref>; <italic>McKinsey Report on Reinventing Korea</italic> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1350507611427827">McKinsey &amp; Company, 1998</xref>).</p>

<title>Local firms: Learners of norms</title>
<p>Korean management used the 1997 crisis as a chance to legitimize its own management ideologies. Benchmarking best practices and satisfying global standards were Korean firms’ two most critical driving forces.</p>
<p>During the initial economic development period, management in Korean firms developed a ‘late-comer complex’, the sense of inferiority as a firm in a country engaged in economic development in the late time. This made management search continually for the ‘advanced techniques’ of competitive companies in economically advanced countries. This attitude changed little even after some big corporations produced some of the top products in the world. In addition, the ideological worldview of Korean professional management was less clearly implemented, because the founders of the firms controlled their firms and their thinking took precedence. All these factors together helped to create a social norm of a ‘change-is-good’ mentality.</p>
<p>Firms were aggressively involved in benchmarking activities. For example, one major electronics company in Korea recklessly spent money for benchmarking purposes. After the 1997 financial crisis, the company managers visited over 50 major companies around the world, including General Electric, IBM, HP, Sony, Philips, Intel, Nokia, JPMorgan, ING Group, Toyota, and Ericsson.</p>
<p>The benchmarking process can be nicely explained by the conformity of actors to social norms, defined as ‘shared perceptions of appropriate behavior that possess the power to induce people to act publicly in ways that deviate from their private inclinations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1350507611427827">Miller, 1999</xref>: 1056). Although benchmarking activities are not necessarily advantageous, firms tend to perceive that other firms are actively involved in benchmarking <italic>best</italic> practices and global <italic>standards</italic>, which motivates management to become involved in benchmarking activities. Now the benchmarking process has become a social norm from which firms are reluctant to deviate due to their fear of becoming pace-losers.</p>
<p>The adoption of new policies and practices by leading companies has enabled them to gain legitimacy, and those policies and practices have in turn become the pattern-setters for other companies. As more major companies have adopted those orientations, the speed of diffusion has accelerated. One CEO of a foreign consulting firm mentioned that Korea is a perfect testing ground for newly created management techniques, because when one firm adopts a new program, it rapidly spreads to almost all major companies in very short period of time. Two examples are relevant here.</p>
<p>The first example is about ‘war for talent’, a typical management arrangement for grouping of workers. Samsung pronounced it should engage in a war for talent. With regard to the top talent management, before the 1997 financial crisis, few companies in Korea used the program. However, the percentage of listed companies that adopted such a program drastically increased from 27.05% in 2003 to 30.0% in 2004, and then to 64.8% in 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1350507611427827">Kim, 2010</xref>). These data are for higher-end employees.</p>
<p>LG Electronics declared it had adopted ‘performance orientation’ as the backbone of its HRM system. To assess the changes in performance-based approach, we looked into how much attention it has gained from the public. For this, using the information retrieval system (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.kinds.or.kr">www.kinds.or.kr</ext-link>) of the Korea Press Foundation, we checked how many times the term ‘performance orientation’ of HRM occurred in the national daily newspapers per year (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1350507611427827">Figure 2</xref>). The number of occurrences of the term in the newspapers was less than 40 before 1998. It constantly increased and, as a result, the average has increased from 15.7 (1991–1997) to 131.4 (1998–2010). This increase in frequency reflects the fact that the performance orientation of Korean HRM has been paid much attention by companies as well as by the public.</p>

<p>This process has been accelerated further by other features of Korean firms, such as speed management, crisis management, organization-wide experiment with new approaches, and the rapid diffusion tradition of management innovation techniques. Firms have often experimented with new management techniques and practices covering the whole organization, rather than just part of the organization to test their efficacy. ‘Speed’ has become a key term in Korean management. Since the mid-1980s, Korean firms have experimented with various ‘new’ management approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1350507611427827">Kim and Bae, 2004</xref>), including TQM, BPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1350507611427827">Lee and Sohn, 2001</xref>), team-based work systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1350507611427827">Lee and Kim, 1999</xref>), BSC, 6-sigma, management transparency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1350507611427827">Han and Bae, 2001</xref>), and so on. The aforementioned institutional forces explain the adoption and diffusion of these new approaches. The studies show that firms tend to adopt new approaches by mimicking the actions of the leading companies. Downsizing is not an exception in this regard, not only in the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1350507611427827">McKinley et al., 1995</xref>) but also in Korea.</p>

<title>Individual actors: Facilitators or obstructers?</title>
<p>Since the self-fulfilling process involves the change of ideologies and social norms, the role and influence of individual actors in the socio-political processes are also critical at the micro level. Individual actors may include individual employees, HRM managers, labor unions, and so on. It is beyond the scope of this article to cover all the details of the socio-political processes of each actor. It would suffice to briefly cover the two forces: the driving force facilitating the diffusion of new approaches and the force of resistance hindering the process.</p>
<p>First, until recently, the driving force of global diffusion typically came from top management and human resource (HR) managers. Their efforts included conducting benchmarking activities, holding global HR conferences, and attending major HRM-related conferences. When major large corporations found a company with more progressive HRM practices, they allowed their managers to visit that firm regardless of country of origin or type of industry. Each benchmarking activity was pursued by a team of two to seven members for anywhere from a few hours to several days. This kind of activity continued until around the year 2005. After that time, most Korean firms stopped their benchmarking efforts. Large Korean multinationals also hold global HRM conferences every year. HRM directors from all over the world get together at these conferences to share HR-related knowledge. In addition, many major Korean companies also send their HRM managers to major HRM-related conferences such as the SHRM (the Society for Human Resource Management) Annual Conference and the ASTD (the American Society for Training &amp; Development) International Conference.</p>
<p>However, these efforts of HRM managers could not be institutionalized without resistance from unions and individual actors. Two critical areas that encountered strong resistance were the individual performance-based approach vis-à-vis the seniority-based one and employment flexibility vis-à-vis employment security. While the first issue was not overly problematic, the second issue was critical. Downsizing, utilizing contingent workers, early retirement were all good examples of numerical flexibility. The case of the Hyundai Motor Company was a typical example that went through the complicated socio-political processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1350507611427827">Rowley and Bae, 2002</xref>). The company reduced its workforce of 45,000 to about 35,000 in 1998 through 277 dismissals, 7226 voluntary retirements, and about 2000 layoffs for temporary workers. Its restructuring and downsizing plans generated huge costs. The original plan to dismiss 4830 ended up being only 277 with many illegal strikes and conflicts during the year of 1998, costing Hyundai about US$750m of revenue and its suppliers some US$600m. This example clearly shows that the diffusion process was not smoothly progressed at least at the early stage. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1350507611427827">Kostova (1999)</xref> claimed, institutionalization has both implementation and internalization processes. In the case of Korean firms, the formal implementation of certain practices should be followed by the internalization process. The internalization process can be achieved when individual actors have commitment to, satisfaction with, and psychological ownership of, newly adopted HRM practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350507611427827">Bae and Rowley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1350507611427827">Kostova, 1999</xref>). The progress of the internalization process, the high level of crisis at that time, and the efforts of HRM managers all combined to lower the resistance level of both local firms and employees.</p>
<p>In sum, the self-fulfilling process at a global level explains the evolution of HRM in Korea. The employment relationship has shifted from a paternalistic model to a market-like model featuring internal competition, wide pay differential, and performance orientation. All these new approaches were once unfamiliar to Korean firms but have now become socially acceptable norms. Once they are legitimized, the new approaches perpetuate themselves. This new HRM model has now created conditions through institutional arrangements, languages, and assumptions that make them even more likely to develop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1350507611427827">Ferraro et al., 2005</xref>). In this diffusion process, international organizations, local institutions, firms, and individual actors have played their particular roles, while the 1997 financial crisis provided the social climate that has made the global diffusion much easier.</p>

<title>Discussion and implications</title>
<p>We conceptualized the institutional theory of diffusion as a phenomenon of the self-fulfilling process. This process was applied to the evolution of Korean HRM. We argued that the content of diffusion contained management ideology, especially neoliberalistic approach. Based on our findings, we make several points.</p>
<p>First, the contents and timing of management diffusion in emerging economies or recently economically developed countries such as Korea are quite different from those of Western developed countries. Organization and employment management ideologies and rhetoric have historically undergone change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350507611427827">Abrahamson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350507611427827">Barley and Kunda, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350507611427827">De Greene, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1350507611427827">Gill and Whittle, 1993</xref>). Thus far, five rhetorics (industrial betterment, scientific management, welfare capitalism/human relations, systems rationalism, and organizational culture) have been suggested, at least in the US; these rhetorics can be further classified into two classes: rational rhetorics and normative rhetorics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350507611427827">Abrahamson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350507611427827">Barley and Kunda, 1992</xref>). It is suggested that these two rhetorics are cyclical in nature, alternating between swings of the pendulum. The pendulum swing thesis is quite intuitive in understanding the changes in management ideologies and rhetorics in the US.</p>
<p>Unlike the long-wave thesis of the pendulum swing of managerial rhetoric in the developed economies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350507611427827">Abrahamson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350507611427827">Ayres, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1350507611427827">Kleinknecht, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1350507611427827">Tylecote, 1994</xref>), Korea is experiencing the short-wave pendulum. As a late-comer, Korea began its economic development only in the early 1960s. The two decades of rapid economic development in the 1970s and 1980s and two major turning points in 1987 and 1997 bring shorter cycles within the long-wave trends of Western economies.</p>
<p>Second, as for the driving forces behind the emergence of new waves, the diffusion (learning) process in an emerging economy involves a complex set of developmental dynamics that centre on the work of the State and particular industrial groups. The efforts of these agents is mediated by regional economic ‘shocks’ and local political machinations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350507611427827">Barley and Kunda (1992</xref>: 392) suggested that one might postulate that culture has set the substantive and structural boundaries within which managerial discourse has developed but that economic forces have determined when new surges of theorizing occurred. However, at a global level, an employment management rhetoric is affected not only by cultural ideologies and economic forces within the country, but also by benchmarking processes in terms of advanced technologies and management practices. Economic forerunners and followers have gone different routes in shaping their employment management rhetorics. Economic late-comers have had more dynamic and complex interactions between their national traditional ideologies and Western ideologies. Some conflict between national cultural traditions and newly adopted foreign ideologies is to be expected. Before Korean firms became deeply involved in global businesses, the adoption of Western rhetorics and management practices took longer and experienced a time lag. But since Korean firms have become more globalized, real-time benchmarking has developed and has been more directly influenced by the management rhetorics and practices of other countries.</p>
<p>Finally, the relationship between technological innovation and organizational innovation found in Western firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350507611427827">Abrahamson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350507611427827">De Greene, 1988</xref>) does not match well with Korea. The process of catch-up by Korean firms started with their ‘imitating’ firms in economically advanced countries, and progressed through ‘creative imitation’ to ‘innovation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1350507611427827">Kim, 1997</xref>). Different phases of the learning and innovation process may require different management arrangements, although causality is not clear. Furthermore, local conditions also intervene and challenge the importation of particular practices (e.g. imported HRM) which had a mixed impact on innovation performance. Certain rhetoric of employment management does not generate desirable technological innovation. Recent changes in HRM toward a more market-like employment relationship have caused innovation to deteriorate. A case study on an R&amp;D center of LG Electronics showed that a performance-based HRM system generated higher innovation performance on average, but the proportion of exploratory innovation vis-à-vis exploitative innovation decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350507611427827">Bae and Park, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>From the findings and discussion, we can derive several implications. First, although the global learning process is quite prevalent these days, global learning activities should be very cautious by prudently considering country-specific context. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1350507611427827">Ferraro et al. (2005</xref>: 17) argued that ‘despite cultural differences and different rates of acceptance, we would also expect to find that, over time, the language and assumptions of economics are indeed diffusing globally’. In addition, they also suggested pursuing historical studies that focus on the evolution of management practices as an avenue of future research. This analysis of the evolution of Korean HRM partly reflects their argument. Judging from these observations, best management practices would not be ‘best’ for every country all the time. Each country may learn quite country-specific and time-specific contents from another country. In this article, we argue that Korean firms adopted American-style management practices in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Even though every country has something to learn from other countries, it is unwise to discard all the merits of the existing paradigm, which is based on the ethos of local people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350507611427827">Bae and Rowley, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, organizational changes appear to undergo a dialectical movement from one extreme (i.e. a paternalistic model) to another (i.e. a market-like model), rather than directly moving toward a synthesis by resolving some shortcomings of the previous model and adding other needed features. Since ‘the ideology sows the seeds of its own destruction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350507611427827">Barley and Kunda, 1992</xref>: 392), the current HRM mode in Korea appears inadequate, as we observe many inconsistencies within it. If it is necessary to take the antithesis, one simple lesson is keeping the shortcomings of it in mind. Many Korean corporations experimented with the market-like employment relationship over the past 10 years and realized that it went too far. Rebuilding lost values, such as trust, would take much longer than destroying them.</p>
<p>Finally, another important implication of this article is that the global diffusion process of market-like employment management has become self-fulfilling at a global level. This self-fulfilling process occurs through the influence of international organizations such as the IMF, with the facilitation of local institutions, when a country encounters a crisis, such as the 1997 financial crisis in Korea. Local firms also become actively involved in the process when they benchmark best practices to meet global standards. Once these new languages and assumptions, previously rejected by many stakeholders, obtain legitimacy and become socially accepted, the diffusion is greatly accelerated and is afterwards taken for granted. However, generally accepted ideologies and social norms do not necessarily mean they are right. Self-fulfilling processes occur regardless of whether the contents are true. It requires discernment on the part of management when it adopts new management practices. Labor market flexibility is a prime case in point.</p>
<p>The Korean Government and many large corporations thought the adoption of labor market flexibility was a critical factor for company competitiveness. We can observe similar debates in some European countries, the UK, and Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350507611427827">Bae and Rowley, 2001</xref>). For example, the phenomenon whereby Korean firms were adapting to neoliberalism by adopting a dual approach was witnessed in the UK in the 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350507611427827">Atkinson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350507611427827">Atkinson and Gregory, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350507611427827">Atkinson and Meager, 1986</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1350507611427827">7</xref></sup> The core-periphery model was subject to considerable criticism (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1350507611427827">Pollert, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1350507611427827">1991</xref>): the current employment modes are ‘far more complex and uneven lines than this polarization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1350507611427827">Pollert, 1988</xref>: 281). There were also some qualified defenses such as arguing that we need to understand the model at a political level with a different view of strategy (i.e. ‘patterns’ rather than ‘plans’) (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1350507611427827">Procter et al., 1994</xref>). In addition, there have been initiatives by the European Union such as ‘flexicurity’ to counter this model by enhancing both flexibility of the firm and labor market on the one hand, and security of employment and income on the other, all of which promote security for contingent workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1350507611427827">European Commission, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1350507611427827">2007</xref>). From these arguments, Korean firms may learn a lesson: a veneer of legitimacy does not resolve all current and emerging issues. If the experiences of Korean firms over the past decade have not been just a simplistic fad, wisdom based on evidence and continuing debate is called for.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article analyzed the evolution of Korean HRM using the framework of self-fulfilling prophecy and the institutional theory of diffusion. These perspectives underpin the global learning process. Contingent upon dynamic interactions among international institutions and local institutions, the nature, contents, timing, and ways of global learning become quite different from the existing literature on those of Western countries. Therefore, we argue that we regard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350507611427827">Barley and Kunda’s (1992)</xref> work as a locality study (i.e. US-based argument), and that other locality studies such as this article require us to theorize a much stronger role for other agents in the process of diffusion. This line of argument departs substantially from the currently dominant framework of institutional determinism. Rather, we argue that we need to incorporate the proactive roles of local agents, such as government, corporate groups, business schools, and consulting firms, into the framework of the global learning process. This ‘strong agency’ perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1350507611427827">Kostova et al., 2008</xref>) provides rich explanation for the global diffusion process.</p>
<p>However, the choice of managerial rhetoric seems to be highly contingent upon the moderating role of local economic conditions such as financial shock. The 1997 financial crisis put the local agents under high pressure for survival. Given limited choices and a sense of urgency, rapid global diffusion process occurred without much reflection. In this situation, the strong agency roles with a homogenous perspective expedite global learning process toward a rather dominant management ideology at the time.</p>
<p>In sum, this study makes a contribution to the literature of both institutional theory and organizational learning theory by focusing on the global learning/diffusion of management discourse which highlights the importance of local or regional dynamics (e.g. state intervention, globalization of business groups, economic shocks and variable impact of some practices).</p>
