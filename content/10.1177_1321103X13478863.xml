<abstract>
<p>There has been a gradual increase in the body of literature regarding seniors’ musical preferences, learning approaches, development, and creativity. This literature dispels existing myths that perceive older people as a homogeneous group, characterized by decrepitude and diminishing capacity, and with a passive contribution to society. A phenomenographic approach has been taken in this article to explore the different ways that 11 participants experienced creative music sessions delivered by the Connect Programme of the Guildhall School of Music &amp; Drama, London, UK, as part of the Music for Life Project. The analysis revealed five distinct categories of engagement. Two of these categories of engagement are described in detail and demonstrate how music learners in late Fourth Age can achieve in music given sufficient opportunity, motivation, and support from the music facilitators and their environment. The article concludes with some practical suggestions for music facilitators who wish to lead musical activities with seniors.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Research concerned with the role of music in older people’s lives has demonstrated a number of social, emotional, cognitive, and physical benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1321103X13478863">Clift, Hancox, Staricoff, &amp; Whitmore, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1321103X13478863">Cohen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1321103X13478863">Hays &amp; Minichiello, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1321103X13478863">Varvarigou, Hallam, Creech, &amp; McQueen, 2011</xref>) and indicated the potential for enhancing health and well-being for older adults as they move to the ‘Third Age’ and ‘Fourth Age’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1321103X13478863">Hallam et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1321103X13478863">Laslett, 1989</xref>). Third Age seniors (50–75) are conceptualized as those who enjoy a considerable degree of resilience in relation to independence, autonomy, cognitive functioning, and well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1321103X13478863">Scourfield, 2007</xref>). However, the Fourth Age (over 75) is believed to be a period of disengagement and dependency, involving physical and mental decline and a decrease in subjective well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1321103X13478863">Baltes &amp; Smith, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1321103X13478863">Findsen (2005)</xref> identified three pervasive myths about older learners. The first relates to the idea that older people comprise a homogeneous group, with a collective characteristic and set of needs. Indeed, it is arguable that as people accumulate life experience they become ever more diverse. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1321103X13478863">Withnall (2010)</xref> carried out extensive focus groups with a total of 98 older learners in formal, organized educational settings and concluded that any attempt to characterize older learners as a homogeneous group is misguided and ageist.</p>
<p>A second myth is the idea that all older people are characterized by decrepitude and diminishing capability. There is evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1321103X13478863">Sternberg &amp; Grigorenko, 2005</xref>) that fluid intelligence, associated with processing speed and short-term memory, does decline as humans age. However, crystallized intelligence, acquired through experience and reflection and associated with knowledge and wisdom, has been found to remain stable or even increase. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1321103X13478863">Cohen (2009)</xref>, looking for evidence of highly developed brain activity in later life in behavioural neuroscience and brain imaging studies, found that the hemispheres of the brain work in greater synchrony with age. Moreover, it has been hypothesized that music and ‘virtually every form of art provides optimal utilization of the benefits of synchronised hemisphere involvement – optimally integrating left and right brain capacities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1321103X13478863">Cohen, 2009</xref>, p. 58). With regard to the natural physical decline that happens in older age, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1321103X13478863">Gembris (2008)</xref> found that older learners develop compensatory strategies to mitigate physical or cognitive constraints when learning to play a musical instrument.</p>
<p>The third myth highlighted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1321103X13478863">Findsen (2005)</xref> was that of dependence, with the related positioning of older learners as consumers. Findsen argued that rather than dependence, the Third and Fourth Ages may be conceptualized as a period of developing interdependence, where an intergenerational exchange of knowledge and skills becomes salient and where older learners comprise a rich resource for knowledge and skills. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1321103X13478863">Weiss and Bass (2002)</xref>, the drive to engage in meaningful activity, together with the need to make a socially valued contribution, persist through the Third and Fourth Ages. From this perspective, older people have the potential to continue in a relationship of interdependence within their families and wider communities.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1321103X13478863">Dabback (2005)</xref> discusses false perceptions about senior music learners and their needs. He proposes that it is fallaciously believed that seniors (a) have no desire for musical activities; (b) prefer passive activities and sedate music; (c) are satisfied with mediocre performances; and (d) are frail and therefore lack any capacity for musical growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1321103X13478863">Dabback, 2005</xref>). Rather, there is growing evidence that later life is a period of profound creativity, where older people use creative outlets for reflection on their own unique stories and for personal healing and problem solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1321103X13478863">Hickson &amp; Housley, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1321103X13478863">Iwasaki, Coyle, &amp; Shank, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1321103X13478863">Lally, 2009</xref>). In addition, there are a number of studies that have focused on detailed explorations of how individual learners experience music-making in later life and the impact that this has on their creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1321103X13478863">Allison, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1321103X13478863">Boswell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1321103X13478863">Kellmann, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1321103X13478863">Lally, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>This article focuses on the active musical engagement of a group of seniors and discusses issues related to myths about senior learners’ musical engagement in creative music-making activities. Through the lens of phenomenography this article explores the different ways that these participants experienced music-making that took place in weekly music sessions. The music programme was part of the Music for Life Project and was led by music facilitators from the Connect Programme of the Guildhall School of Music &amp; Drama, London, UK. The forms of musical engagement of the two eldest members of the programme (born in 1918 and 1919) are described in greater detail because they provide examples of different ways of experiencing music-making in late Fourth Age.</p>

<title>The Music for Life Project</title>
<p>The Music for Life Project started in October 2009, funded by the New Dynamics of Ageing strand of the UK Research Councils to (a) explore the way in which participating in music-making activities can enhance the lives of older people; (b) consider the extent to which this participation may impact on social, emotional, and cognitive well-being; and (c) consider the specific processes through which this impact occurs. Three case study sites acted as partners in the research: The Sage, Gateshead; Westminster Adult Education Service; and the Connect Programme at the Guildhall School of Music &amp; Drama. This article relates to the first area of research inquiry and presents data that were collected from the music sessions of the Connect Programme of the Guildhall School of Music &amp; Drama.</p>
<p>The Guildhall School of Music &amp; Drama Connect Programme runs community projects with people of all ages in East London. Connect music projects are distinctive in that their focus is on activities where participants create and perform music together, linking story-telling and reminiscing to creative music-making. To date, the programmes run by Connect have largely focused on young people. However, from October 2009 to May 2010 the Music for Life Project facilitated musical activities with older people, which took place in sheltered housing accommodation in East London. These musical activities, which are no longer run, included intergenerational music sessions involving the older people making music together with children from local primary schools.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1321103X13478863" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This article draws on data generated from two seniors’ music groups that were part of the same programme, over the period of one year. The sessions took place in the common rooms of two sheltered housing schemes<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1321103X13478863">1</xref></sup> in East London where the participants lived independently. The first location was visited in the morning and the second in early evening. Each session started with vocal warm-ups and moderate physical stretching exercises and continued with singing, songwriting and experimentation with untuned percussion instruments. Some of the songs rehearsed during the sessions were: “I Can See Clearly Now” (by Johnny Nash), “Mamma Mia” (by Abba), “My Bonny Lies Over the Ocean” (traditional Scottish folk song), and “El Café” (traditional song from Argentina). The repertoire and activities used with both groups were the same and were delivered by the same music facilitators. The programme reached its culmination with a concert at the Pit Theatre in the Barbican Centre, London, where both groups performed together with primary school children in an intergenerational project (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1321103X13478863">Varvarigou et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Data were collected through:</p>
<list id="list1-1321103X13478863" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>face-to-face interviews with eight seniors participants, the principal music facilitator (one at the beginning and one at the end of the project), the assistant music facilitator (one interview) and the two sheltered housing scheme managers;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>one focus group interview with five participants and two music facilitators;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>questionnaires (Q) from nine participants;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a talking heads video (TH), where six participants talked about their experiences from their involvement in the music programme and the concert (10.91 minutes); and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>email communications with the principal music facilitator one year after the project.</p></list-item>
</list>
<sec id="section4-1321103X13478863">
<title>Interviews</title>
<p>During face-to-face interviews the participants were asked about their musical background and preferences, what they enjoyed about the music sessions, and suggestions for how the music sessions could be improved. The facilitators were asked about their musical background and preferences, the benefits from and difficulties in facilitating the music sessions for them, and the difficulties for the participants in attending the music sessions. The facilitators were also encouraged to talk about individuals from the two participating groups and how they responded to the musical activities. The scheme managers were asked about the benefits and difficulties for the tenants in attending the music sessions and for their suggestions on how the music programme could be improved.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1321103X13478863">
<title>Focus group interviews</title>
<p>During the focus group interviews the participants were asked about what it was like being in the group, what it felt like performing at the Barbican Centre and how the programme could be improved. They were also asked to compare it to other groups in which they participated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1321103X13478863">
<title>Questionnaires (Q)</title>
<p>Nine participants responded to open questions on two questionnaires, Q1 and Q2, which were distributed at the beginning and end of the project respectively. Seven participants returned Q1 and Q2, one participant only returned Q1, and another only returned Q2. The open questions were: for Q1, “What is the role of music in your life?,” and “What are the difficulties in attending the sessions and how might these be overcome?”; and for Q2, “What encouraged you to continue to participate in the activity?,” and “Have there been any changes in your life in the last six months that have affected your taking part in group activities?” Space for additional comments that could help the researchers to understand why participation in music activities has been a positive (or negative) experience for the participants was available in both questionnaires.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1321103X13478863">
<title>Talking heads video (TH)</title>
<p>After the group’s performance at the Pit Theatre, the participants of the music project were invited to talk about their experiences from the music sessions and their comments were filmed. The footage was then used to create the talking heads video.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1321103X13478863">
<title>Email communication with the facilitator</title>
<p>The music sessions at both housing schemes continued for a year after the end of the Music for Life Project in May 2010. The principal music facilitator was contacted by the first author one year after the project and asked about the participants’ musical progression.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1321103X13478863">
<title>Analysis procedures and approach</title>
<p>All face-to-face interviews, the focus group interview, and the talking heads videos were transcribed verbatim in separate Word documents and the responses from the questionnaires were copied into one Word document. NVivo 8 (manufacturer: QSR International) was used to support the process of analysis. The data were analysed through an iterative process outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1321103X13478863">Cooper and McIntyre (1993</xref>, p. 384). The process involved:</p>
<list id="list2-1321103X13478863" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>reading a random sample of scripts;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>identifying points of similarity and difference among these transcripts in relation to the research questions;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>generating theories against a new set of transcripts;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>testing theories against a new set of transcripts;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>testing new theories against transcripts that had already been dealt with;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>carrying all existing theories forward to new transcripts; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>repeating the above process until all data had been examined and all theories tested against all data.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The analysis presented here was carried out in two phases. During the first phase all qualitative data from the Music for Life Project were analysed by the first and fourth authors in separate NVivo databases for: (a) facilitators, (b) participants, (c) focus groups, and (d) observations. The themes that emerged were discussed and agreed amongst all four authors. The second phase of analysis was undertaken by the first author and focused on the different levels of engagement in the creative music sessions that were experienced by the 11 participants (five men and six women, born between 1918 and 1942) of the Guildhall School of Music &amp; Drama Connect Programme. The analysis builds on previous work by the author on using a phenomenographic approach in order to describe, analyse, and understand choral conducting education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1321103X13478863">Varvarigou, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Phenomenography was a term created by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1321103X13478863">Marton (1981)</xref> to describe a qualitative research methodology that aims to find and systematize “forms of thought in terms of which people interpret significant aspects of reality” (p. 177). Contrary to phenomenology, which aims to capture the richness of experience and the fullness of all the ways in which a person experiences and describes the phenomenon of interest, phenomenography is substance oriented (i.e. aims to capture the relationship between the actors and the phenomenon and not the phenomenon per se). Conceptions and ways of understanding are not seen as individual qualities but as “categories of description to be used in facilitating the grasp of concrete cases of human functioning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1321103X13478863">Marton, 1981</xref>, p. 177). Phenomenographers describe the variation of human experience. The outcome of a phenomenographic approach is a set of categories of description and the structural relationship between the categories is referred to as “outcome space” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1321103X13478863">Marton &amp; Booth, 1997</xref>). The qualitatively different ways of experiencing a particular phenomenon form a hierarchy “defined in terms of increasing complexity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1321103X13478863">Marton &amp; Booth, 1997</xref>, p. 125). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1321103X13478863">Marton (1981)</xref> argues in favour of this kind of research by highlighting that: (a) people have access to the world only through experience and, therefore, “we cannot separate that which is experienced from the experience per se” (p. 177); and (b) although the interpretation of a phenomenon or aspect of reality might vary, the way they are experienced or conceptualized occurs in a relatively limited number of qualitatively different ways.</p>
<p>Five categories of experiencing active music-making emerged from the analysis of the data: (a) Music-making as a means for interaction with others; (b) Music-making as a means for interaction with others and reminiscing; (c) Music-making as a means for interaction with others and for developing a new skill; (d) Returning to active music-making after several years; and (e) music-making as a means for creative self-expression. More complete descriptions are given below.</p>

<title>Category 1: Music-making as a means for interaction with others</title>
<p>The main common characteristic of the responses given by the four participants (Helen, Elizabeth, Garreth, Gladys) in category 1 was that they attended the music sessions purely for social purposes, to meet other seniors and interact with the children in an intergenerational music project (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1321103X13478863">Varvarigou et al., 2011</xref>). Some examples of the responses given were the following:<disp-quote>
<p>I like being amongst people who sang and enjoyed themselves. Company of others. I enjoyed the company of the children. The children were wonderful. The way they sing. (Helen, Q2)</p>
<p>I told them [the scheme manager] – they found money to make the garden and nobody goes. Why don’t they give money for the music sessions? It gives us life. (Elizabeth, Q2)</p>
<p>Well, it was [scheme manager] who said I would come to it. She was asking all the tenants. We had to get some people to come, didn’t we? … I am in tenants’ activities; Tenants’ Association… More people would make the sessions more enjoyable. (Garreth, interview)</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section12-1321103X13478863">
<title>Category 2: Music-making as a means for interactions with others and reminiscing</title>
<p>Category 2 had one participant, Martha. Martha enjoyed the interaction with the children and other seniors but also engaged in music-making because music brought back significant musical memories from her past.</p>
<p>Martha was born in 1919 and lived on her own in a flat provided by sheltered housing accommodation in East London. A carer, who washed her and prepared her meals, visited her twice a day, and her son and one of her grandchildren visited her every evening. She was an enthusiastic participant in the music sessions and expressed an interest in being interviewed about her involvement in the project. During the face-to-face interview, Maria asked Martha about her musical background and her experience from the music project. Martha replied that she liked the song “Mamma Mia,” which was rehearsed during the sessions. She also liked opera, her favourite aria was “Nessun Dorma,” and she enjoyed watching André Rieu from Vienna on the TV. With regard to the things she enjoyed the most about the project, Martha referred to playing small percussion instruments and singing, and added that she would like the group to sing “Champagne Charlie” because this song reminded her of her late husband and her favourite singer Gracie Fields.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Maria:</speaker>
<p>Last time you told us about Champagne Charlie.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Martha:</speaker>
<p>[laughing] Oh, yes. That was years and years ago that was about. It must have been charming because it used to be my husband’s. He used to sing it. [Martha is singing “Champagne Charlie is my name, Champagne Charlie is my name …”]. I can’t remember the other words. The other song is “I am Burlington Bertie, I rise at ten thirty” [she is singing these lines]. They are all Maxy Miller’s … And “Daisy Daisy” [she is singing that one, too]. Have you ever heard of Gracie Fields? … She used to sing “Daisy”… She always used to sing “Daisy Daisy”. And years and years ago when I was in my teens I was in service and I was working in Belsize Park. I looked after in the house, you know. And he was a barrister, the people that I worked for and the garden in the house where I worked in Hampstead was attached to the garden of another house that was in Finchley Road. And I found out that Gracie Fields … she used to go in the garden singing because she used to have a lot of children …</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>My dear husband, he had Alzheimer’s. So I would remind him and he would remind me of songs I couldn’t remember. At his funeral they played “Champagne Charlie is my name.” I lost him just before Christmas. He was 94. Seventy years we have been married.</p>
</speech>
<p>The principal music facilitator also recollected how enthusiastic Martha was when she sang the song “Mamma Mia” during the music sessions and how participation in the music sessions had a positive impact on Martha’s morale after her husband had passed away.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[At the music session] we did the Abba [song] for the first week and maybe I thought it was quite interesting to see, you know, Martha, 92, singing Abba, really involved, you know, no questioning of anything! Nobody was like, “What’s this?” Everyone is singing away, heartfelt and again for me … that was bit of an eye opener, too… (Interview 1)</p>
<p>Going back to Martha, after Christmas her husband has passed away and she was in a quite bad way … she was very teary and … We were not sure whether she would actually come but she did and she was very much in the moment of the grief but she did leave smiling and laughing and, you know, coming in all teary … (Interview 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>During an interview with the scheme manager, it was revealed that Martha had benefited greatly from participating in the sessions because she left her room more often, she socialized with others and music “lifted her spirits.” In particular, the scheme manager explained:<disp-quote>
<p>For me the benefits would be that people I would never thought that would come out and socialize did come out. Especially for Martha; I thought she benefited a lot from this because, you know, she doesn’t go out that much and she was able to interact with others and the music … I think that was one thing she was excited to come to. Sometimes, when she wasn’t even feeling well, when I said “Come out for a little while” – she came out, you know. So I do think she really made an effort although she wasn’t feeling well. She came out for the music and she really did enjoy it. It lifted her spirits.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Martha got involved in musical activities because she liked listening to music, particularly opera. Participation in group singing was an opportunity for her to remember songs of her times and songs that her husband sang to her. Music participation had a positive impact on her emotional well-being especially during a period of distress after her husband’s death. It also had a positive social impact, offering her opportunities to socialize with other seniors in the housing scheme as well as children in the intergenerational project.</p>

<title>Category 3: Music-making as a means for interaction with others and for developing a new skill</title>
<p>Anne and Ian were the two participants in this category who joined the music sessions because they enjoyed interacting with others and because they saw it as an opportunity to keep active and learn new skills. Anne enjoyed singing and playing the djembe and Ian got involved in singing and group composition.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>As soon as we warmed up and we started singing there was a lovely feeling of heart being in harmony. It was hard work, it was a big commitment, we rehearsed for six months but it was worth every minute of it really … In school I had so many bad experiences in music and they [facilitators] were so encouraging and although you think you haven’t got the ability, you do really. They coaxed a good sound out of us all and it has been a wonderful experience and working with all the kids as well. (Ian, TH)</p>
<p>I am so looking forward to it [the final concert]. Because I have no tune to my ears and I am getting through this. I don’t know how the hell and I think it is wonderful. And I am already there. I tell you, I am over the moon every time. I feel so happy. Every time I started singing people said “shut up,” “be quiet.” But here I am told to do it. (Anne, Interview)</p>

<title>Category 4: Returning to active music-making after several years</title>
<p>Rose, Hugh and Samir recollected playing musical instruments as children and were excited by the prospect of playing musical instruments again. Hugh and Samir brought their own musical instruments, a recorder and karkabou, an Algerian percussion instrument, and played during the sessions and at the final concert. Rose, who used to play the violin, played the metallophone during the final concert. Rose mentioned in her questionnaire, interview and TH video that she enjoyed the music sessions because she could listen to the cello performances of the assistant facilitator and “discuss music” with the group members.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Participation in music helps me to remain active and strong…</p>
<p>… I was playing karkabou… Just goes like this, from father to son and then from son to the – it is this family … My grandfather was, like a sheikh of a group. My great-grandfather gave it to my grandfather and is going in the blood like this. And one of my brothers is playing … (Samir, Interview)</p>
<p>It is really something that I have been waiting for a long time I think … [What encouraged me to join was] my desire to sing and play music … I learned to play the piano as a boy and then lost out due to going to [African country] with my parents at 11 years old. I re-started playing in [different African country] at 33; but stopped again due to discouragement, the lack of support and opportunity to play in public. I have now purchased a recorder (wind instrument) and I am learning to read and play music again, a thing I would never thought I would be able to do now I am 74. (Hugh, Q2)</p>
<p>Well, I did it [the violin] with a local teacher but I did my exams at Guildhall … It’s good being with people who appreciate music and we can talk about it, because lots of people they aren’t really that much interested in it, are they? So, it is good doing that down here, yes … I like the percussion and listening to [facilitator] playing the cello? (Rose, Interview)</p>

<title>Category 5: Music-making as a means for creative self-expression</title>
<p>Rick, born in 1918, saw the music sessions as an opportunity to create songs with a special meaning for him and share them with the group during the music sessions.</p>
<p>Rick’s favourite music was songs by Joe Longthorne, which he played as background to the face-to-face interview. Rick led a very active life. He had attended computer classes offered in the sheltered housing where he lived in the year before the project, and during the year of the project he went to the gym on a weekly basis to train. In the summer months he volunteered at the gym to “tape-up” the boxers and got free breakfast and free access to big tournaments in return.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I don’t box no more. I do weights. And I go there in the summer when the trainers are out and the boys are training and the trainers tell me to tape the boys up. It saves them a job … And they are good to me because my breakfast there costs me nothing each morning. And on a big tournament I will go with them.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The fact that music sessions started one year after his computer classes had ceased gave him great satisfaction because he had the opportunity to remain active and enjoy social interactions.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I would attend more to anything like that. Life can be pretty boring in a place like that. I mean, I am out every day. I don’t stay in but a lot of people don’t move and there is nothing in their life. They look at television. But when they come [the musicians], we are talking and laughing and singing and it’s great.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, joining the music session turned out to be more of a self-exploratory journey for Rick. In the face-to-face interview Rick said that what he enjoyed the most about the music session, although he found them “a bit of a highbrow,” was playing the electric piano and understanding the lyrics of the songs. He also talked about his life; the fact that he never played any musical instrument – unlike his siblings and father who all played the piano; his years in prison and how joining the Sunday choir, despite being a “growler,” was an opportunity to avoid heavy chores and to belong to a group, “gang” in prison language.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I was with the [name] gang. And that was well respected. No one would interfere with them. And I was with them so I was left alone … We couldn’t sing. None of us. But we’ve done the jobs to get out of the way and have an easy time on Sundays. And you got a better food on a Sunday! … But it was growlers.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A few weeks after the sessions had begun Maria had an interview with the principal music facilitator who revealed that Rick had asked her for private tuition in creating song lyrics. One-to-one support from the music facilitator combined with Rick’s rich life experiences released his creative spirit. During the first term of the project the music facilitator encouraged the group to work collaboratively to create lyrics and short riff melodies that could lead to a song. This idea inspired Rick to privately (and secretly) start writing his own lyrics. The facilitator remembered how Rick initially lacked the confidence to claim his song and how later on, after the song was very well received by the group, he became more confident and proud, and made plans to create more songs.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>He was incredibly nervous about his song, to begin with. To the extent of not wanting anyone to know he’s written anything and kept saying, “Oh, are they going to laugh at me? Are they going to laugh at me?” He just kept saying and repeating this. And just saying how he didn’t think it was very good and all this kind of stuff. But the fact that it was affirmed that it was quite a good song and everyone enjoyed it, I think, it’s a real development … There is another song he wants to do. He is planning other work now.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The facilitator explained that initially there was a lot of fear from Rick and the other seniors in creating music because they didn’t perceive themselves as musicians and they didn’t feel that composing a song was appropriate for them. However, after a couple of weeks of music sessions Rick created the lyrics to a song called “I’m Sorry Now” that talked about his regret for “causing” pain to his wife when he got into prison. Having experienced success as a song-writer, Rick’s second song “In the Middle of a Kiss” was created a year after the first one. It was much longer in duration and it talked about a successful love that “passed the test of time” (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1321103X13478863">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>During the second term of the music programme Rick asked the music facilitators to show him how to play some chords on the electric keyboard so that he could accompany the rest of the group when they sang or played percussion instruments. When asked on the second questionnaire what might make the music activity he was part of even more enjoyable, Rick replied that he “really enjoyed piano [keyboard] music,” probably indicating that he would like to engage with playing the keyboard more in the future. When asked if there had been any changes in his life in the last six months that had affected his taking part in the group activities, Rick replied that he had “tried to make verse,” demonstrating more confidence than earlier in talking about his creative activities.</p>
<p>Rick said in the TH video that he found the music sessions very inspiring and the music facilitator very supportive. He underlined that he did not miss a single rehearsal and that he was very proud of himself for creating something that people enjoyed.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When this project started in October last year I didn’t think it would last. I thought it was just a whim and it probably wouldn’t last and we would all get bored of it. But as it turned out it was very encouraging and we enjoyed every minute and we run through until May this year. We never missed a meeting, which was every Tuesday. We enjoyed it immensely. Z. [principal music facilitator] would give us every encouragement and especially with me. I wrote the words to a song and I didn’t think it was much good but she rather liked it and we have been playing it in the Barbican. I am very pleased, I am very happy! Everybody enjoyed it and the children as well!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For Rick, involvement in musical activities was not only an opportunity to socialize and keep active. Ultimately, it was a “cathartic” experience that offered an avenue for self-expression, creativity, and a way to resolve emotional tensions with memories from his past.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>There appears to be great variation in the ways that older learners experienced active music-making. The five categories describing this variation were presented here in a hierarchy of increasing complexity. For the participants of category 1, active music-making offered the opportunity to socialize and interact with others on a weekly basis, activities that are believed to enhance the sense of well-being in older people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1321103X13478863">Hays &amp; Minichiello, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1321103X13478863">Hillman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1321103X13478863">Iwasaki et al., 2010</xref>). For Martha (category 2) it was an opportunity to socialize and to reminisce about musical pieces related to important people and events in her life. As revealed in the interviews and questionnaire responses, the participants of categories 1 and 2 tended to value the non-musical benefits that they reaped from their participation in the sessions more than the musical benefits. On the other hand, the participants of the three subsequent categories not only valued social interactions through music-making but they also saw real potential in developing their musical skills. For Anne and Ian (category 3) the sessions helped them develop their singing and performance skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1321103X13478863">Clift et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1321103X13478863">Hallam et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, Hugh, Samir and Rose (category 4), took up a musical instrument again after many years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1321103X13478863">Gembris, 2008</xref>). For Rick, in category 5, active music-making was a means for creative self-expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1321103X13478863">Lally, 2009</xref>). “Creativity” is understood here as the generation of something new, related to “something happening within a person’s experience” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1321103X13478863">Reimer, 2003</xref>, p. 111) that has been brought to the surface through “mutuality, interaction and exchange between actors” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1321103X13478863">Burnard, 2012a</xref>, p. 15) such as the music learners and the music facilitator. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1321103X13478863">Amabile (1996</xref>, p. 5) termed these generative circumstances “creative situations.” Creativity is a vital element of a complete music education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1321103X13478863">Running, 2008</xref>), it arises in all people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1321103X13478863">Amabile, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1321103X13478863">Burnard, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1321103X13478863">2012b</xref>), and it matters to different people for different reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1321103X13478863">Csikszentmihalyi, 1999</xref>). In order for creativity to be meaningful to all learners the tasks given to the music learners need to be purposeful, to facilitate progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1321103X13478863">Hallam &amp; Rogers, 2010</xref>) and to provide educational experiences that “anticipate the nature of the learners’ lives” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1321103X13478863">Lapidaki, de Groot and Stagkos, 2012</xref>, p. 385). The confluence of these elements in the programme in focus led to Rick’s enthusiastic involvement in the session and his self-expression through songwriting.</p>
<p>Martha’s and Rick’s perspectives and experiences on active music-making have been selected and discussed in greater detail because they demonstrate how creativity and musical enjoyment are sustained and can flourish in the Fourth Age. Martha’s and Rick’s differences in the level of participation in musical activities offer a lens through which to explore active music-making engagements in later life. For Martha active music-making allowed “sharing and connecting” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1321103X13478863">Hays &amp; Minichiello, 2005</xref>) with other people. Listening to music in her room alleviated her loneliness. Making music in the group helped her interact with other seniors and children, it supported her during her bereavement, it increased her enjoyment of performing contemporary songs such as “Mamma Mia” and it encouraged the recollection of songs from her past. These songs allowed reminiscing to music that was connected to life events and important people in her life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1321103X13478863">Flowers &amp; Murphy, 2001</xref>). For Rick, active music-making offered him a creative platform for composing song lyrics, collaborating with other seniors and with musicians to put melody to his song, and for learning how to play some chords on the keyboard to accompany others. Furthermore, it rendered him the opportunity to perform his song in an established music venue in London, the Pit Theatre at the Barbican Centre.</p>
<p>Like prior phenomenographic research on the variations in the ways that instrumental and vocal students experience learning music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1321103X13478863">Reid, 2001</xref>) and on ways the choral conducting students experience choral conducting education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1321103X13478863">Varvarigou, 2009</xref>), this study showed that owing to their life histories and rich life experiences older learners do not comprise a homogenous group but they have, instead, different needs and aspirations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1321103X13478863">Findsen, 2005</xref>). These, of course, are not the only ways that seniors could experience active music-making but they were the ones experienced by the participants of this programme. Moreover, we could not claim that the same participants are not capable of experiencing music-making in a different way but, given the data collected, these were the five categories that emerged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1321103X13478863">Marton &amp; Booth, 1997</xref>). Marton (1980, p. 186) observed that “differences in the conception of various aspects of reality” can be found not only between individuals but also within individuals, so it is possible that over time participants could change ways of engaging with active music-making.</p>
<p>The second myth of considering seniors as individuals of diminishing capacity, who prefer passive activities and sedate music, was dispelled by the examples of Martha, Anne, Ian, Rose, Hugh, Samir, and Rick. Regardless of the natural physical deterioration that comes to the body with age, the mental and emotional energy of these participants demonstrated how much older learners can achieve in music given sufficient opportunity, motivation, and support from the music facilitators and their environment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1321103X13478863">Kellman (1986)</xref> emphasized that older adults have the capacity to be creative and that the arts “can benefit older adults by providing entertainment, meaningful leisure activity, social contact and creative outlets that enable them to gain flexibility, a feeling of personal worth and a sense of control” (p. 31). Rick’s achievement in composing his own song and performing it in the concert showed how active musical engagement became a “meaningful leisure activity” that gave Rick confidence and a sense of self-worth for creating something that has been liked and enjoyed by others. It also motivated him to produce more songs and to learn to play some chords on the piano (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1321103X13478863">Rusinek, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The examples provided by Rick and the category 3 and 4 participants dispelled the third myth that older learners are dependent consumers and not creators of music. This finding echoes the findings from Allison’s study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1321103X13478863">2008</xref>), which suggested that, through songwriting, seniors continued to produce cultural outputs that became an enduring part of the culture of their residential community. Reflections on life experiences, both positive (Martha’s husband and his singing of “Champagne Charlie”) and negative (Rick’s time in prison) brought a renewed orientation towards creative endeavours to the participants of the programme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1321103X13478863">Lapidaki et al., 2012</xref>). Notwithstanding some iconic examples of creative achievements in later life (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1321103X13478863">Hickson &amp; Housley, 1997</xref>), creativity is not the preserve of the great and gifted nor is it limited to young people. Rather, creativity is “an attribute of every individual” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1321103X13478863">Amabile, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1321103X13478863">Hickson &amp; Housley, 1997</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1321103X13478863">
<title>Implications for practice</title>
<p>Although further research is needed that will test the applicability of these findings in a variety of musical contexts (e.g. choir, instrumental groups, music appreciation groups), there are several implications for musicians who work with older adults. Facilitators of musical activities can be guided in developing strategies for differentiation, responding to the diverse needs of heterogeneous groups. The issues of decrepitude and dependence amongst Third and Fourth Age learners may be counteracted through strategies that focus on tasks that capitalize on reflection of life experiences and creativity, as well as by using approaches that foster peer-learning and sharing of prior knowledge.</p>
<p>Practical suggestions for music facilitators arise from the analysis. Participants should be consulted about repertoire that they would like to perform. YouTube is a very useful resource for finding older songs, but it is also beneficial to introduce participants to music that is enjoyed by the facilitator but is less familiar to participants. Usually the response is positive. Martha’s example of requesting Gracie Fields’ songs provides an indication to music facilitators of the significance of musical memories and of preferences that their participants might have that need to be taken into consideration when facilitators choose repertoire for the sessions. Also, her enjoyment of “Mamma Mia” shows that older learners are open to learning new repertoire that is unfamiliar. Opportunities for active music-making also need to be open access (no prior experience required, no auditions), so that participants such as Ian and Anne, who did not initially consider themselves musical or had negative musical experiences from their school years, can be encouraged to (re-)engage with music. In addition, there need to be opportunities for progression from beginner to more advanced levels. In the music groups in focus, Hugh and Samir brought their own musical instruments to the sessions, which allowed them to build on existing musical skills and understanding. Facilitators should also be encouraged to introduce creative activities such as songwriting (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1321103X13478863">Lally, 2009</xref>). This might be more appropriate in smaller than in bigger groups but it can definitely encourage collaboration, group creativity, the articulation of the participants’ own insights and can contribute to setting collaborative and individual goals. Finally, participants need to be given opportunities to perform because performances are crucial to facilitate motivation and social affirmation.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The findings reported in this article highlight that active participation in creative musical activities can foster a sense of competence, purpose, and personal growth in older learners. The myths outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1321103X13478863">Findsen (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1321103X13478863">Dabback (2005)</xref> provided a useful framework for exploring possible underlying assumptions and developing positive and creative responses to these. The notion that older people are all the same and that they are decrepit and dependent consumers needs to be dispelled. Facilitators of musical activities, therefore, need to develop a wide repertoire of strategies to meet the diverse needs of their participants in activities that are creative and meaningful; where each individual makes a valued contribution and also progresses towards personal and collective goals. The key implication for music facilitators is that older people continue as creative individuals through the Third and Fourth Ages and that engagement in expressive, creative activities can in turn support healthy ageing. Such activities also give participants a sense of confidence and self-worth and help dispel myths about their abilities and their life motivations.</p>
