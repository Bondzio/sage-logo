<abstract>
<p>Focusing specifically on adolescents forced to relocate after Hurricane Katrina, the study looks closely at the role of schools in helping adolescents adapt after a natural disaster. Data collected from 46 middle and high school students across a 6-month period demonstrate that those who showed the greatest improvements in their well-being were those who sought help from their teachers, whose new school created a milieu of cooperation, and who were placed in a school that neither went overboard trying to help nor ignored their special needs. The article concludes with recommendations for schools seeking to maximize the welfare of their students.</p>

<p>Scholars have observed posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as well as other characteristics of distress in children following the traumatic events of natural disasters. Stress symptoms were observed in child survivors of Hurricane Andrew in 1992 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042085911416011">Jones et al., 2001</xref>; Vernberg et al., 1996; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042085911416011">Vogel &amp; Vernberg, 1993</xref>) and Hurricane Mitch in 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042085911416011">Goenijian et al., 2001</xref>). In a comprehensive analysis of the literature, Vogel and Vernberg noted studies finding high levels of fear, depression, survival guilt, and physical complaints, as well as studies demonstrating reduced academic performance and abilities to concentrate among child survivors.</p>
<p>Natural disasters destroy physical structures, but they also splinter social networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042085911416011">Kaniasty, Norris, &amp; Murrell, 1990</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042085911416011">Milne (1977)</xref> assessed the impact on children who were forced to leave Darwin, Australia, because of Cyclone Tracy. Those who left the city fared worse emotionally than those who stayed, and children who never returned to the city, even after its reconstruction, seemed to suffer the greatest. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042085911416011">Kilic et al. (2006)</xref> found similar results among adults displaced by a 1999 earthquake in Turkey. Researchers found higher levels of depression among adults who evacuated than among those who stayed despite the destruction and chaos of life in the earthquake-torn city. Both Milne and Kilic et al. conclude that it was the disruption to support systems that lead to the poorer outcomes among evacuated individuals.</p>
<p>Hurricane Katrina struck the Mississippi and Louisiana coast in August 2005. Although the winds were downgraded to Level 3 by the time the hurricane hit landfall, the storm surge was enough to destroy villages along the Gulf and topple levees in New Orleans. Very quickly, 80% of New Orleans was submerged, leaving tens of thousands of residents homeless. Many residents were able to flee the area before the hurricane struck, moving in with family members, taking available hotel rooms, or camping in their cars away from the winds and water. Others were less fortunate, and only after the water began to rise were they evacuated from the city. The Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan (DFW) area, 500 miles northwest of the Gulf coast, was a destination for many, including families with school-age children. Within a week of the hurricane when it was clear that New Orleans and parts of the Gulf coast would remain uninhabitable for a while, families settled into their new temporary homes, and children were enrolled in local schools. In this article, we examine the physical and psychosocial well-being of teenage students relocated to the DFW area, investigating specifically the potential role that schools played in helping the adolescents adjust.</p>
<p>Every year hurricanes strike the coast of the United States, and sometimes the damage is extreme. Hurricane Katrina devastated the city of New Orleans, and because of the demographics of New Orleans, its impacts disproportionately affected lower-income urban African Americans. At the time Hurricane Katrina struck, 28% of the population of New Orleans was living below the poverty line (U.S. Census Bureau, 2007), 67% of the residents were African American, and 84% of the poor residents were African American. Although the hurricane made no discrimination in its destruction, among those least capable of exiting beforehand were the poor; hence, the poor, largely African American residents of New Orleans were those most likely to have experienced the worst of the storm.</p>

<title>Support Networks</title>
<p>For children, the family is a key source of support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042085911416011">Cochran, Larner, Riley, Gunnarsson, &amp; Henderson, 1990</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042085911416011">Furstenberg, Cook, Eccles, Elder, and Sameroff (1999)</xref> observed in their ground-breaking study of urban youth, parents act as mediators between the negative (or positive) aspects of the community and the well-being of their children. Thus, children in seemingly dysfunctional neighborhoods can nonetheless succeed when they have a parent helping them navigate the potential pitfalls. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042085911416011">Tinsley, Nussbaum, and Richards (2007)</xref> seconded Furstenberg et al.’s findings with a sample of youth living in a dangerous neighborhood of Chicago. The youth studied by Tinsley et al. were best able to navigate through the daily hassles of the neighborhood when they had supportive family members. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042085911416011">Marshall, Noonan, McCartney, Marx, and Keefe (2001)</xref> found that African American families were more likely than either White or Latino families to live within walking distance of extended family members, and they were more likely to have extended family members helping to care for their children. Furthermore, regardless of race or ethnicity, the authors discovered that children whose parents had closer ties to networks (family or otherwise) tended to be more socially adept, show fewer signs of depression, and performed better in their schoolwork. To a significant degree, Marshall et al. note, the effects of networks on children is mediated through their parents. Networks influence parents’ interactions with their children, which in turn impact the well-being of the children.</p>
<p>Of course, the family is not the only source of support, and in fact, as children enter adolescence, other groups—primarily peers—become even more significant than family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042085911416011">Furman &amp; Buhrmester, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042085911416011">Rubin, Bukowski, &amp; Parker, 1998</xref>). Peers influence the behaviors of adolescents in many ways, including the likelihood that they will smoke or use illegal drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042085911416011">Ennett et al., 2006</xref>), skip school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042085911416011">Hartnett, 2008</xref>), participate in physical activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042085911416011">Salvy et al., 2008</xref>), among many others. Furthermore, not only peers but other adults, including non-kin relationships, are often part of the social network web of adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042085911416011">Cochran et al., 1990</xref>). Significant adults can help children cope with the aftermath of a disaster. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042085911416011">Cryder and colleagues (2006)</xref>, for example, discovered that children who had significant others in their lives available to give them social and emotional support demonstrated greater coping skills following a disastrous flood when compared to children who lacked strong social support.</p>

<title>School as a Resource</title>
<p>Children spend a good part of their day in school, and school officials have the potential to provide significant assistance to students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042085911416011">Wolmer and colleagues (2005)</xref> learned that when child survivors of a major earthquake in Turkey participated in a teacher-led support program, they showed far fewer signs of posttraumatic grief and dissociation symptoms than did children who had not participated. According to their assessment, the teachers made the difference, even though they were empowered through the curriculum. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042085911416011">Prinstein and colleagues (1996)</xref> also recognized the importance of teachers (in addition to family and friends) in helping child survivors of Hurricane Andrew cope with their losses.</p>
<p>Despite their apparent value, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042085911416011">Jaycox et al. (2007)</xref> found that schools offered very little mental health support for child survivors of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. School administrators reported offering services only during the first few months following the disaster, and in many cases, determining which children were connected to which services tended to be happenstance. Moreover, even when there was a strong will to help, budgetary constraints prevented the initiation of substantial programs. Jaycox et al. discovered that some school personnel did not believe student survivors needed special attention. This point was also observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042085911416011">Martinez-Cosio, Barrett, and Ausbrooks (2008)</xref>. They found that some schools intentionally allowed students displaced by Hurricane Katrina to blend into the larger student body, believing that to target them for particular needs would be to reduce their likelihood of successful integration. On the other hand, Martinez-Cosio et al. also found school personnel who advocated seeking out the students and making sure their needs were addressed.</p>
<p>The focus of this article is on whether students fared better when their school left them to meld on their own with others or when their school actively sought to help them. We also examine whether students who sought help from a teacher—regardless of the actions taken by the teacher—were doing better months after the relocation than were students who failed to connect. This article represents one aspect of a comprehensive research project examining the structural, cultural, and social conditions that enable adolescents to adjust to life following a catastrophic event. The goal of the broader research was to employ theoretical perspectives from education, sociology, and psychology to investigate three areas: (1) the characteristics of the adolescents evacuated into the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area in terms of their economic background, family structure, race, and ethnicity; (2) how the students progressed in terms of their academic, social, and psychological well-being, including how their welfare changed over time and the extent to which the school environment interacted with the changes; and (3) how schools responded to the influx, including changes they made to accommodate the new students and how campus leadership and organizational structure within the schools affected the direction and speed of the response.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section4-0042085911416011">
<title>Participants and Procedures</title>
<p>Data were collected from two groups: middle school and high school students who attend Dallas-Fort Worth area public schools and teachers working in those same schools.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0042085911416011">
<title>Schools</title>
<p>In December 2005, we approached representatives of 12 school districts in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area identified because of their higher numbers of Katrina evacuated students. By May 2006, two districts had agreed to allow the study to take place in their districts, and in October 2006, two more districts agreed to participate in the study. Seven districts preferred not to participate, and one district did not respond to our request despite numerous attempts to reach district personnel. We also approached a large Catholic high school in the area, but because the school had received only a handful of Katrina-displaced students, it declined to participate. We worked directly with 11 middle schools and 17 high schools (including two 9th-grade centers) within the districts to survey Katrina-evacuated students. Although baseline data were collected from students in 28 schools, not all students responded to the 6-month follow-up. Hence, only 19 schools (in the 4 school districts) were represented in the 6-month follow-up data.</p>
<p>Student enrollment in the schools included in the 6-month sample ranged from 600 to 3,300 students (<italic>M</italic> = 1,490), and as would be expected, middle schools (<italic>M</italic> = 995) tended to have a lower enrollment than high schools (<italic>M</italic> = 1,803). All of the schools had a majority-minority student body: 44% had more than half Latino students, and 11% had more than half African American students. The majority of the schools also had a higher percentage of economically disadvantaged students, ranging from 9.3% to 71%. Finally, all of the schools with reported data (13 of the 19) had student-to-counselor ratios higher than that recommended by the American School Counselor Association (250:1 for high school) as well as the national average ratio (229:1 for high schools in 2004-2005). The student-to-counselor ratios in the subsample of schools ranged from 304:1 to 597:1. Ratios were higher in the reporting high schools (455:1, <italic>n</italic> = 5) than in the middle schools (432:1, <italic>n</italic> = 8). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042085911416011">Table 1</xref> summarizes the school characteristics.</p>

<title>Students</title>
<p>Within each school, counselors or other office administrators delivered to all known Katrina-evacuated students notices of the study along with parental permission slips. In the description of the study, students were told the purpose of the study (“to see how well teenagers are doing after being relocated to the Dallas-Fort Worth area after Hurricane Katrina”), what was to be asked of them (to complete a baseline, 6-month, and 12-month survey asking about their “health and emotions” as well as about “the support you receive from your family, your school, and the new community you moved into”), and that they would be given a US$20 gift card if they participated in the 6-month and 12-month follow-up surveys.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0042085911416011">1</xref></sup> Given the requirements of the university Institutional Review Board, no student was allowed to participate in the study unless he or she returned signed permission from a parent or legal guardian.</p>
<p>Eligible students completed the initial survey during school hours. The survey, which took approximately 30 min to complete, was based on the CHIP-AE<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0042085911416011">2</xref></sup> but also included questions about students’ family, their school, church (if applicable), friends, and their interactions with other public and private agencies. All students were asked to complete the same survey instrument 6 months later. (Those who completed the initial survey in May 2006 were also asked to complete the same survey 12 months later, but those results are not discussed in this article.) The 6-month follow-up surveys were mailed to the addresses given by the students on the initial survey. No student was sent a follow-up unless he or she agreed to participate further.</p>
<p>A total of 120 students participated in the initial survey: 63 completed the survey in spring 2006, and 57 completed the survey in the early months of 2007. Seven students did not provide a follow-up address. Hence, 6-month follow-up surveys were mailed to only 113 students. Forty-six useable surveys (41%) were completed and returned; 18 were returned address unknown. Discounting the nonworking addresses, we achieved a 48% response rate on the 6-month survey. Although the response rate is within the expectations of social science research, and not at all surprising given the mobility of the evaluated families, the useable sample was nonetheless small.</p>
<p>The Katrina-evacuated students who participated in the follow-up sample were overwhelmingly likely to self-identify as Black or mixed-race including Black (92%). Two students considered themselves Asian (4%), one as White (2%), and one as Native American (2%). Although there were a few Latino students in the full sample, none completed the 6-month follow-up survey, and hence, none are included in the subsample analyzed here.</p>
<p>There were more female than male Katrina-displaced students included in the subsample (58% girls as compared to 42% boys). The sample was equally dispersed between younger teens (57% teens aged 15 or younger) and older teens, with an average age of 15 years. The household size of the displaced students tended to be relatively small (average= 4.3 people), with only 20% living in households with 6 or more people. Finally, more than a third of the students lived in mother-only households, and 11% lived with no parent. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042085911416011">Table 2</xref> summarizes the characteristics of the student sample.</p>

<p>Students in the sample were enrolled in Grades 6 through 12, and the overwhelming majority (91%) was in the grade appropriate for his or her age (e.g., 12-year-olds were in either 6th or 7th grade, 15-year-olds were in either 9th or 10th grade, etc.). Three students were in grades lower than expected, and one student—a 15-year-old in the 11th grade—was in a grade above what would have been expected given that student’s age.</p>

<title>Teachers</title>
<p>School officials (most often a counselor, but in a few instances it was the principal) were given three to five surveys to distribute to teachers who had been on campus when the Katina students arrived. The survey asked teachers about the leadership of their school, the decision-making policies, and the actions the school had taken when the Katrina-displaced students arrived. The sampling of teachers was left to the administrator. The teacher packets included a letter detailing the purpose of the project, an informed consent form they were to sign and return, a survey, and a stamped return envelope. The 8-page survey was designed to take no more than 15 min to complete. Teachers who returned the survey were sent a US$10 bookstore gift card in appreciation for their participation. A total of 65 teachers, representing 29 schools, completed the survey; however, 22 of the teachers worked in one of 10 schools in which no Katrina-displaced students completed the 6-month follow-up survey. Thus, the working sample was 43 teachers representing 19 schools.</p>
<p>The majority of participating teachers were female (74%) and non-Hispanic Whites (70%). The sample included 10 Black teachers (23%), two of whom identified as American Indian (5%), but there were no Latinos. More than 40% of the teachers taught English or reading, and another 21% taught social studies or history. The others spanned a number of disciplines. Two thirds of the participating teachers had been in the profession for at least 8 years, and none was a first-year teacher at the time of Hurricane Katrina. On the other hand, 2 of the 43 (5%) were new to the school the year of Hurricane Katrina. Still, 65% had taught at the same school for at least 3 years, and more than a third had been at the school for at least 8 years (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0042085911416011">Table 3</xref>.)</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section9-0042085911416011">
<title>Student Measures</title>
<p>The survey instrument was based on the Child Health and Illness Profile, Adolescent Edition (CHIP-AE), with questions added to assess school and other support services. (For more information on the CHIP-AE, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.outcomes-trust.org/instruments.htm">http://www.outcomes-trust.org/instruments.htm</ext-link>, accessed October 10, 2008.) The CHIP-AE is a nationally used instrument designed to measure adolescent physical and emotional health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042085911416011">Starfield et al., 2000</xref>). The instrument includes six domain scales (satisfaction, discomfort, resilience, risks, disorders, and achievement) with subdomains under each. Because of time and privacy limitations placed on us by the participating school districts, some subdomains were omitted from the survey. In this article, we focus on three domains: discomfort, risk taking, and school achievement.</p>
<sec id="section10-0042085911416011">
<title>Discomfort domain</title>
<p>Two subdomains of discomfort are included here: physical discomfort and emotional discomfort. The original physical discomfort index was designed to consist of 24 items for girls and 23 items for boys. The scale constructed with this sample had only 22 items because 2 items addressing physical discomfort with sexual organs and menstrual problems were omitted from the instrument at the request of school officials. The 22 items included on the physical discomfort scale asked students how many days in the past month they (1) felt really sick, (2) woke up feeling tired, (3) tired easily or felt like they had no energy, (4) had watery or itchy eyes, (5) had skin problems, (6) had a cough, (7) had fever or chills, (8) were dizzy, (9) were wheezing or had trouble breathing, (10) had chest pain, (11) had a headache, (12) had soreness in muscles or joints, (13) had a stomach ache, (14) had bothersome pain, (15) vomited or felt like vomiting, (16) had trouble urinating, (17) had poor appetite, (18) had diarrhea, (19) had constipation, (20) were pain free, (21) felt really healthy, and (22) lost weight without trying. Cronbach’s alpha found by the developers ranged from .80 to .85, and on the current survey, it was .89. The second subdomain, emotional discomfort, included all 14 items from the original scale. Students were asked how many days in the past month they (1) had trouble sleeping, (2) felt depressed, (3) had trouble relaxing, (4) were nervous, (5) were moody, (6) were irritable or grouchy, (7) cried a lot, (8) were afraid of things, (9) tried to hurt or kill themselves, (10) woke up refreshed, (11) felt like they did right, (12) felt loved, (13) vomited on purpose, and (14) binged. The developers’ Cronbach’s alphas ranged from .72 to .84; the Cronbach’s alpha on the current data was .81. The overall test–retest reliability of the discomfort domain was .82 as determined from the instrument developers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042085911416011">Starfield et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0042085911416011">
<title>Risk domain</title>
<p>The risk domain as designed had three subdomains: individual risks, threats to achievement, and peer influences. In the original version, the individual risk scale was composed of 18 items. However, because school districts asked that questions addressing illegal behavior be removed (they did not give us a justification but refused to allow the questions to be asked), the subdomain as measured included only 11 items addressing (1) risky bicycle and motorcycle riding, (2) household rule breaking, (3) shoplifting, and (4) one question about illegal drug use. The scale as designed achieved a Cronbach’s alpha between .77 and .87; as measured, it had an alpha of .69.</p>
<p>The threats to achievement subscale as measured in this study included all but two of the original items (omitted were a question about carrying weapons and one about belonging to a gang). The remaining 13 items asked respondents when was the last time that they (1) ran away from home, (2) threatened to hurt someone, (3) physically attacked someone, (4) stole something worth more than US$10, (5) destroyed another’s property, and (6) were expelled from school. It also asked how many days in the past month respondents (7) lied or cheated, (8) argued a lot, (9) hung around with others who get in trouble, (10) disobeyed at school, (11) had trouble with teachers, (12) had trouble concentrating at school, and (13) had trouble getting school work done. Cronbach’s alpha was .83 (both as measured with the current data and from the developers’ data).</p>
<p>The peer influence subdomain included four items: (1) number of friends who smoke, (2) number of friends who drink alcohol, (3) number of friends who smoke marijuana, and (4) number of friends who use other drugs (omitted was number of friends who have sex). The full 5-item scale had a Cronbach’s alpha between .72 and .83; as measured with 4 items, it reached an alpha of .86. The overall risk domain had a test–retest reliability of .93.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0042085911416011">
<title>Achievement domain</title>
<p>The final domain included on the CHIP-AE measured achievement. An academic achievement index was computed by asking respondents about their performance in school coursework, homework, honor roll, school awards, school club officer status, and whether they failed a class or grade. The test–retest reliability as measured by the developers ranged from .58 to .63. Too few respondents were employed to allow for measurement of work performance, the second subdomain in the achievement category. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0042085911416011">Table 4</xref> summarizes all the scales.</p>

<title>Teacher Measures</title>
<sec id="section14-0042085911416011">
<title>School-level decision making</title>
<p>Two scales describe the decision-making models of the school administration as perceived by the teachers. Cooperative decision making was measured through 10 items. Specifically, teachers were asked whether there was an active effort within their school (1) “to solve school problems without placing blame or finding fault,” and (2) “to coordinate the activities of all the school’s decision-making bodies.” Teachers were asked whether when a problem arises in their school (3) “adults usually blame each other rather than look at the problem,” (4) “teachers usually blame the administration,” or (5) “the school administration usually blames the teachers.” They were also asked to what extent (6) “decisions about school policy and goals are made by consensus,” (7) “staff relations are cooperative,” (8) “all members of the school community have a say in the decision making,” (9) “teachers and other staff members feel free to communicate with the principal,” and (10) “the channels of communication are open to teachers when they have a school-related problem.” The scale achieved a Cronbach’s coefficient alpha of .91. Scores ranged from 1 (<italic>noncooperative</italic>) to 5 (<italic>very cooperative</italic>), with an average score of 3.5 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.8). For the sake of student-level analyses, schools have been divided into those in which the teachers emphasized high levels of cooperative decision making (<italic>n</italic> = 5, <italic>M</italic> + 0.5 <italic>SD</italic>), average levels (<italic>n</italic> = 6, <italic>M</italic> ± 0.49 <italic>SD</italic>), and low levels (<italic>n</italic> = 7, <italic>M</italic> − 0.5 <italic>SD</italic>). The average measure was used to determine the school grouping when more than one teacher responded from the same school.</p>
<p>Democratic decision making was assessed through five questions: (1) “Students are involved in the decisions are policies that affect them,” (2) “Students are involved in decisions that affect school goals and objectives,” (3) “Administrators involve teachers in developing discipline rules,” (4) “Administrators involve teachers in determining school goals and objectives, and (5) “Administrators seek consensus rather than majority rule.” The scale, which ranged from 1 (<italic>low involvement</italic>) to 4 <italic>(high involvement</italic>), had a Cronbach’s alpha of .88. The average score was 2.4 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.8). Schools have also been divided into those in which the teachers emphasized high levels of democratic decision making (<italic>n</italic> = 2, <italic>M</italic> + 0.5 <italic>SD</italic>), average levels (<italic>n</italic> = 10, <italic>M</italic> ± 0.49 <italic>SD</italic>), and low levels (<italic>n</italic> = 6, <italic>M</italic> − 0.5 <italic>SD</italic>).</p>
<p>Although the three measures of decision making were conceptually somewhat different and, in a factor analysis, appeared as separate scales, they were nonetheless highly correlated. Schools that had a high level of cooperative decision making were also perceived by teachers to have greater democracy (<italic>r</italic> = .70, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Nonetheless, when schools were grouped into high, average, and low levels of the two types of decision making, there was not a one-to-one match. Hence, when analyzing the student-level data for the influence of the school decision-making environment, the scales are analyzed separately.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0042085911416011">
<title>School rules</title>
<p>Regardless the rigidity of rules, students may fair best when there is consistency. To test this, teachers were asked whether rules within their schools were (a) clearly enforced, (b) strictly enforced, (c) fairly administered, (d) contradictory, (e) not existent, (f) not enforced, and (g) not consistently enforced. The 7 items formed a scale with a Cronbach’s alpha of .89. The mean score on the scale ranging from 5 (<italic>consistent and fair</italic>) to 1 (<italic>inconsistent and unfair</italic>) was 3.7 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.8). For the sake of student-level analyses, schools were divided into those in which the teachers perceived strong consistency and fairness in rules (<italic>n</italic> = 9, <italic>M</italic> + 0.5 <italic>SD</italic>), average consistency (<italic>n</italic> = 4, <italic>M</italic> ± 0.49 <italic>SD</italic>), and low levels of consistency (<italic>n</italic> = 5, <italic>M</italic> − 0.5 <italic>SD</italic>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0042085911416011">
<title>School response to the influx</title>
<p>Teachers were asked whether, in their opinion, they and their school took proactive steps toward meeting the needs of the Katrina-displaced students. They were asked how much they agreed that (a) the principal solicited ideas from teachers, (b) teachers were asked to share ideas, (c) the principal asked teachers about their resource needs, (d) teachers met regularly together to discuss students’ progress, and (e) administrators set an example for treating students and parents fairly. The 5 items formed a single scale with Cronbach’s alpha of .83. The mean 4-point scale (1 = <italic>poor response</italic>, 4 = <italic>positive response</italic>) was 2.3 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.6). Judging from the teachers’ responses, six schools took little or no action to work cohesively for the students, seven schools took some actions, and four schools built a cohesive plan.</p>

<p>Student well-being showed improvement in some domains over the 6-month period between the baseline and follow-up survey. The greatest change was a noticeable decline in physical and emotional discomfort. Students also reduced their reported risk-taking behavior during the period, though there was no significant reduction in other risks (i.e., threats to achievement and peer influences).

<p>Over the 6-month period, boys experienced a greater decline in physical discomfort (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 2.4, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 1.7) than did girls (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 2.0, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 1.9); Pillai’s Trace, <italic>F</italic>(1, 39) = 4.46, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. The greatest improvements in physical discomfort were experienced by students between 14 and 15 years (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 2.2, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 1.6) of age, with marginal changes experienced by those younger than 14 (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 1.9, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 1.8) and those older than 15 (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 2.0, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 1.9); Pillai’s Trace, <italic>F</italic>(2, 39) = 5.84, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Students in the middle teen years reported the greatest decline in emotional discomfort (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 2.4, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 1.7) as compared to students younger than 14 (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 2.0, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 2.0) and those 16 and older (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 2.1, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 2.1)—Pillai’s Trace, <italic>F</italic>(2, 39) = 10.1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01—in the threats they faced to their academic achievement (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 2.5, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 1.9) as compared to the younger students who experienced a slight increase in threats (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 1.8, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 2.0) and older students who hardly changed (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 1.9, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 1.8)—Pillai’s Trace, <italic>F</italic>(2, 39) = 6.23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01—and in the strength of negative peer influences (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 2.7, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 2.4) as compared to a change from <italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 2.3 to <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 2.2 for younger teens and no change among older teens—Pillai’s Trace, <italic>F</italic>(2, 39) = 3.78, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. There were no gender or age differences over time in adolescent risk-taking behavior or in students’ academic achievement. More important, on all factors in which students in the 14- to 15-year-old group improved, they had been below the older or younger students at baseline. Thus, though there were age differences at baseline, 6 months later, the age differences had disappeared.</p>
<p>On the whole, students showed the greatest improvement in their physical and emotional discomfort levels and, to a lesser extent, in their risk-taking behavior. There were no overall improvements in other well-being factors, though students between the ages of 14 and 15 years were able to catch up to their younger and older peers. The next section examines whether school-level factors help determine which students improved.</p>

<title>Influence of Teachers</title>
<p>Some Katrina-evacuated adolescents were more likely than others to ask for help from their teachers. At baseline, 27 of the 45 students (60%) said they had talked with their teachers about a problem they were having related to the relocation. Whether students talked with their teachers about their Katrina-related needs did not appear to relate to any improvements in their personal and physical well-being 6 months later, but those who talked with a teacher did report fewer school-related problems 6 months later. Students who turned to their teachers for help reported declines in the threats they faced to academic success (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 2.2, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 1.9), whereas those who did not approach a teachers reported slightly more threats 6 months later (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 1.7, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 1.8); Pillai’s Trace, <italic>F</italic>(1, 43) = 3.16, <italic>p</italic> = .08. More significantly, those who talked with a teacher demonstrated higher academic performance 6 months later (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 2.6, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 2.9) as compared to those who did not seek out a teacher’s assistance (from 2.6 to 2.5); Pillai’s Trace, <italic>F</italic>(1, 43) = 4.62, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Thus, the data suggest that though teachers cannot solve all the issues faced by relocated students, they can at least resolve academic concerns.</p>

<sec id="section20-0042085911416011">
<title>Influence of the School Environment</title>
<p>Schools varied in size from student populations of fewer than 500 to more than 3,000. Students who attended the largest schools (those with more than 1,500 students) showed greater decreases in their emotional discomfort (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 3.0, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 2.2) than students in medium-sized schools (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 2.4, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 2.1) and small schools (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 2.6, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 3.1); Pillai’s Trace, <italic>F</italic>(2, 39) = 3.48, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. All 6 of the schools with more than 1,500 students were high schools, though 3 of the 7 medium-sized schools (43%) and half of the four small schools were also high schools. Furthermore, there was no significant relationship between emotional discomfort and whether the school was a high school or a middle school; Pillai’s Trace, <italic>F</italic>(1, 42) = 1.26, <italic>p</italic> = .27. The size of the student body mattered but not the grade levels of the school.</p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of the students in the sample self-identified as African American (92%). Students who attended a school that had between 25% and 50% Black students improved more in their level of physical discomfort (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 2.4, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 1.7) than either those who attended a school with fewer than 25% Black students (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 2.0, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 1.8) or those who attended a school with more than 50% Black students (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 1.8, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 1.9); Pillai’s Trace, <italic>F</italic>(2, 39) = 2.65, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10. Schools that had a high proportion of African American students had low proportions of Latino students, and vice versa. Thus, a more telling finding is that students who attended schools with fewer than 25% White students did not improve in their physical and emotional well-being as much as those in schools with 25% to 50% White students (there was no school with more than 50% White students). There was a greater decrease in physical discomfort among those in schools with more White students (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 2.2, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 1.6) than those with more minority students (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 1.9, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 2.0)—Pillai’s Trace, <italic>F</italic>(1, 40) = 10.09, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01—as well as a greater decrease in emotional discomfort (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 2.3, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 1.7) in schools with less than 25% Whites as compared to (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 2.2 and <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 2.2, no change) those in higher minority schools; Pillai’s Trace, <italic>F</italic>(1, 40) = 2.15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05.</p>
<p>Schools varied in the proportions of economically disadvantaged students they served. Katrina-displaced students who attended schools with fewer than 25% economically disadvantaged students reported a much greater decline in physical distress (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 3.1, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 1.6) than either students attending schools with 25% to 50% economically disadvantaged (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 1.9, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 1.6) or students attending schools with more than 50% economically disadvantaged (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 1.9, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 2.0); Pillai’s Trace, <italic>F</italic>(2, 39) = 12.63, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Students in schools with fewer economically disadvantaged students also reported a much greater decline in emotional distress (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 3.1, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 1.6) than either students attending schools with 25% to 50% economically disadvantaged students (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 2.0, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 1.8) or students attending schools with more than 50% economically disadvantaged students (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 2.2, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 2.1); Pillai’s Trace, <italic>F</italic>(2, 39) = 7.98, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Students in low economically disadvantaged schools experienced fewer threats to their academic success over time (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 3.2, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 1.8) as compared to those in schools with a moderate level (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 2.1, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 2.0) or high level (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 1.8, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 1.8) of economic disadvantage; Pillai’s Trace, <italic>F</italic>(2, 39) = 3.39, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. And they reported lower peer influence over time (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 3.7, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 2.3) as compared to those in schools with a moderate level (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 2.4, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 2.4) or high level (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 2.3, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 2.3) of economic disadvantage; Pillai’s Trace, <italic>F</italic>(2, 39) = 9.33, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Finally, whether the counselor-to-student ratio was less than or greater than the maximum recommended 400:1 made little difference in the well-being of the students.</p>
<p>For the most part, neither the students nor their families sought out any particular school. Instead they attended whichever school was closest to their temporary housing. When the baseline data were collected, students in the least economically disadvantaged schools by chance had the highest levels of physical and emotional distress, the greatest number of threats to their achievement, and were most influenced by peers. Six months later, these same students were reporting scores on the measures that were equal to or better than their peers in other schools. Thus, the change that occurred between baseline and 6 months moved the most distressed students closer to their Katrina-evacuated peers.</p>
<p>Teachers provided information on the decision-making style of the school administration. The data suggest that student physical well-being improved more over time when he or she was placed in a school in which teachers sensed that administrators followed a cooperative decision-making model. Among students enrolled in schools seen as the most cooperative, average physical discomfort level decreased from <italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 2.0 to <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 1.7; for those in the least cooperative environments the change was a slight increase from <italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 1.8 to <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 1.9. Change in physical discomfort was greatest for those students enrolled in schools seen by teachers as falling in the middle; their high-average discomfort level at baseline (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 2.3) decreased to <italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 1.7 6 months later; Pillai’s Trace, <italic>F</italic>(2, 40) = 2.46, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10. The changes in physical well-being among students were even greater when schools were divided into those in which principals actively sought teacher and student democratic consensus in decision making; Pillai’s Trace, <italic>F</italic>(2, 40) = 3.47, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. In the most democratic schools, averages decreased from <italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 1.9 to <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 1.8; in schools with a midlevel of democratic decision making from <italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 2.2 to <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 1.7 and in schools with little perceived democracy between the administration, teachers, and students, scores increased slightly from <italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 1.8 to <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 2.0. The level of cooperative and openness to democratic ideas did not relate to changes in emotional discomfort among the students or to any other measured domain.</p>
<p>In some schools, rules were clearly stated and enforced fairly. In other schools, there was less regularity or fairness in the implementation of rules. For the most part, the consistency of rules did not differentially affect the well-being of Katrina-displaced students, with one exception. Students in schools with the highest level of consistency improved their average academic achievement scores over time (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 2.4, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 2.8), whereas those in schools with some consistency (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 2.7, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 2.7) and those in schools with inconsistent implementation (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 2.6, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 2.6) failed to improve over time; Pillai’s Trace, <italic>F</italic>(2, 40) = 2.85, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10.</p>
<p>According to the teachers, some schools approached the influx of Katrina-displaced students with more proactive steps than did other schools. Of course, neither the school administrators nor the teachers had any say over which students would enter their school, but they could prepare themselves for whoever arrived. The data suggest that schools that took some proactive steps were more successful at improving the physical well-being of the students (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 2.2, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 1.6) than either schools that took few steps (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 1.9, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 1.8) or those that were staunchly proactive (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 2.2, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 2.3); Pillai’s Trace, <italic>F</italic>(2, 38) = 3.37, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10. The emotional discomfort of the students changed only slightly between those in highly proactive (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 2.6, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 2.8), moderately proactive (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 2.3, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 1.7), and not at all proactive (<italic>M</italic><sub>base</sub> = 1.9, <italic>M</italic><sub>6m</sub> = 1.8); Pillai’s Trace, <italic>F</italic>(2, 38) = 2.28, <italic>p</italic> = .11. Interestingly, whether schools prepared for the students or not related little to the academic threats and academic performance of the students.</p>
<p>It is difficult to determine whether size, minority composition, and economic disadvantage of the school made the difference or whether changes were influenced by the decision-making milieu, rule consistency, and proactive response of teachers and school administrators because the variables are interrelated. Smaller schools tended to have lower levels of cooperation between administrators and teachers, χ<sup>2</sup>(4) = 13.1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, and less democratic decision making, in the teachers’ views, χ<sup>2</sup>(4) = 19.2, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. The greatest degree of rule consistency was in medium-sized schools, though small schools were all equally likely to be inconsistent, χ<sup>2</sup>(4) = 13.9, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Larger and smaller schools were no different in their proactive measures. All the schools with more than 50% Black students scored low on teachers’ perception of cooperative decision making, χ<sup>2</sup>(4) = 20.0, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and democratic decision making, χ<sup>2</sup>(4) = 22.8, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Schools with proportions of Black students between 25% and 50% were more likely than others to be consistent and fair in their rules, χ<sup>2</sup>(4) = 14.1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, but all of the highly proactive schools had fewer than 25% Black students, χ<sup>2</sup>(4) = 15.7, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Schools with the highest proportion of economically disadvantaged students were more likely than other schools to have low cooperative, χ<sup>2</sup>(4) = 19.7, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, and democratic decision-making ratings, χ<sup>2</sup>(4) = 25.9, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; low consistency and fairness in rules, χ<sup>2</sup>(4) = 9.37, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; and high proactive scores, χ<sup>2</sup>(4) = 21.4, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Finally, and perhaps most important, neither school size and racial composition nor proportion of economically disadvantaged students related to the likelihood that a Katrina-evacuated student would seek help from a teacher.</p>

<title>Conclusions and Discussion</title>
<p>Schools are important in the lives of children in many ways. Data in this study show that schools can have a measureable impact on the well-being of distressed students. Students who reported the greatest suffering at baseline improved the most when they were fortunate enough to be enrolled in a school that had lower proportions of economically distressed students. Although limited to schools within Australia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042085911416011">Perry and McConney (2010)</xref> found a significant relationship between student academic achievement and the socioeconomic profile of the school, regardless of the economic background of the student. In part, the improvements among lower socioeconomic students, who, the literature suggests, tend to show lower levels of performance than their wealthier peers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042085911416011">Sirin, 2005</xref>, for example), may be due to the increased exposure to higher-achieving peers. However, the improvement in student well-being might also be attributable to the expanded resources available in these schools. With fewer economically dependent students, schools can focus more attention on academics and social needs of all students, including the evacuated students.</p>
<p>Economic distress also declined among evacuated students attending schools with a more even mix of racial or ethnic minority and White students. The devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina and the forced evacuation created a multigenerational disruption of families, which is particularly disturbing because family had represented a significant community base to many of the residents of New Orleans. Throughout their lives, many residents had been accustomed to being near family members and friends with whom they were in constant and close contact and who provided a social network on which they had depended for comfort, support, and well-being. Hurricane Katrina dislodged that social network, leaving many survivors socially isolated. Outsiders to their new schools, the Katrina-evacuated students—the vast majority of whom were African American but foreign to Texas—felt welcome in the ethnically and racially diverse schools where their uniqueness was less conspicuous. Quite likely, the school served to reduce the isolation they otherwise felt and enabled them to feel more comfortable seeking the help they needed.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042085911416011">Lee and Madyun (2008)</xref> discovered that Hmong students with limited English proficiency showed the highest level of improvement when their schools allowed them greater exposure to peers from different races. The Hmong children stepped out of their culture and, as a consequence, learned English and their academic subjects more quickly. Similarly, the evacuated students, the overwhelming majority of whom were African American and very likely had attended predominately minority schools before the hurricane, could meet and interact with students not only who had not experienced the trauma but also who came from different ethnic and cultural experiences. This experience might have further increased their confidence and diminished their sense of social isolation.</p>
<p>As the findings demonstrated, the school leadership milieu also related to student well-being. Katrina-evacuated students tended to show the greatest reduction in distress and greatest improvement in academics when they were enrolled in schools in which administrators created an administration-teacher-staff decision-making environment that promoted cooperation and consensus. This environment—perhaps indirectly—also conveyed to the students an atmosphere in which they could find support. Although unable because of limited variability to determine whether participatory leadership made a difference, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042085911416011">Opdenakker and Van Damme (2007)</xref> nonetheless found that teacher cooperation—likely stimulated by the quality of the school management—was highly associated with student performance in a sample of Flemish-speaking Dutch schools. The teacher cooperation, noted by Opdenakker and Van Damme, influenced other aspects of the learning environment, which in turn led to improved student math scores. Just as teachers can influence the academic atmosphere, so too can they change the social climate for students. Teachers who were accessible to students provided a support network that allowed anxious students an opportunity to improve academically. The results of this study suggest that schools can provide a place of stability and access to supportive adults, and these attributes seemed to make a difference in the lives of students evacuated following Hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p>Because teachers can play such a pivotal role in the academic as well as emotional well-being of traumatized youth, preparing them must be a high priority. Too many of the surveyed teachers expressed frustration at the lack of preparation they had to deal with the unique needs of the incoming evacuees. Teachers did not receive training either in how to address the academic needs of the students or in how to help the traumatized students cope in their new and strange surroundings, yet they were being asked for guidance by the students. Recognizing the important role filled by the teacher is the first step in helping teachers get the resources they need to best serve their students.</p>
<p>There is growing acceptance by education scholars as well as principals themselves that school leadership is most effective when the principal does not function alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042085911416011">Smylie, Conley, &amp; Marks, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042085911416011">Leithwood, Leonard, and Sharratt (1998)</xref> studied schools that were particularly successful at fostering a culture in which both students and teachers remained active learners. They discovered that key to creating dynamic learning organizations was principal leadership. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042085911416011">Collinson, Cook, and Conley (2006)</xref> built on this to emphasize the significance of democratic governance within school leadership. When principals help facilitate an environment of cooperation, teachers are able to share their discoveries and, ultimately, all in the school—including the students—benefit from the increased organizational knowledge. The results from this study suggest that democratic governance can also influence the ability of teachers and the school as a whole to influence the lives of students beyond their academic achievement. By creating an environment of active learning, teachers and other staff members are perhaps better able to quickly adjust to meeting the needs of distressed students. The data in this study suggest that when devising a disaster preparedness plan for their school, principals would be wise to look at how they lead the school for all students. If they can foster an environment in which teachers feel welcome in the decision-making process and in which the teachers are given opportunities to share their classroom experiences with one another, all students—not just those dealing firsthand with the effects of a disaster—will be better served.</p>

<p>Because it turned out to be so difficult to recruit students, we decided to offer a US$20 gift card to students for the initial survey as well. Students who entered the study after September 2006 were paid US$20 at baseline. Because of the limited study period, they were not asked to complete a 12-month follow-up. Hence, all students had the opportunity to earn US$40 in gift cards.</p>
