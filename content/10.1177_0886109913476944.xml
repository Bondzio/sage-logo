<abstract>
<p>In the study presented here, we examined factors that shape women’s employability and their impact on women’s subjective health and well-being in four British Columbian communities. Although the economic contexts of the urban, rural, remote, and reserve communities were diverse, they intersected with gender roles and cultural norms to provide a picture of women’s employability that was remarkably consistent. In all the communities, the women reported difficulties making ends meet; caregiving overload; chronic stress and worry; and, in many cases, violence and abuse. Our intersectional analysis allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of women’s lived experiences of being defined as employable.</p>

<body>
<p>Over the past two decades, globalization and governmental prioritization of economic gain over human development and social justice have been dominant trends in Canada, specifically in the province of British Columbia (BC). In this context, people who were previously seen as unemployable because of parenting, caregiving responsibilities, disability, or ill health were redefined as employable; regardless of the reason, the unemployed are impelled back to work. Through years of involvement with a range of women serving organizations in various locations across BC, we have witnessed the limitations of policies that redefine diverse women as employable. Women continue to juggle paid and unpaid work, precarious employment, multiple jobs, and insecure seasonal work with few work-supported health benefits. Many women are involved in unpaid, underpaid, under-the-table, or illegal work. The Women’s Employability and Health Research Project (WEHP) investigated these experiences. We defined employability as the relative chances of getting and maintaining different kinds of employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886109913476944">Brown &amp; Hesketh, 2004</xref>). The research questions guiding this analysis were (1) what factors shape diverse women’s employability across BC? (2) what is the impact of being seen as employable on women’s subjective health and well-being?</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<sec id="section2-0886109913476944">
<title>Employability-Based Approaches</title>
<p>Initially, the concept of employability described a disabled person’s capacity for employment. As liberal labor market policies strove to “wean the hardest-to-employ people off long term state programs” the concept shifted to include delinquents, ex-convicts, and eventually women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0886109913476944">White, 2001</xref>, p. 6). These same market policies also maintained that the state had neither the responsibility nor the capacity to create jobs. The causes of unemployment were conceived in individualistic and behavioral terms: The old problems of demand deficiency and job shortage were dismissed, and policies needed to focus on the motivations and expectations of the “workless class” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886109913476944">Peck &amp; Theodore, 2000</xref>, p. 729). Failing to take into consideration the supply and demand of labor perpetuated the idea that credentials, knowledge, and social status alone guaranteed a good position in the labor market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886109913476944">Brown &amp; Hesketh, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Although women in both developing and developed countries saw significant improvements to their socioeconomic status after World War I, “economic adjustments undertaken globally since the 1980’s halted and even reversed this progress” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886109913476944">McDaniel, 2002</xref>, p. 127). Employability-based approaches to labor market policy are typical examples of these economic adjustments. Over the past 30 years, many industrialized countries have shifted the responsibility for the social safety net from the state to women’s shoulders by classifying women as employable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886109913476944">Baker, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886109913476944">Baker &amp; Tippin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886109913476944">Day &amp; Brodsky, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886109913476944">Morris, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886109913476944">Porter, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886109913476944">Stratigaki, 2004</xref>). However, women face challenges to their employability for societal as well as individual reasons. The unavailability of good-quality child care, the lack of public affordable transportation, and the inflexibility of employment opportunities can hardly be viewed in individualistic terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886109913476944">Berry, Katrass, Sano, Lee, &amp; Bauer, 2008</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886109913476944">Peck and Theodore (2000</xref>, p. 731), “employability-based approaches are not sufficient to the task of tackling unemployment, social exclusion, and economic inequality.” Certainly, they address neither women’s chronic poverty nor the nuances and implications of women’s unpaid caregiving work.</p>

<sec id="section3-0886109913476944">
<title>Employability and Women’s Poverty</title>
<p>For as long as data have been collected, women as a group have experienced poverty and deprivation more significantly, and more deeply, than men. The main causes of women’s poverty are labor market inequities, domestic circumstances, and welfare systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886109913476944">Ruspini, 1999</xref>). Almost 24% of Canadian women are raising children on their own, and 14% of single older women are poor, even after governmental taxes and transfers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0886109913476944">Townson, 2009</xref>). More than 1,772,000 women in Canada live in poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886109913476944">Canadian Association for Social Workers, 2009</xref>). Women are not only at a greater risk of poverty than men, but their poverty is more persistent over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886109913476944">Lochhead &amp; Scott, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Labor market inequities are particularly evident in the highly gendered nature of the Canadian workforce. Men still dominate higher-earnings groups and constitute a relatively small proportion of workers in the lowest-earnings categories (Townson, 2009). The majority of women remain in the lowest earnings categories in increasingly part-time, temporary, or contract, employment (Townson, 2009). Such nonstandard jobs offer little financial security, and few, if any, offer health care or disability benefits. Important parts of the Canadian social security net, such as employment insurance, are “discriminatory in effect” and remain inaccessible to many Canadian women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886109913476944">Porter, 2003</xref>, p. 240). Poor women as a group have little recourse to protection through labor laws and are often in compromising positions that threaten their health and personal safety and expose them to violence within the family or community (Townson, 2009).</p>
<p>Women’s poverty occurs as a consequence of domestic circumstances, such as divorce and separation, with many BC women falling into the category of being “one man away from welfare” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886109913476944">Reid, 2004</xref>). Women’s roles as mothers, homemakers, and caregivers also contribute to their poverty (Townson, 2009). Women perform two thirds of unpaid caregiving work. The enormous demands of unpaid work reduce many women’s opportunities to participate fully in the paid workforce. While the costs of raising children have been acknowledged by the addition of the child-rearing drop-out provision of the Canada Pension Plan, caregiving for other relatives has not, which contributes to some women’s deepening poverty. Canadian policies of deinstutionalization and “closer to home health care” in the same era of governmental downsizing have been shown to result in increased caregiving responsibilities for women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886109913476944">Armstrong, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0886109913476944">Yalnizyan, 2005</xref>). In addition, Canada’s aging population and rural-to-urban migration have both been shown to be increasing women’s caregiving responsibilities significantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886109913476944">Joseph, Leach, &amp; Turner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886109913476944">Lero &amp; Joseph, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In 1995, the federal Canadian government replaced the Canada Assistance Plan with the Canada Health and Social Transfer (CHST) removing national standards for the delivery of services. In the subsequent decade, the BC government reduced welfare rolls by 54.2%, mainly by increasing restrictions in eligibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886109913476944">Ministry of Human Resources, 2003</xref>). In 2001 and 2002, BC initiated deep cuts in social programs and shifts in social policy. Services that supported women and their children were either cut entirely or reduced significantly. For example, governmental programs in BC redefined lone mothers of children aged 3–7 as employable. Governmental downsizing also brought the elimination of many relatively high-paid unionized service sector jobs for women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886109913476944">Fuller, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886109913476944">Laurence, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>The confluence of these policy shifts and economic trends has put diverse women in BC in increasingly precarious positions. Shifting understandings of who is employable force many women, who carry a disproportionate burden of unpaid care work, to take on work that is underpaid, unstable, seasonal, and at times dangerous and illegal.</p>

<title>Women’s Health</title>
<p>It is commonly known that although women have a longer life expectancy than men, they suffer greater burdens of morbidity, distress, and disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886109913476944">Doyal, 1995</xref>), including depression; stress overload; chronic conditions, such as arthritis and osteoporosis; and injuries and death resulting from family violence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886109913476944">Varcoe, Hankivsky, and Morrow (2007</xref>, p. 5) noted that “in 2000–2001 over 4 million women compared to under 3 million men reported having two or more chronic conditions” and that in that same time frame “500,000 more women than men reported having functional health disabilities.” In addition, in Canada, women are poorer than men (Townson, 2009). It is well known that poverty is a determinant of health. Indeed, “living in chronic material deprivation limits access to health promoting services and resources and has a significant impact on women’s health behaviours … [poverty] leads to shame, stress and depression … [and] women living in poverty are often forced to compromise good health choices for bad ones for financial reasons” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886109913476944">Reid, 2007</xref>, p. 214).</p>

<title>WEHP</title>
<p>Recognizing the provincial shift toward neoconservative labor market policies, a group of service providers in Metro Vancouver formed the Coalition for Women’s Economic Advancement to discuss and take action on their observations of women’s worsening situations. Members of the coalition shared anecdotal evidence that changes in governmental policy had resulted in an increasing number of women staying in abusive relationships; getting into sexually exploitive relationships for economic gain; engaging in sex trade work or the underground economy, such as dealing in drugs; relying on their children for money, food, and shelter; and getting involved in other criminal or marginal behavior that was directly linked to their deepening poverty. It was also believed that women’s worsening economic circumstances were not limited to any particular group of women and that the women affected were diverse ethnically, racially, socially, and geographically.</p>
<p>Coalition members recognized the need to gain a better understanding of women’s economic situation in BC. We initiated WEHP and identified two research questions: (1) What factors shape diverse women’s employability across BC? (2) What is the impact of being seen as employable on women’s subjective health and well-being? In an effort to capture the broad range of women’s experience in BC, we selected research communities on the basis of their sociodemographic and geographic diversity. In choosing the research communities, we considered the gap between women’s and men’s incomes, the sources of income in the community, and the basis for the local economies. The four research communities are here called rural-farming, northern-resource, remote-reserve, and urban-South Asian.</p>
<p>The project was managed by the lead researcher and the project coordinator. Local researchers were hired in each community, in one instance as an individual and in three others as teams of two to four women. The community researchers were responsible for forming and liaising with a local Advisory Committee, recruiting participants, collecting and analyzing, and writing a final community report. As a project team, we adopted feminist participatory action research as our conceptual and methodological framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886109913476944">Maguire, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886109913476944">Reid, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886109913476944">Reid &amp; Frisby, 2007</xref>). We held a deep commitment to intersectionality as our theoretical lens and identified as an intersectional research team. Together, we examined the ethical dimensions of our work with a particular focus on the implications of maintaining community confidentiality in the context of a project that is action oriented. We gained ethical approval from the Research Ethics Board at Simon Fraser University, where Reid, the lead researcher, was completing her postdoctoral fellowship, and from the Vancouver Foundation, the funding organization. In other venues, we have examined these conceptual, methodological, and ethical issues more extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886109913476944">Reid, Ponic, Hara, Kaweesi, &amp; LeDrew, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886109913476944">Reid et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Northern-Resource</title>
<p>Northern-Resource is a remote community of 25,000 people with a subarctic continental climate. Its population has expanded by 9.3% since 2001, primarily as a result of the robust oil and gas economy. The labor participation rate is 81%, with 88% of the men compared to 73% of the women able to work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886109913476944">Statistics Canada, 2010</xref>). The strong labor market is reflected in low unemployment rates. Citizens in this community have one of the highest levels of disposable income in the country compared to the Canadian average. However, in this community, the median income for men is more than double that of women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886109913476944">Statistics Canada, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Rural-Farming</title>
<p>Rural-Farming is a village serving a rural area of approximately 5,000 residents nestled in south central BC. In 2006, the unemployment rate was almost twice that of BC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886109913476944">Statistics Canada, 2010</xref>), which may have been due to the seasonal nature of the logging industry as well as the periodic shifts in the resource-based economy. Women accounted for one third of full-year, full-time jobs, compared to men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886109913476944">Statistics Canada, 2010</xref>). While Rural-Farming has a lower-than-provincial average wage, women’s median income is only 70% of men’s locally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886109913476944">Statistics Canada, 2010</xref>).</p>

<p>Remote-Reserve is comprised of just under 800 people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886109913476944">Statistics Canada, 2010</xref>), including status Aboriginals, nonstatus Aboriginals, and nonaboriginals. In this community, the employment rate during the high season is 53% in part due to ecotourism and students’ summer jobs. The off-season employment rate drops to 30%. Most people who have full-time, year-round jobs work for the Band Council or the Tribal Council. The average educational level of employable community members is Grade 10. The drop-out rate from high school is 57%; the provincial drop-out rate for the general population was 18% in 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886109913476944">Statistics Canada, 2010</xref>).</p>

Thirty-eight percent of the residents are immigrants, and the majority of them are from India, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886109913476944">Statistics Canada, 2010</xref>).

Urban-South Asian’s labor force works primarily in the manufacturing and retail sectors.

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The local researchers produced a community report to provide in-depth contextual information and relevant data on each research community. From this community snapshot, they then purposefully recruited a broadly representative range of participants. Across the four communities, 70 women participated in the study. The participants were diverse in many ways; they ranged in age from 17 to 74, had various domestic statuses (single, separated, divorced, married, and partnered) although most were mothers, and possessed a range of education and training from not completing Grade 8 to multiple university degrees. The participants worked in various sectors and had a range of jobs from insecure and seasonal to secure and long term. Regardless of their current employment status, all the women self-identified as employable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0886109913476944">
<title>Data Collection and Analysis</title>
<p>We gathered qualitative data from 57 semistructured one-on-one interviews and three focus groups. Our data set consisted of 60 primary documents and 18 sets of field notes as secondary documents. Data analysis was conducted in the local communities by the local researchers. The lead researcher provided a descriptive coding framework, which was used by the community researchers for coding and analysis. Atlas.ti was used to manage and sort the data. From the inductive and descriptive coding, the local researchers wrote a community report that integrated the contextual information from their communities with the research findings.</p>
<p>We identified intersectional theory as the most appropriate theoretical lens for our work. Intersectionality theory is the study of multiple categories of identity and social relations that intersect with one another to produce systems of power, oppression, and privilege (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886109913476944">McCall, 2005</xref>). It has grown out of critical feminist concerns about the limits of privileging one category of analysis (e.g., gender) over others (e.g., race, class, sexual orientation, ability, or place) and seeks to understand the fluid ways in which they intersect to shape the reality of women’s lives systematically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886109913476944">Canadian Research Institute for the Advancement of Women [CRIAW], 2006</xref>). Intersectionality can help illuminate the connections between individual subjectivities and broader social structures, as well as local and global experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886109913476944">Shields, 2008</xref>). The core purpose of intersectionality theory is to facilitate deep analyses of social justice issues, such as women’s employability and health, by interrogating the complex social and power relations that lie at their root (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886109913476944">Hankivsky &amp; Cormier, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886109913476944">Shields, 2008</xref>). Intersectional frameworks “provide potentially transformative alternatives. They unravel how social categories of difference intersect in constantly changing ways in order to crack open oppressive dialogues, structures, and practices” (CRIAW, 2006, p. 10).</p>

<sec id="section14-0886109913476944">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>Investigating the fullness of women’s employability through an intersectional analysis explicates the ways in which gender, place, the local economy, and cultural identity intersect and influence each other to shape how women experience employment and how these experiences influence their health and well-being. The findings are divided into two major sections that correspond to the research questions. In the first section, we examine the ways in which gender intersects with location, unpaid caregiving, and culture. The second section describes how women’s experiences with employability affect their perceived health and well-being. Intersectional analysis is not additive; rather, it is multiplicative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886109913476944">Phoenix &amp; Pattynama, 2006</xref>). As such, the findings build on one another. Rather than provide an analysis that separates out distinct analytic categories, analytic categories that intersect and cross-cut the four research communities are presented sequentially. In other words, the relationships among the analytic categories are presented in the sections of the findings. The intention is to render the fluidity of women’s experiences across the four communities and to capture the overlapping nature of the analytic categories.</p>
<sec id="section15-0886109913476944">
<title>Women’s Employability</title>
<p>Women’s employability was shaped by community location, the community’s local economy, gender, culture, and caregiving roles and expectations. Although there were some distinct differences between women across the province, there were also remarkable similarities. What follows is an analysis of the women’s experiences of employability across the four research communities.</p>
<sec id="section16-0886109913476944">
<title>Community Location and Gendered Work</title>
<p>A striking finding was how the remoteness of all but the urban community and the highly gendered nature of well-paying job opportunities curtailed women’s earning capacity. In the booming Northern-Resource community, one woman said: “It’s a man’s world up here, … and it’s really, really hard for women to make it. I see some that will never be able to break out. They have no opportunities, no options, just to stay on that gerbil wheel at 7 or 8 dollars an hour, stuck on there. There is nowhere else for them to go because they don’t have the money to get the education.”</p>
<p>Northern-Resource offered many well-paying jobs in the oil field outside the town center, but these jobs were not widely available to women, who worked predominantly in the low-paying service sector in the city. The dearth of well-paying employment contributed to a substantial gender difference in women’s ability to earn a living wage. “At one point I was averaging $8,000 a year working and going to school, and my ex-husband was earning $120,000 to $150,000” (Northern-Resource). Of the four research communities, Northern-Resource had the strongest local economy, but despite its prosperity, women in Northern-Resource were not faring well—they did not have access to the same economic opportunities as men, and they also struggled with limited resources in terms of transportation, accessible child care, and services to support them.</p>
<p>At the time of the study, women in Rural-Farming earned an average of 58% of men’s wages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886109913476944">Statistics Canada, 2010</xref>). For women who were supporting themselves and their families, it was normal to hold multiple part-time jobs. They had few employment benefits (e.g., employment insurance and a pension) and struggled while living in poverty: “I've taken a while to adjust from coming from the big city, Toronto, where I was making $120,000 a year, coming to [Rural-Farming town] making nothing” (Rural-Farming).</p>
<p>Most Remote-Reserve women relied on seasonal, precarious employment at the minimum wage, unless they had the education and training to access the few health or governmental service positions that were available or had the means to start their own businesses. To make ends meet, most women also reported that they worked “under the table.” The majority of women in Remote-Reserve, along with most women in the other research communities, faced the burden of making ends meet. The following captures the experiences of most of the participants: “I’m so worried I <italic>have </italic>to get to work, I <italic>have </italic>to make the money, I <italic>have </italic>to pay the bills. And when I’m doing that, two of my kids quit school within like three months of the school being over. And I keep thinking well, maybe if I didn’t work so hard or, but I still, I <italic>have </italic>to” (Remote-Reserve).</p>

<title>Cultural Factors Shaped Women’s Employability</title>
<p>Cultural factors shaped women’s employability in the Urban-South Asian community. For some, immigrating to Canada forced shifts in employment opportunities that had an impact on gender roles and expectations in the family. Like the Remote-Reserve women, these changes in traditional gender roles, which for both groups of women were driven by economic factors but were bound in cultural norms and expectations, were challenging and difficult to negotiate. After immigrating to Canada, some South Asian women had the potential to earn as much or more than their husbands and often found work before the men. Although this potential brought a sense of self-sufficiency and independence to the South-Asian women, in many cases it created conflict in their relationships. For the first time, the women earned an income and kept some of it, which undermined their reliance on their male partners as the sole providers.</p>
<p>Some South Asian women were positive about their work prospects. Generally, the younger women and the women who spoke English easily and had a postsecondary education were more optimistic about their work opportunities. These women reported that they were confident that they could find rewarding and financially sustaining employment. One woman said: “I guess I am just lucky … have never had a problem finding a job. I apply to jobs and usually go to the interview and get the job the same day …. They [jobs] just pop up in the newspaper or sometimes they come up through friends that I know or people that I know, a lot of networking and sometimes it’s through training courses and that sort of thing” (Urban-South Asian).</p>
<p>While some South Asian women spoke of finding work easily and before their husbands did, others, particularly those who were older and had more difficulty speaking English, encountered difficulties finding work, as one woman noted: “At first it was very difficult to find work, and by knowing people, you can work on the farms, and after my hours were done, I collected EI [employment insurance] and then had a little bit of school … . With knowing friends, we would ask [for work] and they would say they are not hiring” (Urban-South Asian). Older South Asian women spoke about the hardships they had endured to arrive at their current lifestyles: “It is very hard to go to work. Even though I work part time, I work seven days a week” (Urban-South Asian). Still others reported that immigrating to Canada had caused them to lose the careers they had established in India. One woman said that her degree as a registered nurse was not acknowledged in Canada:
<disp-quote>
<p>[I didn’t like Canada when I first moved here] because I was working before, and when I got here [Canada], I did not get the same job [as a registered nurse], and everything else was new to me and it was hard.</p>
</disp-quote>Like Northern-Resource, the Urban-South-Asian economy was growing quickly, however, half the participants from Urban-South Asian reported struggling to make ends meet. One woman reported that her ex-husband was faring significantly better than she was: “He [ex husband] is much better off because he does own a property, so that works out a lot better, and the other thing is he has worked full time and put himself back in school part time and has gotten a second job. So he is far ahead much more than me (Urban-South Asian).</p>
<p>Another woman spoke of struggling with her family to pay the bills: “My parents make minimum wage, and my dad was laid off for a very long time, so it has been really hard because we do have a house, so we do have a mortgage; it’s been hard, and because I haven’t had a full-time job, it has been hard on the family … we have to live check to check literally.</p>
<sec id="section18-0886109913476944">
<title>Domestic Responsibilities</title>
<p>An overwhelming finding from all four communities was the challenge of juggling paid and unpaid work. The women’s limited opportunities for jobs intersected with their domestic responsibilities to often prevent them from taking employment. The lack of child care spaces prevented women with dependent children from participating in jobs that were available in the oil field and forest industries. Although four participants had worked in the oil patch before having children, they found it impossible to return to that industry after giving birth. As one woman stated: “The reason I’m taking bookkeeping is because it is something I can do at home while I raise my children. I wouldn’t be able to go back to the oil patch because of the hours; …. it wouldn’t be worth it—I would never get to see my kids (Northern-Resource).</p>
<p>With few opportunities available to women in the lucrative oil field, the Northern-Resource women spoke of being responsible for maintaining their households and child care when their partners were working away from the community. When their partners returned from the oil patch, the women’s control over the household shifted dramatically, which was stressful and at times difficult to manage. As one woman put it:
<disp-quote>
<p>Basically, everything falls on the women’s shoulders … everything from finances, to running the household, to caring for the children. A lot of these men are gone from three weeks to two months, and they come home and it creates tremendous stress and tension in the home because you’re really used to doing everything yourself.</p>
</disp-quote>A common term used in Northern-Resource to denote women’s status was “oil and gas widow.” After a drastic downturn in the forest sector more than 10 years ago, Rural-Farming had an unemployment rate that was 3 times the provincial average. More recently, unemployment rates for women moved much closer to provincial averages, while unemployment for men remains significantly higher and men’s labor force participation is also lower than the provincial rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886109913476944">Statistics Canada, 2010</xref>). With few well-paying local jobs, some men looked for work outside the area, resulting in a gender imbalance similar to that in the Northern-Resource community. Several Rural-Farming women reported that they were managing the homes in their husbands’ prolonged absence to Alberta oil fields or northern forestry jobs. As one woman stated: “I do have a husband, but he works in Alberta. He basically lives in Alberta. The job he does now he works 15 days and gets 6 off. But he doesn’t come home every time because … it is an 11-hour drive … . He comes home long enough to get everyone all worked up, (laughs) and then he leaves. And then he waits for 6 weeks and then he comes home again. Of course, nothing is run the way he wants to run it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0886109913476944">
<title>Greater Uncertainty and Caregiving in Resource-Based Economies</title>
<p>In both Rural-Farming and Northern-Resource, a reliance on the resource-based economy disrupted normal family functioning and created a set of power dynamics within the family characterized by greater uncertainty and increases in women’s caregiving role. Another dimension of shifting gender roles occurred during the economic downturn in Rural-Farming when many men lost their high-paying jobs. More employment options opened for women that were low paying and part time: As one woman said: “At the forestry I made $12.65 an hour 26 years ago. Now I am offered $10 for the same [job], … and I am not working any less.”</p>
<p>In Remote-Reserve, there was a sharp reduction in resource-sector jobs in the past 10 years that had been held primarily by men. Tourism and local government jobs became the main sources of income in this small community. In many cases, women found themselves the main breadwinners in the family. At times, this situation caused strain on the couple and jeopardized some women’s ability to keep their jobs, as one woman put it: “It [the reduction in resource-sector jobs] has a big impact. I can’t go to work, and I have to worry about my kids, and I have to hire someone, right? … I think if he [husband] was able to get more [work] under his belt and feel more self-sufficient, things would go a bit smoother in the house. ‘Cause the seasonal work is, when he’s off his job, eh, it is the bottle. What else do you have here?”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0886109913476944">
<title>Limited Access to Training and Education</title>
<p>Caregiving and location intersected to limit some women’s access to training and education. The college in a neighboring town of Remote-Reserve offered some certificate programs, but because of the small population base, courses were often canceled because of the lack of enrollment. For the most part, women had to leave the community in order to access postsecondary training, at a high cost to themselves and their families. Some partners and families were supportive of women’s efforts to improve their employability, but it was equally true that some women had to cut their studies short because their spouses were unable or unwilling to look after the home and children. Indeed, the economic realities for women and men in Remote-Reserve affected the family dynamics, including family transitions and the ability to gain a sense of “readiness” for other employment opportunities. The high unemployment rate in Remote-Reserve was representative of many reserves. Jobs that paid more than the minimum wage required higher skills and education. Although this community was known to be resilient and progressive, many families continued to be affected by the residential school experience and, as a result, experienced unique barriers to realizing their potential fully.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0886109913476944">
<title>Cultural Expectations Reinforced Caregiving Roles</title>
<p>In Remote-Reserve and Urban-South Asian, women’s caregiving roles were reinforced by cultural expectations. Women were expected to play (and expected themselves to play) this role in their families, extended families, and social networks. The meaning of family in Remote-Reserve extends to all those related by blood and clan. Women’s traditional caregiving role reached well beyond the extended family and, for some, included the majority of the community since most families were interconnected. As one woman stated: “When she’s [mom] here, she helps out with my boys a lot because I am a single mom, and she also helps me out financially if I need the help. And my sister does a lot of babysitting for me and helping me with the kids” (Remote-Reserve).</p>
<p>While women can rely on a large network for support, they are likely to be providing care of some sort to one or more people in their community in addition to looking after their immediate families. Local women are also expected to care for grieving families, prepare a deceased person’s body for burial, and organize the memorial service when a loved one is lost. These activities take priority over all other activities, including care of one’s own family or other responsibilities like work or school. For six consecutive weeks during the project, there was a loss of a community member every week, which left the local women exhausted and the community burned out.</p>
<p>In Urban-South Asian, women’s caregiving was also intricately linked with cultural values and norms. In the South Asian culture, family is seen as the fundamental building block from which all else grows. Support and guidance from family influence every decision an individual makes. Many extended families in India live under the same roof, and most aging parents live with one of their sons. The son and his family are expected to care for the elders, while married daughters become responsible for their in-laws: “My mom and dad do the housework, and my brother and I bought a house together, and we live together and we work together.”</p>
<p>One participant described taking a leave from her paid work to care for her mother for 3 months while she recovered from surgery: [Caregiving] would involve taking care of their financial, legal matters, anything that they had, those kinds of documents, or taking them to doctors’ appointments, driving them to get groceries, even the basic things … . It increases the stress level because you are trying to balance your priorities, caring for yourself as well as finding time for your family because you are working full time, that’s stressful, and [you] come home and everybody wants stuff done.” In this interview, the participant acknowledged that she had moved out of the family home to gain some distance from her parents’ demands and expectations. Since she had moved away from her parents, she felt like more of an adult and noticed immediately that her level of stress had decreased. South Asian women’s caregiving responsibilities had an impact on both their health and their ability to function in their paid work.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0886109913476944">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Location, caregiving, and cultural expectations had profound impacts on women’s employability. In the rural and remote communities, women did not have access to well-paying jobs. They experienced major family disruptions and power dynamics with partners repeatedly absent for lucrative work in the resource sector. In the South Asian and Aboriginal communities, cultural expectations shaped women’s employability and caregiving duties, as well as some women’s access to training and educational opportunities.</p>
<p>In spite of the diverse research communities, we found remarkable similarities. Many women juggled two or three part-time jobs, managed child care and domestic duties, and worried about paying the bills. The few women who were not in the paid workforce anticipated returning to it when possible; in other words, they considered themselves “employable.” In all the communities, the women reported that unpaid caregiving reduced their options for finding work or for training and education that could improve their employability. The women struggled to make ends meet; few had financial security, employment security, health benefits, or plans for retirement. The fact that their work was variously underpaid, precarious, and unpaid, contributed significantly to their impoverishment. They valued both paid and unpaid work even when there was conflict between the two.</p>

<sec id="section23-0886109913476944">
<title>Employability and Women’s Health and Well-Being</title>
<p>All the participants readily saw a connection between their employability and their health and well-being. In particular, the women spoke of the toll that stress and living in poverty took on their health. They also spoke at length about safety concerns and experiences of violence and discrimination in the workplace.</p>
<sec id="section24-0886109913476944">
<title>Women’s Concern for Their Health</title>
<p>Although their health issues were diverse, the majority of the participants expressed some concern about their health. In Northern-Resource, seven of the women younger than age 40 had significant chronic health problems, and four others had been diagnosed with a serious disability. In Remote-Reserve, two thirds of the participants reported significant and persistent health problems. In Rural-Farming, almost 80% of the women had chronic health concerns. In the Urban-South Asian community, only 1 of the 15 women claimed good health.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0886109913476944">
<title>Women’s Employability and Health Status</title>
<p>The vast majority of the participants understood their health holistically and readily saw a connection between their employability and their health status. They spoke of the relationship among role overload, caregiving responsibilities, financial uncertainties, and health and well-being. Many participants identified the stress of balancing work and caregiving as a significant factor that affected their health: “I seriously don’t cope, stresswise, coping my days go from work to kids, work to kids … . I feel guilty that I’m not enough for them, so I try harder to be with them (Northern-Resource).” Urban-South Asian women spoke frequently about the stress of juggling paid and unpaid work, as this woman did: “My health isn’t that good because I have a lot of stress: I have to think of my son, I have to wake him up for school, go to work, then get him from the babysitters, and help with his homework, and if I have schoolwork. I have to do that, and so I have a lot of stress.” Although early research suggested that women’s participation in the paid workforce appeared to be health enhancing, more recent literature has acknowledged that women’s juggling of paid and unpaid work in itself contributes to ill health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886109913476944">Forssén &amp; Carlstedt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886109913476944">Thurston &amp; O'Connor, 2005</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section26-0886109913476944">
<title>The Impact of Prolonged Stress and Living in Poverty on Women’s Health</title>
<p>The majority of the women earned less than the BC median income, and most were poor as defined by the low-income cutoff. In Rural-Farming and Northern-Resource, the difference between women’s and men’s median incomes was far greater than the provincial average. In Remote-Reserve, over half the women spoke openly of their struggles with poverty. They told us repeatedly that their health had deteriorated because of prolonged stress and living in poverty. In Remote-Reserve, for example, one third of the participants reported that their health was affected by their financial situations, including the inability to purchase healthy foods and to afford recreational opportunities, increased stress and worry, and the struggle to afford rising costs of prescription medications. As one woman stated: “Finances have a big impact on your life emotionally… . There’s nobody happy when finances are tight. And it’s really hard on the relationship. Going through the no-money period there was really tough … . I stress about it [finances].” Women in Rural-Farming reported the same struggles: “You cannot live without money … . I know I don’t eat right. I know I don’t exercise … . I don’t have any money … . It’s so interconnected because everything costs money.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-0886109913476944">
<title>Violence, Safety, and Workplace Discrimination</title>
<p>One of the most surprising findings was the number of women from each community who reported significant concerns with violence, safety, and workplace discrimination. “All oppressed groups suffer systematic violence simply because they are members of a subordinate group. Subordinate groups not only experience direct violence, but also live in constant fear that violence may occur” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886109913476944">Mullaly, 2007</xref>, p. 268). Violence has strong and negative impacts on women’s employability even when the women are well trained or educated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886109913476944">Moe &amp; Bell, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886109913476944">Morrow, Hankivsky, and Varcoe (2004</xref>) documented the negative effects of government downsizing in BC on women’s vulnerability to violence. Even nonviolent workplace discrimination has been shown to have a negative impact on women’s health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886109913476944">Pavalko, Mossakowski, &amp; Hamilton, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Almost a third of the participants had past and direct experiences with violence, and the majority continued to be concerned about their own or their children’s safety. One woman in Urban-South Asian spoke of the threat she felt from her ex-husband: “[I don’t feel safe in my home] because my husband knows where I live, but I know that if something were to happen, I would call 911.” Nine women from Northern-Resource described a past intimate relationship as physically and/or emotionally abusive. As one woman recalled: “It was January ’96. I had stated that maybe we should break up. He came home; he was drugged up on … I don’t know what it was. It was three weeks after my hysterectomy that he came home and attacked me with a baseball bat in front of my youngest daughter and another 3-year-old child.” Women in Rural-Farming also reported high rates of violence and abuse. Three teenagers who were interviewed in Rural-Farming had already experienced abuse by male relatives. One said: “My uncles were … bullies … . My uncle used to hang me out of a two-story window by my legs,” and abusive relationships took their toll on women in marital relationships: “I got beat down. … I took a welding course, … and he made me quit … I spent 10 years with him; … the last thing he did was beat me up with his new girlfriend.”</p>
<p>One third of the women who were interviewed in Urban-South Asian worked night shifts. Many women worked in the janitorial and housekeeping industries, some traveling home by public transportation at two in the morning. Because of their shift work, they knew that they could easily be targets of violence. One woman said:
<disp-quote>
<p>No I don’t feel that way [that my community is safe]. I hear about all the things that are happening, and I get scared … . At work when I go from my car to work, I park kind of far away, because inside it’s pay parking. So when we walk from our car we feel a little bit scared.” Half the participants in Remote-Reserve thought that community safety was an issue because of crime and drugs. As one woman indicated: “I don’t feel safe at night because of all the crime and stuff that’s been happening around here … . I get a little bit worried when I’m out with my friends, that, you know, things are going to happen for the worst.</p>
</disp-quote>Historical victimization intersected with geographic isolation and limited work opportunities to keep women in abusive or unhealthy relationships. One woman in Rural-Farming stated: “I was in relationships that I knew I shouldn't be in, but I was in them because of the financial burden I would have had with the five kids, with four kids at one time and then five.” Another Rural-Farming woman said: “The last relationship I was in, I stayed in it for probably an extra, almost a year, even though I kept telling myself … I was trying to fix it, but it just wasn’t fixable.”</p>
<p>In the Remote-Reserve community, five women commented on violence and its impact on their lives. Three described violence in a personal context, and four described the effects of violence in the context of family and/or community members. One participant said that she had to leave her job and school because of the impact of violence on her family: “I didn’t do well because my daughter was being abused physically, emotionally, mentally, [and] there was nobody home for her. And when I went into doing this course, it was all about what I wanted. I didn’t think about what was going to happen down the line with my daughter and if she could handle it. It just didn’t connect.” The woman intimated that it was partially her fault that her daughter suffered while she was working and attending school. She did not consider other factors that may have led to the violence.</p>
<p>All the participants understood the links between their social and economic circumstances and their health. While most were concerned with their health and reported ongoing health issues, they all saw a connection between their employability and their health status. The women’s efforts to obtain or maintain paid employment, alongside their considerable unpaid caregiving responsibilities, had profound effects on their psychosocial health and well-being. In addition, many of the women experienced the stress of living in poverty and, for some, the stark reality of living in material deprivation. An unexpected yet significant finding across the four research communities was women’s ongoing concerns with violence, safety, and workplace discrimination.</p>

<title>Implications and Conclusion</title>
<p>Adopting an intersectional framework demonstrates the inextricable links among gender, location, unpaid caregiving, and cultural expectations. In multiple and overlapping ways, these factors have intersected with each other and interacted with role expectations and threats of violence and discrimination to limit women’s opportunities for well-paid employment across a range of British Columbian communities. Not only has the daily challenge of juggling unpaid and paid work limited women’s opportunities financially, but it has resulted in the chronic worry of living in material scarcity.</p>
<p>Currently, policies across Canada, particularly in the province of BC, ignore women’s realities. Assuming that most women can be classified as “employable,” with no regard for their multiple roles and urban, rural, and remote contexts, has a deleterious impact on their health and well-being. Overwhelmingly, the women we spoke with could not obtain high-paying stable employment or access safe and affordable child care. Many struggled to care for children and other relatives or friends and did so with few or no community supports. Yet rather than challenging their classification as “employable,” the women were working hard to secure and maintain employment. Despite their best efforts, they faced increasing difficulties supporting themselves and their families. Employability-based approaches, which focus on getting the indigent to work, do not tackle the systemic problems of demand deficiency and job shortage and are insufficient to the task of tackling unemployment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886109913476944">Peck &amp; Theodore, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Over the past 20 years, provincial and federal governments in Canada have instituted macroeconomic changes that have resulted in the transfer of the Canadian social safety net from the state to the already-overburdened shoulders of individual women: “In nations such as Canada, with high unemployment, a stagnant economy, vast discrepancies between the wages of men and women, and a severe shortage of affordable and regulated child care, focusing on employability has negative consequences for many individuals as well as social policy development” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886109913476944">Baker, 1996</xref>, p. 498). The data for this study were gathered in 2005 and 2006, before the worldwide economic meltdown in 2008 and subsequent economic crises of 2011. Unfortunately, the trend toward neoconservative labor market policies that individualize systemic issues has firmly taken hold as governments urge “fiscal restraint” and “net zero mandates.” The result has been women’s deepening economic insecurity and deteriorating health and well-being.</p>
