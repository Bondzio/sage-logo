<p>This article will outline the current status of gifted education in Ireland. To fully understand the picture, one needs to look at the history of the Irish education system and how educational decisions are made in the country. Political climate is often an important factor in how people view special education programs and Ireland is no different in that regard. The article will also chart Ireland’s attempts to define giftedness and how recent research in the gifted field has furthered our understanding in this area and can be used to broaden the sphere of programming that exists in Ireland for high-ability students.</p>

<p>To fully understand the current status of gifted education in Ireland, one needs to look at the history of the Irish education system and how educational decisions are made in the country. For more than a century, the system was dominated by the Catholic Church in a country where more than 90% of the population was Catholic. Most of the schools were built on church grounds and were controlled by diocesan representatives. This dominance had a direct impact on how government parties implemented policy relating to education. Traditionally, Ireland was a poor country with few natural resources, and in many areas, agriculture was the predominant occupation. It was not until 1967 that secondary school education became free for everyone. Even as late as 1970, less than 30% of boys and fewer than 40% of girls completed secondary schooling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0162353212470039">Whelan &amp; Hannan, 1999</xref>). There were very few employment opportunities and emigration was high during this period. Against this bleak backdrop, there was little attention given to gifted students or special education in general. It would be as late as the 1990s before the issue of gifted education became a topic of conversation in Irish education.</p>
<p>This article will chart the historical background of the Irish education system and the political climate that prevailed as a result of the Church dominance in education. The origins of gifted education in Ireland will be discussed and this will be followed up to the present day when a small but prominent movement exists in the form of out-of-school classes for gifted children. Schools in Ireland have very little to offer gifted education by virtue of the fact that giftedness is not recognized as a special need by the Department of Education. The impact of such a scenario will be outlined and the article will conclude with some recommendations to improve the status of gifted education in Ireland.</p>
<sec id="section1-0162353212470039">
<title>History of Irish Education</title>
<p>The Irish education system has a history of dominance by the Catholic Church. The modern system dates back to 1831 when the national school regime was set up under the control of the British State. However, apart from centralizing control within a Department of Education in 1924, little change took place in the administration and financing of schools when the Irish State was established in 1923. In 1930, the Vocational Education Act gave the State a more significant role in certain areas, although the education system continued to be controlled mainly by privately owned institutions.</p>
<p>The ultimate dominance of the Catholic Church seems surprising when one looks back to the set up of the system in 1831. At this time, the main objective was to unite children of different creeds in one system. The National Board of Education was to look with favor on applicants for aid for schools jointly managed by Roman Catholics and Protestants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0162353212470039">Hyland, 1989</xref>). Although many of the schools taken into connection with the Board in the early years were jointly managed, the main Christian churches put pressure on the government to allow aid to be given to schools under the management of individual churches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162353212470039">Akenson, 1970</xref>). This pressure was so effective that, by the mid-19th century, only 4% of national schools were under mixed management.</p>
<p>By the beginning of the 20th century, the Irish system of national education was fundamentally different from those in other parts of the United Kingdom. In England and Scotland, “parallel” systems had evolved, that is, denominational schools existed side by side with local authority controlled schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0162353212470039">Stuart, 1967</xref>). The development was also mirrored in other Western European countries. In Ireland, provision was never made for a separate system of primary schools controlled by the local authority, largely because it had been found by the Powis Commission in 1870 that voluntary effort had adequately met the demand for elementary education in this country. As a result, by the mid-20th century, the system of national education in the Republic of Ireland was one which was de jure nondenominational, but de facto denominational in 97% of cases.</p>
<p>Initially when the education system was being formalized in Ireland, the Roman Catholic Church had relatively little power and influence compared with the Church of Ireland. The Roman Catholic Church envied the Church of Ireland because the Church of Ireland was a major influence in cultural, political, and educational affairs. However, by the end of the 19th century, the positions of power for both churches had been reversed (Ó Buachalla, 1998). The Roman Catholic Church had successfully used the education system to extend its sphere of influence relative to the Church of Ireland. While Ireland was under British rule, little attention was paid to Irish schools, with British forces more preoccupied with quelling any Irish rebellions. The mid-19th century saw the Irish famine, which greatly reduced the Irish population and the education of the Irish people was a low priority for the British Government. Cardinal Paul Cullen became Archbishop of Dublin in 1849, and by the end of his career, Cullen succeeded not only in converting the national schools to Catholic schools but also in setting up a Catholic majority on the national board that would determine education policy. At this point, the Roman Catholic Church was now effectively in charge of the Irish education system. This influence led to an egalitarian philosophy toward education. Under this philosophy, an emphasis was placed on creating similar outcomes for all students, and gifted students suffered under this position. There was also an emphasis on reestablishing Gaelic traditions and culture that had been neglected under the British rule. This along with the teaching of the Irish language dominated the school curriculum. Following the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1923, one of the first moves in the education system was the removal of science from the primary school curriculum to be replaced by Irish language as a compulsory subject. Science would not return to the primary school curriculum in Ireland until 1999.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the 20th century, the churches and the government were the only bodies that could make education policy. The boards were made up of people whom the Church and State had nominated, and policy decisions were administered by these people. Given that almost all of the schools in Ireland were on lands owned by the Church, this led to a huge influence on educational policy.</p>
<sec id="section2-0162353212470039">
<title>How the Irish Education System Works</title>
<p>The Department of Education began to play a more significant role in developing and implementing educational policy from the 1960s onward. Measures taken included the introduction of free postprimary education in 1967, the development of community and comprehensive schools, and the establishment of Regional Technical Colleges (now Institutes of Technology [IoTs]). The Higher Education Authority was set up in 1971 as the planning and development authority for the university sector. There was a major era of reform in the 1990s when, following wide-ranging debate throughout the country, the government published a Green Paper (a discussion paper) with proposals for education change in all the sectors, and also convened a National Education Convention in 1993, publishing the White Paper <italic>Charting Our Educational Future</italic> in 1995, which was the first major statement of government policy on primary, postprimary, and tertiary education.</p>
<p>This led to the publication of the Education Act of 1998, which formed the legislative framework for the change agenda. The Act provided, for the first time, a statutory framework for the Irish education system at first and second levels. This piece of legislation states that there is a statutory duty on the government in power to ensure that appropriate education and support services are available to everyone in the country. At this stage, church influence on a local level was still strong, but nationally teaching unions and legislative government bodies began to increase their powers and responsibilities without as much church influence.</p>
<p>The Irish education system is currently centrally controlled by the Department of Education. All teachers’ salaries of both private and public schools at first and second level are paid by the Department, but the schools are individually managed by private institutions, usually a religious order. Traditionally, the Catholic Church had much control over the patronage of the schools in Ireland, whereas presently, the schools are managed by a Board of Management. The Church would be influential in the makeup of the Board, because most schools operate on lands owned by churches or religious institutions.</p>
<p>Today, there are more than 3,200 primary schools in Ireland, 750 postprimary, 7 Universities, 14 IoTs, 33 Vocational Education Committees (VECs), and a number of other educational institutions that are aided by the State. Most primary and postprimary schools are privately owned and managed by local diocesan trusts or patron bodies but are publicly funded. The denominational character and ethos of schools are recognized by the State, including in legislation.</p>
<p>At primary level, many of the schools are small, with more than 50% of them having four or fewer teachers and each school is managed by its own voluntary management board appointed by the patrons.</p>
<p>At postprimary level, there are different types of State-funded schools—namely, voluntary secondary schools, vocational schools, and community and comprehensive schools. Voluntary secondary schools are privately owned and managed and the trustees of most of these schools are religious communities or boards of governors. VECs are statutory local education bodies that administer vocational schools and community colleges. Pupils in all three types of schools follow the same curriculum and sit the same State examinations. Essentially, the Boards of Management are the legal employers of school staff and carry considerable responsibilities as laid down in the Education Act 1998 and other legislation. Therefore, although salaries are paid for by the State, each school is legally autonomous in terms of the appointment, discipline, and dismissal of staff, and in terms of legal and compliance responsibilities. This is significant in relation to a school’s policy for gifted students.</p>
<p>The Department of Education currently employs just over 100,000 people and manages a significant budget, with the allocation for 2011 being some €8.9 billion, including a capital budget of €491 million. Of this, about €1 billion is allocated to special needs education. The budget supports pay and pensions (teachers, nonteaching staff, and academics), school and higher education student grants, further and adult education activities, labor force development, school transport, and the department’s administrative budget. However, none of this budget in 2011 was allocated toward the education of gifted children.</p>

<title>Fitting Gifted Children Into the Picture</title>
<p>So the question to be asked is where do gifted children currently fit into the Irish education system? To answer this, we must first look at the legal rights of gifted children. Currently there is no legislation in Ireland directly mentioning gifted children. The 1998 Education Act s.7 (1) (a) states that:
<disp-quote>
<p>there should be made available to each person resident in the State, including a person with a disability or who has special educational needs, support services and a level and quality of education appropriate to meeting the needs and ability of that person. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162353212470039">Department of Education and Science, 1998</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although this would seem to advocate that gifted children should receive special services in schools, to date no direct funding has been made available to allow schools to provide services for high-ability children. Schools are confused as to what to do with gifted children, and, without resources, these students may not receive the services they need in school. As part of the new transparent education policy, schools are now evaluated by the Department of Education in terms of how they implement curriculum and also how they effectively manage the schools. The results of these Whole School Evaluations are published externally for the public. While most of the focus within the evaluations relates to the management and performance of the school and special needs at the other end of the spectrum, some inspectors have asked schools about how they are providing for the needs of gifted children within the system.</p>
<p>Hence, it would be helpful to know how gifted children are defined within the Irish Education system. Historically, The U.S. Department of Education or Marland Report (1972) contains a definition of giftedness that is probably the most quoted in any research into giftedness. The report declared that
<disp-quote>
<p>gifted and talented children are those identified by professionally qualified persons, who by virtue of outstanding abilities are capable of high performance. These are children who require differentiated educational programs and/or services beyond those normally provided by the regular school programme in order to realise their contribution to self and society.</p>
<p>Children capable of high-performance include those with demonstrated achievement and/or potential ability in any of the following areas, singularly or in combination:</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<list id="list1-0162353212470039" list-type="bullet">

</list>
<p>The reforms that were mentioned previously in the area of Special Education in Ireland in the 1990s led to the establishment of a Special Education Review Committee in 1992. Ireland has had a very poor record in relation to Special Education. Up until 1970, students with special needs were neglected in the system and often were unable to attend school. Between 1970 and 1990, these students were sent to special schools with very poor outcomes for the students. It was only in the reform era of the 1990s that a policy of integration and inclusion was introduced. A small group of parents of gifted children who were frustrated that their children were not being provided for within the Irish educational system formed a gifted lobby group, and they were represented on the Special Education Review Committee. The first Irish definition of giftedness as offered by the report of The Special Education Review Committee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0162353212470039">Department of Education and Science, 1993</xref>) owes much to Marland’s definition, with proficiency in each of the categories of general ability, specific ability, creative thinking, leadership, visual and performance art, and psychomotor ability represented, and a separate section on mechanical aptitude included. The publication of the Education Act in Ireland in 1998 led to an increased call for the area of special needs to be addressed. Consequently, the Education for Special Needs Act known as the EPSON Act was published in 2001. However, although it provided for various special needs, including dyslexia and other learning difficulties, there was no reference to giftedness as a recognizable special need in Ireland and therefore no resource hours for special needs teachers were reserved for gifted students. This was a major blow to the cause for advocates of the gifted movement in Ireland, because although schools were now legally obliged to address cases of students with special needs, they did not have to consider gifted children as part of this plan.</p>
<p>In 2001, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) was established as a statutory body to advise the Minister for Education and Skills on curriculum and assessment for early childhood education and for primary and postprimary schools. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0162353212470039">2007</xref>, the NCCA addressed the area of highly able children and published a set of draft guidelines for teachers to deal with these. The term <italic>gifted</italic> is not explicitly stated, rather the phrase <italic>exceptionally able</italic> is used to describe students who require opportunities for enrichment and extension that go beyond those provided for the general cohort of students. The following description was used and is the closest in terms of a definition of gifted children that Ireland has published.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>With that in mind approximately 5-10% of the school population may be exceptionally able and will demonstrate very high levels of attainment in one or more of the following areas:</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<list id="list2-0162353212470039" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>general intellectual ability or talent</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>specific academic aptitude or talent</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>visual and performing arts and sports</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>leadership ability</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>creative and productive thinking</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>mechanical ingenuity</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>special abilities in empathy, understanding and negotiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0162353212470039">NCCA, 2007</xref>, p. 8).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>A subsequent review of these guidelines by teachers and school principals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0162353212470039">NCCA, 2008</xref>) showed that they succeeded best in supporting school management and teachers to audit and review school policy in relation to gifted children. However, feedback also indicated that the guidelines did not give enough support in allowing teachers to differentiate curriculum.</p>
<sec id="section4-0162353212470039">
<title>Political Climate</title>
<p>The emphasis a country places on gifted students or the concept of giftedness in general is usually dependent on the educational policy and educational philosophy of that particular country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0162353212470039">Gross, 2003</xref>). In some countries, education is highly centralized and a certain educational philosophy dominates. Ireland, for example, has an egalitarian philosophy where national legislation and policy can have a tremendous influence on the development of any initiatives for gifted and talented programming. In countries with decentralized educational systems, the climate for program development may vary considerably in different regions or in different historical time periods. In Canada, gifted and talented programming varies by province, whereas in the United States, it varies by state or school district. In Australia, gifted programming tends to be influenced by the political party in power and can vary by time as well as region.</p>
<p>Cultural influences on gifted education are often related to educational philosophies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0162353212470039">Freeman (1992)</xref> pointed out that the egalitarian philosophy holds that the primary purpose of education is to create similar outcomes for all students. Therefore, an important educational goal in an egalitarian culture is the reduction of individual differences (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0162353212470039">Robinson, 1999</xref>). Those with an egalitarian philosophy of education often oppose homogeneous grouping of high-ability students on the grounds that gifted classes are elitist and that gifted students can make it on their own without needing special interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0162353212470039">Moon &amp; Roselli, 2000</xref>). Furthermore, egalitarians often believe that other students will suffer academically when deprived of association with high-ability classmates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0162353212470039">Oakes, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0162353212470039">Slavin, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>Countries with egalitarian educational philosophies can be influenced by advocacy to modify their stance. Finland, for example, has become more receptive to gifted education because of pressure from industry for greater investment in excellence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0162353212470039">Tirri &amp; Uusikyla, 1994</xref>). In Ireland too, falling numbers of people taking science and technology courses at third level has led to widespread investment in the science and technology sector at school level to promote the study of science. The foundation of Discover Science and Engineering (DSE) in Ireland in 2004 is an example of this. DSE is an Irish government–funded project designed to promote interest in science. DSE’s overall objectives are to increase the number of students studying the physical sciences at both school and university, to promote a positive attitude to careers in science, to generate an interest in engineering and technology, and to foster a greater understanding of science and its value to Irish society. This is an admirable project that has led to increases in the number of people taking science-based courses at university. However, gifted students were not targeted as part of this venture.</p>
<p>The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is an initiative of the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD). First implemented in 2000, it examines the extent to which students from various participating countries are able to demonstrate key competencies in reading, mathematics, and science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0162353212470039">Cosgrove, Shiel, Sofroniou, Zastrutski, &amp; Shortt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0162353212470039">OECD, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0162353212470039">OECD, 2004</xref>). Ireland participates in PISA, and there is widespread media coverage of outcomes and results. One of the main goals of Ireland’s involvement with PISA comes from a perspective of achieving equity in educational outcomes reflecting the country’s egalitarian philosophy. This leads to a larger focus on reasons of low achievement rather than focusing on the results of the high-achieving students. In any case, the results from PISA are not that encouraging from an Irish perspective. Despite Ireland’s mean scores in the 2009 PISA report on the overall scale not being significantly different from the OECD average of the other 65 countries, Ireland has shown the largest decline in average scores from the first PISA results in 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0162353212470039">Cosgrove, Perkins, Moran, &amp; Shiel, 2011</xref>). The percentage of high-achieving males fell by 7 points between 2000 and 2009 and the percentage of high-achieving females fell by 8 points. However, with the decline in scores of low-achieving students in reading and mathematics, much of the media attention emphasized the low achievement outcomes. The Educational Research Centre (ERC) of Ireland concluded that some of the decline was related to demographic changes in the PISA cohort in Ireland since 2000. These included an increase in the proportion of immigrant students, and greater participation of students with special educational needs in mainstream schools.</p>
<p>Ireland has significantly fewer students at the higher proficiency levels (at/above Level 5) than the OECD average (6.7% compared with 12.7%). The United Kingdom (9.8%) and Poland (10.4%) are countries with similar education systems to Ireland, and they too have higher average scores at the high proficiency levels. There are also proportionally more high-achieving students in Northern Ireland (10.3%) than in the rest of Ireland (6.7%). The percentage of high-achieving students in Ireland is also much lower than the corresponding percentage in Finland where 21.6% of students achieved at Level 5 or 6. This pattern of results suggests that Ireland’s low average performance is, in part, attributable to the comparatively low performance of higher achieving students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0162353212470039">Cosgrove et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the problems lies with the fact that there are currently no provisions within teacher training programs to work with gifted students. The emphasis is on students at the other end of the spectrum with differing educational needs. Given that under the EPSON Act, there is no provision for special needs teachers to work with gifted students, there is little or no motivation for trainee teachers to be given techniques to work with gifted students as the schools will have very few resources available to them once they start their teaching. There is an online course available for teachers run by Institute of Child Education and Psychology Europe (ICEP Europe), which is a provider of online Continuing Professional Development (CPD) and university-validated diploma programs in special educational needs for teachers, parents, and allied professionals who work with children and young people. They offer a course for teachers who wish to work with gifted students. However, this course is not financially supported by the Department of Education, and teachers must pay to avail of it.</p>
<p>Following the publication of the Education Act in 1998, there was much excitement within the small gifted community that this would mean schools would now need to provide separately for gifted children. However, this was quashed following parliamentary questions on the issue when the Minister of Education in 2001 stated that it was the decision of the boards of management of the schools to provide services for high-ability students. Given that nearly all of the public funding for schools goes toward teacher’s salaries and that the limited number of resource teachers available to each school would be focusing on students at the other end of the spectrum than gifted children, there currently does not seem to be any political backing for the advancement of gifted children in Ireland.</p>
<p>In spite of the lack of political will and the shortage of resources, the gifted community in the country—mostly parents of high-ability students—were anxious to provide the best opportunities possible for their children. This led to the establishment of a Talent Search to identify gifted children from all the schools in the country and the introduction of an out-of-school university-based program for gifted students. This will be discussed in the next section.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0162353212470039">
<title>Talent Search in Ireland</title>
<p>Without the support of government and with little cooperation from schools, Dublin City University formulated an ambitious plan to provide services for gifted students. In 1992, with the aid of Center for Talented Youth (CTY) at Johns Hopkins University, a talent search was introduced to identify high-ability students for the first gifted summer program run at Dublin City University organized by the Irish Centre for Talented Youth (CTYI). To date, some 45,000 Irish students aged 6 to 17 have participated in a Talent Search run by CTYI to identify high-ability students. Letters are written to all schools in the country to ask them to identify students who have scored at or above the 95th percentile on a standardized test. As of 2012, up to 70% of the schools in the country have participated in the Talent Search. Following the Talent Search, qualifying students are asked to attend an awards ceremony at Dublin City University to recognize their achievement.</p>
<p>The Talent Search concept, pioneered by Julian Stanley in the 1970s, offers a challenging test designed for older students and bright, motivated younger students as a means of identifying exceptional talent in a specific domain. The Talent Search is effectively a two-step process. First, students who score highly on a standardized achievement test are invited to take an above-level test as a measure of their aptitude. Second, the above-level test is administered to the eligible students. Identifying students who score well on standardized tests would not be difficult in Ireland as schools must administer tests in reading and mathematics at two stages in a child’s career in primary school. Secondary schools in Ireland would often use standardized tests for students attending the school before they are admitted. These tests cannot be used for entry to the school but are often used to help with the future educational planning for the particular student and may identify if the student has a particular learning difficulty. Following discussions with Dublin City University and Johns Hopkins University, it was decided that Irish students would take the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) as the out-of-level test to qualify for programming. The CTY had been using the SAT for many years as an identification tool with good success. Given that Irish students speak English as their first language and would usually not have seen the SAT before, it was hoped to be a good indicator of academic potential among Irish students. Early and subsequent results showed that Irish Talent Search results were very similar to those of their American counterparts, and thus, the test was applicable to an Irish audience.</p>
<p>Normally, the out-of-level test would be suitable for students 2 to 4 years above the students taking the test. The youngest of the Irish students would take the SAT at 13 and be compared with 17-year-old college-bound American students. This allows those students who have hit the ceiling in grade achievement tests to demonstrate their advanced abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162353212470039">Lupkowski-Shoplik, Benbow, Assouline, &amp; Brody, 2003</xref>). This approach uses a standardized test designed for older students to determine the degree to which younger students’ abilities exceed those that can be measured using tests for their own age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0162353212470039">Charlton, Marolf, &amp; Stanley, 2002</xref>). If a student is scoring at the 97th percentile for his or her age on a grade-level test, then he or she has usually answered all the questions on this test correctly. The results of this testing can show that students have mastered the material expected for their particular age but will not be able to show what the students might know beyond grade level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0162353212470039">Swiatek, 2007</xref>). By providing this above-level or out-of-level testing, talent searches allow parents and schools to determine how much a child’s level of performance differs from the performance of other above-average students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0162353212470039">Matthews, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, it allows parents to decide what curricular modifications might be necessary for meeting the child’s academic needs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0162353212470039">Stanley (1991)</xref> suggested that the overall purpose of the Talent Search Model is to educate for individual development over the life span of the student.</p>
<p>Benefits found from Talent Search include students gaining a better understanding of their academic abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162353212470039">Brody, 1998</xref>) and reporting higher educational and career aspirations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0162353212470039">Van Tassel-Baska, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0162353212470039">Wilder &amp; Casserly, 1988</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0162353212470039">Olszewski-Kubilius and Grant (1996)</xref> documented that students who participate in talent searches are more likely to participate in academic extracurricular activities and to pursue more rigorous academic courses and careers in the future. The predictive validity of above-level tests has been demonstrated by the academic success of high-scoring students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0162353212470039">Swiatek, 2007</xref>). Longitudinal studies have documented impressive achievements among seventh and eighth graders who have taken the SAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0162353212470039">Lubinski &amp; Benbow, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0162353212470039">Stanley, 1976</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0162353212470039">Barnett and Durden (1993)</xref> found that students who participate in talent searches and went on to take advanced academic programs were more likely to pursue academic challenges while still in high school and to enter more competitive colleges and universities. Talent Search methods have been shown to be effective at identifying primary school students as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0162353212470039">Colangelo, Assouline, &amp; Lu, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0162353212470039">Lupkowski-Shoplik &amp; Swiatek, 1999</xref>).</p>

<title>Gifted Programs in Ireland</title>
<p>Currently, the only formal program for gifted students in Ireland is the CTYI. CTYI was established following negotiations with Dublin City University and CTY at Johns Hopkins University who were interested in starting an international program based on the principles of the CTY program. CTYI was started at Dublin City University in 1992, with the following aims:</p>
<list id="list3-0162353212470039" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>to identify through national and international talent searches precollege children who reason extremely well mathematically and/or verbally;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to provide talented youth both from Ireland and overseas with challenging and invigorating coursework and related educational opportunities through an annual summer program, and on Saturday classes during the school year;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to provide teacher training and support services to schools participating in the CTYI program;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to assist parents in advancing talented students by providing access to information and resources; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to research and evaluate talent development and the effectiveness of program models and curriculum provision (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dcu.ie/ctyi">www.dcu.ie/ctyi</ext-link>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>As part of its mission, CTYI runs Saturday courses for primary school children at various centers around the country. These courses would traditionally be in noncurricular subjects, giving students the opportunity to study topics that they would not usually be exposed to in school. Examples of subjects in Saturday classes that primary school students in this study experienced included forensic science, zoology, science of tomorrow, engineering, computer programming, journalism, legal studies, and psychology.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0162353212470039">Feldhusen and Sokol (1982)</xref> identified some key cognitive needs of talented students addressed by Saturday programs. The gifted must try to acquire a broader store of knowledge, learn new research methods, and exercise self-direction in learning. Saturday programs provide the opportunity for gifted and talented youth to engage in some in-depth study in areas of interest, with a curriculum that can be enriched and accelerated to fit students’ needs. Saturday programs should offer a wealth of information (enrichment) at a fast pace (acceleration). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162353212470039">Feldhusen and Ruckman (1988)</xref> suggested that an effective Saturday program should be between 7 and 12 weeks in length, with 2 to 3 hr of instruction per week. The CTYI Saturday course is a 9-week program with 2.5 hr of instruction every week. This allows sufficient time for detailed pursuit of a topic and for any significant project involvement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0162353212470039">Feldhusen and Wyman (1980)</xref> believed that a college or university campus is an excellent location for a Saturday program. College or university lecture theaters provide an excellent setting for the classes and the professional academic environment may serve as a career stimulus for the talented adolescent. The CTYI Saturday classes in Dublin take place on the campus of Dublin City University and the regional classes take place in third-level institutions around the country.</p>
<p>Courses given would normally be in subjects that would be offered at the third level and are taught by subject experts in the particular area. The teachers would usually be part-time lecturers or postgraduate students from the third-level institution hosting the course. In this way, CTYI students have access to third-level facilities and teachers who have particular knowledge in their area of interest. Typically in primary school, these students have one teacher for all subject areas and have little or no opportunity to develop their knowledge in specific academic areas.</p>
<p>Another out-of-school program option for gifted students is summer programs. CTYI runs 3-week residential summer programs at Dublin City University for high-ability, secondary school students. Examples of summer course subjects that secondary school students participated in included biomedical diagnostics, theoretical physics, criminology, corporate business, social psychology, international relations, and writing for life. The variety and depth of subjects offered is important because although Irish students have teachers in different subject areas at the secondary level, it is often the case that either the subject might not be challenging enough for them (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0162353212470039">Kulik, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0162353212470039">Moon, Feldhusen &amp; Dillon, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0162353212470039">Vaughan, Feldhusen, &amp; Asher, 1991</xref>) or in some instances, the students may excel in a subject that is not offered at secondary school (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0162353212470039">Benbow &amp; Stanley, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0162353212470039">Olszewski-Kubilius, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0162353212470039">Olszewski-Kubilius &amp; Lee, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Summer programs for gifted students may vary in length and focus but most have several components in common: an accelerated and enriched curriculum, dedicated staff, peer interaction with others of similar ability, and a supportive environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0162353212470039">Olszewski-Kubilius, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0162353212470039">Coleman and Cross (1988)</xref> reported that some high-ability children report to feeling different from peers, so placing them in programs with like-minded individuals may enhance feelings of acceptance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162353212470039">Enerson (1993)</xref> found that summer programs may help to meet gifted students’ academic, social, and psychological needs. Classes at CTYI are kept small so that students may interact with one another, for experience shows that students learn as much through intensive interaction with their peers as they do through direct instruction (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0162353212470039">Mills &amp; Durden, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0162353212470039">Tangherlini &amp; Durden, 1993</xref>). The class size at CTYI allows a pupil–instructor ratio of around 15 to 1, which is much lower than the average class size in Irish schools. The intense nature of the program means that students are required to put in a very high level of work during the period and for many students this may be the first time that they have ever really been challenged academically. Adjusting to this new challenge allows them to maximize their high-academic potential.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162353212470039">Enerson (1993)</xref> also found that while satisfaction with challenging coursework taught by expert teachers and the opportunity to live on a university campus was important, making friends and gaining confidence in one’s ability is equally vital. The fact that so many students return to the courses at CTYI each year validates this assertion. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0162353212470039">Kolloff and Moore (1989)</xref> pointed out that the most critical aspect for students in residential programs is to discover that there are other young people who think the same way as they do, who are interested in the same ideas, and who like to learn in similar ways.</p>
<p>Summer programs have been found to be positive experiences for gifted students, offering them opportunities to interact with other equally able students and to further develop their intellectual ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0162353212470039">Van Tassel-Baska, Landau, &amp; Olszewski, 1985</xref>). The social component is a very important aspect of the summer program at CTYI, and as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162353212470039">Feldhusen (1991)</xref> pointed out, the opportunity to share a common viewpoint or discuss a topic deeply and passionately is not typically available in a 40-min period. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0162353212470039">Rimm (1991)</xref> stated that these classes may be necessary for gifted students to stop them from underachieving or developing poor study habits. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162353212470039">Enerson (1993)</xref> pointed out, programming should stimulate curiosity and allow investigation while introducing new areas of interest.</p>
<p>In 1993, CTYI ran the first summer program for gifted children in secondary school using students identified from the Talent Search. In the 1st year of the program, 133 Irish students attended. The program has proved to be a successful outlet for high-ability students and was expanded to include primary school students in 1997. In the academic year 2011-2012, more than 5,000 students aged 6 to 17 participated in programs run by CTYI. One of the main drawbacks to CTYI is that there is currently no government funding to subsidize the project, and therefore the parents must pay tuition for their child to attend. This has led to an underrepresentation of children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds attending CTYI.</p>
<p>To counter this trend, CTYI along with the Dublin City University Access service started the Center for Academic Achievement (CAA) in 2006. The DCU Access Service provides supports for students from disadvantaged areas to attend university and assists them while they are attending. The decision to start these classes was taken after a needs-analysis report from local primary school principals highlighted the lack of support for bright students from classes in disadvantaged areas. Using a steering committee of interested parties from various schools, teachers were asked to identify students who could participate and better develop their academic talent. The goal was to encourage students who traditionally would not have access to university resources and materials toward an academic path and to fulfill their potential. There was no charge to the students or their families or schools for attending these programs. To date, more than 1,200 primary school students have participated in the CAA program.</p>

<title>Other Resources Available for Gifted Students in Ireland</title>
<p>In February 2008, Giftedkids.ie was launched as an advocacy and support website for parents and educators of exceptionally able and twice exceptional children in Ireland. It was unique in that it was the first website to actively meet the needs of parents and teachers of gifted children from an Irish perspective. Run by a small voluntary group of parent and teacher advocates, the site currently acts as a signpost to online resources and has a huge range available for parents, teachers, and children. One of the most active areas of the site is the online community forum where teachers and parents can share strategies, offer support, and seek advice in a secure and supportive environment. In 2010, the Giftedkids team, with the support of Social Entrepreneurs Ireland, the National Centre for Technology in Education, and the Centre for Talented Youth Ireland launched a highly successful series of free online webinars aimed at parents and teachers. Since its launch, Giftedkids has grown in scope and reach. In 2008, Giftedkids had a total of 29,309 visitors viewing 253,743 pages; by 2011, this had risen to a total of 183,348 visitors viewing 645,165 pages. Although Giftedkids has an Irish emphasis, its web statistics show a global reach with increasing visitor numbers from the United States.</p>
<p>A popular blog in the area of gifted education in Ireland is <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://innreach.wordpress.com/">http://innreach.wordpress.com/</ext-link>. This blog includes information on education strategies, presentations in the area and social media, and web support around gifted and talented students. Another resource in this area is dazzledandfrazzled.com, which provides support for parents and teachers of gifted children. They were instrumental in making Ireland part of EU Gifted Awareness Day in 2011, and this became a Gifted Awareness Week in 2012. Awareness of gifted education is an important issue for parents and teachers in Ireland as they are often unfamiliar with best practices from a research perspective. To meet this need, in 2008, CTYI began holding a one-day conference every year for parents and teachers of gifted students. Usually an international expert in the field will speak at this conference, and the event is usually well attended with 150 to 200 people coming every year.</p>

<title>Recommendations</title>
<p>High-ability students are often not stretched by regular curriculum at school, and this can lead to boredom and frustration. By challenging these students at a level appropriate to their abilities, the students can become stimulated and motivated to achieve their potential. In 2005, the Department of Education and Science in Ireland produced a report evaluating curriculum implementation in primary schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162353212470039">Department of Education and Science, 2005</xref>). The report stated that in almost half of the classes, no provision was made for different learning styles and individual needs in mathematics. It was also reported that there was no differentiation within learning tasks for pupils of varying abilities. Often teachers do not know how to differentiate curriculum for gifted children. Changes may need to be made at the teacher training level to provide guidelines for new teachers on how to work with gifted students. Currently there is little or no training or professional development for teachers in this area, and this needs to improve for gifted children to reach their potential within the school system.</p>
<p>Identification of gifted children in Ireland is a problem. This stems from the lack of a definition of <italic>gifted child</italic> within the Irish literature. As we have stated previously, Irish definitions of giftedness owe much to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0162353212470039">Marland (1972)</xref> definition. In the Irish context, it is worth looking at this more closely. First, there is the requirement that gifted students need to be identified by professionally qualified persons. From this definition, there is a certain level of uncertainty that teachers or parents are suitable individuals to identify these students and that an independent level of assessment is required. There is also a statement that these children require a differentiated program beyond the school curriculum to allow them to thrive. This certainly conflicts with more traditional thinking in an Irish context that these students are provided for within a regular curriculum and these students can be challenged by regular classroom activities. A general consensus among practitioners is that students who are gifted have the potential to perform at levels beyond what may be expected for their age. Most experts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0162353212470039">Benbow &amp; Stanley, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0162353212470039">Kulik, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0162353212470039">Moon, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0162353212470039">Olszewski-Kubilius, 1989</xref>) agree that gifted children fall into the special educational needs category as they have different educational needs than that of a general population. We need to define giftedness in a more relevant fashion from an Irish context, and once this is done, it seems imperative that giftedness be moved back into the special needs category. In this instance, resource teaching would become available to these students within their regular school.</p>
<p>Perhaps a culture shift away from the egalitarian philosophy that permeates in Ireland is needed when one develops practices best suited to gifted students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0162353212470039">Gallagher (1993)</xref> pointed out that an equal opportunity culture values equality of opportunity more than equality of outcomes and recognizes or should recognize that providing equal opportunities allows gifted individuals to reach their potential. A core educational value in an equal opportunity culture is adapting instruction to meet individual needs, whereas in an egalitarian culture, achieving excellence beyond age groups is discouraged. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0162353212470039">Moon and Roselli (2000)</xref> pointed out that egalitarians tend to reject gifted education when it is based on narrow conceptions of giftedness as innate, fixed, and measurable. They are more open to giftedness when it is focused on multiple talents that are developed in inclusive settings. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0162353212470039">Robinson (1999)</xref> pointed out that equal opportunity cultures encourage the development of a range of activities for talent development of gifted students. The current international movement away from traditional identification tools for gifted students is very beneficial from an Irish perspective. It is hugely important within Ireland that all students are eligible for high-ability programs. Broadening our definition of what constitutes giftedness and applying this to specific circumstances makes it possible to identify students who traditionally are underrepresented in gifted programs. Rethinking gifted education in the form of talent development takes away a lot of the stigma and elitism associated with gifted programs. It also allows these programs to produce appropriate outcomes for the students who are involved in them.</p>
<p>Therefore, when giftedness is properly defined in Ireland, it needs to be a broad definition that incorporates different types of ability and identifies people from all socioeconomic backgrounds. Much of this can be based on the availability of funding and resources. Naturally, when resources are ample, more options exist for gifted students, but where resources are scarce, the needs of the gifted are usually a lower priority than those of disadvantaged and disabled students. The current economic climate in Ireland is one of austerity with many budget cuts in education, so gifted students would not expect any allocation of resources for a considerable period of time. However, if one stresses the importance of gifted children in building the country for the future, then government policy may change in that regard.</p>
<p>The message within the Irish system seems to advocate including gifted students within the regular classroom and school. Acceleration is rarely practiced in schools in Ireland, with many schools pointing to the potential negative social consequences of such practices. However, research consistently reports achievement benefits for all forms of acceleration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162353212470039">Kulik, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0162353212470039">Rogers, 2004</xref>), while finding little or no evidence of social or psychological harm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0162353212470039">Colangelo, Assouline, &amp; Gross, 2004</xref>). Most forms of acceleration have been shown to have little effect on measures of socialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0162353212470039">Rogers, 2002</xref>). Despite this seemingly overwhelmingly positive research evidence in support of acceleration for gifted students, it is still not a popular option among teachers and educators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0162353212470039">Bain, Bliss, Choate, &amp; Brown, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0162353212470039">Plunkett, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0162353212470039">Southern, Jones, &amp; Fiscus, 1989</xref>). Moving forward, there may be a need for Irish educators to embrace acceleration to give Irish gifted students some level of flexibility in their education.</p>
<p>In terms of out-of-school activities, the Talent Search has been an effective model for identifying Irish high-ability children. The use of out-of-level testing allows us to challenge students beyond their normal school levels. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0162353212470039">Rotigel and Lupkowski-Shoplik (1999)</xref> listed the benefits of participating in Talent Searches to include educational diagnosis, educational recommendations for particular students, appropriate information, educational awards, and further educational opportunities. Looking at this a little closer from an Irish perspective, we can see that the benefit of diagnosis is that above-level testing will give a more accurate picture of the ability of the particular student. Recommendations and appropriate information will allow children to have a better sense of where their abilities lie and what options may be available for them at school or outside school. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162353212470039">Goldstein and Wagner (1993)</xref> believed that award ceremonies represent the first and possibly only opportunity for public recognition many of these exceptional youngsters will receive. In Ireland, it is much more common to recognize achievements in a sporting arena and there are very few opportunities for academically talented children to shine within the Irish system.</p>
<p>As well as developing programs in school, it is important to continue with university-based out-of-school programs. Researchers and practitioners have proposed the need for special out-of-school programs for gifted students who face barriers in developing their academic capabilities in regular schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0162353212470039">Benbow &amp; Stanley, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0162353212470039">Olszewski-Kubilius, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0162353212470039">Olszewski-Kubilius &amp; Lee, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0162353212470039">Feldhusen (1997)</xref> stated that gifted students often do not have a variety of educational opportunities available to them in their schools and out-of-school programs are necessary to fill this void and foster talent development. Certain out-of-school programs enhance gifted students’ self-confidence, self-esteem, motivation to achieve, and personal responsibility for learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0162353212470039">Olszewski-Kubilius &amp; Grant, 1996</xref>). This enables them to succeed in subsequent academic courses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0162353212470039">Rimm (1991)</xref> stated that special programs for academically gifted children may be necessary to save them from a pattern of underachieving or poor study habits that result from easy or boring classes in their regular schools. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162353212470039">Enerson (1993)</xref> pointed out, these types of educational programs are needed to stimulate academic curiosity within gifted students. Out-of-school programs may be necessary for the brightest students who may not be challenged enough in school. One’s judgment in relation to out-of-school programs may depend on his or her educational philosophy. If you believe that gifted students are those with special needs, then outside school programs are necessary for their development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0162353212470039">Olszewski-Kubilius, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Perhaps, most important is the need for more research in this area. This article will go some way to highlighting this important issue. There is very little published research in this area in Ireland, although doctoral research has shown that gifted students benefit from out-of-school programs in Ireland both academically and socially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0162353212470039">O’Reilly, 2010</xref>). Findings from this study demonstrate that high-ability students from both primary and secondary school have more academic satisfaction and a more positive attitude from attending CTYI compared with school. Another doctoral study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162353212470039">Cooke, 2012</xref>) shows the benefits of an intervention program in Ireland on high-ability students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. This is significant from an Irish perspective because it is an indication that decision makers within the country realize that gifted students can come from all parts of society and not just from privileged backgrounds.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Ireland currently has a very challenging position in relation to the education system. As a result of changing demographics, enrollment figures will continue to rise over the medium term with enrollment at primary level projected to grow by 9.3% over the period 2009-2010 to 2014-2015 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0162353212470039">Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, 2012</xref>). This will bring fresh demands with regard to teacher supply, school accommodation, higher education provision, and education supports for special needs students. There is uncertainty over the status of gifted students and whether they classify as special needs students. By current definition within the Irish system, they do not qualify for any resource hours for extra instruction, and no special pull-out classes for high-ability students exist in Ireland. Very few schools have any direct policy relating to gifted children, and under the existing system, there is no requirement for them to make special provisions for such students.</p>
<p>The only provision for these students comes in the form of out-of-school programs. There is no specific teacher training for teachers of high-ability students in the form of a specialized postgraduate qualification, and it is often a neglected area in terms of general teacher training programs. Giftedness should be recognized as a special need within the Irish education system for this to change. It is important that gifted students are provided the services they need within and outside of school.</p>
<p>The gifted movement is definitely gaining momentum in this country. Each year, enrollment has increased at the CTYI. More parents are involving themselves on specialized Irish websites to see if there are further resources available to them. With continued advocacy and heightened awareness, there is hope for a brighter future for gifted students in Ireland.</p>
