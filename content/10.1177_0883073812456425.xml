<p>Our understanding of childhood stroke and other cerebrovascular disorders has dramatically evolved since the first edition of <italic>Pediatric Stroke and Cerebrovascular Disorders</italic> 2 decades ago. Under the guidance of Dr Roach, who chaired the American Heart Association panel that produced the consensus guidelines on childhood stroke, this third edition provides a readily accessible and clinical useful summary of childhood cerebrovascular disorders.</p>
<p>Establishing a comprehensive anatomic, etiological, and pathophysiological foundation, the authors provide a thorough discussion of various hemorrhagic and thrombotic disorders, vascular malformations, embolism, vasculitis, hemiplegic migraine, neuroimaging and laboratory workup, genetic causes of cerebrovascular disease, and a separate chapter covering the newborn infant.</p>
<p>Chapters are thoughtfully illustrated with generous use of neuroimaging that effectively demonstrates specific pathology. Relevant published studies are appropriately integrated and reviewed. During this review, I happened to diagnose and manage 2 patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. The relevant chapter was comprehensive and appropriately referenced. Table 16.1 laid out a clear differential. The observed clinical features from 5 different case series were reviewed in Table 16.3, and published risk factors from 6 different series were laid out in Table 16.4. The authors’ stated goal of summarizing current recommendations is very well illustrated in the accompanying discussion on anticoagulation in cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Quoting William Osler, “The value of experience is not in seeing much, but in seeing wisely.” The final chapter encompassing the acute and long-term management of pediatric stroke is worthy of thoughtful review.</p>
<p>In summary, the third edition of <italic>Pediatric Stroke and Cerebrovascular Disorders</italic> offers a comprehensive analysis of the current thinking and practice in the field. The authors successfully achieve their stated goals. This book merits an unconditional recommendation.</p>
