<sec id="sec1-1038416213497193" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In this paper, we argue for the need to develop approaches for career counselling which may be more suitable to the dynamic context for work and career in a globalised world. This is not a new argument: the call for interpretative approaches was made in the late 20th century by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1038416213497193">Young and Collin (1992)</xref>, amongst others (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1038416213497193">Cochran, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1038416213497193">Savickas, 1997</xref>). On the hard ground of practice in the ‘Western’ post-industrial world, however, the view that career is about finding a job still dominates: rather than thinking about how a career fits into a life.</p>
<p>The case for a transformation in terms of how career counselling interventions should be framed is argued around the world. The European/American research group that formed to develop the “Life designing” approach argued for a paradigm shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1038416213497193">Savickas et al., 2009</xref>). As recognised by the Life designing research group, calls for transformation and innovation can lead to a negation of the value of existing theories and models; amounting to “throwing out the baby with bath water”. We are mindful in our study that the need for change is rooted in the context of increasingly vulnerable economies in countries that might be better described as Northern Atlantic, rather than “Western”; where reliance on previous models developed in the 20th century appears unwise for current times. However, this is not meant to imply that the model could not be usefully employed by career counsellors outside these contexts, as models that are more attuned to contemporary life and work can, we argue, help us to rethink the part that career plays within a life.</p>
<p>What we are not suggesting is that there can, or should be, a singular approach to career counselling interviewing. We would view the model described in this paper as fitting into a constructivist framework with a focus on how the individual constructs meaning in a life and in a career. As such, the model’s usefulness needs to be evaluated in the context of practice. This is important in order to acknowledge the dangers of importing (or exporting) models across cultures and contexts, particularly if they fail to consider the relevance for particular communities, cultures and individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1038416213497193">Arulmani, 2009</xref>). However, as reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1038416213497193">Reid &amp; West, 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1038416213497193">2011b</xref>), current economic circumstances in certain contexts can inhibit the practitioner’s capacity for innovation: ‘best get on with the job in hand’: i.e. finding people jobs to provide a livelihood. The need for innovation to move beyond 20th-century models for career counselling practice may be in short supply.</p>
<p>The subject of this paper is an in-depth qualitative pilot study of a new approach for career counselling, focusing on enabling clients to challenge their limiting assumptions; the Career Thinking Session (CTS). This paper begins by defining some key terms and the CTS is then outlined. A brief literature review follows and the background to the research is described, in order to set it into context and to explain how the work developed. The research methodology is then critiqued and the approach taken to data analysis is described, noting the questions that we continue to ask of the material. We then illustrate our approach to analysis through focusing on one case study (Helen) from the project. This illuminates the particularities arising from the analysis in one case, before we make reference to the commonalities and themes that are suggested across the material. A discussion follows, before concluding with thoughts about the usefulness of the model and its possible further development.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1038416213497193"><title>Defining the terms used</title>
<p>The terms used in this paper will be familiar, but can be redolent with meaning according to context. The purpose of career guidance has been defined elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1038416213497193">OECD, 2004</xref>) and the evolution of the terms career guidance, career development and career counselling has been discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1038416213497193">Savickas (2011</xref>). Mostly, we will use the term career counselling in this paper as a reflection of the model’s positioning within the epistemology of career construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1038416213497193">Savickas, 2005</xref>). The model can be described as involving a particularly interpersonal process, and is not about information giving, advice or job preparation. The interaction takes place in what has been described elsewhere as ‘a transitional space’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1038416213497193">Reid &amp; West, 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1038416213497193">2011b</xref>), drawing on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1038416213497193">Winnicott (1971)</xref>. In the CTS, the individual deconstructs their thinking in order to question their limiting assumptions and work towards reconstructing their views about what might be possible. It is worth re-iterating here that just as one model will not be effective with all clients, not all clients present with limiting assumptions; working from this premise would in itself be an assumption. However, with those that do, the practitioner needs to tread carefully, as an individual’s cultural background can inform the assumptions they may be making, which in turn can be rooted in their personal values. Questioning an individual’s values can be intrusive; but recognising that values arise within cultural contexts, alerts us to the need to question such discourses where these become barriers to alternative ways of exploring what might be possible for a career and a life. The practitioner needs to listen to the ‘other voices’ present in the interview which may be limiting the client’s (and their own) thinking. Aided by the practitioner, the aim is for the client to recognise and challenge these limiting assumptions through the thinking process. Savickas states ‘Deconstruction seeks to undo a story’s uncritical domination over a client’s thinking, not destroy the story’ (2011, p. 111). This deconstruction is a deeply reflexive process which concentrates on an exploration of career past, present and future, rather than an attempt to fix career goals or plan action. Reconstruction within the CTS is however future orientated, as will be discussed later. This approach is challenging for both the practitioner and the client when tidy outcomes are expected: this raises a number of issues, which we return to in the evaluation. What the model appears to do, with its focus on challenging limiting assumptions, is to slow the interview process down, giving the client an opportunity to consider their motivations and critically analyse some of the barriers that might prevent their career development. This resonates with the definition of career counselling suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1038416213497193">Savickas (2011</xref>), with its concentration on collaboration, narration, themes, reflexivity, constructing meaning and considering life projects. That said we remain mindful that counselling perspectives based on individual decision-making can ignore the structural constraints that define access to opportunities for many. In the above we have referred to a constructivist methodology, indicating a link to approaches that work alongside an individual as they construct meaning in their life and their career. In what follows we link this to the literature on social constructionism, to denote that this construction takes place in a social setting, with others. And, although it can be argued that the word social is redundant, retaining the word reminds us that intervention of any kind is always culturally situated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1038416213497193">Bassot, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>First, a word or two about how we name the practitioner and the client within the discussion of the mo<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1038416213497193">del. Kline’s (1999</xref>) work (developed in the context of human resource management and organisational development), which the model adapts, refers to the interviewer as ‘the Listener’ and the interviewee as ‘the Thinker’. We like these terms and use them as they help to emphasise the collaborative nature of the work. However, it is worth noting that our experience of using the terms was at times confusing, as clearly both participants in the process are listening and thinking. But, using these terms facilitates a move away from problems associated with words such as ‘client’ or ‘helper’ that suggest an unequal relationship (albeit issues of power imbalance will remain). Finally, we should clarify that our study is located in the United Kingdom, and our research collaborators were adults in employment. We believe that the model, the case studies and the discussion will be of interest to career colleagues working in other sectors and countries. Before moving on to examine the literature that underpins the approach, the next section will outline Kline’s model.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1038416213497193"><title>The CTS</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1038416213497193">Kline’s (1999)</xref> model comprises the following six steps.
<list id="list1-1038416213497193" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Step 1</italic> – ‘What do you want to think about?’. Here the Thinker needs time to express the thoughts and issues they have brought to the CTS. It is particularly important that the Listener does not rush in with solutions but waits for the Thinker to speak, interjecting when necessary with encouraging comments and supplementary open questions to encourage them to think further about any related issues. Once the Thinker has finished speaking and has nothing else to add, they are ready to move on to Step 2.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Step 2</italic> – ‘What do you want to achieve from the rest of the session?’. This is an opportunity for the Thinker to articulate their goals and desired outcomes from the CTS. Again it is important that the Listener waits for the Thinker to respond, which may take some time. Examples of responses from Thinkers could include things such as ‘to understand more about my future possibilities’, ‘to gain greater clarity in relation to my future’, ‘to explore how I can gain more confidence in my work’ or ‘to think about my work life balance’.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Step 3</italic> – ‘What are you assuming is stopping you from achieving your goal?’. This encourages the Thinker to think about their limiting assumptions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1038416213497193">Kline (1999</xref>) argues that there are three types of limiting assumptions; facts such as ‘I don’t have the required qualifications’, possible facts such as ‘my family would not be supportive’, and bedrock assumptions about self and how life works, such as ‘I won’t be able to do that because I'm not good enough’ or ‘people like me don’t do that’. Such bedrock assumptions can be deep rooted and will usually take time to come to the surface. Often they act as barriers to career progression and can dilute confidence and self-esteem. Bedrock assumptions operate at a deep level, develop over long periods of time (often from early childhood) and are so strong that they inform our beliefs and what we see as ‘truth’. Finding the bedrock assumption is vital in Step 3. It lies beneath ‘fact’ and ‘possible fact’ assumptions and the Thinker will need time to identify and articulate it. It is vital that the Listener recognises it and remembers it.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Step 4</italic> – ‘If you knew that … what ideas would you have towards your goal?’. Here the Listener asks the Thinker to find the positive opposites to their limiting assumptions, with the ultimate goal of enabling the Thinker to design the Incisive Question in relation to their bedrock assumption. Examples of searching for positive opposites in relation to the examples shown in Step 3 could be, ‘if you knew you could study for the required qualifications’ (fact), ‘if you knew your family would support you’ (possible fact), ‘if you knew you were good enough’ (bedrock) or ‘if you knew people like you do, do that’ (bedrock). Such questions encourage the Thinker to challenge their limiting assumptions. It is important to emphasise that the Thinker needs to articulate these questions in their own words, as limiting assumptions are particular to the individual concerned and are based on their view of the world; not that of the Listener. The role of the Listener is to encourage the Thinker to choose what they feel are the most appropriate words for the positive opposites. In Step 4 the Thinker is asked to identify the positive opposite to their bedrock assumption and to state this in relation to their goal for the session. According to Kline, this is the Incisive Question, described as such because it cuts through the limiting bedrock assumption, removing it and replacing it with a new, freeing assumption. This releases the Thinker to think freely and positively about their goal and their future.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Step 5</italic> – Writing down the Incisive Question. The Incisive Question is so important it needs to be captured in writing so that it is not lost. It is important that it is written in the Thinker’s own words. The Listener then poses the Incisive Question a number of times, until the Thinker has voiced all their new positive ideas in relation to their future. This will be explained further in the case study.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Step 6</italic> – Appreciation. This is unusual and can be unexpected. Sharing limiting assumptions is sensitive and challenging, demanding trust and openness on both sides. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1038416213497193">Kline (1999</xref>) states that ‘Appreciation keeps people thinking’ (p. 62) and this last step asks both participants to share a positive quality found in each other that they have valued during the session. This is with a view to encouraging the Thinker to continue thinking once the CTS has finished.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1038416213497193">Kline’s (1999)</xref> book cannot be described as an academic one and is very practical in nature. Within it no reference is made to any literature underpinning the model and it appears to draw solely on Kline’s extensive experience in human resource management and organisational development. Equally, a literature search revealed very few academic writers who have made reference of the work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1038416213497193">de Haan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1038416213497193">Hall, 2013</xref>); those that have referred to it are writing in the domain of coaching. It appears that the model has not been subject to critique.</p>
<p>Having introduced Kline’s model, we now examine the literature within which our adaptation of it is grounded. This short review will define the terms reflectivity and reflexivity, include a brief critique of the concept of reflective practice and emphasise the form of reflexivity that the model calls for. The literature on reflective practice does not always provide clear distinctions between the terms, reflectivity and reflexivity: we will attempt that distinction below. Many clients and practitioners live in a frenetic world where there is pressure to make decisions quickly, with little time for what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1038416213497193">Cochran (1997</xref>) refers to as ‘wavering’. Slowing down the process and creating a space for purposeful reflection, avoids rushing to solutions that limit the opportunity for more meaningful engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1038416213497193">Hansen &amp; Amundson, 2009</xref>). The need for purposeful reflection recognises that human behaviour is complex and that career solutions cannot be selected and applied in an instrumental manner: deeper thinking is required.</p>
<p>The internal process of reflection that is active and conscious can be described using the term reflectivity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1038416213497193">Schön (1987</xref>) stated that the necessity to reflect on professional practice became an increasing need as scientific certainty, and rational problem solving, was challenged by post-modernist ideas. Whilst intuition, subjective and tacit knowledge are recognised as making a significant impact on the decisions made in practice, the understanding of how this happens needs to be examined. From this viewpoint, reflective practice becomes more than internal and individual contemplation and will involve others, in a collaborative process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1038416213497193">Ghaye, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Reflexivity is the process by which we are conscious of our own responses and our reactions to people, events and the dialogue taking place within any interaction. Such an understanding includes an awareness of the personal, social and cultural context and its influence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1038416213497193">Etherington (2004)</xref> suggests that this reflexivity in counselling entails, firstly, inner reflection, and secondly a conscious awareness of our thoughts, feelings and imaginings within our minds <italic>and</italic> bodies. Etherington describes this as the need ‘to know the inner story that we tell ourselves as we listen to our clients’ stories’ (p. 29). This is a deeper metacognitive process that can lead to changes in the way we communicate with our clients and ourselves. In the work reported in this paper, reflexivity enhanced the relationship between the Listener and the Thinker and led to more collaborative work. The aim is to recognise and encourage the individual’s agency to bring about change that is meaningful for them, where change is desired. For the practitioner – the Listener – reflexivity leads to an awareness of the subjective influences which are in play and may need addressing.</p>
<p>Schön (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1038416213497193">1983</xref>, p. 54) refers to theory and research as occupying the ‘high, hard ground’, whilst practice resides in the ‘swampy lowlands’. Thus, ‘Practitioners have to connect with the complexities of practice, in all its diversity, in order to construct <italic>with</italic> their clients, meaningful solutions via reflective processes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1038416213497193">Reid &amp; Bassot, 2011</xref>, p. 103). The concept of reflection is not without its critics however. Munby and Russell claim that Schön’s work is not sufficiently analytical in that, ‘The reflection that Schön is calling attention to is <italic>in the action</italic>, not in associated thinking about action’ (1989, p. 73). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1038416213497193">Eraut (1994)</xref> draws attention to the focus on reflection in professional codes of expert practice. Routine behaviour which is not challenged by continuous professional development can lead to out-of-date experts, who do not engage critically with the more intuitive parts of their day-to-day practice. In addition, as Eraut suggests, when time is a scarce resource the capacity for reflection is limited and action proceeds on the basis of rapid interpretation rather than critical reflection. In a criticism of Schön and Eraut, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1038416213497193">Ixer (1999</xref>, p. 513) states that in the context of ‘busy practice’ in the helping professions ‘there is no such thing as reflection’. What we are advocating for are approaches, such as the CTS, which move away from a technical- and problem-solving process, towards a more developed use of reflection that acknowledges that the counsellor is <italic>in</italic> the process and not an objective, external expert: in short, we are advocating for greater reflexivity.</p>
<p>Early literature on reflective practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1038416213497193">Kolb, 1984</xref>) encourages us to learn from our experiences of work through a process of reflection, in order to improve and develop our practice. Later writers on this subject (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1038416213497193">Brookfield, 1995</xref>) often use the term ‘critically reflective practice’ and ask us to examine our assumptions and to be clear about our values. This involves questioning those things that we take for granted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1038416213497193">Thompson &amp; Thompson, 2008</xref>), and being careful not to accept things at face value. Critically reflective practice encourages a deeper examination of issues, including power in relationships, which is essential when working in a client centred and impartial way.</p>
<p>Two particular writers offer insights into how assumptions are formed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1038416213497193">Argyris’s (1982)</xref> ‘Ladder of Inference’ provides a helpful explanation of how assumptions are made based on previous experiences (both positive and negative). As similar situations occur over a period of time, this often means that we tend to see what we expect to see through selective observation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1038416213497193">Mezirow (1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1038416213497193">1981</xref>) describes seven levels of reflectivity which help us to examine how we approach people and situations: in particular the assumptions we might make as a result of past experiences. The first four levels operate within our ordinary consciousness and include an examination of our feelings and values. The remaining three levels lie within the realm of critical consciousness and include becoming aware of the reasons why we might be quick to make judgements about situations, people and ourselves. By examining our thinking at each level, we can begin to question our assumptions, in particular whether they are accurate or not. This means we can challenge our assumptions where we feel they are not justifiable and reframe them where appropriate. Mezirow asserts that assumptions are always culturally situated and that reflecting within the realm of critical consciousness can begin to change the way we think about things: i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1038416213497193">Mezirow’s concept of perspective transformation (1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1038416213497193">1981</xref>).</p>
<p>Brookfield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1038416213497193">1995</xref>, p. 2) describes critical reflection as a process of ‘hunting assumptions’ and describes assumptions as ‘taken-for-granted beliefs about the world and our place within it that seem so obvious to us as not to need stating explicitly’. Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1038416213497193">Kline (1999)</xref>, Brookfield also describes three levels of assumptions. The first he calls ‘paradigmatic assumptions’ and these play a vital part in how we structure the world as we see it and our views of ‘reality’. These will not necessarily be recognised as assumptions and will only be examined critically after a great deal of resistance. Brookfield’s paradigmatic assumptions appear similar to Kline’s bedrock assumptions. However, in Kline’s work there is no specific reference to resistance to the critical analysis of bedrock assumptions – only that time, rapport and trust will be needed for them to emerge during a thinking session. At the second level there are what Brookfield terms ‘prescriptive assumptions’. These are based on what we think ought to happen in certain situations, and are, inevitably, based on our paradigmatic assumptions. This contrasts with Kline’s ‘facts’ where the emphasis is on what is happening, from the perspective of the client. ‘Causal assumptions’ lie at Brookfield’s third level and are usually spoken of in predictive terms – ‘if X happens, Y will follow’. This appears similar to Kline’s ‘possible facts’, both focusing on the future. Having outlined the literature that underpins the study, this paper will now explain its methodology.</p>

<p>In 2007, Bassot was introduced to Nancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1038416213497193">Kline’s (1999</xref>) book, <italic>Time to Think</italic> by a close friend (‘Sharon’ – all participants’ names are pseudonyms). At this point Bassot and her friend had established an informal mentoring relationship and would meet to discuss their goals and plans for the coming year. This particular year they decided to try out the six steps in Kline’s Thinking Session as part of this informal process. In 2009, Bassot received an invitation from Reid to co-write a chapter on reflective practice and career counselling for a book on constructivist approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1038416213497193">McMahon &amp; Watson, 2011</xref>). As part of the chapter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1038416213497193">Reid &amp; Bassot, 2011</xref>), Bassot developed the idea of the CTS, based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1038416213497193">Kline’s (1999</xref>) work. The work was then developed into a pilot study as an example of innovative practice as part of an ERASMUS (EU funded) project.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1038416213497193">1</xref></sup> This pilot study forms the basis of this paper.</p>
<p>At first sight, the CTS may appear similar to other ‘staged’ or process models for intervention (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1038416213497193">Egan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1038416213497193">Reid &amp; Fielding, 2007</xref>). However, on closer examination there are two distinctly different features. First, there is a <italic>specific</italic> focus on providing a space for the Thinker (the client) to reflect during the session, in order to question their limiting assumptions. This is a distinct contrast with process models that focus on goal setting. Second, there is a lack of emphasis on action planning. It is also worth noting that whilst the focus of the CTS is on the future, it is not the same as approaches that focus on finding solutions to problems (e.g. solution focused brief therapy). This point is important and we will return to it later in this paper. The Listener (the practitioner, acting as the Thinker’s Thinking Partner) poses few questions and listens deeply to what the Thinker says. In order for this to be effective, the Listener needs to build trust and rapport with the Thinker from the outset. The approach is collaborative and can only proceed in an atmosphere of trust and acceptance, particularly when discussing limiting assumptions. As discussed above, and evident in the description of the model below, this is not designed as a ‘quick fix’, diagnostic interview resulting in a career match. Sufficient time is needed: in our research each interview lasted 90 min, but with practice and greater familiarity with the model, it is expected that this could be reduced to 45–60 min, bearing in mind, of course, that each client will be different. In addition, a ‘private’ space needs to be available.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1038416213497193" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title>
<p>The methodology that informed the study is that of interpretivism, where knowledge is constructed in social settings through interactions with others; such knowledge is culturally situated. In keeping with this, a qualitative method was chosen, where one of the researchers carried out an interview with three participants using the CTS in order to seek to assess its usefulness as an approach. At the start of this pilot project our research question was: Is applying Kline’s thinking session model to career counselling useful? Before contacting the participants we completed the requirements of the university’s ethical review and ensured that that participants were aware of the process and what use we would make of the material. Their consent was gained and they were aware that they would receive a copy of the interview transcript and be able to request changes (no changes were requested). We also agreed to send any case study material that was to be published to the participants for their approval – this approval was granted. Three participants took part in a CTS and the interviews for the pilot study took place during 2010–2011; each interview lasted approximately 90 min. The selection of two of the participants was opportunistic in that both were known to the researchers and were keen to take part. In both cases, they were at or approaching a transition point in their careers. The third participant was a friend of a colleague who was wondering if career guidance might help her with a career/life dilemma.</p>
<p>Having undertaken three interviews and transcribed these, at the point of moving to the analysis we clarified the questions we were asking of the model and the data collected thus far. These questions are on-going and will be carried forward/developed further in the next phase of the work. They are:

</list></p>
<sec id="sec6-1038416213497193"><title>Data analysis and results</title>
<p>Before moving to a discussion of the case study and the themes identified across all the material, we will explain our method of data analysis. The case study presented in this paper was read and approved by Helen. In order to analyse the material, a proforma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1038416213497193">Merrill &amp; West, 2009</xref>) was employed to work with each transcript to build the individual case studies before moving to identify themes across the material. It was important not to fragment the material and to pay respect to each career ‘story’ as it emerged in the interview. There was a thorough immersion in recordings and transcripts, by each researcher working separately, who then each completed a proforma. We then met to compare and contrast our work, discussing the biographical data and reflecting on the process. This was a complex procedure as we were interrogating the transcripts through a lens which looked at both the research process and the practical application of the model. The sharing of this analysis was important as only one of the two researchers (Bassot) undertook the interviews using the new career counselling approach (CTS). Our approach enabled us to see different elements in the material. We discussed the quality of the process, including the auto/biographical dynamics: the effect, in other words, of the narrator (the Thinker) on the interviewer (the Listener) as well as vice-versa. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1038416213497193">Merrill and West (2009)</xref> indicate both can be a source of insight into the meanings and emotions being communicated.</p>
<p>We worked in this way with the transcripts of all participants and there were similarities with regard to themes across the four cases, but to avoid superficiality we have decided to <italic>re-present</italic> ‘Helen’s’ story here. Our view is that shorter extracts, across all the case studies, would be less illuminating in their richness and narrative power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1038416213497193">Richardson, 1997</xref>). Helen’s story illustrates common themes found across all the material and provides an example of the CTS in practice.</p>
<p><italic>Helen’s story: ‘How I can keep developing myself: where I am now?’</italic>: Helen is in her mid-twenties and has been in her job for approximately four years, but from her mid-teens was involved in her organisation as a volunteer. She was known to us both as a student and from previous contact we were aware that she appears confident, but there is also evidence in the transcript of an apparent vulnerability. At the time of the interview, massive cuts to public services were taking place and many redundancies were expected in Helen’s service. Helen seemed to talk freely about her future. She welcomed the opportunity to talk and to have someone listen to what she was saying. That said, we have to recognise the powerful position of the interviewer as a tutor/academic. Helen knew it was the first occasion that the CTS model had been used and was fully informed about the research. The surroundings were familiar to Helen and the conversation had a relaxed air. The overall impression is that Helen has to cope with much enforced change. She seems to take a positive approach to change within her current role, but there is uncertainty about the future.</p>
<p><italic>‘Change is constant... so how can I think about this in a more structured way?’</italic>: Since the start of her job, Helen has had a new manager every year and new managers want to do things in different ways. But over the years, Helen has taken on more responsibility and has felt some level of control, but now there are redundancies on the horizon – no one knows whose job will remain. Helen says she may need to look at career in a ‘more structured way’ to enable her to start from ‘a more prepared place’. Helen questions whether or not she should be using her qualification more, maybe ‘topping it up’ to gain entry into other jobs, because ‘you do your degree to do better jobs’. Although Helen has been proactive towards change within her current role, she is unsure about what to do next. She does not see an immediate need to have a strategy, but feels an ‘emergency plan’ would be a good idea ‘rather than just plodding along’ in case the service does not survive or her role changes and she no longer likes what she is asked to do. Helen appears to be able to live with uncertainty: a vague plan is OK.</p>
<p><italic>‘Uncertain futures – jump or be pushed?’</italic>: Helen shows loyalty to the service, she feels she has worked there a long time, her job has developed and she has been able to be innovative, but she worries that her job will change once all the cuts in funding have taken place. She feels that trying something new could be exciting and fun, and recognises that she has gained skills in the job and a wealth of experience ‘but I wouldn’t [go] unless it was something really exciting’. Helen makes it clear that she did not come to the interview with the idea of wanting a new job and says that talking about her job makes her realise just how much she likes it. The service has been a big part of her life, ‘So I wouldn’t want to abandon it necessarily, but I don’t want to be the last one on the sinking ship that doesn’t get a life jacket because you’re too busy like worrying about it!’.</p>
<p><italic>‘Work/life balance’</italic>: During the session Helen realises that there is much about her current job that she enjoys, but also that she feels that other aspects of her life that her current job gives her are very important too. For example, she works very close to home, which means that she does not have to spend a lot of time travelling to and from work. This gives her more free time to enjoy activities and interests outside of work (e.g. she is a keen member of her local Women’s Institute group). She explained that a good ‘work life balance is what I want’.</p>
<p>Helen voices a number of limiting assumptions during the CTS, in particular that further study needs to be related to her job. Bearing in mind that her job situation is changing, this makes thinking about further study difficult for her (e.g. ‘how do I know what to study, if I don’t know what kind of work I will be doing?’). She also assumes that studying will cost her a lot of money and feels this may not be worthwhile if it does not improve her job prospects. Helen’s somewhat negative past experiences of study (in particular that the course did not always relate directly to her work) meant that she assumed she would face similar challenges in further study.</p>
<p><italic>Towards the Incisive Question: ‘how I can keep developing myself: where I am now?’</italic>: Bassot was surprised by Helen’s Incisive Question, she remembers thinking ‘I know what this will be’ (‘should I stay or should I go?’), but when Helen articulates it, it is very different and much more insightful and meaningful to Helen. By this time, Helen has begun to realise how much she enjoys her current job. She struggles to find the Incisive Question but finally settles on: ‘I think the big question really is how I can keep developing myself: where I am now?’. This question cut through her limiting assumptions and enabled her to begin to think positively about the future.</p>
<p><italic>Thoughts on the interview: ‘just to talk it all through’</italic>: The interview provided a reflective space to talk about change, uncertainty, embracing and/or avoiding a potential transition: it provided a safe transitional space in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1038416213497193">Winnicott’s (1971</xref>) terms. This safe space gives permission for Helen to air disbelief in the ability of the self to make things happen and to question her limiting assumptions. Helen is independent and yet self-belief does not always appear strong in the transcript. But above all she really values being listened to by ‘someone who just sits there and listens … … just to talk it all through really’. Thus in career counselling, we should never underestimate the power of being listened to by someone who demonstrates genuine respect and attentiveness. This resonates with the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1038416213497193">Hansen and Amundsen (2009)</xref>, who emphasise the value of providing a quiet space in busy lives and acts as a reminder of the need for many people to live with uncertainty and negative capability. Bassot, for example, needed to wait and trust that the approach – the CTS – would work. Helen’s Incisive Question, with its positive emphasis on enabling her future, was certainly worth waiting for. This contrasted sharply with Bassot’s urge at one point to impose her own Incisive Question (‘should I stay or should I go?’) and her desire to solve Helen’s problem. Helen’s story is of course particular to her situation, but there are commonalities across the three case studies with regard to using the CTS. In our analysis, a number of themes became apparent and these are discussed next.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1038416213497193"><title>Themes from the analysis</title>
<p>Having reviewed one case study in some depth, we now examine three particular and recurring themes that were identified during the wider analysis of the data. The first will come as no surprise to career counsellors, as all participants felt they were engaged in a process of change. The way change was perceived differed from person to person, with one seeing it as ‘like walking on sand’ and wanting the process to be over, in order to be able to ‘walk on firm ground’ again. Another participant spoke of change in herself and her personal circumstances. Like Helen, she also described changes in her workplace, but expressed the need to ‘go with the flow’ as she saw change as constant. All saw the value of discussing the process of change, whether in relation to overcoming fears or working positively with the excitement that change can bring. Secondly, all participants appeared to view career in its holistic sense; not simply as paid work, but in the context of their lives as a whole. One was particularly concerned about work life balance and two others wanted to think about the impact of further study on their lives. This included such issues as finance and whether or not it was too late to undertake certain types of study. Participants described their previous career thinking in different ways, using words such as ‘accident’, ‘old chestnuts’ and ‘fantasies’. Thirdly, all participants appeared to value space and time to talk and think. In particular, this was evident in Step 6 where they were each asked to express something they had appreciated. Each participant valued being listened to and felt that the process had helped them to gain new insights into their futures.</p>

<sec id="sec8-1038416213497193" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Having examined one case study and the common themes that emerged from the wider analysis, this paper will highlight particular links between the literature, research and practice. It is important to reiterate here that the points made are not generalisable to groups of people or populations, but are based on the views of participants in the study. In spite of their busy lives (or perhaps because of them) people appear to value a reflective process, which helps them to slow down and take time to think about the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1038416213497193">Hansen &amp; Amundson, 2009</xref>). Giving people time and space to waver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1038416213497193">Cochran, 1997</xref>) and to reflect purposefully seems useful and, indeed, enjoyable. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1038416213497193">Ixer’s (1999</xref>) assertion that in ‘busy practice’ there is no such thing as reflection is evidence of a world that seems only to value outcomes and results. By contrast, participants in the study valued the reflective process that the CTS offered. However, if the CTS is to be effective, practitioners need to resist the supposed imperative to identify problems and find solutions. In Helen’s case, the conversation could easily have been led by Bassot to focus on ‘should I stay or should I go?’ using a tool, such as a pros and cons list. In practice this would probably have served to limit Helen’s thinking to a fairly superficial level. By contrast, what she thought through in the CTS, following her reflection and identification of the Incisive Question, was at a much deeper and more meaningful level. Sharon’s thoughts on the CTS showed clear evidence of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1038416213497193">Mezirow’s (1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1038416213497193">1981</xref>) concept of perspective transformation. She described how she had begun to think differently about herself and her future.</p>
<p>In relation to ‘staged’ or process models for career interventions, the CTS does not focus on goals and action planning like other models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1038416213497193">Egan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1038416213497193">Reid &amp; Fielding, 2007</xref>), but on limiting assumptions. Helen was able to identify a number of prescriptive and causal assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1038416213497193">Brookfield, 1995):</xref> for example, ‘if I study for a degree it needs to be related to my work’. However, identifying the bedrock assumption was difficult for Helen and not achieved during the CTS. It would be possible to speculate here what this might have been, but even limited experience of using the model shows that this would probably be wrong – and another assumption. In spite of this, Helen was still able to devise an Incisive Question, which cut through her limiting assumptions and enabled her to think much more positively about the future. Challenging limiting assumptions demands that people deconstruct their thinking in order to work towards ‘perspective transformation’, but this is not easy and the practitioner’s role is to support the client in this process. Savickas states, ‘Practitioners must open up such closed texts so as not to defer or deflect the authority of clients in scripting their own journey’ (2011, p.110). In the CTS the practitioner (as Listener) works alongside the client; ‘bearing witness’ as the client develops their reflective examination of their limiting assumptions and positive opposites – working towards their Incisive Question.</p>
<p>The CTS raises a number of issues in relation to its application. The issue of time, and particularly the perceived lack of it, is clear. Some practitioners will argue that the pressure to achieve identifiable outcomes in the quickest possible time precludes the use of a model like this and, of course, any model must be fit for purpose. However where time is available, the CTS has the potential to enable career/life decision-making which may be more durable in the longer term. In addition, practitioners who are used to working in their role as an adviser, and indeed who are seen in this way by their clients, may need to change their approach to that of a more collaborative approach of the thinking partner.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1038416213497193" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The size of the pilot project does not lead us to make generalisations about the approach as the research is based on a limited, opportunistic sample in England, with a group of adult clients. Statistically based claims cannot be extrapolated from the work: that was never the intention. We aimed to explore the potential of an approach which stayed with purposeful reflection, slowing the process down, in order to construct a space for meaningful career thinking: in one of the participant’s words, enabling ‘the gift of time to think’. As noted above, this presents a challenge for the application of the CTS within the constraints of the contemporary working environment. However, we wanted to experiment with an approach that moved away from short-term work for short-term solutions. The CTS is one approach that does have a focus on meaning, rather than a focus on facts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1038416213497193">Savickas, 1997</xref>), but this is a work in progress and we are not suggesting that the CTS will be useful for all clients. Nevertheless, thus far, our research suggests that it could be particularly useful with certain clients; for example, those who are ‘stuck’ in their career thinking, those who have been unemployed for some time and those who are facing redundancy. Having concluded that applying Kline’s thinking session model to career counselling is useful, our next step is to develop the research in order to further identify those clients and practitioners who would find ‘the gift of time to think’ engaging for career construction.</p>
