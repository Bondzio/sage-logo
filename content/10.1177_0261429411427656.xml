<abstract>
<p>Thinking outside of the box is a standard cliché for creativity. Yet an awareness of the boxed nature of new media can empower young students to think creatively about design. This article is a reflection of one teacher who led a group of young students in a series of lessons based on basic design principles related to technology. It is based on classroom experience and research at the University of Central Florida.</p>

<p>If thinking outside of the box is the path to creativity, then why do we spend so many hours staring into them? New technology can be so dazzling; it is easy to forget that we are engaged in a physical act of starring at a square space to take in information. Janet Murray describes transparency as a narrative that creates an immersive, interactive, and imaginative space that engages the mind. She also warns of the potential dangers of creating worlds that are more addictive than engaging of the imagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261429411427656">Murray, 1997</xref>). As a teacher, I am keenly aware of the barrage of information to which children are exposed from media that are nearly invisible yet omnipresent. This season, I arranged my curriculum to teach my students an awareness of media design as a platform for building their own creativity.</p>
<p>I came to this strategy through my own graduate studies at the University of Central Florida in the Visual Language and Interactive Media program. I was particularly inspired to apply my knowledge with my own students after I completed a summer course with Dr Gillian Eriksson entitled ‘The Nature and Development of Creativity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261429411427656">Eriksson, 2010</xref>), which explored theories and research about the concept and development of creativity. My challenge was to translate these concepts into lessons for children in my own classroom with limited technological assets.</p>
<p>I began by guiding my students through a series of Socratic dialogues designed to develop their awareness of the illusion of media. For example, one lesson included a discussion in which they were asked to identify and count the number of walls in the classroom (four). Then they looked at a series of paintings, drawings, photographs, and video stills of interior spaces. Then they counted the number of walls in each image (three). The exercise revealed the ‘fourth wall’ phenomenon, through which the viewer witnesses an imagined world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261429411427656">Stevenson, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>I had to apply some creativity of my own in order to teach technological ‘savvy’ in a classroom with one shared computer. I leveraged this situation as an opportunity for the students to examine the physicality of the single computer and its function, rather than immersing them in how to use the tools within the computer. We drew the thing! We made clay models of it. Then we began naming the things that a computer does: ‘It makes pictures’, ‘It tells stories’, ‘It plays games’, and so on.</p>
<p>One by one, my students and I addressed the attributes and functions that we ascribed to the computer. And, one by one, we discovered how those functions happen. Some of our lessons were purely for silly enjoyment, such as playing a game of dodgeball with a piñata model of a computer. Other lessons were more technical, such as creating a camera obscura in order to see how photography works. The thread that tied each lesson together was the idea that technology is ultimately the result of human creativity.</p>
<p>One of the problems presented by new media is that they generate a visual language that is polished and packaged. This flood of perfectly rendered images can act as an emotional block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261429411427656">Simberg, 1978</xref>) for anyone who attempts to create an original drawing or painting of their own. Why draw or paint on paper, when anyone can create customized characters and worlds in any number of online game environments? It is natural for children to become more conscious of the technical accuracy of their drawing as they mature, and some degree of frustration is a necessary part of any learning process. The danger lies in the strong connection between drawing and personal narrative. A child who loses confidence in his or her drawing skill may also lose confidence in his or her own narrative skills and, by extension, his or her own sense of creativity.</p>
<p>I have learned a few techniques to avoid these emotional blocks. At the beginning of the year, I asked my students to describe a horrible drawing. What does it look like? What makes it horrible? I then created a drawing exercise based on the work of artist Stefan G. Bucher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261429411427656">Bucher, 2008</xref>), which is a sort of extension of a classic Rorschach test. The exercise began with an ink blot, and the students were responsible for expanding the inkblot into a character or object. Again, the goal was to foster creativity by empowering the students to make free observations and interpretations.</p>
<p>The constraints that I placed on these drawing exercises were more organic versions of the inherent constraints of video games and graphics programs. The transparent nature of technological constraints can block further creativity. For example, why practice handwriting or develop a distinctive style when a computer offers a menu with hundreds of perfect font options? By showing students how to recognize creative constraints, they are empowered to use them as a starting point for further creative thought, rather than limiting their thinking inside of an invisible box.</p>
