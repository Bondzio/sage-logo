<abstract>
<p>Much mischief has been done in thinking about religion by a general failure to attend to the different kinds of concepts that the brain employs and the capabilities of each kind. The general assumption seems to have been instead that concepts are, or should be, all of the same kind. This paper attempts to redress that failure by offering a preliminary typology of concepts. It identifies three types: kinds, classes, and clumps, defined in terms of ‘essences’ (generative mechanisms), features, and (generally unbounded) sets of instances, respectively. It also points to degree of inferentiality as a property of these types that can be especially useful for thinking about religion, kinds being inference-rich, classes inference-fixed, and clumps inference-indeterminate. Although careful reflection at times transforms clumps into kinds or classes, it can also lead to the recognition that a putative kind or class may be better considered a clump. An example of the latter—hardly the only one—may be the term ‘religion.’ It is neither necessary nor possible for careful reflection entirely to abandon clump concepts for kinds and classes. Scholars do, however, need to exercise care in what they use each type of concept to try to do.</p>
<p>Bien des erreurs ont été commises à propos de la religion à cause d’une incapacité générale à s’attacher aux différentes sortes de concepts que le cerveau utilise et les capacités de chacune. Il semble que la supposition générale ait été que tous les concepts doivent être de la même sorte. Cet article cherche à remédier à cette incapacité en offrant une typologie préliminaire des concepts. Il identifie trois sortes : les types, les classes et les agrégats, définis respectivement en termes d’ ‘essences’ (mécanismes génératifs), de traits et de séries de cas (généralement illimités). L’article nous amène également à envisager le degré d’ ‘inférentialité’ comme propriété de chacune de ces différentes sortes qui nous permettent de penser la religion : les types étant ainsi riches en ‘inférentialité’, les classes ayant une ‘inférentialité’ fixe, tandis que l’ ‘inférentialité’ des agrégats demeure indéterminée. Bien qu’une attention méticuleuse puisse à certains moments transformer les agrégats en types ou en classes, elle peut aussi nous amener à reconnaître qu’un type ou une classe supposée pourrait être considérée plutôt comme un agrégat. Un exemple de ce dernier cas de figure —loin d’être isolé— pourrait être le terme de ‘religion’. Il n’est pas nécessaire ni possible dans une réflexion soutenue d’abandonner le concept d’agrégat au profit des types ou des classes. Il est cependant nécessaire de porter une attention soutenue à la façon dont chaque concept est utilisé et à ce qui en est fait.</p>

<p>I first started thinking about this topic when I came across a comment somewhere, I think in Pascal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0008429811430054">Boyer’s (1994)</xref>
<italic>The Naturalness of Religious Ideas</italic>, to the effect that religion is not a natural-kind concept. This struck me as right, but then what kind of concept is it, and what were the implications for the study of religions?</p>
<sec id="section1-0008429811430054">
<title>Towards a Preliminary Typology of Concepts</title>
<p>I only began to hazard an answer in a paper delivered at a conference in Chicago as late as November 2006 and not published until early 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0008429811430054">Alles, 2010</xref>). There I observed that while natural-kind concepts are inference-rich, the concept ‘religion’ is inference-poor. When one knows that an object is an instance of a natural kind, one knows a great deal about it, even without checking the details. For example, I infer that all human beings who read this paper will have blood, although I may never actually see any of them bleed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0008429811430054">1</xref></sup> By contrast, simply identifying something as an instance of ‘religion’ does not allow us to make many solid inferences about it. For me religion may involve the sacrifice of goats and chickens, and all-night dances in counterclockwise circles, along with the lavish consumption of homemade liquor. For many readers it probably does not.</p>
<p>The observation that the concept religion is ‘inference-poor’ goes a little way towards answering my opening questions, but it does not tell us much about what kind of concept religion is. I took a second step in a paper delivered in the fall of 2008 in Brno and published in <italic>Religion</italic> in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0008429811430054">Alles, 2009</xref>). There I contrasted kinds with classes, a contrast that I took from Ruth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0008429811430054">Millikan (2005)</xref>. Following Hilary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0008429811430054">Putnam’s (1975)</xref> twin-earth argument (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0008429811430054">Pessin and Goldberg, 1996</xref>), I conceived of kinds—I will drop the adjective ‘natural,’ in order to allow for socially emergent kinds—as defined by some stable generative mechanism. Putnam’s example was water, defined as H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
<p>Classes are different. They are defined not in terms of generative mechanisms but in terms of sets of features. In my paper I used an example that I took from Millikan, red triangles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0008429811430054">Millikan, 2005</xref>: 108). An object belongs to the class ‘red triangle’ just if it is red and triangular. It may be H<sub>2</sub>O (most probably in the form of ice), Fe (iron), Pb (lead), (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub>)<sub>
<italic>n</italic>
</sub> (cellulose), or a combination of SiO<sub>2,</sub> Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, CaO, MgO, and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (glass), but as long as it is somehow triangular and somehow red, it belongs to the class ‘red triangle.’ One difference between class concepts and kind concepts concerns the inferences that we can draw from them. We can discover new properties that instances of a kind share, such as previously unknown properties of a chemical substance. For classes, however, we cannot. All we can say about a red triangle, <italic>qua</italic> red triangle, is that it is triangular and it is red. To learn more, to be able to make more inferences, we do not study red triangles <italic>per se</italic>. We study triangular objects in general or whatever counts as red or some other incidental property that a particular red triangle or set of red triangles happens to have. In other words, there is and can be no science of red triangles (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0008429811430054">Millikan, 2000</xref>: 208; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0008429811430054">2005</xref>: 108).</p>
<p>I find this distinction helpful in suggesting what a scientific study of religion needs to do. It needs to break up religion—‘fractionate it,’ as Pascal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0008429811430054">Boyer (2005</xref>: 4) and Harvey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0008429811430054">Whitehouse (2008)</xref>, among others, have put it—into constituent kinds and study those kinds, not all of whose instances may belong to what we consider religion. Nevertheless, as increasingly sophisticated attempts to define religion polythetically have shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0008429811430054">Alston, 1967</xref>: 140–147; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0008429811430054">Southwold, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0008429811430054">Smith, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0008429811430054">Wilson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0008429811430054">Chryssides, 2007</xref>: 26–33; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0008429811430054">Needham, 1975</xref>), religion is not a class defined in terms of specific features. So what kind of a concept is it? It is, I think, a kind of concept that I propose to call a clump.</p>
<p>A clump is not a cluster of properties, whether substantive or functional, monothetic or polythetic. It is simply a cluster of instances that the brain finds it useful to lump together (cf. the discussion of conceptual atomism by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0008429811430054">Laurence and Margolis, 1999</xref>: 59–71). Clumps differ from both kind and class concepts in terms of inferences. They are not inference-rich, like kinds, but neither are they inference-fixed, like classes. They are, to use a somewhat clumsy expression, inference-indeterminate. They involve varying degrees of uncertainty. One example <italic>might</italic> be the concept ‘cup.’ Just because something is a cup, it does not mean that you or I can drink from it. It may refer to a prize in an athletic contest, as in the football World Cup, or a protective part of male athletic gear, or a supportive part of women’s upper-body underclothing. Clumps persist, however, because despite their indeterminateness they allow the brain to simplify the processing of sensory input, and they do so even at increasing levels of aggregation and abstraction.</p>
<p>I do not know if it is possible to design—or even to imagine—a brain plus nervous system that operates only with kinds and clearly defined classes. I suspect that such a brain would be very costly to operate in terms of energy, processing time, and material architecture. I also suspect that such a brain would pose tremendous complications for learning. Neither we nor any other animal that I know of has such a brain. At the same time, no animal that I know of needs such a brain, because no animal needs to think perfectly well. It only needs to think well enough to survive long enough to reproduce effectively in its environment. In some cases, properly identifying kinds is probably vital to survival and so to reproduction. Drinking colorless, odorless liquids may be such a case. For many purposes, however, clumps do just fine.</p>

<title>What Clumps May and May Not Be and Do</title>
<p>To avoid misunderstanding, I want briefly to note what I do not take clumps to be. Then I will talk a little about what I think clumps may and may not do.</p>
<p>Clumps are not simply concepts with fuzzy boundaries. They may certainly have fuzzy boundaries, but so may kinds and classes. Nor are clumps simply concepts that exhibit prototype effects (in religious studies, cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0008429811430054">Saler, 2000</xref>). They may certainly exhibit such effects; for example, some cups may come more readily to mind as representatives of the concept ‘cup’ than others. But then, other kinds of concepts do so, too. ‘Even number’ is not a clump, but, asked to give an example of an even number, most people are likely to respond with a number like two, four, six, or eight, rather than with one like 1,028,610,328, which was the population of India in the 2001 Census.</p>
<p>Nor are clumps limited just to one or a few of the domains that, according to at least some cognitive scientists, are basic to human conceptions of the world: persons, animals, plants, natural objects, and tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0008429811430054">Taves, 2009</xref>: 42, referring to Pascal Boyer and Justin Barrett). They are found in all domains. For example, among persons we encounter, there are kinds (males and females), classes (people who hold Canadian or Mexican passports), and clumps (perhaps <italic>ādivāsīs</italic>, ‘tribals’ in India, or ‘indigenous’ people worldwide).</p>
<p>I also prefer not to think of clumps in terms of ‘family resemblances.’ To me the notion of family resemblances connotes resemblances that ultimately derive from genetic causation. I think clumps probably do arise as a result of complex processes of aggregation when encountering ever-new instances, driven by the recognition of different superficial features, whether those features are formal, functional, material, or of some other kind. But sets of features do not define clumps. Clumps are just aggregates of instances.</p>
<p>It would be a mistake to see kinds, classes, and clumps as immutable properties of individual concepts. We can and do change our minds about whether a concept is a kind, class, or clump. One sees these changes, for example, in learning. A young child may associate water with potable liquids, learn that not all potable liquids are water and that water is not always liquid, and eventually identify water in terms of a chemical formula H<sub>2</sub>O. But we may also discover that we are mistaken in thinking of a concept as a kind. Someday this may happen with water—all scientific knowledge is subject to correction—but it has already happened with many other concepts. For example, serious investigation has led to the conclusion that schizophrenia is not a kind (a single disease) but a class of several different diseases that share specific features, or indeed perhaps just a clump of diseases that our brains have somehow grouped together. In this regard, I think, religion is much more like schizophrenia than it is like water.</p>
<p>Clumps seem to make us intellectually uncomfortable. When our brains think carefully and critically, they seem to prefer to think in terms of kinds or classes. Perhaps that is because the brain finds the inferential richness of kinds and the inferential stability of classes more useful. Academic work often attempts to transform clumps into kinds or precisely defined classes. One sees such efforts routinely in the natural sciences. Paradigmatic for me is the way chemistry has managed to conceptualize the extreme diversity of material reality in terms of aggregates of three basic particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons (that is, atoms), as well as aggregates of those aggregates (covalent and ionic compounds).</p>
<p>Some concepts, however, resist refinement in terms of kinds or classes. Among them I would include a number associated with human activities that English speakers target with the words ‘culture,’ ‘music,’ ‘art,’ ‘literature,’ ‘law,’ and of course, ‘religion’ (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0008429811430054">Tweed, 2006</xref>: 30–33, 41). If a concept has received a large number of proposed definitions, each seemingly workable in its own way but often mutually incompatible, and if wide disagreements exist regarding the extension of a concept, I would take these features as <italic>prima facie</italic> indicators that a concept is a clump.</p>
<p>Although clumps make us intellectually uncomfortable, an inability to refine a clump into a kind or a class is in itself no reason not to use it, if it happens to be the best concept available. We simply need to respect what clumps can and cannot do. Consider the capabilities of clumps with regard to several common intellectual moves made in academic work: explanation, prediction, and ostension.</p>
<p>Kinds can both be explained and serve to explain. By ‘explanation’ I simply mean the construction of a model of the processes that produce the object or event to be explained. Such a model may be more or less representational, more or less metaphorical, but it is possible to consider a concept a kind rather than a class or clump when we are able to provide just a single model, convincing for the time being, to account for all instances of it, or when we are convinced that such a model exists but we have not yet found it.</p>
<p>Classes are not capable of being explained in this sense. Consider engines. It is certainly possible to explain the operation of engines, but different kinds of engines, for example, internal combustion engines and jet engines, operate quite differently. To explain what makes an automobile move, however, I may legitimately reply, ‘its engine,’ using a class rather than a kind concept. That is because one feature of engines is the ability to make things go.</p>
<p>Like classes, a clump cannot be explained in terms of a single generative mechanism; otherwise it would be a kind. It is possible, however, to use a clump concept in explanations not on the basis of a feature that defines the clump but on the basis of a status that we have assigned to instances of the clump. Thus, we might try to prevent some Hindus from destroying nude paintings of Hindu gods by M. F. Husain, just as we might try to prevent some Muslims from destroying massive statues of the Buddha or Mahavira, or some Christians from destroying crucifixes of whose composition they disapprove, by referring to these instances as ‘art’—on the assumption that instances of art, whatever their specific features, should not be destroyed. I will return to these observations about explanation later.</p>
<p>Clumps are similarly poor at prediction, an activity that depends upon the inferential properties of concepts. Not all predictions about kinds are equally strong. The likelihood of pure water boiling at 100°C at sea-level on earth is much greater than the likelihood of a human being having five fingers on each hand or four wisdom teeth. Nevertheless, in the case of kinds it is possible not only to make specific predictions of varying strength about kinds but also through empirical investigation to learn to make new ones. It is possible to make specific predictions of varying strength about instances of classes, too, although it is not possible to learn to make new ones through empirical investigation, aside from new predictions about kinds (red, triangle) that appear in the defining features of classes. In the case of clumps, however, it is neither possible to make reliable predictions of measurable strength about newly encountered instances, nor does empirical investigation make new predictions possible, unless empirical investigation and conceptual refinement lead to the reformulation of clumps as kinds or classes.</p>
<p>For purposes of explanation or prediction, then, clumps are not very useful. They can be useful, however, for purposes of ostension. I refrain from discussing here the prodigious philosophical issues raised by such a simple statement as ‘words refer to things.’ Suffice it to say that we seem, at least, to use concepts to negotiate our environments and ourselves. In the evolutionary story, this negotiation is precisely why cognition and conceptualization evolved.</p>
<p>I take academic work to be a specialized form of negotiating our environments and ourselves, but it is not limited to the formulation of explanations and predictions. It also involves other activities that ostension makes possible, among them historical and interpretive activities. So long as a clump allows both speaker and hearer, communicator and receiver, to target more or less the same object or set of objects, it is useful for purposes of ostension. To be sure, I suspect that clumps are more prone to confusion and more in need of clarification than kinds or classes, but this does not vitiate their usefulness altogether. Once again, I will have more to say about this usefulness below.</p>
<p>Finally, without going into the large literature on translation, let us simply note that clumps present translational difficulties that kinds do not and classes may not. The difficulty is not quite that people cannot think in terms of foreign clumps. People can and do adopt new concepts all the time. Sometimes they modify or coin a word to refer to the new concept, as when the Chinese combined two words, <italic>zong</italic> and <italic>jiao</italic>, to make the Chinese word for ‘religion,’ <italic>zongjiao</italic>. At other times they simply transpose a foreign word for the concept into their vocabularies, as happened when English took the Latin word <italic>religio</italic> by way of French before it had its present meaning. The difficulty lies, rather, in the character of the aggregations that make up clumps.</p>
<p>Within linguistic communities, regular exchange largely ensures that language users aggregate more or less the same instances within a clump. In the case of ‘cup,’ for example, I may not initially realize that the concept includes an athletic contest, but I soon catch on. Between relatively isolated linguistic communities, however, these dynamics do not occur, and the aggregates associated with clumps may vary widely. For example, in German I drink tea from a <italic>Tasse</italic>, a cup. In 2010 the Spaniards did not, however, win the football <italic>Tasse</italic> but the <italic>Weltmeisterschaft</italic>, the world championship, or <italic>der Pokale</italic>, the goblet—a vessel from which, so far as I know, people do not drink tea. Similarly, a sportsman does not wear a <italic>Tasse</italic> but rather a <italic>Tiefschutz</italic>, and the relevant part of a woman’s underclothing is (to quote from an on-line discussion<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0008429811430054">2</xref></sup>) <italic>sicherlich nicht Tasse</italic>—certainly not <italic>Tasse</italic>—but either <italic>Körbchen</italic>, the diminutive of <italic>Korb</italic>, ‘basket,’ or, given the Anglicization rampant in German, simply ‘cup.’ Similar complications arise with other words, among them words such as ‘religion,’ <italic>dharma</italic>, and <italic>dīn</italic>.</p>
<p>The generative mechanisms in terms of which we identify kinds provide academically acceptable reasons either for modifying local concepts that refer to kinds or for adopting new, perhaps foreign ones. The same may pertain in the case of classes, especially those whose defining features refer to kinds. The problem with translating clumps, especially in an academic environment, is that the aggregations that constitute them, while not arbitrary, are also not defensible on grounds that academics prefer. Perhaps an example can help make this point. Suppose that you collect cups and I collect <italic>Tassen</italic>. Suppose, too, that we were founding a group for collectors like us, known as the International Association of Cup Collectors/Die internationale Vereinigung von TassensammlerInnen. You may wish to include as members people who I think have no business in a group of <italic>TassensammlerInnen</italic>: people who collect goblets, ‘little baskets,’ ‘protectors’ for the lower parts of the [male] body, and perhaps other objects as well. The problem at issue here is that there is no non-arbitrary way to determine whose position to prefer. Similar difficulties arise, of course, in the case of religion, <italic>dharma</italic>, and <italic>dīn</italic>.</p>

<title>Some Implications for the Study of Religions</title>
<p>I think the typology of kinds, classes, and clumps has applications on a variety of scales in the study of religions. For example, I think it can help clarify the kinds of terms we are using when we refer to religions, such as ‘Hinduism’ (a class) and ‘Christianity’ or ‘Islam’ (more akin to biological kinds), and to phenomena such as ‘myths’ and ‘rituals’ (perhaps both clumps). Here, however, I limit myself to only a couple of implications that pertain to the highest-order category in the study of religions, namely, religion itself.</p>
<p>Both the large number of vastly divergent definitions and the wide disagreements regarding the extension of the concept ‘religion’ lead me to conclude that scholars of religion have failed to transform the concept ‘religion’ into a kind or a class. It remains a clump, and despite certain efforts to limit the term to, for example, interactions with superhuman beings, I do not see any realistic possibility of altering this situation.</p>
<p>Religion’s ‘clumpiness’ does not entail that, as scholars, we should give up on the concept and organize our work differently, as some have seemed to suggest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0008429811430054">Fitzgerald, 2000</xref>). It is not just that these other concepts, too, come with their own local histories (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0008429811430054">Tweed, 2006</xref>: 36–42, but also Fitzgerald himself, 2000: 221) or, in the language I am using here, that they are also clumps, whose contents have been established within limited linguistic communities. Rather, these concepts clump together somewhat different instances than ‘religion’ does. So I prefer to retain ‘religion,’ but not in order ‘to promote an illusion that we have some inherently useful word … that specifies some further and additional characteristic of the world beyond and above the social, the collective, the cultural … without which our understanding of humans would be seriously incomplete’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0008429811430054">Fitzgerald, 2000</xref>: 222). I prefer to retain it simply for its ostensive utility. It is a useful way to demarcate a more specific range of objects within the broader concept ‘culture.’ (Whether this clump of cultural objects deserves special social treatment is another matter; cf., e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0008429811430054">Sullivan, 2005</xref>.)</p>
<p>Religion’s clumpiness does, however, suggest that we need to use the concept with care. Scholars have tried to sidestep the concept’s clumpiness in at least three ways. One has been to take recourse to stipulative definitions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0008429811430054">Spiro, 1966</xref>: 91, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0008429811430054">Tweed, 2006</xref>: 34–35, and a great many others). A second has been to re-construct the category as a Weberian ideal-type, but an ideal-type defined in terms of features, that is, as a class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0008429811430054">Pharo, 2007</xref>, and cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0008429811430054">forthcoming</xref>; on ideal-types, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0008429811430054">Weber, 1949</xref>: 89–99). A third has simply been to retreat into the claim that all scholarship is context-bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0008429811430054">Tweed, 2006</xref>: 13–27).</p>
<p>There are problems with all three of these moves. For example, stipulative definitions are useful in constructing formal systems (‘Let “parallel line” mean …,’ with Euclid, Riemann, and Lobachevsky stipulating very different meanings and so developing very different geometries), but in empirical research they quickly reach limits (‘I stipulate that water is a colorless liquid; therefore I need not consider ice and steam’). Constructing an ideal-type class would seem arbitrarily to impose one’s own preferences on everyone else (‘What religion <italic>really</italic> is …’), while appealing to the contextuality of all thinking begs the question at hand, inasmuch as thinking about kinds and classes is context-bound, too.</p>
<p>All three moves, however, also suffer from a problem that I want to highlight. Earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0008429811430054">Alles, 2010</xref>) I have suggested, without using quite this terminology, that because clumps are inference-indeterminate, we tend to be much more interested in exploring individual instances—in our case, individual instances of religion—than we otherwise might be. (How interested are chemists in exploring the chemical properties of endless glasses of distilled water?) Further, if religion is a clump, not a kind, the ambitions of the classical phenomenology of religion become little better than the organizational efforts of a cup collector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0008429811430054">Alles, 2009</xref>). Here, however, I want to emphasize another consequence of religion’s clumpiness: <italic>Every theory that purports to be a theory of religion is actually a theory of something else.</italic> Rather than present their wares as theories of religion, scholars of religions, in the interests of clarity and intellectual rigor, would do well to state specifically what, as scholars of religions, they are interested in, name those objects of interest as precisely as possible, and then investigate relevant instances systematically, regardless of whether those instances count as religious or not.</p>
<p>In one sense this position restates an observation that William James made over a century ago, albeit about a narrower field: ‘[T]here is no ground for assuming a simple abstract “religious emotion” to exist as a distinct elementary mental affection by itself, present in every religious experience without exception’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0008429811430054">James, 1902</xref>: 28).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0008429811430054">3</xref></sup> But the procedure I favor departs from the method by which James sought to deal with the clumpiness of his subject: ‘[T]his [clumpiness] need not prevent me from taking my own narrow view of what religion shall consist of <italic>for the purpose of these lectures</italic>, or, out of the many meanings of the word, from choosing the one meaning in which I wish to interest you particularly, and proclaiming arbitrarily that when I say “religion” I mean <italic>that</italic> [<italic>sic</italic>]’ (ibid.). Ann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0008429811430054">Taves (2009)</xref> has recently set out on what would seem to be a better path. In developing a theory not of religion <italic>per se</italic> but of the attribution of value, she has proffered a theory of ‘special things,’ religious things among them. One would do well to read the fourth chapter of her study carefully—and perhaps modify it—with the distinction between kinds, classes, and clumps in mind.</p>
<p>The above comments address, if much too quickly, the concerns raised by scholars such as Fitzgerald about using the concept ‘religion’ analytically. As a clump, religion <italic>per se</italic> is primarily useful for purposes of ostension, not explanation or prediction. Nevertheless, inasmuch as we live in a globalizing world, although a world in which for the moment English increasingly dominates scholarship, especially in the natural and social sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0008429811430054">Ammon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0008429811430054">Gingras and Mosbah-Natanson, 2010</xref>: 151), problems of translation still remain.</p>
<p>It is important not to overstate these problems. I personally know native speakers of north Indian languages who have no difficulty in equating <italic>dharma</italic> with religion; for them, <italic>dharma</italic> has a variety of possible meanings, and when speaking of <italic>Christī dharm</italic>, for example, or Hindu <italic>dharm</italic>, they know that they mean something rather different by <italic>dharm</italic> than when they speak of <italic>nītidharm</italic>, the <italic>dharm</italic> of social duties like hospitality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0008429811430054">4</xref></sup> I also know native speakers of Arabic who apparently think of <italic>dīn</italic> the same way. Nevertheless, in a global scholarly context it does not go far enough to assert, as Benson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0008429811430054">Saler (2000</xref>: 208; cf. 208–212) has done, that it is advisable to ‘move from talk of Christianity (and Judaism) as “the prototype” to a discourse that describes them as “among the most prototypical” examples of what we mean by religion.’ I would prefer to be even more open-ended and say with Thomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0008429811430054">Tweed (2006</xref>: 40) that we should ‘continually refine and revise our understanding of the term [religion] for different purposes and contexts.’</p>
<p>In many cases, what people seem to be rejecting when they reject ‘religion’ is not so much religion as a clump—the sense that particular objects may be usefully clumped together (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0008429811430054">Riesebrodt, 2004</xref>)—as particular conceptualizations of it. One finds this in the assertion, popular with some North Americans, that they are spiritual but not religious (cf. also, among many examples, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0008429811430054">Dalai Lama, 2010</xref>: 105). One also finds it, I think, in Talal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0008429811430054">Asad’s (1993)</xref> vigorous critique of Clifford <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0008429811430054">Geertz’s (1973)</xref> account of ‘Religion as a Cultural System’ (on which, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0008429811430054">Strenski, 2010</xref>). In the end, it does not matter much which phonemes we attach to the clump that I have been calling religion, nor should we assume that this clump is here for all eternity. No concept is. It may well be that in the future, as languages and the social, political, economic, and intellectual contexts in which they are spoken change, our intellectual descendants will find it more useful to organize themselves around a word such as <italic>dharma</italic>, <italic>dīn</italic>, or <italic>zongjiao</italic>—or more probably a word in a language that has not yet achieved the form it will someday assume. These preferences will be determined by ongoing scholarly conversation, presumably in many languages. I prefer not to predict the future, so I have nothing to say about either the results of these conversations or the speed at which changes will take place. I am certain, however, that change is inevitable.</p>

<p>Such inferences may be misleading. For example, I once thought that all fish had blood, but apparently not all fish have hemoglobin-based blood and so, in popular parlance, those that do not are called ‘bloodless.’ For a popular account, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0008429811430054">Carroll (2006</xref>: 19–27), and for a more technical one, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0008429811430054">Garofalo et al.

<p>Cf., too, James’s (1902: 26) comments: ‘[T]he very fact that [definitions of religion] are so many and so different from one another is enough to prove that the word “religion” cannot stand for any single principle or essence, but is rather a collective name’—in my terminology, a clump.</p>
