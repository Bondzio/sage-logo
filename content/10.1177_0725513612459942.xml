<p>Writing that concerns itself with Adorno, when not explicitly resistant to his thought, often displays a sententiousness arguably typical of the master himself – a tendency towards large claims, hinting at, if not explicitly naming, totalities and inevitabilities. These declarations – easily condemned as unsubstantiated or worse, but defensible for their boldness, a worthy corrective to our often tentative and limiting academic dispositions – often revolve around possibility and temporality. They evoke irrevocabilities, chances missed, possibilities and impossibilities before this and after that, a language of course reflected in our various ‘posts’, ‘neos’, and other periodizing signals. And, of course, all this comes together in the most notorious Adornian sentence of all, from his essay <italic>Cultural Criticism and Society</italic>, concerning poetry after Auschwitz.</p>
<p>The trouble is that it is not a sentence at all. Made one, in the English translation, it is in the original the inseparable fragment of a typically complex dialectical phrase (‘Cultural criticism finds itself confronted by the last phase of the dialectic of culture and barbarism: to write a poem after Auschwitz is barbaric; and this corrodes even the knowledge which articulates why it has become impossible to write poetry today’). Taken out of this context, cited and re-cited, generally as the occasion for its repudiation in the face of some surely non-barbaric post-Auschwitz poetry or art, the truncated aphorism would in any case declare Auschwitz a perverse anti-cultural success – Goebbels’s apocryphal quip (‘every time I hear the word culture I reach for my gun’) transformed into programme, alongside, or incorporated into, the genocidal one. There is no doubt that, for Adorno, Auschwitz killed something also for those who outlived it: its administered annihilations were the culmination and absolute limit of the defeat of subjectivity in the face of administration more generally; a demonstration of the reducibility of the human to mere matter and the subsequent impossibility of an ethical reconciliation of spirit. He was, however, also able to praise Beckett and Schoenberg and, more importantly, find lasting value in their pursuits even where they risked the very barbarism he warned of. He was famously champion of a modernism that revolved around the negativity or dissonance of its forms; art might harbour an otherwise extinct or endangered subjectivity in the midst of, or indeed through, the impossibility of the latter – all of which, summarized and encapsulated, loses much of its subtlety and tends again to the sententious attempt at profundity.</p>
<p>The befores and afters remain, then, even as we allow their complexity. They are at best the insistence on the importance of historical context, however much context itself all too easily begins to resemble determination and teleology (even as the opposite of these, contingency, something Adorno also in his way insisted on, can easily lead to a spirit of naive universalism and voluntarism). Adorno himself, however, and the modernism he defended, have by now withdrawn to another time and place, a postwar Europe with administration and society to the fore: where no change seemed possible, the only possibility was to change everything, the still-nameable whole. By extreme contrast, our own situation seems rather to be one where everything is possible, so nothing is, and terms such as society or totality are barely utterable.</p>
<p>The papers in this book, then, cover a (perhaps the) range of responses to the resulting problem with reading Adorno – particularly his aesthetic theory – now. Our concern can be with poetry no longer only after Auschwitz, but also after Adorno. Do we simply reject him out of hand (a position taken here most strongly, if not quite fully, in a paper by Thierry de Duve)? Do we, at the opposite extreme, continue to insist absolutely on Adorno’s relevance? It would be wrong to read this mostly as a question about whether Auschwitz is a trauma that we have or haven’t recovered from. Instead, Auschwitz presents itself here as an unforgettable proof of subjectivity’s radical insecurity in the face of some system. So, in terms of bodily obliteration, it might figure less as a single event than as name and limiting case for something that preceded and outlasted it, something that might take in other annihilations up to, in Adorno’s time, Vietnam, and onwards. As Robert Kaufman – an eloquent and persuasive interpreter of Adorno in relation to the postwar American poetic scene – notes, Adorno was himself concerned to maintain the connection, at least at an ethical level, between National Socialist and US imperialist atrocities. Of course, we need hardly hesitate before the observation that the latter continue to our own time, but joining the dots into a larger arc, connecting Holocaust genocide with Iraq and Afghanistan – this is something that seems to cheapen Auschwitz into mere rhetorical stamp, if perhaps only because it has since become (and with Adorno’s help) a token of the sublime, with other uses (not least by Zionism and anti-totalitarianism). With another breath we might stretch ‘Auschwitz’ even further, to other forms of administration, right up to those of our own lives, even if this brings us close to the Agambenesque suggestion that even the comfortable white collar worker is, in the assault on her subjectivity, somehow also a victim. What we think of Adorno, and what use we make of him now, might depend on what we make of these questions – not a straight rejection or acceptance of their extremes, but a more considered set of thoughts about how subjectivity subsists, how it conflicts with its administration, and how it relates to its violence, in our very different times.</p>
<p>This book takes a bathetic dive from such large themes into particularities and close readings of the arts. The media, in modernist fashion, are divided up here: painting (Picasso’s <italic>Les Demoiselles d’Avignon</italic>) is represented by J. M. Bernstein; music (Schoenberg) by Claudia Brodsky; poetry (Robert Duncan) by Kaufman. A version of the ‘after Adorno’ question – one already raised by all these particular and historical studies – is then that of how we think art, and Adorno himself, after the closure of his favoured modernism. It is hard to come at this question without a range of art-historical quibbles and revisions, largely concerning the relation between modernism, avant-gardism and the latter’s revival as postwar neo-avant-gardism, surely itself continuous with the problematic of the contemporary scene. Brodsky, then, turns from Schoenberg towards a range of neo-avant-garde and contemporary painters concerned with colour and objecthood, from Rauschenberg to Sean Scully, while nonetheless making good use of Adorno; Kaufman takes Adorno on a similar trek outwards from canonical modernism through his concern with its American counterpart.</p>
<p>The move away from the modernist concern with autonomy – which at once shelters the subject and critiques its supposed demise – can lead us to prefer the parallel tradition of which postmodernism names only a recent moment. We might make light (as does Aleš Erjavec here) of the ‘failure’ of the historical avant-garde movement to transform society, seeing it instead as the origin of a continuing tradition of play at the margins of art, at its boundary with non-art. This margin, uniting theory and art itself in a concern with the institution of art, is already at a remove from canonical or paradigm cases (<italic>Demoiselles! </italic>), pre-selected objects whose form alone is to be interrogated. Indeed, hints Erjavec, if anything has failed, it is modernism, now as frozen into monumentality as a Greek statue, and whose autonomy is now as colonized by the commodity form as anything.</p>
<p>And so a range of positions is mapped out. If there is now no shortage of intelligent reassessments of Adorno, this book is a valuable contribution in uniting the focus suggested by its title with the breadth of its opinion, in a small number of extended papers. It can be recommended to those interested in Adorno now, if only as the presentation of a choice, a range of attitudes concerning his theoretical and interpretive demise or continued relevance, from which we might take our pick.</p>
