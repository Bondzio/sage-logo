<abstract>
<p>This study presents survey data collected from a sample of HIV-positive men (<italic>N</italic> = 182) who had high transmission-risk sex, defined as unprotected anal intercourse with a man whose HIV-status was negative or unknown, in the previous 6 months. Despite the tremendous changes in HIV treatment and their impact on people living with HIV, little recent research has examined current trends in their thoughts toward unprotected anal intercourse. Here, the authors describe the self-justifications reported by HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) in their current study conducted between 2006 and 2009 and explore key differences between the those of the HIV-positive MSM and those collected from a previous cohort of HIV-negative men (<italic>n</italic> = 124), who previously reported engaging in high transmission-risk sex. Whereas HIV-negative men focused on themes related to the impulsivity of and gratification from unprotected intercourse, HIV-positive men focused on themes regarding the deferral of responsibility/assumption the partner is positive (i.e., “If he’s doing X, he must be positive . . .”), or the role of condomless sex fulfilling emotional needs. The findings highlight unique aspects of how HIV-positive men approach decision making regarding the use of condoms, as well as how they perceive issues of responsibility for initiating safer sex practices.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most difficult obstacle to effective HIV prevention is the seeming contradiction between the widespread knowledge of HIV risk reduction strategies and the inconsistent adoption of these practices. This classic dilemma, that information alone does not cause behavior change, is common knowledge among those working in HIV prevention and has been well-illustrated by the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090198111427390">Albarracín et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090198111427390">Fisher &amp; Fisher, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090198111427390">Hays, Kegeles, &amp; Coates, 1990</xref>). As a group, MSM (men who have sex with men) have long been the target of HIV prevention efforts intended to raise awareness and provide information about HIV, and yet, within San Francisco, MSM are the one risk group in which HIV-knowledge deficits are no longer related to high transmission-risk behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1090198111427390">San Francisco Department of Public Health, 2010</xref>). Thus, despite high rates of knowledge regarding risk behaviors, reported unprotected anal sex and HIV rates among MSM are increasing. In a survey by the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance System, 47% of MSM reported a recent sexual partner whose HIV serostatus was unknown to them and among that group, 21% reported having had unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) during their most recent sexual encounter with that partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1090198111427390">Sanchez et al., 2006</xref>). Similarly, a series of population-based, random-digit-dial telephone surveys of MSM households in San Francisco found an increase in the proportion of men reporting UAI with a partner of different or unknown HIV serostatus from 9.3% in 1997 to 14.6% in 2002 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1090198111427390">Osmond, Pollack, Paul, &amp; Catania, 2007</xref>). Finally, in 2006, MSM accounted for an estimated 53% of new HIV infections in the United States and historical data show that, within this group, rates of HIV incidence have steadily increased for the past two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090198111427390">Hall et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-1090198111427390">
<title>Previous Research to Address the Gap Between Knowledge and Behavior</title>
<p>Cognitive psychologist Ron Gold explored this dissonance between knowledge and behavior in a series of studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090198111427390">Gold &amp; Rosenthal, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090198111427390">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090198111427390">Gold &amp; Skinner, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090198111427390">Gold, Skinner, &amp; Ross, 1994</xref>), which established that MSM have developed an internal dialogue of “self-statements”: stories that they tell themselves at the time of a high-risk sexual encounter, which allow them to bridge this dissonance. His research found that these narratives focused on “online” self-statements (i.e., the thoughts and beliefs experienced at the time of arousal) containing self-justifications (SJs) that either minimize their expectations of HIV transmission or else justify the risk based on some line of reasoning. Gold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090198111427390">Gold &amp; Rosenthal, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090198111427390">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090198111427390">Gold &amp; Skinner, 1992</xref>) hoped that when individuals reexamine these SJs “off-line” (outside of the sexual encounter), they are more likely to view their justifications for allowing UAI to occur as flawed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090198111427390">Gold and Rosenthal (1995)</xref> conducted a randomized, controlled trial with 109 MSM with recent UAI “slipups” that examined the effect of a self-exercise to examine SJs compared with a “sex diary” or standard HIV prevention education. Although the number of men with such “slipups” did not differ at the end of the 4-week trial, there was a delayed effect in the SJ group: Men who had UAI once after the SJ intervention were less likely to do so again during the study period, χ<sup>2</sup>(2) = 6.53; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090198111427390">Gold &amp; Rosenthal, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Our research took Gold’s approach one step further and adapted the use of his SJ idea to a face-to-face counseling intervention. This approach, termed <italic>Personalized Cognitive Counseling</italic> (PCC), took advantage of the opportunity to discuss the participant’s “online” SJs in the company of a trained counselor, who helped the participant relive the experience, identify the SJs used at the time of the sexual encounter, and reexamine these thoughts in “the cold light of day” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090198111427390">Dilley et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090198111427390">Dilley et al., 2007</xref>). The goal of PCC is to bring attention to the contradictions inherent in one’s online and offline thinking, thereby discouraging these same SJs from being employed to rationalize future high-risk sexual behaviors and resulting in fewer episodes of UAI. High-risk HIV-negative men who received PCC in both these trials were found to reduce their future high-risk behavior (UAI with partners whose serostatus was unknown or known to be positive) at 6 and 12 months when compared with controls who received standard client-centered counseling. In the first study, conducted in San Francisco between 1997 and 1999, the intervention was conducted by mental health professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090198111427390">Dilley et al., 2002</xref>). There was a significant reduction in episodes of UAI at both 6- and 12-month follow-up points when compared with controls. In the second study, also based in San Francisco and conducted between 2002 and 2004, paraprofessional HIV test counselors were trained and supervised in conducting the intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090198111427390">Dilley et al., 2007</xref>). In this case, the reductions were significantly greater in the intervention group at 6 months, though they were not statistically significantly different from the controls at 12 months. In adapting this intervention for face-to-face use, we developed a SJs questionnaire based on frequently reported SJs common among HIV-negative MSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090198111427390">Dilley et al., 2002</xref>). The most popular SJs among HIV-negative men included items such as “I want to have unprotected sex because it feels good,” and “I didn’t want to fuck without a condom, but I was so horny I couldn’t think properly,” findings that were replicated in our second study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090198111427390">Dilley et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1090198111427390">
<title>Adaptation to HIV-Positive MSM</title>
<p>The success of our cognitive counseling intervention with HIV-negative MSM led us to adapt the intervention for use among people living with HIV. The process by which the SJ questionnaire was developed and administered to this population is described below. Earlier, when <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090198111427390">Gold et al. (1994)</xref> examined SJs for UAI in a study of 88 HIV-positive MSM, the most common SJ reported by these men was a feeling that they “had nothing to lose.” Several of the most-endorsed statements referred to the notion that because they were already infected, unprotected sex no longer posed a threat to their health or well-being. Similarly, the statements conveyed a certain “giving in to fate” or fatalism associated with their infection and their related actions.</p>
<p>Despite the tremendous changes in HIV treatment and their impact on people living with HIV in the years since Gold’s work, little recent research has reexamined their thoughts, attitudes, and beliefs toward UAI. Here, we describe the SJs reported by HIV-positive MSM in our current study conducted between 2006 and 2009 and explore key differences between the SJs of the HIV-positive MSM and our previously reported sample of HIV-negative MSM.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>All research methods and procedures were reviewed and approved by the Committee on Human Research, the Institutional Review Board for the University of California, San Francisco.</p>
<sec id="section4-1090198111427390">
<title>Recruitment and Enrollment</title>
<p>Our study, based in San Francisco, targeted HIV-positive MSM who engaged in sexual activity that put their partners at risk for HIV. To be eligible for this study, participants had to be men, have been diagnosed with HIV at least 6 months prior to screening, be aged 18 years or older, and have reported UAI with at least one man whose HIV serostatus was discordant (i.e., HIV-negative) or unknown to the participant at the time. In addition, their partners had to be men with whom they had a casual relationship (i.e., a nonprimary partner, defined as someone whom the participant had dated for less than 3 months) and the relevant sexual episode(s) had to have taken place within the past 6 months. Participants also had to be currently receiving HIV-related medical care (e.g., routine CD4+ and viral load counts, prescribed HIV treatment). This last requirement was included because of the expectation that the intervention would most likely be delivered in a health care setting.</p>
<p>Exclusion criteria were based on factors that were thought to inhibit or confuse the administration or evaluation of the intervention. Among those who were excluded from participation were those who were unable to give informed consent due to cognitive impairment or insufficient English-language comprehension. Participants’ abilities to meet these criteria were assessed by study staff by having the participants demonstrate their understanding of the study procedures in their own words. Those already enrolled in other HIV-specific research were also excluded to prevent confounding interventions.</p>
<p>Recruitment among HIV-positive men was extensive, encompassing approximately 20 different medical and other HIV-related service sites as well as community postings throughout San Francisco. Recruitment strategies included distribution of posters and handbills at these sites and in other areas frequented by gay men, placing advertisements in the local gay print media, word-of-mouth recommendations from participants to their social networks, and online recruitment. Of the 1,002 MSM that responded to recruitment announcements, 488 (48.7%) were determined eligible and, of these, 408 (83.6%) consented to participate. Ineligibility was primarily because of no reported UAI within the past 6 months or with a nonprimary partner. Participants were randomized between an experimental and control condition in blocks of six. After randomization, 182 (44.6%) were assigned to the experimental condition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1090198111427390">
<title>Instrument Development and Administration</title>
<p>Our current study was divided into two phases. In the first phase, we developed a Self-Justification Questionnaire (SJQ) designed to elicit one or more of the many rationales one might choose to minimize risk and thus allow a decision to engage in risky sexual behaviors. This instrument was modeled after a survey originally developed and tested by Gold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090198111427390">Gold &amp; Skinner, 1992</xref>) and in our research with HIV-negative MSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090198111427390">Dilley et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090198111427390">Dilley et al., 2007</xref>). For our study with HIV-positive men, the statements used were selected from a series of qualitative interviews conducted among a group of 30 participants who met eligibility criteria. The qualitative interview used a semistructured format intended to draw out and identify thoughts, attitudes, and beliefs specific to the decision to have UAI with a partner of unknown or discordant serostatus. Transcripts of the interviews were analyzed by a team of health professionals for content using Grounded Theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090198111427390">Martin &amp; Turner, 1986</xref>), and themes were identified through open coding were then coded via Atlas/ti software. Specifically, Atlas/ti facilitates the process of content analysis, and in this case key words and themes noted by study staff were used to determine the frequency of identified words among open responses provided by participants. Common statements containing these themes were used to form the SJQ.</p>
<p>A preliminary format was administered to 9 participants with structured probes and think-aloud techniques used to determine which items were confusing or unclear, easily recognizable, or merited exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198111427390">Drennan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090198111427390">Hughes, 2004</xref>). Finally, a working draft of the SJQ was administered to an additional 22 participants as a final assessment of clarity and comprehensibility. The resulting 73-item SJQ contained many of the same statements previously endorsed by HIV-negative men (e.g., “If I put on [or he puts on] a condom, I [or he] won’t be able to get an erection”). However, not surprisingly, many statements specific to the serostatus and related experience of the respondent were unique to the HIV-positive SJQ. The items were clustered into 14 themes based on the similarity of motivations underlying the SJ. For example, statements about pleasure, thrill seeking, or entitlement related to UAI (e.g., “I feel like I’ve been really good. I deserve to do what I want”) were grouped as having to do with UAI as a reward.</p>
<p>The final version of the SJQ was then used in the second phase of the study, as part of a clinical trial to test the efficacy of PCC to reduce the incidence of UAI among HIV-positive MSM. The SJQ was administered at the beginning of the counseling session at the baseline appointment to help participants in the experimental condition identify their SJs and prepare them to talk about these thoughts with their counselor. Following the establishment of rapport and confirmation that the participant could recall a relevant and memorable sexual episode, participants were asked to recall the high-risk episode of UAI (either insertive or receptive) with another man who was either HIV-negative or whose serostatus was unknown and to complete the questionnaire with that episode in mind. Participants were told that the questionnaire contained a variety of thoughts, attitudes, and beliefs that other MSM had said were in their minds to varying degrees in similar situations. They were told that they may have experienced some of these thoughts and reactions in other circumstances, but were to answer just about their thoughts and beliefs specific to this one event. Participants were asked to endorse each statement using a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (<italic>very true</italic> or <italic>I had this thought strongly—in the forefront of my mind</italic>) to 4 (<italic>not true at all</italic> or <italic>I didn’t have this thought at all</italic>). The response, <italic>I can’t remember at all if I had this thought</italic>, was also available.</p>
<p>After the participant completed the questionnaire, the counselor would ask the participant to tell the story of the sexual encounter in some detail, focusing on the participant’s thoughts, attitudes, or beliefs about his decision to engage in UAI. The counselor encouraged the participant to reexamine, reconsider, and reframe these SJs as they were revealed during the counseling session.</p>
<p>The frequencies of responses to the questionnaire were calculated and ranked. The most frequently endorsed statements were then evaluated by theme.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The sample of 182 participants randomized to our current HIV-positive counseling intervention is quite different from our previously reported sample of HIV-negative men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090198111427390">Dilley et al., 2002</xref>). Overall, the men in our HIV-positive sample were less educated, had lower incomes, and were more often men of color as compared with our previous HIV-negative sample. The men in our previous sample of HIV-negative men were younger than 40 years (77.5%), more affluent (49.6% earning &gt;$45,000/year), more educated (74.8% with at least some college experience), and were predominantly White (66.7%). The majority of our HIV-positive sample was non-White (58.2%), had an annual income less than $15,000 (59.3%), and had only attained a high school diploma or less (62%). The cohort had been HIV-positive for an average of 12.4 years (7.6 years for men younger than 40 years), and reported a mean of 13.8 anal sex partners in the previous 12 months (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1090198111427390">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Each of the 73 SJs was endorsed as “slightly true” or “I had this thought slightly” or stronger, by at least 1 participant. The three most frequently endorsed SJs were (a) “Since he hasn’t asked me if I’m positive I figure he’s positive too” (65.9%); (b) “This guy makes me feel attractive and I want to feel that way” (65.4%); and (c) “It feels great just to let go and let him take charge, whatever happens will happen” (63.2%). More than half (58.2%) of respondents indicated that the fact that their partner did not mention HIV or condoms meant that he “must not care” about becoming infected or using protection. The least-endorsed item was, “I don’t care if I infect someone else. Someone infected me” (14.8%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090198111427390">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Three themes (5, 12, and 14) involve information, assumptions, or beliefs that minimize the likelihood of HIV transmission in the “online” thinking of the participant or discount the importance of HIV transmission. Items in Theme 5 infer that the partner is not likely to be infected, based on the sexual behaviors of the participant (e.g., “If I’m the bottom and he fucks me, then the chance of me infecting him is low” and “As long as I don’t cum inside of him, it will be okay. I’ll just pull out before then”). Theme 12 consists of views related to the likelihood of one’s partner contracting HIV, including items that suggest an oversimplification of the factors that lead to seroconversion (e.g., “Lots of guys have plenty of unprotected sex, but not everyone has HIV. So it can’t be all that easy to infect someone” and “We’ve had unprotected sex so many times before and he’s still HIV-negative; why bother with condoms now?”). Theme 14 was more reflective of a lack of concern regarding the possibility of a partner’s seroconversion (e.g., “I don’t care if I infect someone else. Someone infected me”). This theme also includes items, however, that are more fatalistic about the process of seroconversion and imply a lack of personal responsibility and strong external locus of control (e.g., “Whether you get infected with HIV is not really up to you—it’s fate”). Theme 14 was also the least-endorsed.</p>
<p>Themes 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 were all moderately endorsed and share a sense of casting responsibility aside, enjoying sex, and the primacy of sex, including thoughts associated with a willingness to risk any further consequences of unprotected intercourse (e.g., “Hell, I’m HIV-positive. How bad could catching something else be?”). Theme 6 focuses specifically on avoiding disruption of the sexual act (e.g., “If I start talking about HIV and condoms it would mess up the mood”), and Theme 9 focuses on the related concern of ruining the sexual experience (e.g., “If he puts a condom on he’ll lose his erection”). Theme 7 relates to letting go of personal responsibility (e.g., “I’m fed up with having to think about AIDS all the time. Always focusing on it is just depressing. At this moment, I refuse to think about or worry about HIV”); Theme 8 takes this further with positing unprotected sex as a reward (e.g., “This will be just one last fling. I won’t fuck without a condom after this last time”).</p>
<p>Themes 10 and 11 include moderately endorsed SJs relating to thought processes that do not try to minimize the likelihood of HIV transmission, but rather describe the impact of psychosocial factors on participants’ willingness to take a risk, based on knowing or believing that HIV transmission is possible or likely. Items in Theme 10 relate to impaired decision making (e.g., “I didn’t want to fuck without a condom but I was so drunk or high or stoned that I couldn’t think clearly”). Items in Theme 11 refer to the interpersonal difficulties of disclosing one’s status or discussing condom use (e.g., “I just don’t feel right talking about HIV and condoms”).</p>
<p>Theme 13 related to issues of autonomy or defying norms. These items were less endorsed (36.8%) than those of other themes. Only Theme 14 items, which related to lack of consideration for partner, were less frequently endorsed. The focus was primarily on being left alone to decide how one would like to live sexually (e.g., “This is my choice. No one is going to tell me what I should or shouldn’t do with my body”; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1090198111427390">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>As detailed in prior publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090198111427390">Dilley et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090198111427390">Dilley et al., 2007</xref>), the previous cohort of HIV-negative men endorsed SJs that emphasized personal pleasure and risk calculation in the decision to have UAI. The most-endorsed statement, with 75.8% of the sample agreeing at least slightly, was “I want to have unprotected sex because it feels good.” Other endorsements expressed the impossibility of always using condoms and an acceptance of a certain level of risk-taking involved in sex (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090198111427390">Figure 1</xref> for a list of the 10 most frequently endorsed SJs). The most frequently endorsed a priori themes were (a) items related to condoms reducing sexual pleasure; (b) items related to fatalism or leaving HIV-prevention methods to chance; (c) items related to loss of control; and (d) items related to inferring that one’s partner is not HIV-infected by how he looked, spoke, or behaved.</p>
<p>Additionally, HIV-negative men did not endorse even the most popular SJs very strongly. This differs from HIV-positive men, who on average endorsed 30 of 73 SJs (41.1%), with an average of 18 of 73 items endorsed moderately or strongly (24.7%). These 18 items are primarily distributed among the most popular themes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1090198111427390">Table 3</xref>), with nearly two thirds of the sample endorsing both items related to the assumption that a partner is positive, as well as intimacy needs. A vast majority of participants endorsed at least one item very strongly (84.5%).</p>

<sec id="section7-1090198111427390" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In developing this questionnaire for HIV-positive men, our goal was to gain information on the particular thoughts that led to their decision to engage in UAI with serodiscordant partners and to focus on these thoughts in a counseling session designed to reduce future episodes of such high-risk behavior. Additionally, we hoped that an investigation into the thoughts and attitudes of HIV-infected men associated with their decision to engage in high-risk sex could be used to design effective HIV-prevention programs for HIV-positive men. For example, the finding that items related to the deferral of responsibility for using condoms were the most frequently endorsed, might be helpful to programs in considering areas for discussion with their HIV-positive clients.</p>
<sec id="section8-1090198111427390">
<title>Practice Implications</title>
<p>The findings in this study reveal a number of important concepts that might drive public health interventions. Most important to consider is the finding that the most frequently endorsed items reflected an assumption that partners were HIV-positive based on sexual practices they agreed to (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1090198111427390">Table 3</xref>). These items were not restricted to participants who labeled partners as of “unknown” status. In fact, a theme among some participants in the subsequent intervention counseling sessions was a skepticism about the reliability of a partner’s self-declared status as HIV-negative, and our participants’ willingness to assume sex partners were, in fact, HIV-positive, which makes the report of partner status nearly impossible to disentangle. This is consistent, however, with research indicating that HIV-positive MSM who engage in UAI have equally risky sex with men of unknown status as they do with those who are known to be HIV-positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090198111427390">Halkitis &amp; Parsons, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090198111427390">Parsons et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1090198111427390">Parsons et al., 2006</xref>). It also confirms the consistent finding that nondisclosure is often assumed to imply seroconcordance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090198111427390">Gold &amp; Skinner, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1090198111427390">Suarez &amp; Miller, 2001</xref>). This skepticism creates a barrier to distinguishing between the behaviors of HIV-positive men toward HIV-negative or unknown status men, respectively. With casual partners, or when the decision is based on a willingness to engage in certain sexual activities, our data would suggest this distinction is less important in prevention efforts. Specifically, public health campaigns aimed at targeting HIV-positive men may be helpful in challenging the assumption that men who do not declare their HIV status are also HIV-positive. The conflation of unknown and serodiscordant partners in this study (i.e., the data collected on the HIV status of participants’ UAI partners did not distinguish between those that were known to be HIV-positive and those that were unknown to be HIV-negative) may be interpreted in one of two ways: this is either a limitation of the study that restricts generalizability, or a replication of previously identified assumptions made by HIV-positive men toward partners willing to engage in UAI. The small sample size further limits the generalizability of these data; this is exacerbated by the limited geographic range of data collection in a single West Coast urban area and may further limit the external validity of these findings to MSM elsewhere in the United States.</p>
<p>Underendorsed or unendorsed SJs might also provide insight into areas where public health campaigns might fail to engage a receptive audience. The least endorsed theme among HIV-negative men was expressing love or intimacy through not using condoms (e.g., “I love this guy. A condom would spoil all the romance”). Although the theme “Intimacy and Emotional Needs” was the second most popular among HIV-positive men, the two least endorsed items by HIV-negative men fit this theme. “I love this guy. A condom would spoil all the romance. I can’t have a condom separating me from the man I love. I can’t have a condom coming between us” was only endorsed by 8.7% and strongly endorsed by only 2.9% of the sample; “Part of being in love with a guy is trusting him and showing him that you trust him. I want him to know that I trust him” was endorsed by 9.4%, and strongly endorsed by 2.2% of the sample. Only slightly more endorsed were items related to the theme of low self-esteem (e.g., engaging in unprotected sex because one feels unattractive). Among HIV-positive men, the least endorsed themes included attempts at seroadaptation (e.g., “My viral load is so low, I probably won’t infect him”), and lack of concern for a partner (e.g., “‘I don’t care if I infect someone else. Someone infected me”).</p>
<p>Another of our goals was to compare these findings with the SJs of HIV-negative men in the same urban community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090198111427390">Dilley et al., 2002</xref>). As noted in our previous report, HIV-negative men did not endorse even the most popular SJs very strongly. This may imply that the risk of exposing a partner to HIV leads to greater advance processing, a greater belief in SJs, and a greater salience to these beliefs. Analyses will soon be complete in our trial among HIV-positive men, which will allow us to examine whether the effect was strengthened or lessened by this approach. The second point of divergence is in the content of the SJs. Although HIV-negative men were much more focused on the “heat of the moment” sensation of not using condoms in anal intercourse because of a reduction in pleasure, their focus on the act itself, without regard for infection risk, does not have a corollary in the SJs of HIV-positive men. Rather, the most-endorsed SJs among HIV-infected men related to the deferral of responsibility, and this suggests that their status is already at the forefront of their minds. We see this underlying awareness of HIV as an already present factor in some of the common SJs reported by our participants in the development stage. Unprompted SJs included thoughts such as</p>
<list id="list1-1090198111427390" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>“Generally, I just assume if a person isn’t concerned I just assume he’s already positive.”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“I thought he already knew by not asking first.”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“It is his responsibility to protect himself if he is going to have anonymous sex in a bookstore.”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“He should know I’m HIV+, everyone else is and he was a regular.”</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In addition, the fact that participants endorsing items related to assuming one’s partner is HIV-positive also endorsed items about wanting to feel attractive, or reducing feelings of loneliness, was instructive. The desire both to feel close to another person and to not claim full responsibility for the use of condoms with serodiscordant partners are not mutually exclusive and might offer a particular avenue for discussion with these men. Some public health campaigns to date have been created to target the deferral of responsibility (e.g., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hivstopswithme.org">http://www.hivstopswithme.org</ext-link>), but the impact of this kind of campaign is unknown. Other areas of endorsement on the SJQ have been similarly underexplored by public health experts. For example, although men in our sample frequently endorsed items relating to the importance of intimacy or loneliness in their decision making, few interventions to date have focused on the difficulties with intimacy or loneliness among HIV-positive men, though their experiences are well-known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090198111427390">Dowshen, Binns, &amp; Garofalo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090198111427390">Grove, Golub, Parsons, Brennan, &amp; Karpiak, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1090198111427390">Straits-Tröster et al., 1994</xref>). Further research may indicate that the assumption that a partner is positive is secondary and aids in justifying a more primary need to feel intimately connected with another person. Prevention programs that highlight these ideas and work with positive men to address these needs concurrently may be useful.</p>
<p>Several limitations of this study must be noted. First, as recruitment was conducted via self-referral in response to community and clinic advertisements, this is not a random sample of HIV-positive MSM, and the sample’s composition diverges from previously collected demographic data regarding who is HIV-positive in the study area. It is also possible that these findings are not applicable to MSM with higher levels of education or income, or younger HIV-positive men. Additionally, our participants were all receiving medical care; these findings may not apply to HIV-positive MSM that are not treated under current standards-of-care or those who have delayed the pursuit of medical treatment. Additionally, HIV-negative participants’ data were collected in 1995-1997, prior to the widespread availability of highly active antiretroviral therapies for HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090198111427390">Dilley et al., 2002</xref>). The same pattern of endorsement was replicated in a later sample of HIV-negative men in San Francisco from 2002-2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090198111427390">Dilley et al., 2007</xref>), however, indicating some stability in the SJs used by HIV-negative men. The HIV-positive participants’ data was collected in 2006-2009. Despite the apparent stability of SJs among HIV-negative men, it must be noted that these results may have differed if participants were recruited concurrently. Finally, this was a cross-sectional study and thus suggests only an association, not a causal relationship, with high transmission-risk sex.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Recently, funding has transitioned away from strengthening HIV prevention behaviors and moved toward biomedical aspects of intervention, such as test-to-treat programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090198111427390">Russell, 2010</xref>), which are expected to mitigate or halt the spread of HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090198111427390">Granich, Gilks, Dye, De Cock, &amp; Williams, 2009</xref>). Recent data suggest that risks of seroconversion within serodiscordant partnerships is still high, however (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090198111427390">Jin et al., 2010</xref>), as is the likelihood of the proliferation of drug-resistant strains of HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1090198111427390">Smith, Okano, Kahn, Bodine, &amp; Blower, 2010</xref>). For these reasons, it is imperative that we continue to study ways to improve behavior-based prevention efforts with HIV-positive men. The idea of deferred responsibility, and that a partner will accurately assess one’s status, has been a consistent finding since the beginning of the epidemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090198111427390">Gold &amp; Skinner, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1090198111427390">Suarez &amp; Miller, 2001</xref>). In future research on HIV-positive men, prevention efforts may benefit from a focus on the underlying assumptions and contexts of sexual encounters. In particular, rather than focusing on the decision not to use condoms, it may be helpful to explore what drives the decision to not disclose one’s HIV serostatus to a potentially serodiscordant partner when negotiating sexual behaviors.</p>
