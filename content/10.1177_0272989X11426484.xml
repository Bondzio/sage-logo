<abstract>
<p>Despite the inclusion of equity in the design of many health care systems, pragmatic tools for considering equity systematically, alongside the efficiency categories of cost-effectiveness in health technology assessment (HTA), remain underdeveloped. This article develops a framework to help decision makers supplement the standard efficiency criteria of HTA and avoid building inequities, explicit or implicit, into their methods. The framework is intended as a first step toward creating a checklist for alerting decision makers to a wide range of equity considerations for HTA. This framework is intended be used as part of the process through which advisory bodies receive their terms of reference; scope the agenda prior to the selection of a candidate intervention and its comparators for HTA; prepare background briefing for decision makers; and help to structure the discussion and composition of professional and lay advisory groups during the assessment process. The framework is offered as only a beginning of an ongoing process of deliberation and consultation, through which the matters covered can be expected to become more comprehensive and the record of past decisions and their contexts in any jurisdiction adopting the tool can serve to guide subsequent evidence gathering and decisions. In these ways, it may be hoped that equity will be more systematically and fully considered and implemented in both the procedures and decisions of HTA.</p>

<p>One of us recently argued<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272989X11426484">1</xref></sup> that two major unresolved issues (“dragons”) were holding back a more complete way of assessing health care interventions. One was the absence of any consensus regarding the scope and significance of “equity” in health technology assessment (HTA). The other was the absence of any agreed upon process that would enable equity (however interpreted) to be systematically and comprehensively considered alongside cost-effectiveness. In this article we attempt to address these two issues.</p>
<p>Health technology assessment is the systematic evaluation of the consequences of the use of a health care intervention. Its principal purpose is to inform decision making. Ethical considerations and noneconomic social consequences were included in early general formulations of HTA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272989X11426484">2</xref></sup> However, it is only recently that attempts have been made to develop frameworks for considering ethics and incorporating a wider set of social consequences into HTA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272989X11426484">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272989X11426484"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272989X11426484"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272989X11426484"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272989X11426484">7</xref></sup> A comprehensive attempt to give practical guidance is that of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272989X11426484">6</xref></sup> NICE also provides its decision makers with a short checklist of factors to consider, drawn from its document. One important ethical consideration is equity. Despite the inclusion of equity in the design of many health care systems, pragmatic tools for considering equity systematically, alongside the efficiency categories of cost-effectiveness in HTA, remain underdeveloped.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X11426484">8</xref></sup> Here we attempt a first step toward a pragmatic solution by providing a framework of equitable considerations of potential relevance in HTA decision making, giving examples of the ways in which such considerations might arise, and providing a summary that might be developed into a checklist, a decision tool, for HTA decision makers. The framework is primarily intended for high-level decision makers who specify the criteria to be used by HTA advisory committees. The summary table is offered as a first step toward a practical tool for use by such advisory committees. Our approach implies that a single common framework might be a useful way of helping decision makers at a variety of levels of decision making. The highest level consists of identifying all possible aspects of equity that might be required at lower levels. The idea at this stage is that the framework be as general and inclusive as possible. The job of the high-level decision makers is to determine which elements should be considered at lower levels. It is at this level that the scope of benefits may be determined, for example, as to whether the scope will include nonhealth benefits, such as educational benefits arising from better teenage health, or health benefits that accrue through mechanisms other than those controlled by the authorities at this level, such as road safety barriers. They may also suggest the weights (quantitative or qualitative) (<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0272989X11426484">Note 1</xref>) to be attached to different elements.</p>
<p>Equity has many meanings in both academic and lay contexts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272989X11426484">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272989X11426484"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272989X11426484"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272989X11426484">12</xref></sup> The absence of an agreed upon theory of equity arises out of the absence of a general or monist theory of morality. There are moral theories that claim to be general, such as utilitarianism, although utilitarianism in its classical form is not directly concerned with equity. Other theories hold that the equitable distribution of health care resources is that which is to the advantage of the least advantaged person—so-called maximin theory. Libertarianism is unconcerned with unfairness in resource (or outcome) distribution provided the process that determines them is fair. Deontological theory posits that an equitable distribution arises out of the duty each has to provide for others. Entitlement theory, rather like libertarianism, holds that an equitable distribution is the outcome of an equitable economic and social system (for a review of rival approaches, see Veatch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272989X11426484">13</xref></sup>). We do not attempt the Sisyphean tasks of selecting from or reconciling rival philosophies, and, indeed, to do so would be inappropriate. We suggest instead that equity issues concerning the use of health care resources in a decision-making context are best considered explicitly as morally pluralist. In our approach, what is equitable or inequitable is less a matter for a priori definition than for discovery and subsequent categorization by those appointed by legitimate means to make such decisions. The role of ethical theories becomes that of suggesting possible factors to consider. Rather than defining a priori what equity is, we therefore draw on a multidisciplinary literature and our own practical experience to create an eclectic list of equity issues which, if left unaddressed by decision makers, could be deemed by a reasonable person to be unfair or to lead to unfairness in the adoption, diffusion, or consequences of a health care intervention. The provision of a framework does not guarantee agreement as to its proper elements or how they ought to be traded off when they conflict. The intention is, rather, to seek to minimize the risk that important elements are casually overlooked and that all partners in the decision process have an opportunity to challenge what may be colleagues’ equity blind spots.</p>
<p>Two domains of equity are especially relevant in HTA. One is fairness of the procedures used in the conduct of HTAs. The other is equity as a decision criterion, like efficiency, for ranking health care interventions. Equity in the first sense has, at least in part, been conceptualized as “accountability for reasonableness.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272989X11426484">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272989X11426484">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272989X11426484"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272989X11426484">16</xref></sup> and has been adopted by some agencies (e.g., NICE 2008). Equity in the second sense is a statutory requirement in several jurisdictions and is likely to be increasingly required: illegal discrimination will need to be addressed in all jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, where such legislation exists. However, such imperatives typically address only a subset of the concerns for equity that can arise in HTA. Unfortunately, there exists no substantive body of principled thinking that can serve as a sure, or even moderately agreed upon, foundation for a more comprehensive treatment of equity in HTA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272989X11426484">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Equity in the sense of fairness in the way health care is financed, produced, and distributed has been a founding principle of many health care systems throughout the world and has resulted in systems that fund activity broadly according to ability to pay and distribute it according to need (especially in middle- and high-income countries). It would therefore seem appropriate for the ideas of equity embodied in HTA in such jurisdictions to be at least consistent with these broader ideals of health care. Unfortunately, there are major differences between definitions of need, measures of it, and its application in HTA decisions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272989X11426484">12</xref></sup> and it is far from clear what a criterion of need would require over and above the criteria of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p>The standard approach to equity within HTA seems to operate at two distinct levels. The first is general, such as being aware of the difference between horizontal and vertical equity (noting that only the former involves attempting to achieve equity through the equality of something<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272989X11426484">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272989X11426484">17</xref></sup>) or having an equal respect for everyone. Since not all inequalities are inequitable, nor all equalities equitable, we agree with Whitehead<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272989X11426484">18</xref></sup> in making equity and inequity the focus of our attention rather than equality or inequality. The second is specific, such as the application of differential weights to costs and benefits according to particular equity-related characteristics of those likely to be affected by the decision.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0272989X11426484">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0272989X11426484"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0272989X11426484"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0272989X11426484"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0272989X11426484"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0272989X11426484"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0272989X11426484"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0272989X11426484"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0272989X11426484">27</xref></sup> Although there is merit in this outcome-based approach, in practice decision makers have difficulty in identifying circumstances in which departures from strict equality in the value of units of outcome could be justified, with the possible exception of end-of-life benefits, which NICE, for example, explicitly treats as warranting special weights, but without specifying them in quantitative terms, and which others, such as Ontario’s Committee to Evaluate Drugs (CED), favor—although only implicitly (<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0272989X11426484">Note 2</xref>). Equity-focused impact assessments are examples of procedures that have a focus specifically on the distribution of outcomes (e.g., Kemm et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0272989X11426484">28</xref></sup>).</p>
<p>There is little guidance concerning what, justly, ought to constitute either the characteristics in question or the size of the weights. Some gather evidence regarding the public’s preferences, stakeholders’ perspectives, or experts’ advice on either of these matters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0272989X11426484">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0272989X11426484">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0272989X11426484">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0272989X11426484"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0272989X11426484"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0272989X11426484"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0272989X11426484"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0272989X11426484"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0272989X11426484">35</xref></sup> Empirical efforts to discover what the public thinks about appropriate ways of trading off benefit with cost also raise the fundamental ethical question of the extent to which HTA ought to embody such values, even when participants are well-informed. Ethicists might raise the objection that what is just or fair is not to be determined by populist vote, whereas others might contend that the preferences of elected representatives of the community in question should count rather than the preferences of those who elected them. Other methods have sought generalizable trade-offs between equity and efficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0272989X11426484">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0272989X11426484">37</xref></sup> However, not all equity issues involve trade-offs with efficiency (<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0272989X11426484">Note 3</xref>),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0272989X11426484">38</xref></sup> and none of these approaches address what ought to be done or attempt to address the many other dimensions of equity that ought to be taken into account. The dimensions of equity typically considered (at least by health economists) are quite restrictive, being mostly concerned with distributive fairness and focused on health, the geography of health care, and income. Furthermore, irreconcilable differences in values are glossed over, stereotyping goes unchallenged, and reliance—save in the case of legislated requirements—is almost entirely upon intuition.</p>
<p>We propose the creation of a pluralist<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0272989X11426484">39</xref></sup> framework that might be expanded and developed in the light of experience, consultation, deliberation, and the transparency that ought to accompany it. In any specific decision context, not all the elements of the framework will be relevant—and perhaps none will be—but the intent is to minimize the risk of overlooking considerations of equity that might be relevant by ensuring that minds are open to matters that can easily be overlooked or, if not overlooked, that may be difficult to articulate, appraise, or measure.</p>
<sec id="section1-0272989X11426484">
<title>A Proposed Initial Framework</title>
<p>We propose a practical and adaptable initial framework as the basis for the development of a more comprehensive typology (<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0272989X11426484">Note 4</xref>). It is practical because it is intended as a sequence of red flags to alert decision makers—and the designers of the systems within which they work—to matters of equity that might warrant integration into, or at least parallel consideration with, the usual efficiency analysis of HTAs. It is adaptable because the framework as it currently stands is intended only as an initial step and what may be added is currently unknowable (at least, by us). It is consistent with the principles of accountability for reasonableness and serves as a complement to a fair process. We do not present the list as indicating priorities. It is the decision makers’ role to determine such priorities.</p>
<p>The framework is an initial framework to inform discussion and decision at a relatively high level, to determine the factors to be taken into account, and to ensure that lower tier decisions—and the reasons for them—are incorporated into minutes and notes of the meetings at which they are taken, thereby enabling a dynamic casuistry of comparison and consolidation as cases accumulate. We hope that the framework will help the process of discovering whether a consensus does exist and, where it does not, what the nature of the conflict may be and how it might most appropriately be dealt with.</p>
<p>Although the exercise is not intended to generate a consensus, establishing that there is no consensus on some of these questions is as important as discovering that there is one.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0272989X11426484">40</xref></sup> Although it may be possible to develop a consensus over time in a jurisdiction, or at least a consistency in the way equity matters are considered, it seems unlikely that such a consensus would ever be achieved across jurisdictions, where prevailing standards, cultures, and political values could vary greatly.</p>
<p>The object instead is to enable all potentially relevant factors to be clarified and considered, along with any evidence pertaining to them, including any evidence generated in the actual process of consultation and deliberation. The process is intended to affect both the procedures of the HTA as well as the “final appraisal determination” (<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0272989X11426484">Note 5</xref>). It may also be used by agencies to determine the scope of equitable issues to be considered by advisory committees, with the consequence that some of the matters identified in the list would not in practice be open for discussion in committee.</p>
<p>We propose that the equity framework should be implemented in HTA as follows: (a) be used as part of the process through which advisory bodies are given their terms of reference, (b) form a part of the scoping agenda prior to the selection of a candidate intervention and its comparators for HTA, (c) accompany the usual efficiency-related statistical and analytical research and background briefings for decision makers, including systematic and other reviews, incorporating any anticipated equity issues from the scoping stage; and (d) where appropriate (e.g., when equity issues of sufficient weight are identified to warrant detailed consideration) help to structure the discussion and composition of multidisciplinary, multiprofessional, and lay advisory groups during the assessment process.</p>
<p>We anticipate that the framework will be developed in a variety of ways. One is through academic research and discussion, which will in turn inform the methodological guidance of HTA agencies. Others, which we have previously characterized as casuistry, are through the gradual building up of case studies of actual decisions, their reasoning, and their eventual analysis, synthesis, and consolidation into statements of good practice at various levels of the decision-making process. This will normally require digging deeper than the mere online consultation of the recommendations and decisions of advisory committees. In this fashion, we expect to see an accumulation of case-based precedents that will help decision makers achieve consistency across interventions, constantly reminding them of factors that might otherwise be overlooked, together with suggestions of how they could be handled.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0272989X11426484">
<title>Principles</title>
<p>Despite the difficulty in obtaining universal assent to specific ethical principles, it is always worth establishing whether some (probably simple) principles would in fact be agreed upon for all cases or in the context of the case under consideration. Some may be inherently broadly applicable and become embodied as standard in the consideration of equity. Principles that might be worth discussing could include the following:</p>
<list id="list1-0272989X11426484" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>(a) The domain of equity shall be “current and prospective health,” not past health.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item><p>(b) Equity requires either the equality of something or else its fair inequality.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item><p>(c) Fair inequalities in treatment exist when the inequality arises from a fair claim for being treated differently, such as an accepted claim of higher need.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>It may also be possible to agree specific axioms relating to equity, such as the following cockshies:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Weak equity axiom 1: If person A has a worse state of health than person B, then in determining the equitable allocation of an intervention having a given impact on a population including A and B, the equitable solution ought to increase A’s health more than B’s, or reduce it less.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Weak equity axiom 2: If person A has a worse state of health than person B, then in determining the equitable allocation of a budget for interventions on a population including A and B, the solution ought to include only interventions that on average increase A’s health more than B’s, or reduce it less.</p>
</disp-quote>

<title>Elements of the Framework</title>
<sec id="section4-0272989X11426484">
<title>Equity Versus Equality</title>
<p>Decision makers may need reminding that equity and inequity are not the same as equality or inequality. When, however, inequalities are linked with postulated causes as when, for example, a concentration curve links health or ill health to income, an inequality might be judged as also inequitable. Some inequalities are actually equitable as when, for example, someone with an urgent need for treatment receives it before another who is a less urgent case. In all cases, however, it is worth asking “equality (or inequality) of what?” Common candidates include need; deservingness or responsibility; capacity to benefit or be harmed; degree of incapacity or current health state; history of health or ill health; prognosis with and without the intervention; and health outcome—quality of life; and dependents (e.g., caregiving responsibilities). The ethical element derives from the postulated cause of the health inequality. Empirical causes judged to be ethically relevant commonly include income and wealth; social class; social deprivation; and lifestyle and behavior. Although the solution to inequity is likely to require addressing the underlying causes, with an assessment of their mutability and the balance of cost and benefit in changing them, the range of remedies in HTA is typically narrower, lying within health care and typically within a rather small subset of health care interventions.</p>
<p>The language of equality and inequality is explicitly quantitative, and it is always worth seeking empirical and quantitative information about how equal or unequal the relevant factors, outcomes, or causes are and how equal or unequal it is believed they ought to be. Major unjust inequalities may rightly be perceived as more important to remedy than minor ones, although the relative costs or redress ought normally also to be taken into account. In all cases, a judgment should be made as to whether the evidence on equity warrants any significant departure from the implications of the efficiency analysis, such as recommending the use of an intervention when its incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is above that normally deemed to be the maximum allowable, or not recommending one that is below that threshold, on grounds of its inequitable consequences. However, as will be apparent in what follows, some aspects of equity do not lend themselves readily to quantification, and the framework should help to ensure that the quantified does not drive out the important from serious consideration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0272989X11426484">
<title>Domains of Equity</title>
<p>The matters for discussion in this element of the framework relate to the appropriate focus on equity, for example, whether it should relate to health care inputs, processes or outcomes; whether it is the direct or indirect (perhaps unintended) consequences of the use and diffusion of the health care intervention that matter; whether there should be a disease focus, with patients being classified by, say, diagnostic group, or in some other way (e.g., by socioeconomic status [SES]). If the identification of subgroups within a larger class of individuals could generate inequities, these should be explored. It is at this stage that some groups who might be affected by an intervention can be (innocently but mistakenly) overlooked, as might be the case in interventions for parents that have significant side effects on children. Such an omission would, of course, also bias an efficiency analysis as well as raise potentially significant equity issues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0272989X11426484">41</xref></sup> For example, if we consider a screening intervention that distinguishes between cancer patients who would benefit from a particular treatment from those who would not, then one domain of equity pertains to the consideration of the implications for both subgroups: not only the subgroup that benefits but also those who are disappointed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0272989X11426484">42</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0272989X11426484">
<title>Legal Obligations</title>
<p>Most jurisdictions will have specific, although not necessarily identical, statutory requirements to consider justice and equity, and there may be further quasi-legal administrative obligations placed on agencies by higher tier organizations or their own governing bodies, for example, that they ought on some matters to consult a citizens’ jury (<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0272989X11426484">Note 6</xref>). Antidiscrimination legislation may be quite specific in the factors it requires to be taken into account and may specify the discretion that is permitted the decision makers. Legal obligations may be absolute, in the sense that any inequality of the sort in question is illegal, or relative in the sense that discretion may be exercised regarding the extent to which a given inequality violates a principle of equity. Common dimensions include discrimination by age, religion, gender, disability, ethnicity, race, SES, nationality, language, and sexual orientation. Other dimensions may have regulations we cover under other headings (<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0272989X11426484">Note 7</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0272989X11426484">
<title>Embedded Inequity</title>
<p>By embedded inequity we mean inequities arising from inherent characteristics of the analysis or intervention. This might arise from the use of specific concepts or tools. For example, it is generally recognized that the uncritical use of EQ-5D might discriminate unfairly against clients with cognitive impairment or with sensory deficits, for whom it is not well designed. Unfairness might also arise in the detail of the measurement process. EQ-5D may omit significant dimensions, and its uncritical use may thereby unfairly discriminate against patients for whom the omitted factors are key outcomes, such as relief of fatigue for people living with rheumatoid arthritis or anemia. Time costs may not properly reflect opportunity costs for different social/employment groups, as when salary earners do not lose income when attending a clinic compared with the self-employed. Practical measurement and experimental methods may contain inequitable framing biases, or measures of inequality may over- or underweight the extremes of a distribution of benefits or harms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0272989X11426484">43</xref></sup> or exclude relevant dimensions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0272989X11426484">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>The systematic exclusion of vulnerable groups from clinical trials and research can lead to an absence of evidence on effectiveness in those groups, which in turn can result in inequitable denial of access. A now classic case of this bias is the exclusion of women from cardiovascular clinical trials despite the prevalence rate of cardiac disease among them.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0272989X11426484">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>Embedded inequity might also arise from the inherent character of an intervention, such as denial of choice that can arise in interventions such as water fluoridation, population-screening programs, or (healthy) fixed school lunch menus, where the affront to freedom may bear more heavily on some than on others, such as those with religious dietary restrictions. The commonly made assumption that a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) is of equal social value to whomever it accrues is an embedded assumption that may need modification, if it is thought that the value (weight) placed on a QALY gain for one who is currently very sick ought to be higher than for one less sick.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0272989X11426484">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Inequity may arise when the valuation basis of health outcomes is variable as when, for example, those who have actually experienced a condition (and its treatment) value its avoidance less than those who anticipate but have not experienced it.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0272989X11426484">46</xref></sup> More generally, if the prevalence of unstable valuations of outcomes is related to other characteristics, such as education or social class, then a suitable precaution might be to discover the views of those most directly affected by the intervention in question. There is a great deal of evidence of the considerable variability of preferences and valuations, and their susceptibility to framing and other effects, in the literature of cognitive psychology and experimental economics (e.g., Kahnemann and Tversky<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0272989X11426484">47</xref></sup>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0272989X11426484">
<title>Institutional Bias</title>
<p>Institutional biases are those that are also embedded but in organizations rather than analytical methods or interventions. The equity issue here is whether the jurisdictional scope of agency or of its parent organization causes any costs or benefits that might be significant for equity to be omitted or distorted. For example, if major outcomes include effects such as reductions in teenage pregnancies or a reduction in the frequency of jay-walking, these may not be a part of a Ministry of Health’s remit, belonging instead to a Ministry of Social Work or the Ministry of Transport. Conversely, the jurisdictional scope of partner agencies or ministries might cause significant costs or benefits for health equity to be omitted or distorted (such as impacts on life expectation).</p>
<p>Other skews may exist in the distribution of the costs and benefits of interventions across stakeholders that create inequity, as when workplace interventions have costs that fall mainly on owners and benefits that fall mainly on workers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0272989X11426484">48</xref></sup> Institutional biases may cut across a myriad of domains, including the highest institutional levels such as health ministries, within agencies conducting technology appraisals, in provider institutions, and in workplaces and other locations of care or intervention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0272989X11426484">
<title>Implicit Stereotyping</title>
<p>Implicit stereotyping occurs when assumptions are made about a condition and the desirability of treating it so as to describe those living with that condition as “abnormal” or “undesirable.” For example, some individuals who are deaf consider themselves as a group distinguished not only by deafness but also by a language (Sign) and resist the descriptor <italic>disabled</italic> on the grounds that deafness is, in effect, a socially constructed disability and therefore need not be treated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0272989X11426484">49</xref></sup> Implicit stereotyping is especially likely when the culture of the “patient” differs from that of the analyst. A dramatic example of the way in which disease can be socially constructed is pinta (dyschromic spirochaetosis). This skin disease produces distinctive rose-colored spots on the skin, which some Indians in South America once believed to be a sign of being healthy, and which was so prevalent among some tribes that the few single men not affected by it were regarded as pathological to the point of being excluded from marriage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0272989X11426484">50</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0272989X11426484">Note 8</xref>). To treat it therefore according to concepts of disease that are external to that culture is likely to imply that the value of treatment thus estimated would conflict with a value based on local Indian concepts and values. The danger for HTA in implicit stereotyping is that the externally perceived health gain relative to that perceived by the patient can be substantially different, and subsequent implementation becomes patronizing or even stigmatizing.</p>
<p>Implicit stereotyping may be particularly expected for congenital and other chronic conditions. A check is actually to ask the target populations concerned through consultation and deliberation whether the measure or conceptualization of the health benefit or state is biased—or whether there may be some members of the target group for whom this might be the case.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0272989X11426484">
<title>Contexts, Behaviors, and Circumstances</title>
<p>This category includes aspects of the context of an intervention’s use that could, at least in principle, disadvantage some people relative to others (e.g., traveling from a remote home to a clinic or hospital) and thereby render an intervention cost-effective for one group but not for another (e.g., Bombard<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0272989X11426484">30</xref></sup>). Any of the following circumstances could affect the balance of negative and positive consequences: demographics (age, sex, ethnicity), SES, location of delivery of care (e.g., home or institution), language, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, or multiple deprivation.</p>
<p>Some effects occur in unanticipated ways. For example, Rich et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0272989X11426484">51</xref></sup> found that the reliability of self-administered dip-slide measures of bacteriuria taken at home by girls without symptoms varied significantly with the age and SES of the children performing the tests compared with costlier supervised sampling of the same girls. In such cases, the cost-effectiveness of an intervention that is in all other respects the same will be lower for the younger and/or lower SES children.</p>
<p>There is considerable evidence that differential behavioral responses to public health measures according to SES may actually contribute in an unintended way to inequity, especially when utilization of an intervention is lower among more disadvantaged and hard-to-reach populations or by ethnic minorities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X11426484">8</xref></sup> It can be all-pervading, for which the term <italic>staircase effect</italic> was coined by Tugwell et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0272989X11426484">52</xref></sup> Unintended inequality-widening interventions have been termed <italic>intervention-generated inequalities</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0272989X11426484">53</xref></sup> These are widespread phenomena and have been found to exist, for example, in many preventive interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0272989X11426484">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0272989X11426484">55</xref></sup> There is also, needless to say, abundant evidence that many interventions also generate greater health equality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0272989X11426484">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>More generally, equity concerns may arise whenever a particular intervention is cost-effective for some subgroups of clients but not others,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0272989X11426484">37</xref></sup> whether for behavioral or other reasons, depending again on the social and economic characteristics of the subgroups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0272989X11426484">
<title>Processes in HTA</title>
<p>Anticipated equity effects that require adaptation of the usual review processes of the agency need to be considered and addressed as early as possible in the HTA, including the scoping stage. Thus, all questions concerning rights of different groups to be consulted, to be represented, or to participate in decision-making processes should be considered not only in terms of the expertise, knowledge, and understanding that they may bring to the process but also with regard to fairness. For example, if a manufacturer or a patient group might be affected for good or ill by the HTA process, it is likely that fairness would at least require that their right to participate be considered.</p>
<p>If the outcome measure of choice is valid for some patients, perhaps because some aspect of health benefit is not included among the dimensions of the measure, then <italic>the procedure</italic> should ensure that decision makers have access to patients and informal caregivers with experience of the condition and its treatment to enable the construct validity of the measure to be assessed and, if necessary, to enable well-informed adjustments. This approach was recently used by the Medical Advisory Secretariat in Ontario during the scoping stage of an HTA on point-of-care monitoring devices for international normalized ratio. Specifically, a focus group was conducted with a sample of patients on warfarin who might (or who currently) use such devices to obtain input on the research questions to ensure that the investigators captured relevant patient outcomes in their evidentiary review.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0272989X11426484">30</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0272989X11426484">
<title>Hidden Opportunity Costs</title>
<p>These are costs imposed on those affected by the intervention and others who are affected through consequential changes in the distribution of resources. The identity of the individuals who lose may not be known. The weight to be attached to any such opportunity cost might vary according to what is known about who are most likely to lose compared with those directly affected by the intervention. One group of stakeholders that is almost invariably omitted from the deliberative processes is the ordinary or potential consumer of health care—that is, members of the public (as distinct from representatives of specific patient advocacy organizations). By definition, these are anonymous individuals whose stakeholder status arises from the fact that their taxes or premiums fund health care budgets, and if some of these budgets are spent on one intervention, those parts are not available for others including interventions for these ordinary and potential consumers. Although this opportunity cost provides the underpinning argument for using a test incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and is a conventional part of the efficiency element of an HTA, the possibility arises that there may also be equity considerations, for example, when the beneficiaries of a proposed new intervention are relatively privileged or underprivileged members of the community (or few in number) compared with the ordinary consumer. Similarly, the ordinariness of those who bear the opportunity costs of newly introduced interventions ought to be tested. Empirical ways in which this might be done are, however, very much at the research stage (<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0272989X11426484">Note 9</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0272989X11426484">
<title>Processes in the Delivery of Care</title>
<p>Processes in the delivery of care might have inequitable consequences even in the absence of institutional bias of the type already outlined. For example, the way in which care is delivered may be demeaning or unduly revealing, as when a patient enters a clinic for sexually transmitted diseases or HIV that has a sign publicly indicating its purpose. There may be processes at local delivery sites that deny opportunities for patients to reveal equity-related factors. For example, it is commonly charged that middle-class clients of health care systems are more adept at managing their way through administrative processes and hence of receiving effective health care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0272989X11426484">56</xref></sup> A flagrant breach of equity arises when health care providers select out patients deemed to be less financially advantageous to the organization by virtue, for example, of the chronicity of the disease or their insurance status.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0272989X11426484">
<title>Special Claims</title>
<p>There is a range of frequently heard specific equity claims that ought to be anticipated and appraised both in the scoping of an HTA and at subsequent stages. A position should be taken as to what categories of claims will be entertained. Commonly met claims include claims of need, such as low initial health status; claims of responsibility, which may be positive if, say, the likely beneficiaries are deserving by virtue of their roles as, for example, parents, or negative if, say, the likely beneficiaries are deemed undeserving by virtue of behavior such as pursuing lifestyles hazardous to health; claims of history, such as past endurance of ill health or previous receipt of the intervention; claims of desperation, as when the intervention in question represents a last chance for a cure; claims of unfair innings, such as a short already-lived life span<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0272989X11426484">57</xref></sup>; claims related to nonhealth consequences (other effects on welfare) or on multiple deprivations; claims of willingness to pay, such as a willingness to top-up to compensate the provider for providing care that is less cost-effective than the third party payer’s threshold requires.</p>
<p>Special claims and possible inequity may arise in connection with individuals who are not themselves patients. Although it is common in efficiency studies to recognize the importance of taking account of the impact of interventions on informal caregivers, caregivers too may have circumstances or characteristics that warrant special consideration on grounds of equity, especially if they have carried very heavy physical and emotional burdens while caring.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0272989X11426484">58</xref></sup> It is important not to be misled by spurious special claims from interest groups but it is equally important not to allow the strongest of special claims to go unappraised or to overlook the interests of those who are not organized or equipped to ensure that their claims are.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0272989X11426484">
<title>Cumulative Effects</title>
<p>The consideration of cumulative past disadvantages or advantages that might be relevant in assessing benefit or cost or their distribution across affected parties would enable a broad view to be taken and help to ensure that the whole was not taken uncritically to be the mere sum of the individual parts. The accumulation might be across many equity categories, or over time, or both. The possibility ought to be considered that such accumulation strengthens any case for redress.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We have provided a framework for developing a checklist of equity considerations to complement the standard efficiency calculus of HTA. It is intended to be used as part of the process through which advisory bodies are given their terms of reference; the scoping of the agenda prior to the selection of candidate interventions and their comparators for HTA; the accompanying background briefing for decision makers, including systematic and other reviews; and as a tool to help to structure the discussion and composition of professional and lay advisory groups during the assessment process. Its effective development and implementation depends upon the creation of an ongoing research program that identifies omissions and on HTA processes that provide, through appropriately detailed minuting and note-taking, accounts of decisions taken by decision making agencies that can be interpreted as precedents and analyzed retrospectively to promote consistency and to understand the reasons why apparently similar cases have been adjudicated differently on different occasions. Periodic reviews and updating guidance for decision makers are also recommended. In these ways, it may be hoped that equity will be more systematically and fully considered and implemented in both the procedures and decisions of HTA.</p>

<p>An example of a qualitative weight is NICE’s practice of having a reference case in which the types of cost and benefit to be routinely included are specified, other costs and benefits are required to be reported separately, and their significance for decisions judged on a case by case basis. See Reference 59, para. 5.6.2.1.</p>

<p>Equity is commonly perceived as in conflict with efficiency. The existence of any trade-off hinges, however, on the concept of <italic>efficiency</italic> that is used. If being efficient is to maximize aggregate population health with fixed weights for its members’ health states (say, equal weights), then any such weights are potentially inequitable and could generate a clash (say, on grounds of neglecting previous histories of ill health or of treating a given health gain as of equal social value regardless of the starting health state of individual members). But this clash is between different approaches to weighting health states and has less to do with efficiency. If, however, efficiency is of the conventional kind in economics (e.g., Barr<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0272989X11426484">61</xref></sup>)—a state of affairs in which no one’s health can be increased without the necessity of reducing someone else’s—then there is a virtually unlimited set of differently weighted combinations of members’ health states, any one of which is efficient but only a few equitable. The real trade-off is again between rival conceptions of what it means to be equitable.</p>
