<p>Julia Kristeva’s <italic>Hatred and Forgiveness,</italic> as translated by Jeanine Herman, spans the spectrum of Kristevan thought. Kristeva employs many of her previous thoughts and offers contemporary annexes and expansions, addressing: women, politics, disabled peoples, religion, literature, art, psychoanalysis, language and love. Tangentially, this book serves as an authorial locator. The themes of vulnerability and recreation of the self through psychoanalysis are developed throughout informative discussions, at times confessional in nature, allowing Kristeva to expose her <italic>self</italic> to the reader. By such mechanisms, the book is performative in effect. Throughout the work, Kristeva pays homage to many thinkers – predecessors, and colleagues. The reader is left with an extensive impression about the genealogy of thought from which Kristeva produces. The book’s sections seem choppy if viewed as atomic constituents, a fair assessment given the majority of the content’s origination. However, an enduring attempt from cover-to-cover will reveal interweaving themes and concepts.</p>
<p>The book is divided into six major parts, which are then separated into multiple sections. Kristeva begins the book, in a section titled ‘World(s)’, by discussing the reception of her ideas in foreign countries. She comments on the hospitality she experienced in America, and likens such hospitality to her own understanding of humanity. Kristeva discusses her position as both an insider and outsider to French critical circles, and notes variations of freedom in order to problematize issues of religion in modern French culture. Including personal experience throughout, Kristeva raises rhetorical investigation of secular discourse and humanism, commenting on the implications entailed concerning women and the disabled. To Kristeva, integration of the disabled (physical/mental) was a necessary step – but is not <italic>good enough</italic>. To Kristeva, it is profound <italic>interaction</italic> with the disabled that will materialize in her envisioned utopia (p. 30). <italic>New</italic> humanism is the potential vehicle for such change, spawning revolution through shared vulnerability.</p>
<p>Part 2, ‘Women’, covers many topics within the realm of womanhood, starting with a discussion of gender parity in French legislation. Kristeva sees consciousness as being necessarily informed by state legislation, thus positing that legislative change in the pursuit of equality can only spawn liberation. In the next section, art is utilized to discuss how the gender dialectic extends beyond discourse; Kristeva states: ‘We do not know much about femininity that would be the product of the feminine imaginary alone’ (p. 62). It is noted that art has been trapped in constructions of masculinity, because the gaze is always masculine and phallic. Kristeva then demonstrates the evolution of female depictions in art, suggesting that revisiting such works in museums can have immense utility in reminding subjects where they come from. The maternal hints within this section transition into the next, on motherhood, which address Jean-Didier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959353512439545">Vincent’s (1998)</xref> notions of biology and passion. Kristeva discusses passion in light of the maternal, and puts forth that: ‘It is through the maternal conscious and unconscious experience … that the modulations of our passion pass – perhaps, in the long term, to the point of modifying the neuronal and hormonal map itself’ (p. 92). After a brief discussion of Francois Charpin, Kristeva moves on to elucidate the importance of Simone De Beauvoir. Kristeva explains that for Beauvoir, ‘the novel is an act of existential affirmation by which the unbearableness of the intimate is transmuted into political stakes’ (p. 112). Following this section is an overview of ‘Fatigue in the Feminine’,’which is reframed as a fatigue of (Lacanian) sexuation. The subsequent examination of Freudian and Lacanian concepts surrounding hysterics and mothers, transitions appropriately into the third part of the book.</p>
<p>‘Psychoanalyzing’ is perhaps the most difficult part of Kristeva’s book to grasp. The first section is located as a response to André Green’s work, <italic>Destin des Passions</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959353512439545">Green, 1986</xref>). In this section, Kristeva distinguishes between scenes and actions, and posits four modalities of hysterical time. Accepting the Freudian concept that ‘the unconscious ignores time’, Kristeva thinks that the psychoanalyst should enter their patient through the realm of lost time, as opposed to specific time of trauma (p. 134). Furthering her thoughts on how the disabled/ill other is treated, Kristeva analyses cancer. Kristeva observes that cancer is identified as a symptom of the subject. She then discusses the depression that often accompanies such illness in its latter stages, and puts forth practical solutions for easing the process, namely that ‘[b]enevolent listening appears to be the most appropriate treatment for these final stages: the dying person expects <italic>not so much a response as to be heard’</italic> (p. 156). Kristeva says that psychical life is universally atrophying, and points towards psychoanalysis as the key to resuscitation. Love is then negotiated, and resolved as the humanistic religion and therapy of the future. In the next section, juridical processes are again referenced, with further rhetorical inquiry – followed by annexation of theories on abjection. The penultimate section in this part, from which the book takes its title, ends by suggesting that psychoanalysis can aid in rectifying religious tension and war. Part 3 closes with a heady attempt at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959353512439545">Freud’s <italic>Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality</italic> (1962[1905])</xref>, amalgamating the thoughts of others (Lacan, Colette, McDougall) along the way.</p>
<p>Part 4, ‘Religion’, starts with a brief overview of Freudian notions regarding transgression, with expansion and explanation of Kristeva’s own interests in studying religion. Kristeva uses the exodus–exile–return narrative of biblical peoples to discuss the imperative of continuous recreation of self. In this discussion of religion and love, Kristeva discloses that ‘Freud wanted to believe in a humanity rid of its illusions … As for me, I would like to preserve one illusion: that of a humanity capable of laughing, out of love, and making light of love’ (p. 227).</p>
<p>Part 5, ‘Portraits’, again covers love, the maternal, art and literature. This part also offers the most reduced and encompassing Kristevan gem to walk away with: ‘We are not all psychotic, but we can all be crazy. Crazy for one another (men and women, women and women, men and men), because we are crazy for our crazy mothers’ (p. 247). As she does in other sections, Kristeva mentions the utility of <italic>writing</italic> as a means of arresting melancholic tendencies, and closes Part 5 by applauding Roland Barthes.</p>
<p>Part 6 of the book, on ‘Writing’, ties many of the themes together. This part mainly consists of an interview conducted by Pierre-Louis Fort, with Kristeva being the interviewee. The main topic of inquiry is Kristeva’s role as a novelist, for which she has been heavily criticized and misunderstood. It is through such direct interview that the reader gets a sense of what is at stake for Kristeva in the novel. For Kristeva, the novel-of-the ego is dead, leaving the novel-of-the-subject to serve society’s religious function. Kristeva clarifies: ‘Durkheim already reminded us that today God is society. Fine. Then the novel as I understand it will be its mystic, God’s as well as society’ (p. 296). Kristeva is hostile towards the literary world, which has been, mostly, hostile towards her. The concluding sentence of this section, and of the book, speak to Kristeva’s convictions on the power of writing: ‘I am trying to write in the open; uncertainty is my Byzantine memory, and the novel of a flowering of questions’ (p. 305).</p>
<p>Kristeva’s role as a novelist can be understood as explained on p. 158: ‘The call is then made to the psychoanalyst, in various forms of disguise, to restore <italic>psychical life</italic> and allow the <italic>speaking body</italic> optimal life.’ The themes of love, new humanism, and the novel – as imperative to necessary cultural revolution – are left to those in her position, as psychoanalysts, to initiate. Kristeva’s concepts are perhaps most clearly articulated regarding abjection, writing, clinical reform, and political legislative implications. The integration of personal narrative and complex prose throughout, though valuable in its own right, largely dilutes the theoretical investigations offered. Undoubtedly, this is something that Kristeva is well aware of; she reminds the reader in Part 1 that she knows exactly how her works have been received. This being the case, the question of audience merits consideration.</p>
<p>Julia Kristeva’s <italic>Hatred and Forgiveness</italic> offers conceptually dense glimpses into the topics of women, politics, disabled peoples, religion, literature, art, psychoanalysis, language and love. The intense language, and atypical methodology employed, will likely repel many. This can be seen as further proof of the psychical decay that Kristeva suggests – though the critique that the work lacks concise pragmatic utility is perhaps valid. Regarding the scope of <italic>Feminism and Psychology</italic>, the book has enormous utility in initiating critical feminist examination; it exposes many issues directly relevant to feminist agenda(s). Kristeva’s states that ‘[she is] not necessarily encouraging doctors to practice analysis, but at the very least, to read novels’ (p. 156). Such critical reflection of clinical atmosphere, with the emphasis on invigorating the psyche, is deeply feminist – and ultimately, a move towards the <italic>new</italic> humanism Kristeva suggests.</p></sec></sec>
