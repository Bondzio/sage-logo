<abstract>
<p>This field report describes an investigation to identify cases to control a syphilis outbreak in a prison and determine whether clinical, case management, and surveillance practices influenced the outbreak occurrence, detection, or management. Key performance measures were assessed to evaluate timeliness and quality of clinical and case management activities and surveillance practices. Thirty cases were found. Prior to the investigation, median times for clinical and reporting/surveillance measures were 15 days from primary and secondary (P&amp;S) symptom onset to exam, 7 days from P&amp;S exam to treatment, and 63 days from serologic test to the state’s receipt of case. After the investigation, these measures improved to 8, 4.5, and 28 days, respectively. Lack of adherence to surveillance and clinical management protocols likely contributed to this outbreak, which was curtailed by aggressive control measures.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Syphilis, a bacterial sexually transmitted disease (STD), can have severe adverse consequences if not treated, including organ damage and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078345812458088">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2010</xref>). A syphilis infection increases the likelihood of acquisition and transmission of HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1078345812458088">Wasserheit, 1992</xref>) and can cause congenital malformations if transmitted perinatally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078345812458088">CDC, 2010</xref>). Syphilis is characterized by distinct phases: the primary and secondary (P&amp;S) infectious stages followed by latent phases in which disease progression may occur, but transmission to others is unlikely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078345812458088">CDC, 2010</xref>). It can be readily treated by intramuscular injection of antibiotic therapy. Timely treatment of infectious cases and contacts is of utmost importance to stop the chain of transmission.</p>
<p>After many years of decline, syphilis rates in the United States reached an all-time low in 2000. Despite syphilis elimination activities, syphilis rates then began increasing and continued to rise through 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078345812458088">CDC, 2009</xref>). This rise was primarily among men who have sex with men (MSM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078345812458088">CDC, 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078345812458088">Heffelfinger, Swint, Berman, &amp; Weinstock, 2007</xref>). Syphilis trends in California mirrored those in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078345812458088">California Department of Public Health, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Rates of bacterial STDs, including syphilis, are higher among incarcerated groups than in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078345812458088">Bernstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078345812458088">de Ravello et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078345812458088">Joesoef et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078345812458088">Kahn, Scholl, Shane, Lemoine, &amp; Farley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1078345812458088">Mertz, Voigt, Hutchins, &amp; Levine, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1078345812458088">Solomon, Flynn, Muck, &amp; Vertefeuille, 2004</xref>). The prevalence of viral STDs, such as HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C, is also higher among incarcerated populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078345812458088">de Ravello et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078345812458088">Fox et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078345812458088">Ruiz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1078345812458088">Samuel, Bulterys, Jenison, &amp; Doherty, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1078345812458088">Solomon et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1078345812458088">Weinbaum, Sabin, &amp; Santibanez, 2005</xref>). Despite evidence of STD transmission in correctional facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078345812458088">Jafa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078345812458088">Javanbakht et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078345812458088">Smith, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1078345812458088">Wolfe et al., 2001</xref>), few STD outbreaks have been reported from these settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078345812458088">Smith, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1078345812458088">Wolfe et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) is one of the largest U.S. correctional systems, with a 2008 census of approximately 171,000 inmates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078345812458088">CDCR, 2009</xref>). Upon intake, inmates pass through a reception center where they undergo health screening and medical examination. In 2008, the California Prison Health Care Services (CPHCS) guidelines recommended syphilis screening for all inmates passing through reception centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078345812458088">CDCR, 2006a</xref>). Upon transfer to a permanent facility, inmates are not routinely screened again; STD testing after intake is dependent on inmate sick-call request or provider clinical assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078345812458088">CDCR, 2006a</xref>). On-site nurses triage sick-call requests, either referring an inmate to a physician or treating according to “standing protocols,” which include a “rash protocol” that indicates treatment with topical creams for symptoms related to common rashes and other minor dermatological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078345812458088">CDCR, 2006b</xref>).</p>
<p>If an inmate is diagnosed with an STD, the prison is responsible for accurate and timely clinical management, including treatment. Recommended syphilis treatment is benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units intramuscularly, with dosage determined by stage of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078345812458088">CDC, 2006b</xref>). In addition, when syphilis is diagnosed or suspected, prison health care providers are required to submit, within 1 working day, a confidential morbidity report (CMR) to the local health jurisdiction (LHJ) in which the case resided at time of diagnosis; laboratories are required to submit, within 1 working day, positive syphilis test results to the LHJ in which the provider is located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1078345812458088">State of California, 2007</xref>). Upon receipt of a CMR or laboratory report, the LHJ is responsible for case investigation, sexual contact tracing, and timely reporting of cases to the California Department of Public Health Sexually Transmitted Disease Control Branch (STDCB).</p>
<p>In April 2008, the STDCB was notified of an apparent increase in syphilis cases in one CDCR prison, here designated as Prison X. At this time, Prison X housed approximately 6,500 male inmates in its East and West sides (CDCR Offender Information, 2009). The West Side housed lower-security inmates (<italic>n</italic> = 2,700) in dormitory-style housing and the East Side primarily housed higher-security inmates (<italic>n</italic> = 3,800) in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078345812458088">CDCR Offender Information, 2009</xref>). Among East Side inmates, 44% were African American, 19% were Hispanic, 26% were White, and 11% were another race/ethnicity. The East Side was divided into four sections, each containing two residential buildings. Sections A and B housed general population inmates; Section C housed inmates identified as HIV positive, transgender, MSM, or having mild mental illness; and Section D housed inmates with severe mental illness. Prior to the notification in April 2008, no syphilis case had been reported in this facility since 1999.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1078345812458088" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>This outbreak investigation was conducted from April through December 2008 and included retrospective case assessment back to January 1, 2007. The investigation remained open through December 2008, when no new cases had been identified for 5 months. Investigation partners included the STDCB, CPHCS Public Health Unit, LHJ public health staff, CPHCS health care providers, and CDCR custody staff, CDCR administrators, inmate peer educators, and other Prison X inmates. For analysis, all dates prior to April 18, 2008, were considered “pre” outbreak investigation and response, and all subsequent dates were considered “post.”</p>
<sec id="section3-1078345812458088">
<title>Investigation Activities</title>
<sec id="section4-1078345812458088">
<title>Case definition</title>
<p>A case was defined as confirmed early syphilis (primary, secondary, or early latent [EL] syphilis, per CDC case definitions; CDC, 1997) or latent syphilis of unknown duration and a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) titer of ≥ 1:16 from January 1, 2007, through December 31, 2008, while incarcerated at Prison X.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1078345812458088">
<title>Case finding</title>
<p>Cases identified by Prison X staff preinvestigation were considered “original” cases. Additional case-finding efforts included (a) review of laboratory data for all nontreponemal RPR screening tests and confirmatory fluorescent treponemal pallidum antibody absorption or <italic>Treponema pallidum</italic> particle agglutination assay (TP-PA) tests for Prison X inmates from January 1, 2007, through December 31, 2008; (b) review of Prison X sick-call appointment logs from January 1, 2008, through June 30, 2008, to identify inmates seeking medical care for syphilis testing or symptoms suggestive of P&amp;S syphilis, including genital lesions, skin rashes, other dermatological conditions, new onset neurologic or ocular symptoms, or flu-like symptoms; (c) interviews by disease intervention specialists (DIS) of all potential cases and sexual and social contacts; and (d) a mass screening among inmates residing in Section C, the housing section of Prison X where most of the original cases resided, using RPR screening and TP-PA confirmatory tests (oral consent obtained) and HIV Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) screening and Western blot confirmatory tests (written consent obtained).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1078345812458088">
<title>Standard syphilis clinical management</title>
<p>Early in the investigation, STDCB provided guidance to Prison X health care providers regarding the recommended clinical management of suspected and confirmed syphilis cases and sexual partners based on 2006 CDC guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078345812458088">CDC, 2006b</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1078345812458088">
<title>Clinical management, case management, and reporting/surveillance</title>
<p>We assessed key performance measures to examine the timeliness and quality of syphilis clinical management, case management, and surveillance activities. Cases identified before April 18, 2008, were compared to cases identified postinvestigation to contrast clinical and public health activities before and after the investigation was under way.</p>
<p>Assessments of clinical management were performed separately for P&amp;S cases and EL cases because, by definition, P&amp;S cases have clinician-observed symptoms whereas EL cases do not. Clinical management measures included number of days (time) between (1) onset date of patient-reported P&amp;S symptoms and date of treatment among P&amp;S cases (P&amp;S Sx to Treatment), (1a) onset date of patient-reported P&amp;S symptoms and date of exam (P&amp;S Sx to Exam), (1b) date of exam and date of treatment (P&amp;S Exam to Treatment), and (2) date of serologic syphilis test and date of treatment among EL cases (EL Test to Treatment).</p>
<p>Case management was assessed by measuring the time between (3) the date the case was first reported to the LHJ and the date the DIS was assigned the case (LHJ Report to Assignment), (4) the date the DIS was assigned the case and the date the case patient was first interviewed (Assignment to Interview), and (5) the date the case patient was first interviewed and the date the case investigation was considered final, meaning that the case patient was treated and all locatable contacts were serologically evaluated for syphilis, offered HIV testing, and treated, if indicated (Interview to Closure).</p>
<p>Public health reporting/surveillance measures included the time between (6) the date of serologic syphilis test and the date the case was received by STDCB (Test to State), (6a) the date of serologic syphilis test and the date the positive laboratory report was received by the LHJ (Test to Lab Report), (6b) the date of serologic syphilis test and the date the provider CMR was received by the LHJ (Test to Provider Report), and (6c) the date the LHJ received a CMR or positive syphilis laboratory result (earlier of the two) to the date the case report was received by STDCB (LHJ Report to State).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1078345812458088">
<title>Data Sources</title>
<p>To determine the syphilis stage, we used clinical assessment, laboratory results, and the STDCB syphilis serologic and treatment database. Demographic and clinical data from the syphilis case management form included age, race/ethnicity, and case self-reported HIV status. We used inmate housing data from Prison X to determine the housing location/locations for case patients during the time period they most likely acquired their syphilis infection, based on standard time periods according to the stage at diagnosis (e.g., the prior 3 months for primary syphilis, 6 months for secondary syphilis, and 12 months for EL syphilis).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1078345812458088">
<title>Study Design and Data Analysis</title>
<p>Throughout the investigation, we used a case series approach; we investigated all individuals diagnosed with syphilis, as potentially having syphilis, or as contacts to syphilis cases. Our primary analysis focused on individuals meeting the case definition. Among these cases, we assessed clinical and case management and surveillance measures and compared results pre-outbreak to the same measures after the outbreak investigation and response (post-outbreak). We calculated descriptive statistics for key clinical, case management, and surveillance measures (mean, median, maximum) by stage of syphilis for pre- and post-outbreak investigation initiation. Because of the small number of P&amp;S syphilis cases in the postinvestigation period, differences between pre- and postinvestigation periods could not be assessed statistically. STDCB was responsible for data management and analysis, with support from the LHJ epidemiologist. To perform the analyses, we used SAS version 9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).</p>

<title>Case counts upon initiation of investigation</title>
<p>Review of the STDCB database at investigation initiation found that no cases of infectious syphilis had been reported from Prison X since 1999. When the investigation began in mid-April 2008, Prison X was aware of 13 early syphilis cases diagnosed since August 2007; no CMRs for these cases had been received by STDCB.</p>
<p>Through all case-finding methods, 66 inmates were suspected cases and investigated thoroughly; 30 ultimately met the case definition. Thirteen were original cases, two were identified by review of laboratory data, two were identified by review of sick-call appointments, three were named by a case patient as sexual/social contacts, and 10 were identified by the mass screening (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078345812458088">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Mass screening</title>
<p>Because the majority (85%) of original cases resided in Section C at time of their diagnosis, we targeted the mass screening to inmates residing in this section. On May 13 and 14, 2008, we offered syphilis and HIV screening to 974 (99.7%) Section C inmates. Among those, 76% were tested for syphilis and 43% were tested for HIV infection. Twenty-one (2.8%) inmates had positive RPR screening and TP-PA confirmatory tests. Ten of the 21 were newly identified syphilis cases. Five (1.2%) of the 421 HIV-screened inmates tested positive, including 1 newly identified HIV case.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1078345812458088">
<title>Sexual partners/social contacts</title>
<p>Among 26 cases reporting sexual partners, 20 provided reliable identifying information; from these, investigations were initiated for 38 sexual partners among whom 3 (7.9%) were found to have early syphilis. Preventive treatment was offered to sexual partners according to CDC partner management guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078345812458088">CDC, 2008</xref>).</p>

Cases increased significantly in the spring and summer of 2008; the last case was diagnosed in August 2008 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1078345812458088">Figure 1</xref>). Forty-seven percent of case patients were HIV infected and most (70%) were African American. Eighty-seven percent resided in Section C at some point during the time period they most likely acquired their syphilis infection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078345812458088">Table 1</xref>). Nearly half (<italic>n</italic> = 13) resided in the same segment of the same floor, including seven P&amp;S cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1078345812458088">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Syphilis transmission within Prison X</title>
<p>No single index case could be identified for this outbreak. There was no evidence that inmates were not screened for syphilis upon intake to CDCR at the reception centers. At least 73% of cases were definitely infected while incarcerated based on their stage of syphilis and the date of incarceration at Prison X. Though sexual activity among CDCR inmates is illegal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1078345812458088">State of California, 2008</xref>), anecdotes from Prison X staff and data from syphilis case-patient interviews indicated that sex among inmates was common. Thirty-four (89%) of the 38 locatable sex partners were Prison X inmates.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We report here on a large syphilis outbreak in a California prison from 2007 to 2008. Thirty cases were detected over a span of 16 months in one prison from which no infectious cases had been reported in the prior 7 years.</p>
<p>Multiple factors likely contributed to the propagation of this outbreak. Among P&amp;S cases, there was evidence of delays between onset of symptoms and clinician exam. The CPHCS system for triaging patients using standing protocols may have resulted in delayed treatment, particularly if syphilis-like symptoms (e.g., nonspecific genital lesions and rashes) were handled according to a protocol (e.g., treatment with topical creams) that did not include syphilis in the differential diagnosis and did not require physician consultation, appropriate testing, or presumptive syphilis treatment. Other delays may have been caused by lack of timely referral to medical care after sick-call request or delays in case patients’ requests for sick call.</p>
<p>There were also delays between the initial exam and treatment among P&amp;S cases. These delays could have been due to an initial clinical misdiagnosis, a lack of presumptive treatment, or delays in returning to the clinic for treatment. There was no evidence of laboratory test delays. CDC recommends presumptive treatment at the time of the initial visit if the patient presents with symptoms suggestive of P&amp;S syphilis (CDC, 2006). Thus, the time between exam and treatment should be 0 days for patients at risk for syphilis and presenting with symptoms suggestive of syphilis, especially in an outbreak setting. Because the initiating event for treatment for an EL case is a positive test result, instead of clinician-observed symptoms, it was expected that there would be a longer delay between exam and treatment compared to P&amp;S cases. It is reasonable to expect that treatment for EL cases occur within 7 to 14 days of serologic syphilis test, which did occur for most cases both pre- and postinvestigation. For incarcerated populations, delays in treatment of EL syphilis should be minimal as inmates are readily accessible for treatment once the laboratory result is available.</p>
<p>This outbreak was not detected during regular and ongoing review of state STDCB surveillance data. Data indicated the LHJ was aware of some original cases by early 2008, but these cases had not been received by STDCB when the investigation began. These reporting delays between prison clinical provider/laboratory and the LHJ and the state may have prevented earlier outbreak detection.</p>
<p>HIV rates among correctional populations in the United States tend to be higher than in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078345812458088">de Ravello et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078345812458088">Fox et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078345812458088">Jafa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078345812458088">Javanbakht et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078345812458088">Ruiz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1078345812458088">Samuel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1078345812458088">Solomon et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1078345812458088">Weinbaum et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1078345812458088">Wohl, Rosen, &amp; Kaplan, 2006</xref>), especially among incarcerated MSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078345812458088">Javanbakht et al., 2009</xref>). Forty-seven percent of cases were HIV positive; this was consistent with the overall HIV P&amp;S syphilis coinfection rate among MSM in California (57.2% in 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078345812458088">California Department of Public Health, 2009</xref>) and expected given that HIV-positive inmates were housed in Section C. The only new HIV infection identified in this outbreak was not in a syphilis case patient.</p>
<p>Seventy percent of case patients were African American, proportionately more than the overall Prison X East Side population. Disparities in syphilis incidence by race/ethnicity are one of the hallmarks of syphilis epidemiology. The 2008 rate of P&amp;S syphilis among African American males (27.6 cases per 100,000) in California was more than double the rate among White males (11.1) and nearly triple the rate among Hispanic males (9.3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078345812458088">California Department of Public Health, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results are subject to limitations. We were unable to obtain housing information for every case patient during his entire infectious period; also, data for the clinical and case management and reporting/surveillance measures in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1078345812458088">Table 2</xref> were incomplete. An additional limitation was that sick-call data were available for only 6 months; this may have resulted in some missed cases, but other case-finding approaches likely mitigated this limitation.</p>
<p>We curtailed the outbreak with standard and outbreak-specific STD control measures. Interagency collaboration was vital to the success of these efforts. Standard case-patient interviews and contact tracing appeared to be effective, even in this prison environment. Inmate peer health educators played a critically important role in heightening awareness, providing STD education, and encouraging inmates to participate in the interviewing and screening activities and to reduce high-risk sexual activity. Although mass screening required resources beyond routine clinical services, this intervention effectively identified one third of the cases and helped control the outbreak.</p>
<p>The quality of correctional health care and the public health systems serving inmates have significant implications for both incarcerated populations and the communities to which they return. To reduce STD transmission within prisons and within inmates’ families and communities, we recommend adherence to all CDC clinical, case management, and reporting/surveillance guidelines; provision of STD prevention education for inmates upon entry and throughout incarceration; clinical management trainings for health care staff; and availability of periodic STD/HIV screening for sexually active inmates.</p>
