<p>The volume <italic>Conversation and Gender</italic> provides a comprehensive, book-length treatment of the promising research field of conversation analysis and gender, which has been developing rapidly over the past decade. The chapters in this volume are contributed by an international group of scholars and showcase the latest thinking and cutting-edge research in this area. The editors’ introduction (Chapter 1) situates the volume in light of the current literature on language and gender research. The remaining 13 empirical articles are organized into four sections according to the themes they deal with.</p>
<p>Part I explores gendered ways of referring to selves and other people in talk. Chapter 2 challenges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461445612466496">Schegloff’s (1996</xref>: 440) analysis of the self-referential ‘I’ as a ‘reference simpliciter’, conveying no categorical information about gender. Drawing on data from telephone calls, Jackson shows where instances of ‘gendered-I’ (p. 31) can be found. In Chapter 3, using naturalistic data, Land and Kitzinger analyze how people do first- person categorization. They demonstrate how speakers render themselves as gendered and as members of particular social groups according to different interactional aims. Klein (Chapter 4) studies how speakers do ‘gender categorization in non-recognitional person reference’ (p. 64). Klein makes a distinction between ‘action’ and ‘system’ relevance and illustrates the way gender categorization can be relevant in terms of both types.</p>
<p>Part II examines gender in relation to two conversational practices: repair and recipient design. Stokoe (Chapter 5) illustrates four different formats for making and repairing consecutive references to absent third parties and considers how these formats reveal speakers’ orientation toward gender. The author suggests that these repairs are interactionally motivated. Chapter 6 focuses on the issue of how gender may be oriented to in routinized and formulaic talk. Wilkinson argues that ‘a key feature of recipient design that informs the call-taker’s selection (or not) of this prefabricated talk is the perceived gender of her recipient’ (p. 114). Working with a selection of tag questions, Hepburn and Potter (Chapter 7) show that tag questions can be ‘both coercive (attempting to alter, or place constraints on, the recipients’ conduct) and invasive (attempting to re/construct the recipient’s desires, beliefs, knowledge or other ‘‘psychological’’ matters)’ (p. 150).</p>
<p>The chapters in Part III are grouped together by their common concern with the relationship between gender and action formation. In Chapter 8, through an examination of reported third-party compliments in transsexual patient’s passing as ‘real’ men or women, Speer shows how gender identities can be displayed through subsidiary actions. The author notes that ‘more work needs to be done to tease apart the relationship between focal and subsidiary actions’ (p. 182). Chapter 9 examines a conversation between three couples in which a joke is told. Through a multimodal analysis, Sidnell shows that a turn in this joke not only makes reference to the recipient’s gender, but also suggests that the joke-telling is designed for a gendered, exclusive male audience. Beach and Glenn (Chapter 10) study how gender is constructed in the midst of pursuing and responding to bids for intimacy. The analysis reveals how foregrounding and backgrounding of gender is achieved in the course of activities.</p>
<p>Part IV centers on how gender identities are constructed through membership categorization practices. Butler and Weatherall (Chapter 11) demonstrate how a temporary cross-gender category membership is established through a case analysis of an episode of interaction between four children. Chapter 12 examines how children employ gender identities in everyday talk. Goodwin argues that ‘the study of membership categorization is enhanced by an ethnographic understanding of children’s social life’ (p. 251). Chapter 13 explores how gender inequality is collaboratively constructed by participants in divorce mediation. The analysis reveals how participants’ strategic use of gendered categories and moral account of their life create a situation of inequality. In the last chapter, Cromdal examines how children invoke and exploit gender stereotypes in the course of group activities.</p>
<p>As a whole, this volume constitutes a valuable contribution to the growing field of conversation and gender research. Theoretically, it broadens our understanding of the relationship between language and gender. Some chapters challenge established views, providing readers fresh insights into classical topics. Some chapters debate with each other, offering readers multiple perspectives from which to look at an issue. Some chapters ask new questions, inviting readers to explore new territory in the research area. Though often with different emphases and perspectives, the chapters are united by the view that ‘gender is best analyzed as a members’ phenomenon as it crops up in everyday, naturally occurring interaction, looking at the regular, situated practices through which gender identities and categorizations are realized’ (p. 17).</p>
<p>As far as methodology is concerned, this volume provides readers with rich, detailed and excellent demonstrations of how conversation analysis of gender can be done empirically. Across this volume, readers can encounter a diversity of data sources. Each chapter draws upon real-life audio or video interactions across a wide range of contexts, such as face-to-face interaction, mediation sessions, helpline calls and children’s play. In the interactional analysis of gender, some contributors conduct sequential conversation analysis, while others combine conversation analysis with related approaches such as discursive psychology and ethnography. Several chapters, such as Chapter 5, embrace a multimodal analysis of gender and interaction. However, as pointed out by the editors, it still remains a challenge for conversation and gender researchers ‘to produce robust, endogenous descriptions of embodied conduct that do not build heavy layers of interpretation into the process of mere description’ (p. 25). All in all, this collection is highly recommended for those who would like to be informed of the latest developments in the area of gender and conversation analysis.</p>
