<abstract>
<p>Although advocates of consociationalism have asserted that there is solid empirical evidence supporting the use of power-sharing institutions in divided societies, previous quantitative tests of these theories suffer from serious data limitations and fail to take into account the conditional nature of institutional effects. The authors test the effect of (a) proportional representation (PR) over majoritarian electoral rules, (b) parliamentary over presidential or semipresidential arrangements, and (c) a federal over a unitary system in reducing conflict in a cross-country data set of 101 countries representing 106 regimes. The results undercut much of the previous empirical support for consociationalist arrangements in divided societies. Using a multiplicative specification, the authors find that PR and parliamentarism appear to exacerbate political violence when ethnic fractionalization is high, though the effect of federalism is less certain.</p>

<p>It is a longstanding hope of scholars and practitioners alike that careful constitutional design can make democratic consolidation more likely in multiethnic countries. Yet there remains considerable debate about what constitutions should be designed to achieve in deeply divided societies and about which institutional arrangements are most likely to meet these aims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0010414011425341">Reilly, 2006</xref>). The most influential work on this question continues to be consociationalist theory, especially the writings of Arendt Lijphart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0010414011425341">Lijphart, 1968</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0010414011425341">1969</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0010414011425341">1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0010414011425341">1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0010414011425341">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0010414011425341">2008</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0010414011425341">Daadler, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0010414011425341">Hanf et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0010414011425341">Milne 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0010414011425341">Hanf, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0010414011425341">Jarstad 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0010414011425341">O’Leary &amp; McGarry, 2004</xref>). The institutional arrangements advocated by members of this “consociationalist school” have taken a number of forms but share a core package of features: pure parliamentarism rather than presidentialism or semipresidentialism, electoral systems that employ proportional representation (PR) in large districts over more majoritarian ones, and meaningful federalism that devolves considerable resources and autonomy to constituent subunits of the larger state.</p>
<p>In recent work on this question, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0010414011425341">Lijphart (2004)</xref> has claimed that there is a “strong scholarly consensus” in favor of these institutions for divided societies, and that there is “solid empirical evidence” (p. 107) of their superior efficacy in mitigating ethnic divisions. We think both of these claims are overstated. There is a spirited and vocal group of scholars who find fault with one or more elements of the consociationalist vision on solid theoretical grounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0010414011425341">Barry, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010414011425341">Chandra, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0010414011425341">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0010414011425341">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0010414011425341">Horowitz, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0010414011425341">1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0010414011425341">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0010414011425341">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0010414011425341">Jarstad &amp; Sisk, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0010414011425341">Reilly, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0010414011425341">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0010414011425341">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0010414011425341">Roeder &amp; Rothchild, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0010414011425341">Selway, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0010414011425341">Snyder, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0010414011425341">Woodward, 1999</xref>). And despite assertions to the contrary, the empirical evidence that parliamentarism, PR, and federalism perform better than alternatives in a wide array of social settings has been very far from “solid” to this point (Clark, Golder, &amp; Nadenichek Golder, 2009, pp. 737-738).</p>
<p>In this article, we present an empirical challenge to consociationalism. We show that the core institutional arrangements are not superior to the alternatives in the most severely divided societies and that some consociationalist choices are actually associated with more political violence in such societies. The analysis on which these results rest is, we argue, a substantial improvement over previous large-<italic>N</italic> empirical work on this topic. First and foremost, past research has usually analyzed the effect of institutions on political instability across all democracies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0010414011425341">Krain, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0010414011425341">Powell, 1982</xref>) or all regimes, authoritarian as well as democratic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0010414011425341">Reynal-Querol, 2002</xref>). In fact, however, Lijphart and others make a conditional argument: The proper question to be addressed is whether consociationalist arrangements appear to perform consistently better than the alternatives <italic>in more divided societies.</italic> We therefore estimate a multiplicative model specification rather than an additive one. In addition, we take advantage of the large increase in democratic regimes in the 1980s and 1990s to greatly expand the number of observations, and we exclude regimes that are not democratic. Finally, we employ in the analysis a wide variety of distinct measures of the outcome of interest—political violence—as well as alternative measures of the main institutional variables. Thus, in contrast to previous research, our central findings appear quite robust to decisions about measures and case selection. Overall, our results provide little empirical support for consociationalist theory: The combination of parliamentarism and PR, in particular, appears to <italic>worsen</italic> prospects for political violence in the most diverse countries.</p>
<p>The article proceeds as follows. First, we review the fundamental tenets of consociationalism along with some of the counterarguments concerning how the three core institutional choices should affect the incidence of political violence in divided societies. We then discuss previous empirical findings, which are far from conclusive. From this review, we generate several testable hypotheses and discuss model specification issues. The next section describes our data sources and presents our findings from a large set of country-regimes for the period 1972 to 2003. We conclude with a discussion of the broader implications of our findings for the consociationalist remedy for ethnic divisions and more broadly for the practice of institutional engineering.</p>

<title>The Consociationalist Logic</title>
<p>There is wide agreement among scholars and practitioners that societies with deep ethnic divides are more prone to political violence than in those without serious identity cleavages. For several reasons, political competition that centers on conflicts over identity is thought to be more difficult than other types of conflict to resolve through simple majority rule. Voting that is motivated by ethnic concerns, for instance, tends to result in “elections by census” in which each group’s share of the electorate is closely reflected in the votes going to each political party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0010414011425341">Horowitz, 1985</xref>, p. 326). This outcome is especially dangerous in societies where one ethnic group is a majority of the population because it raises the possibility that minorities will be permanently excluded from office (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0010414011425341">Chandra &amp; Boulet, 2005</xref>). In addition, when ethnicity or another ascriptive identity is highly salient, the threat of coethnic challengers can discourage party leaders from generating cross-group electoral appeals. Parties are then driven to engage in “ethnic-outbidding” and act to advance mutually exclusive group claims to power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0010414011425341">Rabushka &amp; Shepsle, 1972</xref>). Ethnically heterogeneous societies may also be especially problematic for the provision of public goods, as elected officials seek to funnel state resources more narrowly to coethnics rather than produce broad and nonexcludable benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0010414011425341">Easterly &amp; Levine, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0010414011425341">Miguel &amp; Gugerty, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, ethnically heterogeneous societies pose more serious ex ante challenges to the establishment and maintenance of political stability than do homogeneous ones: There is a greater danger that social divisions will spin out of control and rip the state apart. Some scholars (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0010414011425341">Chesterman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0010414011425341">Snyder, 2000</xref>) even argue that the peaceful practice of full-fledged democracy is simply not possible in many new, ethnically divided countries and that autocratic regimes that maintain political stability are preferable to democracies despite the limits they may impose on political competition and civil liberties.</p>
<p>Advocates of consociationalism are more optimistic about the prospects for preventing political violence through democratic means in divided societies. They begin from the premise that institutions matter for politics: that the formal rules of the state, constitutional and otherwise, both structure political competition and have fundamental, generalizable, long-run consequences for a wide range of political outcomes. That in turn raises the alluring possibility that institutions can be “engineered” to make certain political outcomes more likely.</p>
<p>But what does the ideal package of institutions look like? The consociationalist answer to this question is based on the belief that deep social divisions within a country’s population are best addressed through two practices: (a) <italic>power sharing</italic>, or including representatives of all relevant social groups in the executive decision-making process, and (b) <italic>group autonomy</italic>, or allowing all relevant groups considerable say over the affairs of their own communities with minimal interference from the agents of the central state. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0010414011425341">Lijphart (2004)</xref> has laid out a succinct set of recommendations constitution writers should follow to fulfill these two prescriptions. At its core, these recommendations involve three fundamental choices: electoral system, regime type, and (de)centralization of authority.</p>
<p>On electoral system, Lijphart recommends closed-list PR with large district magnitudes, and he actively discourages the use of any system with majoritarian effects, including plurality rule or alternative vote in single-member districts. In the consociationalist view, one of the most likely causes of political violence is the consistent exclusion from power of any distinct group in society. From this perspective, PR is clearly preferable over alternatives because it best ensures that each group will gain political representation that approximates its share of the electorate. The more majoritarian the electoral system, the greater the potential disproportionality in the conversion of votes into seats, and the “less accurate and secure” minority representation will be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0010414011425341">Lijphart, 2004</xref>, p.100).</p>
<p>On regime type, Lijphart advocates a parliamentary executive over either a presidential or semipresidential one. The chief reason is the greater potential for executive power sharing in a parliamentary system. Presidentialism in this view has several major drawbacks. Unlike the collegial nature of decision making in parliamentary cabinets, executive power in presidential systems ultimately rests solely in the hands of the president. Presidential power is therefore not easily or credibly shared among multiple groups. Presidential elections are also necessarily majoritarian, with the same problems for the representation of diverse views. In addition, because of their separate origins in different constituencies, the executive and legislative branches in presidential systems can be prone to stalemate—a fact made worse by the typically rigid terms of office in such systems. In contrast, the executive in parliamentary systems is drawn from and serves at the confidence of the legislature, so similar stalemates are less likely. And when prime ministers or cabinets become unpopular or their policies are opposed by the legislature, the ability to call early elections allows such crises to be resolved through straightforward constitutional means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0010414011425341">Lijphart, 2004</xref>, pp. 101-104). For all of these reasons, the consociationalist school has consistently favored parliamentarism over presidential or semipresidential systems in divided societies.</p>
<p>Finally, advocates of consociationalism also view federalism quite positively, although here the recommendations are less concrete. Federalism is desirable mainly because it provides a means to give broad autonomy to individual groups and reduce the number and scope of issues that must be resolved at the central government level. Lijphart also advocates providing nonterritorial autonomy as in, for instance, state funding of different religious groups to teach primary education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0010414011425341">Lijphart, 2004</xref>, p. 105).</p>

<title>Counterarguments</title>
<p>Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0010414011425341">Lijphart (2004</xref>, p. 100) has asserted that there is a “consensus” in the scholarly community in favor of consociationalism in divided societies, we see outstanding questions in the literature about the relative efficacy of all three central recommendations of the consociationalist vision: PR over any majoritarian electoral system, parliamentarism over presidentialism or semipresidentialism, and federalism over unitary systems.</p>
<p>First, the view that electoral institutions should be designed to promote accurate representation of diverse views above all other considerations is not universally supported. There are several well-known drawbacks to the closed-list, large-magnitude PR system favored by the consociationalist school. One is that PR systems can facilitate the presence of extremist parties—for instance, antisystem parties that seek to overthrow the regime or single-issue parties that take rigid ideological stances far from the median voter in the electorate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0010414011425341">Powell, 1982</xref>, pp. 92-96). There has long been broad scholarly agreement that extremist parties, if present for an extended period of time in a country, threaten political stability (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0010414011425341">Duverger, 1959</xref>, pp. 419-20; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0010414011425341">Huntington, 1968</xref>, p. 412; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0010414011425341">Sartori, 1976</xref>, p. 140).</p>
<p>In addition, there is good reason to believe that PR increases the incentives for parties to pursue centrifugal campaign strategies—that is, the optimal strategy is to court voters whose views are relatively extreme rather than moderate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0010414011425341">Cox, 1990</xref>). Parties that represent only one ethnic group not only can gain representation in parliament in proportion to the size of that group but also have clear incentives to play up ethnicity and harden ethnic divisions at election time rather than to build cross-ethnic coalitions. For this reason, scholars such as Donald <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0010414011425341">Horowitz (2004)</xref> and Benjamin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0010414011425341">Reilly (2001)</xref> have argued instead for the use in divided societies of electoral systems with centripetal effects, such as the alternative vote in single-member districts. Such systems have the advantage, in this view, of rewarding candidates who take moderate positions and can attract support from a wide range of the electorate over extremists whose support may be deep but narrow.</p>
<p>Finally, PR along with power-sharing requirements can also lead to government paralysis in the face of difficult issues by increasing the need to include many parties in the governing coalition. There is a built-in bias in favor of the status quo in such systems: In general, the larger the number of parties with distinct policy positions in the coalition, the more difficult it will be to pass new legislation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0010414011425341">Tsebelis, 2002</xref>). Yet effective government is frequently the overriding concern in new, fragile democracies emerging from long periods of deep-seated social conflicts, such as in Iraq, Liberia, Ethiopia, Congo, Angola, or Mozambique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0010414011425341">Norris, 2008</xref>, p. 111). Thus, PR may actually hinder the consolidation of democracy in such countries by generating fragmented, polarized party systems that only increase the already steep challenge of governing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0010414011425341">Jarstad, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0010414011425341">Reilly &amp; Reynolds, 1999</xref>, pp. 29-31; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0010414011425341">Roeder &amp; Rothchild, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The scholarly “consensus” in favor of parliamentary regimes over presidential ones in divided societies is not clear-cut either (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0010414011425341">Norris, 2008</xref>, pp. 132-133). For instance, the variation of institutional powers among presidential regimes appears to be at least as important to the prospects for political stability as the difference between presidential and parliamentary regimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0010414011425341">Shugart &amp; Carey, 1992</xref>). Electoral laws that increase the likelihood of a propresidential majority in the legislature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0010414011425341">Jones, 1995</xref>) and that promote two-partism over multipartism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0010414011425341">Mainwaring, 1993</xref>) contribute greatly to the stability of presidential regimes. And presidentialism combined with more decentralized policy making appears to be no less prone to political violence than parliamentary systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0010414011425341">Cheibub &amp; Limongi, 2002</xref>). All these findings point in the same direction: that it is not presidentialism per se that creates problems for democracy, but presidentialism <italic>in combination with something else</italic>. In the right institutional combination, presidentialism appears to be just as viable a form of government as parliamentarism.</p>
<p>Moreover, presidentialism arguably has a couple of advantages over parliamentarism that are especially relevant in divided societies. When political parties are weak and the party system unstable, as is often true in new democracies, the president may be the only elected official with a truly national constituency. In such cases, presidents have much stronger incentives than their legislative counterparts to promote broad-based public goods. Given the consistent finding that ethnic heterogeneity is associated with lower levels of public goods provision (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0010414011425341">Alesina, Devleeschauwer, Easterly, Kurlat, &amp; Wacziarg, 2003</xref>), this potential benefit of presidentialism should not be overlooked. Presidentialism also provides some insurance against weak and fragmented party systems, often themselves a consequence of PR electoral rules, that contribute to immobilism and government instability in parliamentary regimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0010414011425341">Clark et al., 2009</xref>, pp. 744-746). In addition, some scholars have argued that long-term democratic stability is best facilitated not through power-sharing but instead through “power-dividing” institutions—those that “take many responsibilities out of the hands of government” and expand civil liberties, promote multiple majorities, and foster institutional checks and balances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0010414011425341">Roeder &amp; Rothchild, 2005</xref>, p. 15). In this view, presidentialism is preferable to the extent it ensures that the legislative and executive remain separately constituted, with both the incentives and capability to block the initiatives of the other.</p>
<p>Finally, the argument for federal arrangements in ethnically divided societies is by no means settled, either. Federalism is one of the key components of Lijphart’s institutional recommendations: He has argued, for instance, that in divided societies with geographically concentrated ethnic groups, “a federal system is undoubtedly an excellent way to provide autonomy for these groups” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0010414011425341">Lijphart, 2004</xref>, p. 104). Behind this assertion, however, is the assumption that group autonomy will improve the chances for democratic consolidation of the larger state—a claim that is far from self-evident. Several studies have suggested that adopting federal arrangements in these circumstances might actually increase secessionist tendencies, by reinforcing territorially based ethnic identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0010414011425341">Bunce &amp; Watts, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010414011425341">Hardgrave, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0010414011425341">Kymlicka, 1998</xref>). By creating subunits around regionally concentrated groups, federal arrangements give both legitimacy to their claims to be distinct and privileged in the larger state, and resources to act on aspirations for greater autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0010414011425341">Bunce, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0010414011425341">Hechter &amp; Okamoto, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0010414011425341">Leff, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0010414011425341">Roeder, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0010414011425341">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0010414011425341">Snyder, 2000</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0010414011425341">Clark et al., 2009</xref>, pp. 738-742). Decentralizing authority to subnational jurisdictions may also drive the rise of regional parties, whose presence in the party system appears to be strongly linked to the start of secessionist conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0010414011425341">Brancati, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, there are not obvious benefits of strong federal arrangements along ethnic lines if ethnic groups are geographically dispersed—that is, if citizens typically live in ethnically mixed communities. In such circumstances, the federal prescription may end up sparking or accelerating a kind of Balkan-style conflict (the partition of Indian states also comes to mind) with groups making competing claims over the same land and seeking to redraw borders to include clusters of coethnics, through violent means if necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010414011425341">Hardgrave, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0010414011425341">Lake &amp; Rothchild, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0010414011425341">Woodward, 1999</xref>).</p>

<title>Empirical Findings</title>
<p>In addition to the series of theoretical objections to the consociationalist logic described above, the empirical evidence either for or against the efficacy of any particular institutional arrangement in divided societies is inconsistent and quite limited as well. Studies that systematically test the causal claims of consociationalism—that the combination of PR rules, parliamentarism, and federalism will reduce or eliminate ethnic-based conflict in heterogeneous societies—are few and far between. Much more commonly, scholars present evidence from a handful of their favorite cases that support their preferred view.</p>
<p>The earliest attempt at systematic evaluation of consociationalist claims was by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0010414011425341">Powell (1982)</xref>, who attempted to measure correlations between institutional types and political violence, measured as riots and violent political deaths per year per country. Using observations from a set of 29 democracies from 1958 to 1976, Powell found a small but consistent positive relationship between political deaths and both presidentialism and majoritarian electoral rules, although only presidentialism was significant at the 10% level, and only for the decade 1958–1967. His results for riots did not show a clear pattern one way or the other, and he did not attempt to measure the association between federalism and political violence. Powell summarized his findings cautiously, asserting that “representational constitutions” tend to perform better in maintaining political order, but that “most of the advantages of the representational systems…seem to be artifacts of the location of these systems in more economically developed societies” (p. 71).</p>
<p>Although groundbreaking in both its ambition and technique, Powell’s study suffered from a number of drawbacks. For one, Powell used ordinary least squares to identify the relationships between counts of riots and deaths and various explanatory variables, when an events count model may have been more appropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0010414011425341">Krain, 1998</xref>). He also was limited by a small sample of just 29 countries observed over a period of no more than two decades. At the time Powell conducted his analysis, he identified only 20 countries that had been continuously democratic over the entire period 1958–1976, with another 9 having suffered strict limits to or the suspension of democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0010414011425341">Powell, 1982</xref>, p. 5). Although Powell’s sample was large enough to uncover some meaningful associations between measures, on the key variables of interest to us—the effects of institutions in divided societies—few countries featured the kinds of deep ethnic divisions for which consociationalist arrangements are supposed to have the greatest violence-reducing effects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0010414011425341">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the years after Powell’s study, the number of democracies in the world dramatically expanded, giving scholars a much larger set of countries and a longer period of observations on which to test his conjectures. As a result, a number of other comparative studies have attempted to test some of the consociationalist claims on a larger and more diverse set of cases. The most consistent finding in these studies is support for the proposition that PR reduces ethnic conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0010414011425341">Cohen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0010414011425341">Norris, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0010414011425341">Reynal-Querol, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0010414011425341">Saideman, Lanoue, Campenni, &amp; Stanton, 2002</xref>). By contrast, the evidence that presidentialism is associated with higher levels of ethnic conflict or that conflict is higher in unitary than federal states is more mixed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0010414011425341">Cohen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0010414011425341">Norris, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0010414011425341">Reynal-Querol, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0010414011425341">Saideman, Lanoue, Campenni, &amp; Stanton, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The methodology of most of these analyses is problematic in some way. For instance, both Cohen and Saideman et al. find that federalism and PR are associated with a lower incidence of rebellion but are actually positively related to violent protest. Moreover, both use the Minorities at Risk database, which introduces considerable sample bias into the analysis—religious, linguistic, and regional minorities are systematically excluded if they have been successfully integrated into the larger society (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0010414011425341">Norris, 2008</xref>, p. 41). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0010414011425341">Reynal-Querol (2002)</xref> avoids this problem by creating her own religious polarization index but tests the effects of consociationalist institutions on authoritarian as well as democratic cases.</p>
<p>Although Cohen, Saideman et al., and Reynal-Querol control for how divided societies are, their estimates test only whether there is an independent association of PR, parliamentarism, and federalism with higher levels of democracy, not whether in countries <italic>sharing a similar underlying social structure</italic> political conflict is systematically more violent under some arrangements than others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0010414011425341">2</xref></sup> In short, no study to date properly models the <italic>conditional</italic> nature of the consociationalist causal story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0010414011425341">Clark et al., 2009</xref>, p. 737). The central claim of the consociationalist school is that these institutional effects are <italic>not</italic> constant and that the violence-reducing effects of the institutions should be <italic>strongest</italic> in precisely those societies that suffer from the deepest divisions. Indeed, estimating additive models presumes that the effect of institutions on political outcomes will be constant across all countries, no matter how heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0010414011425341">Franzese &amp; Kam, 2007</xref>). The proper model specification for testing consociationalist theory, as stated by its proponents, is one that interacts social structure with each institutional variable.</p>
<p>In sum, past investigations of institutional effects in divided societies have been much like testing the effects of chemotherapy on the entire American population—not only on cancer patients but on healthy individuals as well! Showing that a certain chemotherapy treatment worsens health <italic>on average</italic> does not demonstrate that it should not be used on the subset of the population with malignancies. In the same way, showing a net positive association between majoritarianism, presidentialism, and unitarism and political violence does not demonstrate that these institutional forms are inappropriate for the subset of countries with highly divided societies. By not conditioning institutional variables on the ethnic structure of society, researchers in effect have performed the analysis on the wrong sets of cases. It is with this concern in mind that we turn to the model specification and description of our data.</p>

<title>Hypotheses</title>
<p>We are interested in the effect of political institutions (electoral system, regime type, and degree of centralization) on political violence as it varies across countries with different levels of ethnic diversity. Following past studies, we proxy for social divisions by using measures of ethnic fractionalization. Our hypotheses are as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-0010414011425341" list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1 (H1)</italic>: The marginal effect of PR on political violence is <italic>negative</italic> when ethnic fractionalization is high, but PR has no effect when ethnic fractionalization is low.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2 (H2)</italic>: The marginal effect of parliamentarism on political violence is <italic>negative</italic> when ethnic fractionalization is high, but parliamentarism has no effect when ethnic fractionalization is low.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3 (H3)</italic>: The marginal effect of federalism on political violence is <italic>negative</italic> when ethnic fractionalization is high, but federalism has no effect when ethnic fractionalization is low.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 4 (H4)</italic>: The marginal effect of consociationalism on political violence is <italic>negative</italic> when ethnic fractionalization is high, but consociationalism has no effect when ethnic fractionalization is low.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Note that all four hypotheses are about the effect of institutions conditioned on the level of ethnic fractionalization: We expect institutional differences to have the strongest violence-reducing effects in extremely ethnically heterogeneous societies, whereas we expect no effect in homogenous societies, simply because the consociationalist school does not address such societies.</p>

<p>Note in Model 2 that there is no interaction term between any of the institutions. Although some scholars have argued against the exclusion of these constituent terms without strong theoretical priors, their inclusion makes the interpretation vastly more complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0010414011425341">Brambor, Clark, &amp; Golder, 2006</xref>). We do concede, however, that their exclusion introduces bias into the model. We know from the party systems literature, for example, that the effects of electoral rules are conditioned by the presence of presidentialism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0010414011425341">Golder, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0010414011425341">Hicken, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0010414011425341">Neto &amp; Cox, 1997</xref>), and we have good reason to think they would differ in federal and nonfederal systems, too (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0010414011425341">Brancati, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0010414011425341">Chhibber &amp; Kollman, 2004</xref>). Nevertheless, although future research might usefully theorize and empirically test the interactions among the institutional variables, our current analysis still provides a substantial enrichment over previous studies.</p>

<title>Data and Variables Description</title>
<p>We test our model on a sample of 106 country-regimes in 100 countries between 1972 and 2003, where a regime is defined as a change in any of the institutional variables. Most of our data were drawn from Pippa Norris’s Democracy Time-Series Cross-National Dataset, which includes observations on a wide array of institutional, political, and economic variables for these countries. Because we do not expect the political institutions to take immediate effect, we dropped all country-regimes that appeared in the data set for less than four consecutive years. To identify democracies, we use the aggregate 20-point POLITY scale from the Polity IV data set, where 10 is the most democratic and −10 is the least democratic. We include all country-regime observations for which POLITY ≥ 5, though most of the findings are also substantively robust to a lower threshold of POLITY ≥ 0.</p>
<p>We test the same two measures for political violence as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0010414011425341">Powell (1982)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0010414011425341">Krain (1998)</xref>. First, we analyze the number of riots, defined as any violent demonstration or clash of more than 100 citizens involving the use of physical force (<italic>Riots</italic>). <italic>Riots</italic> is drawn from the Arthur Banks Cross-National Time-Series Database and is a count variable ranging from 0 to 26. Second, we consider the number of political deaths, taken from the Major Episodes of Political Violence (<italic>POLDEATH</italic>). This variable is composed of scaled death magnitudes from revolutionary wars, ethnic wars, politicides, and genocides. It is thus not an event count variable. In addition, we run the analysis on several other measures of political violence. Three are from the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset: internal armed conflict, defined as a civil war between the state and a group within its territory, without external intervention (<italic>Internal</italic>); minor conflicts numbering no more than 999 deaths per year regardless of external intervention (<italic>Minor</italic>); and major conflict numbering 1,000 or greater deaths per year, again regardless of external intervention (<italic>Major</italic>). We also employ four additional alternative measures of political violence from the Banks Dataset: revolts, defined as any illegal or forced change in the top governmental elite, any attempt at such a change, or any successful or unsuccessful armed rebellion whose aim is independence from the central government (<italic>Revol</italic>); guerrilla warfare, defined as any armed activity, sabotage, or bombings carried on by independent bands of citizens or irregular forces and aimed at the overthrow of the present regime (<italic>Guerrilla</italic>); government crises, defined as any rapidly developing situation that threatens to bring the downfall of the present regime, excluding revolts (<italic>Crisis</italic>); and finally a conflict index composed of the former three variables, plus weighted measures of assassinations, government purges, coups, strikes, and antigovernment demonstrations (<italic>Conflict</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0010414011425341">3</xref></sup> These measures give us a good sense of the effect of different institutional types on various kinds of political conflict, from minor episodes involving a handful of injuries or deaths to major episodes of prolonged and deadly violence.</p>
<p>Our measures of ethnic fractionalization are also taken from various sources for robustness. The results we present in this article use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0010414011425341">Fearon’s (2003)</xref> measure of ethnic fractionalization. However, our findings are robust to the use of another popular measure of ethnic fractionalization, that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0010414011425341">Alesina et al. (2003)</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0010414011425341">4</xref></sup> The use of this measure of fractionalization is admittedly deficient in that it assumes that a country with more ethnic groups equates to deeper levels of ethnic division. Some studies have argued that it is actually countries that are bipolarized between two equally sized groups that are the most deeply divided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0010414011425341">Montalvo &amp; Reynal-Querol, 2005</xref>). Others have disregarded the number of groups completely and pointed to the degree that ethnicity crosscuts other socially salient cleavages, such as religion, geographic region, and income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0010414011425341">Selway, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0010414011425341">Selway &amp; Gubler, 2008</xref>). We recognize this critique, but because of the enormity of this subject must regrettably leave it to future research.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0010414011425341">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our institutional variables come from several sources. Electoral rules are coded by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (2004) as PR, which takes the highest value of 3, majoritarian (1), or combined (2). Combined regimes are varied but incorporate elements of both majoritarian and PR rules, hence the intermediary coding. For robustness, we estimate the model separately using two different dichotomous variables: the first takes on a value of 1 if the electoral system is pure PR (else 0), and the second takes on a value of 1 if it is a pure majoritarian system (else 0). Our results do not change substantively (and rarely significantly) using either of these variables. Our measure for parliamentarism is taken from the Banks Dataset and is binary: 1 for parliamentary regimes, else 0. We code semipresidential regimes to their nearest variant; the results we report are robust as well to an alternative coding in which all regimes with a directly elected president are included in the presidential category. Our measure of federalism comes from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0010414011425341">Watts (1999)</xref>; we modify it by recoding all hybrid federations as nonfederal. Federal systems are coded as 1, and all else as 0; the results are weaker but in the same substantive direction if hybrid federations are included as federal.</p>
<p>We also control for several variables common in past studies. First, we take the log of a country’s population (<italic>logpop</italic>): larger population sizes have been linked with higher odds of political violence. We also take the log of GDP per capita (<italic>log</italic><italic>GDP_</italic><italic>UN</italic>) as a measure of a country’s level of development: the wealthier a country, the lower the likelihood of political violence. Next, we include a measure of democracy (<italic>polity2</italic>) relying on the Polity IV data set: Since higher values indicate greater openness and institutionalization of elections and more respect for human rights, we expect a negative coefficient on <italic>polity2</italic>. Finally, we include a lag of the dependent variable (<italic>lagpv</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0010414011425341">6</xref></sup></p>

<title>Estimation Strategy</title>
<p>Given that we have several dependent variables, we estimate a number of models. For Riots, we begin by following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0010414011425341">Krain (1998)</xref> and estimating a negative binomial event count model. The standard Poisson event count model assumes that episodes of political violence are independent and are equally likely to occur at any point in time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0010414011425341">King, 1989</xref>). With political violence, we think it more likely that the probability of an episode occurring increases after an initial outbreak, following a kind of contagion dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0010414011425341">Krain, 1998</xref>). The chi-square tests on the probability of the alpha term equaling zero, which the standard Poisson model assumes, have <italic>p</italic> values less than .05, indicating that the negative binomial model is preferred.</p>
<p>However, the negative binomial model is unable to account for the stationary and/or slow-moving nature of the independent variables: Our institutional variables rarely change, and our measure of ethnic fractionalization does not change at all. In addition, then, we estimate a time-series multiple regression with a lagged dependent variable using the fixed effects with vector decomposition (FEVD) estimator suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0010414011425341">Plumper and Troeger (2007)</xref>. Last, we compare both negative binomial models and the FEVD model with the standard random effects model. Nearly all of our results are substantively the same regardless of which estimation strategy we employ. However, we are inclined to think that the FEVD estimates are preferable since the difference between the negative binomial and random effects models is relatively minor and FEVD is able to adjust for stationary values in some of the independent variables. For <italic>POLDEATH</italic> and <italic>Conflict</italic>, which are not count variables, we estimate using both the random effects and FEVD, again finding very little difference between these results. For the remaining variables, which are all binary (<italic>Internal</italic>, <italic>Minor</italic>, <italic>Major</italic>, <italic>Revol</italic>, <italic>Guerrilla</italic>, <italic>Crisis</italic>), we estimate a time-series logit regression with random effects (an equivalent FEVD estimator for binary dependent variables has not yet been developed). Unless otherwise noted, the marginal effects plots we present in the next section are drawn using the FEVD estimations.</p>

<title>Analysis Without Interactive Effects</title>
<p>We begin by discussing the results from an additive model using our data set, which is more comprehensive than most previous studies in the number of years and country coverage. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0010414011425341">Table 1</xref> presents the results from the random effects, negative binomial, and FEVD estimations for both the political deaths and riots dependent variables. Similar to the findings of Powell, Krain, and others, the coefficient on population size is positive and significant whereas that on country wealth is negative and significant: Larger countries experience more political deaths and riots, whereas wealthier countries experience fewer, all else equal. The level of democracy as measured by the <italic>polity2</italic> variable is not significant in the majority of the models. Nevertheless, the sign is negative in five of the six, and in the FEVD estimations this relationship is highly significant, so there is some support here for the expectation that more democratic countries experience fewer deaths and riots. Finally, ethnic fractionalization (EF) is significant and has the expected sign in four of the six models. In particular, a higher EF score appears to be consistently associated with more political deaths. The effect on riots is less clear, with EF negative (though statistically insignificant) in two of the three models.</p>

<p>It is harder to draw consistent inferences from the institutional variable estimates. On the effects of PR electoral rules, only in the FEVD estimation for riots (Model 6) is PR negative and significant. This result is consistent with past findings that proportional electoral rules are associated with lower levels of political violence, although the lack of any clear relationship between PR and political deaths is rather surprising. The estimates of parliamentarism’s effects paint a similarly muddled picture. Only two of the estimates are significant, one (Model 2) for political deaths and one (Model 4) for riots. Furthermore, they have the opposite signs: Parliamentary regimes experience fewer political deaths but more riots, all else equal. Federalism appears to have the same contradictory relationship with political deaths and riots: The FEVD estimates show deaths (Model 3) to be less common in federal regimes but riots (Model 6) to be more common.</p>
<p>Overall, the additive model gives us conflicting results, both in comparison with previous empirical work and between these two measures of political violence. Were we to stop here, however, these data would appear to provide at least weak support for the consociationalist model: Of the significant estimates, parliamentarism and federalism are associated with fewer political deaths (although more riots), and PR is associated with fewer riots.</p>

<sec id="section12-0010414011425341">
<title>The Marginal Effect of PR</title>
<p>We turn now to the multiplicative models, which capture the differing effect of political institutions across the range of values of EF. Following recent convention, we proceed directly to analyzing the marginal effects plots for each political institution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0010414011425341">Brambor et al., 2006</xref>). We report the marginal effects calculated from the FEVD estimations here; the alternative estimations and tables of coefficients can be found in the supplementary appendix (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dvn.iq.harvard.edu/dvn/dv/joelselway">http://dvn.iq.harvard.edu/dvn/dv/joelselway</ext-link>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0010414011425341">Figure 1</xref> shows the marginal effect of PR on the number of political deaths. The solid line represents the marginal effect, and the two dashed lines represent the 95% confidence intervals. Statistical significance is indicated by <italic>both</italic> dashed lines falling either above or below the zero line. Thus, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0010414011425341">Figure 1</xref>, we see that the entire solid line falls above the axis, indicating that PR increases the number of political deaths. This positive effect, however, is not statistically significant at high values of EF (the horizontal axis) because around the right section of the solid line the upper confidence interval falls above the zero line whereas the lower falls below. As we move to the left of the plot, the marginal effect becomes positive and statistically significant. At about EF = 0.65 and lower, PR is positively associated with political violence. Note, however, that the magnitude of this effect is not large. Political deaths is a scaled variable ranging from 0 (no political deaths) in the large majority of observations to a high of 10.5 (the most political deaths) in Sri Lanka in 1989. Thus, the substantive effect of switching to PR, at its maximum, is around 0.1 on this scale. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0010414011425341">Figure 1</xref> does not offer support for H1, which stated that PR should decrease political violence in ethnically diverse societies. In fact, we find no significant effect of PR in the most diverse societies, and somewhat surprising, a small but positive effect in the least diverse societies.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0010414011425341">Figure 2</xref> again shows the marginal effect of PR, this time on the number of riots. This result, too, is at odds with consociationalist theory. When EF is very high, the marginal effect of PR is again positive but insignificant, though at medium to high levels, PR has a negative and insignificant effect. In contrast, PR has the opposite effect on the number of riots when EF is low: PR is negatively associated with riots. So here we have the interesting finding that PR does indeed appear to reduce riots—but only in homogeneous countries! By testing for marginal effects, we have uncovered a possible reason why previous researchers have found evidence in favor of PR: Most of their cases were relatively homogeneous countries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0010414011425341">7</xref></sup></p>

<p>The measures for political deaths and riots paint a similar picture in ethnically diverse societies, although there is mixed evidence of PR’s effect in violence reduction in homogenous societies. Moreover, the following variables gave consistently statistically insignificant results from which we can draw no concrete conclusions: <italic>Internal</italic>, <italic>Minor</italic>, <italic>Major</italic>, and <italic>Revol</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0010414011425341">8</xref></sup> All these variables capture the worst kinds of political violence—full-scale civil wars. It appears that no type of electoral rule is better in reducing these types of events. However, the effect of PR on the other dependent variables—<italic>Guerrilla</italic>, <italic>crisis</italic>, and <italic>conflict</italic>—all provide evidence that political violence increases with the use of PR in ethnically diverse societies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0010414011425341">9</xref></sup> In sum, we find no evidence whatsoever for the consociationalist claim that PR reduces violence in ethnically fractionalized societies; indeed, the evidence leans slightly toward majoritarian electoral systems performing better in these settings. Moreover, we find mixed evidence that PR is better in homogeneous societies.</p>

<sec id="section13-0010414011425341">
<title>The Marginal Effect of Parliamentarism</title>
<p>Turning next to the effect of parliamentarism on political violence, we again see more similar results between political deaths and riots. The effect of parliamentarism on political deaths is positive and statistically significant at high levels of EF (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0010414011425341">Figure 3</xref>), precisely the opposite of what consociationalist theory predicts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0010414011425341">10</xref></sup> At the very highest levels, moving from a presidential system to a mixed system or from a mixed system to a parliamentary system will result in 0.4 more deaths per year. Going from a pure presidential to a pure parliamentary system, then, leads to almost 1 more death per year, on average.</p>

</fig>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0010414011425341">Figure 4</xref>, the solid line falling above the axis across all levels of EF again indicates that parliamentarism leads to more riots. However, this effect is not statistically significant at the highest levels of EF. Nevertheless, the effect is still positive and significant at medium to high levels of EF, so would seem to be harmful in countries such as Belgium (0.508), Burkina Faso (0.667), Fiji (0.547), Ghana (0.611), Guatemala (0.486), Indonesia (0.623), Latvia (0.541), Malaysia (0.635), Mali (0.681), Pakistan (0.511), and Senegal (0.655). Moreover, parliamentarism leads to more riots in the most homogenous countries.</p>

</fig>
<p>The other variables (<italic>Internal</italic>, <italic>Minor</italic>, <italic>Guerrilla</italic>, <italic>Crisis</italic>, and <italic>Conflict</italic>) all consistently show the same positive and significant marginal effect of parliamentarism on political violence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0010414011425341">11</xref></sup> Thus, we seem to have much stronger evidence against consociationalist theory in the case of parliamentarism.</p>

<sec id="section14-0010414011425341">
<title>The Marginal Effect of Federalism</title>
<p>Next, we turn to the effect of federalism on political violence. Neither Powell nor Krain tests this political institution’s effect, and others who do have found very mixed results (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0010414011425341">Brancati, 2006</xref>). We find highly mixed results for EF. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0010414011425341">Figure 5a</xref>, the marginal effect of federalism on political deaths is positive and significant at high levels of EF. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0010414011425341">Figure 5b</xref>, the marginal effect of federalism on riots is negative and significant at high levels of fractionalization. Federalism also has a significant effect on political violence in both figures at low levels of EF, though again the effects take on the opposite sign.</p>
<fig id="fig5-0010414011425341" position="float">
<label>Figure 5.</label>
<caption><p>Marginal effect of federalism on <italic>Political_Deaths</italic> and <italic>Riots</italic> across levels of ethnic fractionalization</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0010414011425341-fig5.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The other measures of violence provide mixed results as well. For <italic>Internal</italic> and <italic>Minor</italic>, federalism is associated with less likelihood of civil war and battle deaths at high levels of EF. For <italic>Major</italic>, <italic>Revol</italic>, <italic>Guerrilla</italic>, and <italic>Crisis</italic>, the effect is not significant, although the direction is the same. But for <italic>Conflict</italic>, the effect of federalism on conflict is positive, significant, and increasing as EF rises. One possible explanation for the mixed results on federalism is that they depend on the geographic distribution of ethnic groups. Federalism might appease ethnic groups that live in their own region by awarding groups some degree of local autonomy. However, where many ethnic groups are dispersed around the country, federalism likely has no effect. This proposition could be easily tested in future studies using some measure of ethno-geographic segregation as an additional modifying variable. Additional avenues to explore include further distinctions among various types of federalism, both fiscal and functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0010414011425341">Hooghe &amp; Marks, 2003</xref>), as well as the intriguing possibility that presidentialism may also make the emergence of regional parties less likely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0010414011425341">Brancati, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0010414011425341">
<title>The Marginal Effect of Consociationalism</title>
<p>Last, we present our results for the test of H4, using various composite consociationalism variables. This test is arguably the best assessment of the core consociationalist argument, which is that the effects of the recommended institutions should be most visible in combination with one another. There are only four countries in our data set that employ PR, parliamentarism, and strong federalism together, for a total of 102 observations: Belgium, Spain, Austria, and South Africa.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0010414011425341">12</xref></sup> If we take a more expansive definition of federalism, the number grows to seven: the Netherlands, Portugal, and Italy are also included. As a third alternative, we use an additive index of consociationalism, which ranges from 0 if it has none of the consociational institutions to 3 if it has all three.</p>
<p>The two main dependent variables, political deaths and riots, give exactly opposite results: Consociationalism increases political deaths at high levels of EF but decreases riots (marginal plots in the supplementary appendix). None of the results using the other dependent variables are statistically significant and give varying directions of the marginal effects. However, for the composite <italic>Conflict</italic> index, the marginal effect of consociationalism is positive and highly significant at high levels of EF. This seems to accord with the results for <italic>Riots</italic>, though we can draw only weak conclusions from this analysis.</p>
<p>Next, we analyze all countries with just PR and parliamentarism in combination because the consociationalist predictions are most concrete for these two features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0010414011425341">Figure 6</xref>). Here we see that consociationalism has a positive effect on both political deaths and riots at high levels of EF, though this relationship is not statistically significant. At medium to high levels of EF, consociationalism has a positive and significant effect on both political deaths and riots.</p>
<fig id="fig6-0010414011425341" position="float">
<label>Figure 6.</label>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0010414011425341-fig6.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>We can thus conclude that, federalism aside, consociational institutions are associated with more political violence in highly divided societies. Including federalism in the analysis, the results are inconclusive, though they also do not rule out majoritarian institutions as appropriate for divided societies.</p>
<p>Finally, we test the effect of PR and presidentialism in combination. Although this is not a test of consociationalism, it seems appropriate to compare how presidentialism in combination with electoral rules fares in this analysis. As noted above, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0010414011425341">Jones (1995)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0010414011425341">Mainwaring (1993)</xref> have argued that presidentialism is more stable when electoral laws increase the likelihood of a propresidential majority in the legislature and that promote two-partism over multipartism. This indicates that presidentialism should reduce the potential for conflict in combination with majoritarian electoral rules. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0010414011425341">Figure 7</xref> indicates that the dynamics Jones and Mainwaring present are correct, but only conditional on the ethnic diversity of the country in question. The combination of PR and presidentialism does indeed seem to increase the numbers of both riots and political deaths, but only in ethnically diverse countries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0010414011425341">13</xref></sup> In ethnically homogenous countries the evidence is mixed. Though we do not show the marginal effects plots in this article, presidentialism in combination with majoritarianism reduces conflict in ethnically diverse countries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0010414011425341">14</xref></sup> This finding provides additional support for consociationalism’s competitors, including the majoritarian-flavored “centripetalism” arguments of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0010414011425341">Horowitz (1993)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0010414011425341">Reilly (2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0010414011425341">2002</xref>) and the “power-dividing” approach advocated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0010414011425341">Roeder and Rothchild (2005)</xref>.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The results presented in the previous section provide little support for consociationalist theory. To summarize, we have four key findings. First, PR is generally associated with <italic>higher</italic> levels of violence, in contrast to what most other studies have found. Second, presidentialism is associated with <italic>lower</italic> levels of political violence, again in contrast to previous studies. Third, the results on federalism are inconclusive and suggest that federalism in isolation has inconsistent effects on political violence. Last, the combination of consociationalist institutions is associated with <italic>higher</italic> levels of political violence. Overall, then, these results provide no support for Lijphart’s central institutional recommendations.</p>
<p>A secondary finding is that the marginal effect of institutions on political violence is zero in ethically homogenous societies. This result is understandable given the emphasis scholars have placed on institutional design in societies with the <italic>most</italic> serious ethnic divisions. However, empirically it is far from expected since past quantitative studies relied mostly on observations from homogenous societies and did not distinguish between levels of ethnic homogeneity in their models.</p>
<p>We draw three main conclusions from these results. First and foremost, however convincing power sharing and group autonomy might sound in the abstract, there is little empirical evidence that the consociationalist package of institutions is able to deliver better performance <italic>in the societies that are most at risk</italic>. We do not attempt here to provide a full alternative to the consociationalist project. Indeed, from our perspective, consociationalism has the advantage of a clear set of guiding principles and an explicit link between these and institutional recommendations. Our objection here is primarily an empirical one: Its central recommendations do not appear to be supported by real-world observations. At a minimum, taking presidentialism and majoritarian electoral systems completely off the menu of options for constitution writers, as Lijphart advocates, appears unjustified to us. Indeed, our results suggest that in the most divided societies—the “sickest patients”—these institutions perform <italic>better</italic> on average at reducing violence and maintaining political stability than the alternatives.</p>
<p>Our findings also point to the continuing need to consider social context in devising institutional recommendations. Future work needs to allow for the possibility that the modifying effects of institutions may be quite different for some social cleavage structures than others. We all would also benefit greatly from more refined measures of “divided society,” such as how ethnic groups are geographically dispersed and whether they are crosscut by other salient social divisions, such as income or religion. In this analysis, we followed convention by using Ethno-Linguistic Fractionalization (ELF) as a proxy for social diversity. Arguably, however, the severity of social divisions is not well captured by the measures of ELF in use.</p>
<p>Third, there is a clear need for additional work on how the effects of individual institutions themselves might be conditional. We found evidence that presidentialism was beneficial in divided societies, but only when paired with a majoritarian electoral system, and that the consociational package of PR, parliamentarism, and federalism together did not reduce political violence. But we did not attempt to model the interactive effects of other institutional packages. We leave these challenges for future work.</p>

<p>The association of presidentialism with greater political violence, for instance, rests on observations of only 6 countries, 3 of which were democratic for only part of the relevant period.
