<p><italic>The Television Entrepreneurs</italic> explores the way business entertainment formats have contributed to change in both the public perception of business as well as business’ role in public life. Focusing primarily on case studies from Britain, Raymond Boyle and Lisa Kelly’s work explores two dimensions of the rise of business entertainment. The first part of the book considers the way television discursively produces entrepreneurship and entrepreneurs through “factual entertainment” such as <italic>Kitchen Nightmares</italic> and <italic>Dragon’s Den</italic>. The second part of the book delves into audience studies and seeks to understand the ways viewers engage and interact with these business entertainment shows. How is meaning invested in these programs by viewers, and what encourages the audience to engage with these programs?</p>
<p>The authors deftly combine the two parts, transitioning from the larger implications of televisual production to specifics regarding how such production elements are interpreted by audiences. Using focus group studies, Boyle and Kelly explore how and why individuals watch shows like <italic>Kitchen Nightmares</italic>; is it for the drama, the education, the management of affect, or some combination of all of these? The <italic>vox pop</italic> interludes offer insights into how particular audience members view (or, in many cases, do not view) particular programs and what they take away from them. Far from simplistic audience engagement, televisual showcases of entrepreneurs craft an image and a narrative of business acumen that shifts the public understanding of capitalism and introduces the cultural heroes upon which the system relies. <italic>The Television Entrepreneurs</italic> is an important step in the process of understanding how the culture of capital is reified and repaired.</p>
