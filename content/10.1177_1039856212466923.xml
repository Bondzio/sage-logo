<sec id="section1-1039856212466923">
<title>Objectives:</title>
<p>Most postgraduate training for clinicians in Australia and New Zealand regarding mental health legislation focuses on the relevant Mental Health Acts (MHAs) rather than the broader principles of mental health law. Key concepts include treatment in the least restrictive environment, voluntary access to mental health services, treatability, reciprocity and due process. Lack of awareness of these principles may result in a more risk-averse interpretation of MHAs, which is inconsistent with the spirit of mental health law and the promotion of human rights. The aim of this paper is to present some fundamental principles of mental health law, which are essential to proper clinical application of MHAs, and to demonstrate why they should form part of the curriculum for psychiatry training and continuing professional development for psychiatrists.</p>

<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>A sound understanding of the principles of mental health law is essential for all clinicians who may be enacting aspects of MHAs. This provides the necessary platform to safeguard human rights and optimise the care of people with a mental illness.</p>

<p>Competent understanding and interpretation of the Mental Health Act (MHA) in a particular jurisdiction is an expectation of clinicians in mental health, particularly doctors. However, it is an area of practice where clinicians and trainees in particular may lack knowledge and confidence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212466923">1</xref></sup> Psychiatry trainees may gain knowledge about how to appropriately apply the MHA in practice via the master–apprenticeship model, but this experience is not universal. In Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, for example, there is no requirement for psychiatry trainees or doctors in general to formally demonstrate either training or knowledge of mental health law before they are able to enact aspects of respective MHAs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212466923">2</xref></sup> Eastman has argued that the UK Royal College of Psychiatrists and British Medical Association should remedy this by recognising ‘that the right to infringe a patient’s civil liberties must be matched by a duty to maintain detailed knowledge of the enabling law’ (p.44).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212466923">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is, however, more rigorous and consistent training of non-medical accredited persons under the MHA (2007) in New South Wales (NSW), Australia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856212466923">3</xref></sup> The NSW Institute of Psychiatry conducts a training programme designed to provide a ‘legal and clinical framework within which accredited persons exercise their duties and responsibilities’ (p.1).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856212466923">4</xref></sup> The program is mandatory for recognition as an accredited person under the Act, and involves face-to-face as well as on-line education, examination and periodic reaccreditation.</p>
<sec id="section3-1039856212466923">
<title>International context</title>
<p>Human rights and mental health are inextricably linked. For example, breaches of human rights harm mental health and coercive mental health practices infringe human rights.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856212466923">5</xref></sup> Australia is a signatory to international charters regarding human rights.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856212466923">6</xref></sup> In recognition of this important relationship, the Fourth National Mental Health Plan (2009–2014) refers to the need for regular review of mental health legislation to ensure compliance with relevant international and national obligations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856212466923">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) has outlined the 10 basic principles of mental health care law.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856212466923">8</xref></sup> These principles were developed following a comparative analysis of mental health legislation in 45 countries (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1039856212466923">Table 1</xref>). The Council of Europe developed similar recommendations to protect the dignity and human rights of people with a mental illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856212466923">9</xref></sup> These international agreements were developed to define central aspects of mental health law and to provide guidance for their practical implementation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856212466923">8</xref></sup> Responsibility is clearly placed upon health professionals and governments to adapt laws and allocate resources in order to enact the principles contained within these documents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856212466923">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856212466923">9</xref></sup> Therefore, they have direct implications for clinical practice.</p>

<p>Given the close relationship between mental health and human rights, and the legacy of human rights abuses in people with mental illness, further guidance for clinicians may be obtained from international documents concerned with human rights. For example, central principles of mental health care are promulgated by the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights (UNHCHR).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856212466923">10</xref></sup> Additionally, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was developed to ‘promote, protect and ensure’ (p.3) the human rights and fundamental freedoms of people with disabilities, including long term mental impairments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856212466923">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Combined, these essential principles may be usefully applied to clinical practice, particularly in the interpretation of MHAs. Central concepts, such as the right to self-determination, access to representation and availability of review, appear to be better understood and enacted in Australia and New Zealand and are discussed elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856212466923">12</xref></sup> Particularly relevant concepts which may be less well understood by clinicians include care in the least restrictive manner, voluntary access to mental health services, treatability, reciprocity and due process. Each of these legal concepts will be discussed further with reference to common clinical situations.</p>

<sec id="section4-1039856212466923">
<title>The least restrictive environment</title>
<p>The central principles of mental health care promulgated by the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights (UNHCHR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856212466923">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856212466923">11</xref></sup> and the WHO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856212466923">8</xref></sup> are embodied within MHAs in Australia and New Zealand. These principles maintain that individuals with mental illness have the right to receive health care in accordance with the same standards as other ill persons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856212466923">11</xref></sup> Moreover, every person has the right to be treated in the least restrictive environment and ‘every effort’ should be made to avoid involuntary admission.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856212466923">10</xref></sup> This is a fundamental tenet of all MHAs in Australia and New Zealand. The NSW MHA (2007), for example, states that ‘any restriction on the liberty of patients and other people with a mental illness or mental disorder and any interference with their rights, dignity and self-respect is to be kept to the minimum necessary in the circumstances’ (Section 68).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856212466923">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite this clear emphasis, it has been recognised that clinicians may utilise MHAs to detain patients involuntarily through fear of legal ramifications rather than in the interests of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856212466923">13</xref></sup> The clinical judgement of risk is the main concern here. Several authors have emphasised that the justification of involuntary hospitalisation or treatment on the basis of serious risk of harm is problematic given the unreliability of risk assessment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856212466923">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856212466923"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856212466923"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1039856212466923">17</xref></sup> Moreover, notwithstanding the present preoccupation with risk assessment, there is little research evidence that this approach is effective in reducing risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856212466923">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1039856212466923">17</xref></sup> Potential disadvantages of the excessive focus on risk assessment include deterring people from seeking help in the future, an emphasis on containment and control rather than care, and reinforcing negative stereotypes that people with a mental illness are dangerous.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856212466923">13</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1039856212466923">
<title>Voluntary access to MH services</title>
<p>An emphasis on voluntary access to mental health services is another key principle promoted by the UNHCHR to improve the care of persons with mental illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856212466923">10</xref></sup> For example, Principle 15.3. states ‘Every patient not admitted involuntarily shall have the right to leave the mental health facility at any time unless criteria for his or her retention as an involuntary patient, as set forth in Principle 16, apply, and he or she shall be informed of that right’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856212466923">10</xref></sup> Many clinicians, however, will be aware of situations where it has been communicated that a patient should be admitted voluntarily but ‘scheduled’ if they want or try to leave. This directly contravenes the spirit of mental health law, makes a mockery of voluntary status and represents an abuse of the patient’s trust. The WHO, UNHCHR and European Council all clearly stipulate that involuntary detention of a person with a mental illness should always be the option of last resort, and only when specific criteria are met.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856212466923">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856212466923"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856212466923">10</xref></sup> A more considered recommendation given the fluctuating nature of mental distress, would therefore be to ‘admit voluntary, but reassess if he/she wants to leave’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1039856212466923">
<title>Treatability</title>
<p>Prior to the availability of effective treatments for mental illness, the focus of MHAs was containment rather than treatment of people of ‘unsound mind’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856212466923">14</xref></sup> In Australia and New Zealand, MHAs do not stipulate that clinicians must consider whether there is a treatment available which is likely to alleviate symptoms of a mental illness or prevent deterioration in a patient. However, this has been the subject of some debate in the UK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856212466923">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856212466923">18</xref></sup> and is a pertinent principle for clinicians to consider. There is a similar dilemma here to assessing risk, as the implication is that the clinician will be able to foresee the outcome of treatment. Millard argues that making a prognosis in medicine is always uncertain, particularly in some conditions such as psychopathic disorder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856212466923">18</xref></sup> He emphasises that an individual’s behaviour is situation-sensitive and that a clinician cannot predict with any accuracy or control the situations in which individuals find themselves.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856212466923">18</xref></sup> In the UK at least, the government has stated that concerns about risk would take precedence over the treatability criteria in legislation to allow for the involuntary detention of those with ‘dangerous and severe personality disorders’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1039856212466923">19</xref></sup> Nonetheless, it may be difficult to satisfy the treatability principle of mental health law in the absence of an effective treatment (e.g. for particular personality disorders) and when treatment is unavailable (e.g. due to lack of resources).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856212466923">14</xref></sup> A ‘treatability test’ has been proposed as a means of ensuring that this key principle is upheld.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212466923">2</xref></sup> Accordingly, clinicians should evaluate the evidence of the effectiveness of treatment, that is, that it is available and will relieve symptoms of the disorder or prevent further deterioration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212466923">2</xref></sup> Clinicians should also consider treatability in cases where it is evident that past coercion and involuntary treatment has proven ineffective for the individual<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1039856212466923">20</xref></sup> and that it may be demoralising or even traumatic to subject the individual to repeated forced intervention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1039856212466923">
<title>Reciprocity</title>
<p>The principle of reciprocity may be used to match an individual’s right to self-determination with the duty to protect society from danger or nuisance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212466923">2</xref></sup> This principle states that if resources for treatment are inadequate, a patient’s civil liberties may not be denied for the purposes of treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212466923">2</xref></sup> Therefore, the legal basis for compulsorily detaining and treating patients must be balanced by the right to treatment. This principle is therefore linked with that of treatability – having a mental illness which is amenable to treatment and the resources to access effective treatment. Thus, in order to ethically justify involuntary treatment, the patient must receive benefit from that treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1039856212466923">21</xref></sup> Again, this fundamental principle balancing autonomy and social justice, although not an absolute legal requirement of most MHAs, should be considered by clinicians in order to protect the human rights of people with mental illness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1039856212466923">
<title>Due process</title>
<p>Due process refers to the right to have decisions regarding the deprivation of liberty determined by a court of law.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1039856212466923">22</xref></sup> It relies upon having clear and fair rules to guide objective decision making to protect people from arbitrary decisions made by state authorities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1039856212466923">23</xref></sup> However, concerns have been raised about the ‘quasi-judicial’ nature of magistrate and mental health review tribunal hearings and their tendency to ‘rubber stamp’ the opinions of psychiatrists.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1039856212466923">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1039856212466923">25</xref></sup> Due process may not be uniformly applied by mental health review tribunals, thus denying patients the right to independent hearings, another key requirement of mental health law.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1039856212466923">25</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1039856212466923">
<title>Administrative law</title>
<p>An additional consideration in relation to due process and procedural fairness is whether the rules of administrative law are followed. In the context of MHAs, the relevant principles of administrative decision making maintain that a decision maker entrusted with statutory discretion must exercise that power independently and must not be influenced or instructed by a third party. This includes situations where a decision maker feels obliged to make a particular choice because of another’s (such as a work colleague) assessment in relation to the clinical situation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856212466923">4</xref></sup> Even though the other person may not have explicitly directed that such an approach should be taken, the decision-maker may still feel obliged to choose a particular course.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856212466923">4</xref></sup> Influencing someone else’s decision-making in this way is known as acting under dictation. It is not uncommon for psychiatry trainees, especially when inexperienced, to feel pressured by colleagues and supervisors into making decisions that they may not agree with or understand in relation to use of powers under the MHA. Psychiatry trainees and other mental health professionals working in general hospitals may also instruct non-psychiatric doctors to complete ‘schedules’ invoking aspects of the relevant MHA (for an example, see Ryan and Callaghan).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1039856212466923">26</xref></sup> Although a fundamental part of the education of accredited persons in NSW,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856212466923">4</xref></sup> the rules of administrative decision making are not generally taught during the training of psychiatry registrars in Australia and New Zealand. Perhaps few trainees would recognise these examples as breaches of their obligations under the principles of Administrative Law. Indeed, many trainees would expect a consultant psychiatrist to instruct them on what to do after presenting a case. The clinical situation in which it may be communicated (and even documented) that a patient should be ‘scheduled if tries to leave’ also constitutes acting under dictation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1039856212466923" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>There is an expectation from health care colleagues that psychiatrists and other professionals working in mental health have a thorough understanding of the relevant MHA and the principles of mental health law from which it is derived. However, this knowledge is inconsistently and largely informally acquired by psychiatry trainees. Deficiencies in the way in which this legal information is currently taught may lead to fundamental breaches in human rights and misuse of MHAs. International charters for human rights in general and the rights of people with mental illness provide useful frameworks for clinicians. Upholding key concepts such as care in the least restrictive environment, voluntary access to mental health services, and due process are essential for the provision of ethically sound mental health care. Although not required by law, it would also be desirable for clinicians to consider other factors such as treatability and reciprocity when applying aspects of MHAs.</p>
<p>Education about the principles of mental health care law should therefore form part of the curriculum of every formal Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP)-accredited education programme for psychiatry training. Additionally, the RANZCP should consider mandating that psychiatrists update this area of knowledge regularly as part of the requirements for continuing professional development. This is particularly important as such formal education is already occurring with non-medical mental health professionals, completing accredited persons’ training in NSW, who are taught and regularly re-examined on these principles and their application to clinical practice.</p>
