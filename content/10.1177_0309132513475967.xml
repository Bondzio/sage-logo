<title>Commentary 1</title>
<p>The most striking pattern of late 20th and early 21st century migration is of young women from the so-called global south (or ‘Third World’), leaving their families behind to work as low paid caregivers in wealthier parts of the world. Some women experience a circular pattern of repeated migration to the same destination country and home again, while others migrate ‘on and on’ looking for ever-better destinations in terms of pay and living and working conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132513475967">Liebelt, 2010</xref>). Among those who have worked in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and regions of the Middle East, Canada is often spoken of as a dream destination. Unlike Asian countries that offer only two-year visas and explicitly prevent domestic workers from being anything other than temporary migrants, Canada’s Live-In Caregiver Program (LCP) offers a path to permanent residence and citizenship. Filipinos who go to work in Canada are seen by other migrant workers not only as likely to be more educated and experienced, but also as extraordinarily fortunate, akin to having won the lottery. They have a chance at permanent residence; they can eventually bring their family members to settle with them; and they can all become citizens of Canada.</p>
<p>In complex, challenging, creative, and often sad and moving ways, Geraldine Pratt tells a very different story of the ‘catastrophe that is the LCP’ (p. 4). We learn that migration to Canada for many Filipino women caregivers and the family members who might eventually join them is rarely easy, and that it often turns out to be more of a nightmare than a dream. In fact, the Philippine Women Centre of British Columbia (PWC), with whom Pratt collaborated in her research, advocates for an end to the LCP altogether. <italic>Families Apart</italic> tells of the invisible human costs, pain, and tragedies experienced by women and their families (Chapters 1–3). During the time it takes for a woman to finish the LCP (a minimum of two years) and the many additional years she must continue to work – for her subsistence, to send remittances home, and to save for airfares and sufficient funds to sponsor family members to come to Canada – marriages end, children grow older and distant, and all suffer the pains of separation. When children finally arrive in Canada, they do not recognize their mothers and must confront cultural and emotional dislocation as well as what Pratt describes as Canada’s social and economic exclusion. Children face discrimination and do not easily thrive in Canadian schools. Given the challenges and excruciating difficulties they face, the migrant mother’s many years of hard work and sacrifice may seem meaningless.</p>
<p>Stories of migrant mothers and their children are not the only ones told in <italic>Families Apart</italic>. The book interweaves these heartrending stories with the larger story (and theories) of global capitalism and embedded global politics (for example, the parasitical relationship between the Labor Export Policy of the Philippines and the LCP of Canada), and also with a story of feminist activism and collaboration. Utilizing a variety of genres, including a brilliant testimonial play (Chapter 4), Pratt aims to make migrant workers’ struggles visible to a wider audience and to create new spaces of political consciousness and solidarity. The play, a performance art piece, innovatively introduced its audiences to intimate objects, images, and experiences of migrant caregivers, resulting in unexpected interactions and moving responses from Canadian employers. Then, expanding the frame, Pratt takes the reader on another sort of journey to the Philippines (Chapter 5), accompanying a group of Filipino Canadian human rights activists on a fact-finding mission affiliated with the international ‘Stop the Killings in the Philippines’ campaign.</p>
<p>Pratt’s keen commitment to feminist collaboration and her gratitude to the PWC are evident. The book is dedicated to the women of the PWC and their struggle for social justice. Many pages are devoted to discussion of the collaborative essence of the research and Pratt’s common use of the pronoun ‘we’ to discuss the project goals and questions. Two chapters were originally published with co-authors (Chapter 3 with the PWC and Chapter 5 with the Philippines-Canada Task Force on Human Rights). Pratt’s perspective appears to merge seamlessly with that of the PWC. Given her emphasis on collaboration, sensitivity to power, consciousness of the blended voice, and the two originally co-authored chapters, why is the issue of Pratt’s sole authorship not explained? Moreover, where might Pratt’s position differ or diverge from that of the PWC? Does feminist solidarity require seeing things eye-to-eye or does it permit and in fact demand a productive diversity of voices?</p>
<p>
<italic>Families Apart</italic> is an exciting and unsettling book, especially to a reader steeped in another part of the world where Canada is almost synonymous with eureka. I wanted to know exactly how the PWC and Migrante International positions differ regarding ending or reforming the LCP. We are told the PWC’s position with little elaboration on what others in the migrant community think and why. In a world where opportunities for permanent migration for all but the ‘highly skilled’ are becoming ever scarcer, one wonders, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309132513475967">Bell and Piper (2005</xref>), whether advocating an end to the LCP is, from the perspective of prospective migrants, in their best interests. What issues are at stake for differently positioned migrant workers, including those who are single and childless? The critiques of the LCP are convincing, and the problems and vulnerability women face as live-in caregivers echo many of the problems migrant domestic workers face worldwide. Advocating for new permanent migration categories is laudable and idealistic, but the deeper fundamental problems of social and economic exclusion – if not the pain of families apart – would no doubt still apply to other categories of immigrants as well.</p>
