<p>Thomas Wartenberg maintains in his recent book <italic>Big Ideas for Little Kids</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1477878512437463">2009</xref>) that children are natural-born philosophers. Philosophical discussion of age-appropriate literature can enable children to engage issues they naturally wonder about, and in so doing make exciting educational gains. The book continues the efforts of Matthew Lipman and others to build a Philosophy for Children movement, ‘a worldwide social movement that could have dramatic impact on human life on this planet’, as Wartenberg says (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1477878512437463">2009</xref>: 140). I do have some concerns, centered on the nature and role of philosophical discussion, the level of philosophical acumen needed for facilitating such discussion, and the role of character development in this educational adventure.</p>
<p>Wartenberg tells us ‘The course that you will find presented in this book was . . . conceived as an elementary-school version of a typical college-level introduction to philosophy class’ (xi). Thus the sections of the course Wartenberg advances sound much like those one would expect to find in higher education: ethics, social and political philosophy, metaphysics, philosophy of mind, environmental philosophy, epistemology, philosophy of language, and aesthetics. Wartenberg continually reminds the elementary school teacher that he or she does not need a background in philosophy to bring philosophy into the classroom. There is some vagueness in this claim.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it is important to exercise a child’s natural curiosity and knowledge-gaining powers, and a teacher need not have <italic>formally studied</italic> philosophy in order to meet this goal. Helping students become more reasonable with regard to normative issues need not require that teachers have specialized knowledge in philosophical ethics, for example. However, facilitating a classroom discussion on humanistic issues and themes (the content of most children’s stories) involves a form of discussion that must avoid subjectivism and relativism on the one hand, and dogmatic inculcation of values or virtues, on the other. Even though the teacher’s role is that of a facilitator, effective facilitation cannot be completely nonjudgmental. In our current cultural context, weaving a position between nonjudgmentalism and dogmatism requires a substantial degree of philosophical understanding. My experience working with over 100 K-8 teachers in several summer institutes has shown me both how eager teachers are to engage in reflective thinking about normative issues and how difficult it is for many of them to weave such a position.</p>
<p>According to Wartenberg, to be an elementary school philosophy teacher all that is needed is a ‘. . . genuine interest in fostering the independence, creativity, and inquisitiveness of your students – as well as patience and a sense of humor’, and his book (ix). Wartenberg engages an interesting issue here. Assuming that children are natural-born philosophers, can well-meaning elementary school teachers (or parents) bring philosophy into the classroom (or home) and promote responsible freedom by encouraging philosophical discussion? Given the state of the culture and the majority of current teacher-education programs, I worry that the outlook for success is, unfortunately, not as promising as Wartenberg suggests.</p>
<p>Wartenberg offers his book as a guide that will provide elementary school teachers what they need to facilitate philosophical discussions with children. There is much wisdom in the advice Wartenberg gives. In children’s classrooms the main activity centers on the children discussing with one another issues of interest to them that arise from stories that they read or that are read to them. Wartenberg labels this ‘learner-centered teaching’, in which the role of the teacher is to facilitate discussion rather than to pass on information to be stored in the heads of the children. Wartenberg’s remarks here provide a good explanation of why a <italic>thorough</italic> background in philosophy is not required to facilitate a philosophical discussion with children; still it is not obvious that any credentialed teacher, or un-credentialed parent, of good will is thereby automatically up to the task, even with the advantages of this book. A question hovers here: how much philosophical background do elementary school teachers need in order to facilitate significant philosophical discussions on the many normative issues that arise in philosophical as opposed to factual discussions?</p>
<p>Wartenberg raises a question about philosophical discussion when he states:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Traditional classrooms come closest to having philosophical discussions when they employ debates about controversial issues, for children are then asked to support their views with good reasons. But in philosophy discussions, the emphasis is not on facts but defending what you think by providing good reasons for thinking what you do. (22)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is true that providing good reasons for what you think is central to being reasonable. However, it is not clear that this way of thinking about philosophical discussions promotes the kind of rational, critical assessment conducive to reasonable persons seeking to improve themselves and the culture. Bringing philosophy into the classroom often involves a critical understanding of humanistic issues centered on the categories meaning and value, as well as a well-grounded normative attitude. Uncovering structures of meaning and value in various modes of discourse, including children’s stories, requires considerable effort and know-how.</p>
<p>Wartenberg’s portrayal of philosophical activity may be misconstrued to suggest that it is primarily one of trying to rationally persuade or convince others to agree with you. It is important to emphasize the importance of providing reasons, but this notion of persuading or convincing others may also put the emphasis not simply on providing reasons, but on making one’s point as opposed to working together to discover what is most plausible to believe or do. Although Wartenberg also talks about the cooperative aspects of discussions, what he says about debate as approaching philosophical discussion needs attention; especially since he talks of philosophy as a game and the teacher’s role as facilitator as like that of an umpire.</p>
<p>When suggesting follow-up activities to a previous discussion of Frederick, the story of a mouse who writes poetry while the other mice gather supplies for the winter, Wartenberg tells us:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The children’s oral-language skills as well as their ability to cooperate can be improved by asking them to take part in debates . . . For example you could stage a debate about whether writing poetry should count as doing work or not. Since the children will have already discussed this issue together and heard arguments on both sides of the issue, it will be easier for them to develop arguments in support of the position they are assigned. (136)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Debating an issue may generate a great deal of interest, but one needs to be careful not to overemphasize skill development. In engaging the moral and civic enterprises, the overarching goal should not be winning an argument, but working with others to discover what we ought to believe or do. But in a debate, as typically understood, one is assigned a position to defend. Here the goal is to win, not to discover; in fact going with the stronger reasons may occasion one’s losing the debate.</p>
<p>Philosophical discussion in the elementary school classroom should emphasize cooperation not competition; it should also emphasize that rational discussion is more than trying to make one’s point. Wartenberg is sensitive to this and states, in addressing the goals of a follow-up activity, the aim ‘. . . is to get the children to think about this issue, not to take one side or the other’ (74). Thinking about an issue without taking a position on it, however, is not the same as working together to arrive at a reasonable position. Unlike some advocates of so-called community of inquiry strategies, the goal of philosophical discussion that I embrace is not to simply reach consensus, but to reach consensus on the truth. This is the point of following the argument where it may lead; guiding students may require, given our cultural context, more philosophical background in uncovering assumptions and presuppositions than Wartenberg recognizes. For the diligent teacher with time to invest in Wartenberg’s recommended readings and websites, such philosophical talents can be greatly improved without the need for scholarly philosophical knowledge, but I still worry that teachers will not acquire the background needed for guiding discussions on normative issues.</p>
<p>In the teaching ethics session, Wartenberg provides a brief on the virtue theory of ethics and his suggestions for using stories from Lobel’s <italic>Frog and Toad Together</italic> provide a good case for how children can engage in a philosophical discussion on bravery. His suggestion that such reflection can be used to enable children to see that being brave might mean not giving in to the taunts and pressures exerted by bullies is certainly apt. But if one of the aims of introducing philosophy to children is to develop a more reasonable society and world, this involves more than teaching the skill of critical thinking, even critical thinking about moral issues. It requires character development. What types of sustained philosophical discussions will be of most help in this endeavor?</p>
<p>Martha Nussbaum and others have argued that the arts in general and stories in particular play an important role in the moral education of children by helping to cultivate ‘. . . powers of imagination that are essential to citizenship’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477878512437463">Nussbaum, 1997</xref>: 85). Given the current state of education and the culture, these are powers that need to be cultivated and exercised. So my worry, given the curricular and cultural context facing Wartenberg’s exciting project, is that the taste of philosophy approach, while an improvement, will not allow for the sustained cultivation and exercise of children’s powers needed for engaging the moral and civic enterprises, enterprises at the heart of education. A great benefit of Wartenberg’s book is that his approach makes evident many of the conceptual and curricular changes that need to be made in the education of children.</p>
<p>An important strength of the philosophical approach is that preparation for the moral and civic enterprises can be central. By encouraging discussions on humanistic concepts having to do with value, meaning, selfhood, society, and so on, childhood education can and should involve, at a suitable level, the basic fields of philosophy that Wartenberg proposes for his course. By anchoring philosophical discussions involving the basic fields of philosophy to the humanistic concepts suggested above, the child’s learning experience can be made more centered, more coherent, and less episodic. The point I take from Nussbaum is that it is the humanistic content of the stories that gives rise to emotive experiences that serve to ground children’s attitudes.</p>
<p>I take it Wartenberg would agree that the learner-centered approach, especially when there is diversity in the group, is more apt for moral discovery than is the typical teacher-centered classroom. So where children mine for meaning in age-appropriate literature, children’s emotive responses to characters in a story can lead to fruitful discussions in which these emotive experiences can be understood and assessed. But unless sustained efforts are directed at the development, refinement, and critical assessment of students’ sensibilities – their feelings, emotions, and attitudes, as well as their impulses, desires, and decision-making processes, it is not clear that engaging in philosophical discussions about bravery, for instance, will inform judgment making about other normative issues. Again, the discussion on bravery that Wartenberg promotes is a great first step, but if in the next classroom session philosophical discussion centers on the Tin Woodman and personal identity, how are the different sessions integrated?</p>
<p>My suggestion is that, instead of providing a background brief on, in this instance, the philosophy of mind, which teachers are told they can skip, explicit connections should be made by integrating the earlier session on ethics, already enlivened by the children’s emotive experiences, with issues in the philosophy of mind, or environmental philosophy, or aesthetics, and so on. The role of stories is not simply to generate philosophical questions; it is also to exercise emotive experiences so that the questions have meaning. This meaning is often lost to children when their emotive experiences are ignored, not taken seriously, or not refined and developed. Integrating the various topical sessions around normative issues of interest to children, given their lived experiences as reflected in the stories they read, can aid in character development by reinforcing reasonableness in the formation of attitudes with regard to such issues.</p>
<p>While I agree with Wartenberg about the importance of generating philosophical discussions with elementary school children, I worry that teachers’ disciplinary training and the state of the culture in general leave our teachers unprepared for the task. Wartenberg’s efforts can help remedy this, but it remains an uphill battle. We should all be thankful that Wartenberg has engaged in this effort.</p>
