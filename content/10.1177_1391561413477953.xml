<p>The ongoing global economic recovery, to date, has been rather volatile. A fundamental restructuring of the global economic order is a highly anticipated outcome of this recovery. In the industrialized world, it has been somewhat hesitant and slow, whereas the recovery in Asia and other emerging economies has been far more dynamic and robust. With this trend set to continue, South Asian policy-makers are increasingly having to grapple with a number of challenges as well as opportunities to exploit to ensure that their recovery is more durable, inclusive and sustainable, over the medium term in this so-called ‘new normal’ of the global economy. Repositioning and readjusting their economies to survive and prosper in this new economic environment has become a priority which will fundamentally require the uptake of broad-based, behind-the-border domestic reforms.</p>
<p>In the light of the above, this compilation of essays examines a number of past reform initiatives in three South Asian economies, namely, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka—which share a number of broad similarities—to try and examine the underlying forces which drove past reform experiences to move beyond the drawing-board. The volume is organized into 10 chapters and is based on extensive empirical research.</p>
<p>The first chapter, authored by Philippa Dee, sets the broad theoretical and analytical tone for the chapters that follow. Dee argues that ‘policy efficiency’ is fundamental to ensure that ‘difficult yet worthwhile reforms are identified, prioritized, initiated, implemented and sustained’ (p. 2). The concept of ‘policy efficiency’ goes beyond political economy business-as-usual, and is related to the concept of ‘political will’. It relates to the institutional mechanisms that help to create an acceptance of the need for reform, that provide the authority for reformers to carry out their jobs and that provide a learning environment where ability can be developed (p. 2). Dee argues that achieving policy efficiency is most often hampered by either ignorance, or vested interests within and outside government, and thus achieving policy efficiency could be promoted through institutional arrangements to overcome these problems. Dee stresses on the importance of policy reviews as a technical solution, as well as a tool for managing vested interests. Additionally, she also notes that efficient policy review institutions are essential to enhancing accountability and transparency in order to manage vested interest. Dee further highlights that political constraints which materialize in the form of a lack of credibility, political opportunism, political ideology, divided government and the pressures of redistribution act as major obstacles to achieving policy efficiency. However, she recognizes the role of the high level bureaucracy in alleviating these political impediments.</p>
<p>The second chapter authored by Dipak Dasgupta, Nihal Pitigala and Julien Gourdon explores the prospects and challenges for South Asian economies under the ‘new normal’ of the global economic landscape. The authors argue that with faltering demand in industrial economies, and with the East—notably Asia and emerging markets—set to become key drivers of the post-crisis global economy, South Asia needs to ‘rebalance’ itself in view of this structural change to maximize gains from growth in emerging markets, particularly in the long run. They argue that there exists evidence to illustrate that the post-crisis recovery of South–South merchandise trade has been much stronger in comparison to the recovery of North–South trade. Noticeably both during and in the aftermath of the crisis, East Asia has emerged as the largest merchandise export destination for South Asian goods. Furthermore, with East Asia exporting capital-intensive exports, such as transport, logistics, tourism, financial, health and higher-end services, to South Asia, while shifting away from labour-intensive manufacture, the authors call for a more intensified ‘Look East’ strategy through deeper integration to better tap into the East Asian growth drive. The authors also call for the boosting of intra-regional trade, so that South Asian markets could collectively improve the economies of scale of domestic firms, increase competition, and hence efficiency, and facilitate skills and technology spillovers. Repositioning South Asia in the ‘new normal’ requires not only a rethinking of the region’s market integration strategy but also the need to undertake broad-based behind the border policy reforms to enhance the region’s competitiveness, to spur greater volumes of trade and investments both within, and outside, the region.</p>
<p>The following chapter, authored by Ishrat Husain and Rajiv Kumar, compares the structural reform experiences of both India and Pakistan. The authors argue that despite the similarity in the nature of reforms undertaken by the two countries, the divergence in the degree of their success could largely be attributed to the differences in political experiences. Since independence, India has been able to consolidate itself as a stable democracy, whereas Pakistan, over the decades, has undergone a turbulent political past. This chapter chronicles and explores in detail both the tax and industrial policy reforms in India, and argues that the reform process has been gradual and incremental in nature. The authors also state that these reforms were carried out in a transparent manner, involving public scrutiny of policy, with inputs from the epistemic community and civil society to enhance political leverage as well as accountability. Additionally, they note that while reforms under these circumstances have been long-drawn and slow, they have most importantly been enduring. In contrast, however, Pakistan’s reforms experience has been bold and swift, yet short-lived. The short-lived nature of reforms, the authors argue, could largely be attributed to the fierce political rivalry in Pakistan. They cite that the short-tenured nature of governments created both political and financial incentives to undertake ‘big bang’ policy reforms, with short-term foresight. Reforms are undertaken by one-man bands with limited consultations with professionals and the wider public. To add to this, the fierce political rivalry has resulted in successive governments abandoning the reforms of their predecessors, and instead embarking on totally new and different ones. In summing up the chapter, the authors highlight a number of key reform characteristics which differ between the two countries, which have contributed to their different outcomes; notably, the limited consideration for policy debate, ‘bridge-burning’ of political rivals and reforms introduced by one-man band which had direct longevity and legitimacy implications in Pakistan.</p>
<p>The fourth chapter, authored by Rajendra R. Vaidya, examines in depth the banking sector reform experience in India. He argues that the market structure of the contemporary Indian banking industry stands in stark contrast to what it was half a century ago. He goes on to argue that this largely owed to successful incremental reforms undertaken in the banking sector over the years, in particular, reforms associated with the period 2000 to 2008, which has had direct implications on the nature of bank lending. The author notes that the reform process has, however, been slow and cumbersome especially in comparison to China, but this is to be expected given the democratic and diverse nature of the country. Analyzing the nature of the reform process itself provides valuable insights into the success of banking sector reform in India. It has been acknowledged that the nature of the decision-making process itself is painfully slow, with committees consisting of experts, public servants and representatives of the corporate sector being mobilized to explore and identify scope for reform. Subsequently, the committee reports are made public and available for debate, some feedback of which is then fed into the decision-making process. The author goes on to conclude that despite the slow progress, the process of reform in its totality leading to policy choice has proven to have worked well. Sustaining the reform process over such a long period, the author adds, has been no small feat.</p>
<p>The fifth chapter authored by D.K. Srivastava and J.V.M. Sarma argues that in recent years, tangible improvements have been made in the management of debt and deficits in India, at both the central and state levels. This has largely been associated with the concentrated move, during the period 2000–2007, towards monitoring fiscal performance, which subsequently led to 26 out of the 28 states in India enacting fiscal responsibility legislation. The chapter highlights the role and interplay between key institutions in the reform process, especially the Twelfth Finance Commission, which was instrumental in overseeing the uptake of fiscal responsibility legislation by the states. The finance commission, through constitutional provisions, is essentially responsible for periodically reviewing vertical as well as horizontal imbalances; it has also been mandated with taking up any other concerns relating to the interest of sound finance. This latter mandate, the author argues, had allowed the required policy space for the commission to play an influential role in framing tighter fiscal disciplines as well as suggesting incentives for their adoption.</p>
<p>The sixth chapter, authored by Pravakar Sahoo, looks at policy reforms leading to the increase in flows of foreign direct investment (FDI) into India, particularly during the post-reform period from 1991 to 2008. The chapter more specifically looks at the role played by institutions that helped enhance India’s attractiveness to FDI. During the height of the import substitution era, FDI into India had been highly regulated with the government only permitting FDI to meet domestic requirements. The intensification of the balance-of-payments crisis in 1991 witnessed the need for the attraction of non-debt creating international capital flows and FDI was seen as a primary source in this regard. In the broader light of market-oriented reforms, 1991 witnessed the change in the role of the government from being a regulator of private investment to a facilitator of private investment. This change saw the establishment of three key institutions, namely, the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, the Secretariat for Industrial Assistance and the Foreign Investment Implementation Authority; the three of which together being entrusted with the responsibility of providing comprehensive pre- and post-investment care to foreign investors. Sahoo argues that these three institutions have been instrumental in attracting FDI into India. He goes on to explore how FDI policy reforms have been successfully implemented and sustained over the years, and attributes that common consensus amongst the majority of major political parties on the need to sustain the attraction of FDI was key to ensure that reforms stayed on course. The author, however, notes that policy reforms in this sphere remains an unfinished agenda, and goes on to make a number of policy recommendations which are key to further enhancing FDI flows to India.</p>
<p>Geethanjanli Nataraj, in the ensuing chapter, argues that India’s trade policy reform has proved a much more formidable challenge, compared to its FDI policy reform experience. This, she argues, could largely be attributed to the relatively elaborate trade policy-making machine, originally designed to promote exports whilst shielding import-competing industries. India’s trade policy reforms experience was born in crisis at the behest of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, as opposed to being a home-grown initiative. The formulation and implementation of trade policy primarily rests with the Department of Commerce and a handful of key ministries and line agencies. Such a combination of institutional structures and formal policy-making procedures, the author argues, is more conducive to promoting domestic industries and selectively promoting exports, as opposed to a push towards a comprehensive policy reform. At the ministerial level in particular, the approach towards trade reforms have been on the defensive and this has been further extended to the bureaucracy. Mechanisms for formal consultation outside the bureaucracy are lacking, even though informal consultations have been increasingly fruitful. The author then goes on to note a number of key political economy developments, which have seen the continuation of the reform process. She goes on to recommend a number of key institutional changes to ensure effective trade policy formulation: the most noteworthy amongst which is the need to create a structured consultation process beyond the level of line government departments.</p>
<p>The eighth chapter, authored by Zafar Muneen Nasir, examines the financial sector reform experience of Pakistan. Reforms in Pakistan have brought about a marked change in the structure of the Pakistani financial sector. It has significantly contributed to the improvement in the health of the commercial banking system. The author attributes much of this success to the political commitment and the resolve of policy-makers who wanted to implement these reforms with honesty. Financial sector reforms in Pakistan were initiated back in the 1980s; however, broad-based reforms were really only set in motion under the leadership of Nawaz Shariff in 1991. Despite a change in government in 1993, the reform process was sustained under the leadership of Benazir Bhutto. The re-election of Nawaz Shariff in 1997 saw the reform process being further accelerated. The author, however, argues that the most noteworthy reforms to liberalize the sector came under the Musharraf regime. Under Musharraf, new institutions were established, and old ones strengthened. New regulations were also introduced, enhancing transparency and accountability, which instilled public confidence in the system. Nasir argues that the role of Musharraf’s deputy, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz, a former banker himself, in the reform process was vital in ensuring that reforms were well directed and sustained. Aziz, with his deep understanding of the industry, recognized its importance to the overall growth and development of the country, and with the full backing of the president, mobilized a team of dedicated professionals to design and implement reforms.</p>
<p>In the penultimate chapter, Dushni Weerakoon argues that the Sri Lankan economic reform experience has been a mixed one. Sri Lanka’s reform experience cannot be considered in isolation from its political economy considerations, and the institutional capacity reforms in the country. Compared to the reform experience of the earlier decade, reforms since the 1990s have been half-hearted, sluggish and have occurred in a rather ad hoc and piecemeal manner. Second-generation reforms which essentially entail the fundamental realignment of the function of the state, as opposed to ‘a-strike of the pen’ type first-generation reforms, are more politically complex to implement, and hence successive governments have tended to shy away from jeopardizing their political capital on pushing broad-based reforms of this nature. The rise of coalition politics, the author notes, has also been a further impediment to the reform process. The rise of coalition politics in 1994 witnessed that whilst the executive presidency enjoyed a strong political mandate, pushing reforms through the left of centre coalition government proved a formidable challenge, as the left-oriented partners were not enamoured with the idea of pushing reforms through. Another downside of coalition politics was the heightened risk of the demise of government, if political parties fell out over reform and withdrew support. The fragility of such coalition arrangements incentivize incumbent governments to take short-term views on policy, as opposed to the adoption of necessary and more effective medium- and longer-term perspectives. Coalition politics, as the Sri Lankan experience case shows, can also be a source of policy instability. The Sri Lankan experience further demonstrates that weak institutional capacity can also impede the reform process. Reforms of the early 1990s largely by-passed the technocracy and was carried out by a handful of advisers. Weak public institutions fall prey to vested interests and are easily subject to political capture; thus, policy formulation tends to become highly centralized. The author goes on to highlight the need to reform public sector institutions and services by building a strong technocracy to try and alleviate political constraints to reform.</p>
<p>In the final chapter, Moshin Khan argues that improved economic relations between India and Pakistan has the potential to become a powerful tool to build confidence and ease political tensions between the two archrivals. Khan argues that successive governments in both India and Pakistan have repeatedly disclosed their desire for a peaceful reconciliation. The Musharraf–Singh meeting in 2005 was seen as a major breakthrough in trade relation. However, five years down the road, progress has been slow owing to political tensions, security issues and domestic political opposition from both sides of the border. Unlike previous studies using gravity modelling, this chapter determines the potential for Indo-Pakistan trade beyond SAPTA. Results show that the trade potential between the two countries is twenty-fold higher than the present level, but highly restrictive policies and practices as well as other behind the border policies and measures significantly constrains trade between the two nations at present. The author goes on to detail a strategy to enhance trade between the two neighbours. This entails a host of short- and medium-term reform measures. Short-term reforms essentially entail addressing of trade facilitation-related concerns, such as easing visa restrictions, additional border crossings and bus routes, increasing air links, etc. Medium-term measures include the granting of MFN status to India, relaxing restriction on FDI and service trade between the two countries, etc.</p>
<p>In summing up, the global economic recession in the aftermath of the 2008/09 financial crisis has brought about a fundamental restructuring of the global economy, which calls for South Asian economies to take on board broad-based structural reforms to rebalance themselves to ensure that they survive and prosper in the ‘new normal’. In this light, this volume is a much welcome and timely compilation of essays, which draws on past reform experiences in the region to provide insights on how to overcome political restraints to reforms. Case studies examined in the volume highlight the importance of policy reviews and institutional arrangement to overcome political restraints. The analysis opens up whole new dimensions to understanding where opposition for reform stems from in South Asia, as well as a way in which to overcome them. The volume is an engaging read, particularly for those interested in the course of South Asia’s development, and is likely to benefit policy-makers in South Asia—in particular, to devise better strategies to push through broad-based reforms which are crucial to ensuring the growth and prosperity for countries in the region under the ‘new normal’ of the global economic environment.</p>
