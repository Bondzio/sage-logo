<abstract>
<p>As the location of health care delivery continues to shift from inpatient settings into the community understanding the experience of the home care workforce is important. Challenges related to recruitment and retention of nurses in home care has resulted in agencies hiring new graduate nurses. While Extensive research exists exploring experiences of new graduates in hospital settings, experiences of new graduates in home care are not well understood. Given the contextual differences between hospital and home care, research exploring new graduate nurses’ experiences in the home care sector is warranted. A phenomenological approach was used. “Deciding if home care is right for me” emerged as a way of understanding new graduate nurses’ experiences in home care.</p>

<body>
<p>Health care is currently shifting out of hospitals into the community. Despite the growing number of nurses working in the community sector, the number of home care nurses in Ontario has declined.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1084822312473828">1</xref></sup> As a result of challenges related to recruitment and retention of nursing staff home care agencies have begun to hire new graduate nurses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1084822312473828">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Home care nurses work as generalists and require knowledge and skill to care independently for a wide variety of clients. It is due to the complexity of the work and autonomous nature of home care nursing that home care service providers have generally avoided employing new graduates until they have 2 years experience in hospital settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1084822312473828">2</xref></sup> Experience in hospitals is thought to provide time for new graduates to consolidate their skills and successfully transition into the role of independent practitioner prior to beginning work in home care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1084822312473828">2</xref></sup> However, in the face of the nursing shortage, this notion is now being challenged and home care agencies are hiring new graduate nurses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1084822312473828">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Little is known about new graduate home care nurses’ experiences of orientation, preceptorship, transition into independent practice and subsequent turnover rates. Given that turnover rates for new graduate nurses during the first year of employment in hospital settings is estimated to range from 20%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1084822312473828">3</xref></sup> to greater than 60%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1084822312473828">4</xref></sup> understanding experiences of new graduates during their transition from student to registered nurse is essential, regardless of the practice context. High new graduate nurse turnover rates are costly to health care organizations, clients, and nurses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1084822312473828">5</xref></sup> Costs incurred by employing organizations as a result of nursing turnover are reported to range from US$10,000 to US$60,000 per nurse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1084822312473828">6</xref></sup> Patient satisfaction and continuity of care also suffer as a result of nurse turnover.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1084822312473828">6</xref></sup> Although findings are related to turnover of nurses in hospital settings, it is reasonable to conclude that home care employers may incur similar losses, as these new hires also undergo costly orientation and training.</p>
<p>Much like their peers employed in hospital settings, the increased responsibility of being a fully licensed registered nurse is stressful for new graduate home care nurses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1084822312473828">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1084822312473828">8</xref></sup> Research indicates that new graduates working in home care experience added stress because they require a more expansive set of competencies due to the generalist nature of the care they provide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1084822312473828">7</xref></sup> The present study reports on experiences of new graduate nurses who begin their careers in home care with the aim of better understanding new graduate nurse turnover in a home care context.</p>
<p>New graduate nurses’ transition into independent practice can be characterized by personal and professional growth and development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1084822312473828">8</xref></sup> as well as learning to “stand on one’s own feet.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1084822312473828">7</xref>(p262)</sup> Several studies suggest that for successful transition into home care practice, new graduates require confidence, ongoing support, validation, and feedback.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1084822312473828">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1084822312473828"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1084822312473828">9</xref></sup> However, studies also reveal that support and feedback are sometimes lacking, leaving new graduates feeling isolated and unsure about their progress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1084822312473828">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1084822312473828">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Levels of responsibility for client care have been found to be the most noticeable difference between the roles of student and registered nurse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1084822312473828">8</xref></sup> New graduate nurses often reported being surprised by what was expected of them in relation to their knowledge and skills<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1084822312473828">7</xref></sup> and overwhelmed and burdened by high levels of responsibility they were required to assume.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1084822312473828">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1084822312473828">8</xref></sup> Challenges new nurses faced in negotiating nurse–client relationships led them to realize the importance of developing competencies and knowledge related to the home care nursing role.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1084822312473828">7</xref></sup> Knowing when to ask for help, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills have also been identified as particularly relevant to a home care context.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1084822312473828">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>As a strategy to address challenges new graduate nurses experience transitioning into home care practice, extended orientation programs have been established to ease the transition from student to registered nurse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1084822312473828">10</xref></sup> by providing job-related education and extended preceptorships. In Ontario, Canada, the Provincial government launched The New Graduate Guarantee (NGG). This program provides employers with financial support for new graduate nurses to work alongside preceptors for up to 6 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1084822312473828">11</xref></sup> Extended orientation programs such as this are intended to allow new nurses the opportunity and support to consolidate their skills within the home care environment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1084822312473828">2</xref></sup> However, despite implementation of programs such as this, little research evidence is available to determine the impact of extended preceptorship programs.</p>
<p>Others have evaluated the implementation of the NGG in home care and found new graduate nurses valued the additional support and time provided for learning through extended preceptorship periods, as it allowed them to feel better prepared for independent practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1084822312473828">10</xref></sup> Similarly, in a study examining the implementation of an initiative including extended home care clinical placements, internship programs for nursing students, and extended orientation programs for newly graduated nurses, the use of multiple strategies was found to improved recruitment and retention of new home care nurses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1084822312473828">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>While these reports provide insight into the experiences of new graduate nurses employed in home care, the transferability of these studies’ findings to the broader Canadian home care context is limited. For example, two studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1084822312473828">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1084822312473828">8</xref></sup> were conducted in Norway and lacked detailed contextual information, making their applicability to a Canadian context difficult to assess. Other studies included participants other than new graduate home care nurses,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1084822312473828">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1084822312473828">9</xref></sup> or focused specifically on the implementation of extended orientation programs at a single organization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1084822312473828">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>In two non-research-based reports, the implementation of extended orientation programs in Canada and the United States for new graduate nurses in home care were described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1084822312473828">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1084822312473828">13</xref></sup> These reports indicated that extended orientation can lead to successful integration of new graduates into home care nursing teams<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1084822312473828">13</xref></sup> and a decrease in turnover rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1084822312473828">12</xref></sup> To build on both anecdotal data and previous research findings,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1084822312473828">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1084822312473828">10</xref></sup> further empirical evidence is needed to determine the impact of extended orientation programs on retention of new graduate nurses in home care.</p>
<p>Literature exploring turnover of new graduate nurses employed in home care is also scarce. Previous research has identified several reasons why new graduate nurses leave home care following orientation and preceptorship.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1084822312473828">10</xref></sup> These researchers found that although new graduates appreciated extended orientation periods, the NGG did not provide sufficient incentive to remain working in home care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1084822312473828">10</xref></sup> Participants cited extended workdays, pay differential between home care and other practice settings, and the independent nature of home care nursing work as reasons to leave home care for employment elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1084822312473828">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is a dearth of literature exploring new graduate nurses’ experience of orientation, preceptorship, and transition into independent practice as well as turnover rates within home care. To address this gap, a phenomenologic approach was used to understand the meaning of the experience of new graduate registered nurses who begin their careers in home care within the context of the NGG. Specifically, this study sought to explore how new graduate nurses experience orientation, preceptorship, and transition into independent practice in home care and how their experiences influenced their decision to remain in or leave their jobs as well as their intent to remain working in home care in the future.</p>
<sec id="section1-1084822312473828" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Philosophical hermeneutics, an extension of interpretive phenomenology, was used to guide the study. Interpretive phenomenology strives to move beyond pure description and seeks to understand a human being’s nature of being in the world.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1084822312473828">14</xref></sup> Philosophical hermeneutics does not describe the process of understanding, but outlines the conditions under which understanding occurs. Dialogue, historically effected consciousness and the hermeneutic situation, fusion of horizons, prejudice, and the circle of understanding, are conditions of understanding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1084822312473828">15</xref></sup> These concepts are intertwined, all occurring simultaneously in the act of interpretation and understanding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1084822312473828">15</xref></sup> The conceptual elements of philosophical hermeneutics were embedded in the research process. A framework for establishing rigor in interpretive phenomenological research was used to maintain rigor in the study process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1084822312473828">16</xref></sup></p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>Recruitment of participants occurred over a 6-month period immediately following research ethics board approval from the university and partnering agencies. All participants were recruited through the primary author’s personal contacts at two Ontario based home care agencies. The agency contacts invited new graduate nurses meeting inclusion criteria to participate in the study. If interest in participating was expressed, the contact person asked permission to provide the primary author with contact information for that nurse. The primary author then contacted potential participants, confirmed eligibility to participate, provided further detail about the study, and set up an interview time.</p>
<p>Eight new graduate nurses from two not-for-profit home care agencies were recruited to participate in the study. All nurses began their careers in home care and participated in extended orientation and preceptorship programs of between 3 and 6 months, provided through the NGG. Participants ranged in age from 22 to 37 years, and 7 of the 8 were female. At the time of the study, participants had been employed as home care nurses for between 6 and 18 months; 1 decided to leave her position after 6 months. Therefore, 7 of the 8 participants were working as home care nurses at the time of their interviews.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1084822312473828">
<title>Data Collection and Analysis</title>
<p>One-time semistructured individual interviews were conducted with each participant over an 8-month period between October 2009 and April 2010. Interviews, lasting 30 to 60 min, were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Prior to commencing interviews, participants were instructed to read the consent form, ask questions to ensure understanding, and were reminded that participation is voluntary and withdrawl of consent is allowed at any time. Each interview began with the following request: “Tell me about your experiences as a new graduate nurse in home care.” While a semistructured interview guide was used as a reminder of topic areas to be covered during interviews, participants were allowed to lead the conversation. Follow-up questions were used to ensure all content areas were covered and to further the investigator’s understanding of participants’ experiences. To prepare for each interview, notes and recordings from previous interviews and reflexive journal entries were reviewed.</p>
<p>An iterative process encompassing three interrelated phases was used to collect and analyze data. Phase 1 included data collection and preliminary analysis of recorded interviews. Phase 2 included data coding, informed by the preliminary analysis, and writing an initial understanding of participants’ experience as a whole. Phase 3 included development of themes and subthemes, which evolved by comparing, contrasting, and grouping codes developed in phase 2. Data collection and analysis were conducted by adhering to the conditions in which understanding takes place,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1084822312473828">15</xref></sup> which include dialogue, historically effected consciousness and the hermeneutic situation, fusion of horizons, prejudice, and the circle of understanding.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<sec id="section5-1084822312473828">
<title>Deciding if Home Care Is Right for Me</title>
<p>Analysis of participants’ stories suggests the meaning of being a new graduate nurse in home care can be understood through the interplay of personal, relational, and systemic factors affecting their decision to remain in home care following orientation, preceptorship, and transition to independent practice. Specifically, findings showed that while some factors pulled new graduates into home care nursing, others pushed them away. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1084822312473828">Figure 1</xref> provides a conceptual representation of these factors and their interactions.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section6-1084822312473828">
<title>Personal Factors: Do I Have What It Takes?</title>
<p>Findings suggest there is a personal, internal process involved in deciding whether or not new graduates are capable of doing the job. The outcome of this process is reflected in their decision to remain working in or to leave home care nursing following preceptorship and orientation.</p>
<sec id="section7-1084822312473828">
<title>I can do this</title>
<p>Findings indicate the initial days or weeks during which new graduate nurses begin working independently are especially challenging. Study participants described moving from feeling overwhelmed and unsure about their abilities to feeling “comfortable” with their work and “good about” what they were doing. Progression from self-doubt to increased confidence appeared to be important to participants’ successful transition to independent practice. Those participants who described feeling confident in their ability to do the job were also more likely to state they intended to remain in their positions as home care nurses. Annie (names have been changed to ensure anonymity) reflected,
<disp-quote>
<p>Towards the end of my preceptorship, I went from being intimidated by the position and thinking “oh my god, I can’t handle this” . . . to being out there on my own and within a week realizing that “okay I can do this and I’m comfortable with this.”</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1084822312473828">
<title>I don’t have enough experience</title>
<p>Not all participants were able to overcome feelings of self-doubt related to their inexperience. For one participant in particular, negative feelings associated with being inexperienced affected her comfort in providing client care. Dana, who left her position after only 6 months, acknowledged the impact of her inexperience on her ability to practice. Dana reflected, “I knew I wasn’t experienced enough to be able to pop in and do dialysis on someone. I was like ‘wow, this is serious.’” This type of comment suggests that feeling inexperienced may have led some new graduate nurses to question their abilities, which may have further compounded their negative feelings about their job. Indeed, Dana, the only participant who was no longer working in home care directly attributed her decision to leave her position to her inability to overcome the negative feelings associated with being inexperienced. Dana recalled, “The inexperience I felt with it all, that was a big one [reason why I left] . . . I didn’t want to wake up every day feeling unsettled and stressed out about it.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1084822312473828">
<title>I was just so out of my comfort zone</title>
<p>Working independently also appears to play a role in how new graduate nurses experience their work. Reflecting on her first day working independently, Hanna described how “the whole day was just uncomfortable . . . I was just so out of my comfort zone. I felt so lost. I felt clueless; I didn’t know what was going on.” The challenges associated with working independently appeared to be compounded when participants were asked to do more than they felt capable of. These findings suggest the discomfort of working independently may be a factor in new graduates’ intent to leave their jobs. For example, when asked about the impact of feeling overwhelmed by the work Hanna admitted, “I will not lie, I’ve been looking for a new job probably since I started on my own a few months ago.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1084822312473828">
<title>I love the independence</title>
<p>While the independent nature of home care nursing was identified as stressful, findings suggest that independence may also be a positive aspect of the job. Several participants noted the independence they were afforded in planning their workday as a benefit of home care work. Hanna explained, “I like being out on my own. I like being able to plan my own day.” Others talked about how the independent nature of the work enabled them to get to know their clients. For example, when asked what she liked about the independent nature of home care, Alana reflected, “I know I can spend time with people . . . to socialize, to speak with them . . . you can actually build trust and relationships.”</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1084822312473828">
<title>Relational Factors: It’s the Relationships That Count</title>
<p>Relationships were also integral to new graduates’ experiences. Relationships with preceptors, colleagues, peers, and clients were identified as important during preceptorship and independent practice, as these relationships helped participants develop confidence in their nursing skills and passion for the care they provide.</p>
<sec id="section12-1084822312473828">
<title>Feeling supported in the learning process: The preceptor–preceptee relationship</title>
<p>Relationships with preceptors were seen as especially meaningful to participants. Hanna hypothesized how her experiences might have turned out had she not had the support of her preceptors: “If I didn’t have them [preceptors] and I was just thrown into it, I probably would have quit.” The preceptorship provided new graduates with time for learning and development of confidence, as Heather stated, “the preceptorship . . . gave me time and enough hands-on skills to really feel like I knew what I was doing and I should really be in nursing.”</p>
<p>Feeling comfortable with one’s preceptor and feeling safe to ask questions were important aspects of the relationship. Eric recalled how the “friendships” he developed with preceptors allowed him to feel safe asking questions: “Because I was with them [preceptors] for a long time, I built good friendships, you can ask them anything and never feel stupid because they’re like your friend.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1084822312473828">
<title>Fostering independence</title>
<p>Preceptor approaches that encouraged independent critical thinking and problem solving were perceived as more effective in improving self-confidence than approaches where participants were simply told what to do. As Robin recalled,
<disp-quote>
<p>I think with the first [preceptor] that just sort of showed me how to do everything. I was really intimidated because it felt like “there is just this one way to do it” . . . When I got with the second [preceptor] it was like “no, there is flexibility. How would you like to do it?” Then I would sort of say what I would want to do and she would give me feedback . . . which definitely gave me more confidence in my critical thinking abilities.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1084822312473828">
<title>Being there for each other</title>
<p>Participants also described how they were able to find support through relationships with new graduate peers and nursing colleagues. Although not all participants were able to connect with other new graduates, those who did described this as beneficial for providing emotional support. Hanna reflected, “I called . . . one girl on my team . . . and she was like ‘it’s not that bad but honestly you had a really bad day’ . . . so we kind of just debriefed.”</p>
<p>Support from nursing colleagues and nursing team members was also identified as central to the new graduate experience, as it made working independently easier. Robin explained, “We really support each other . . . which is really nice. It definitely made [working independently] a lot easier.” For the majority of study participants, team support played an important role in their decision to remain working in home care. Annie reflected,
<disp-quote>
<p>If I were on a team that no one got along and you couldn’t call anyone for help then I probably wouldn’t stay because you’re really on your own and you need that support . . . If I didn’t have [my team] I don’t know how I’d do it. I’d be like “see you later!”</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1084822312473828">
<title>Feeling the absence of supportive relationships</title>
<p>Although the majority of participants identified supportive relationships, one described a very different experience. Dana, who decided to leave home care work only 3 months after completing her preceptorship, identified a number of factors within her preceptored experience as influencing her decision to seek other employment. In particular, she talked about how having a preceptor who was required to care for a full caseload of clients while also functioning as a preceptor, challenged her ability to acquire the hands-on nursing skills necessary for home care. Dana explained,
<disp-quote>
<p>In terms of the hands-on nursing part, they [preceptors] still had their 10 patients to do every day and they just wanted to be in and out . . . it was their schedule and it was their time and their clients . . . when I was with them they would just let me follow them . . . they didn’t really teach me things or tell me things unless I asked.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>For Dana, new graduate peer support was also missing. She reflected, “There weren’t other new grads at the time I was a new grad and I think that really hindered my feeling of how much support I was receiving . . . Other new grads, they can relate.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1084822312473828">
<title>Building meaningful relationships with clients</title>
<p>The majority of participants spoke passionately about relationships with clients. Several identified how regular client visits allowed for development of meaningful relationships. Robin reflected on her experience with one client and his wife: “One client we saw every day for six months; 9 o’clock in the morning every day we’d set up his dialysis and help him and his wife. You become part of their family.”</p>
<p>The ability to build relationships with clients was identified as unique to practicing in home care. It was this type of relationship building that played into their decision to remain working in home care. As Robin explained, “I don’t think you get to develop types of relationships like that in other nursing jobs . . . That’s what I love about it . . . It’s the only thing keeping me in.”</p>

<sec id="section17-1084822312473828">
<title>Systemic Factors: It’s Not What I Expected</title>
<p>Systemic factors also influenced new graduates’ decision to stay in or leave their jobs. Participants all described unexpected realities of the job that stemmed from the structure of the home care system.</p>
<sec id="section18-1084822312473828">
<title>Never really being done</title>
<p>Participants talked a great deal about how the work they were required to do from home after completing client visits caused them to feel as though they were never really done working. For several participants, the intrusion of work into personal time was an unexpected reality of the job. Hanna reflected, “It takes up so much of my time when I come home at night and I listen to voicemail and I send voicemails . . . Some days I come home and I’m so tired and it’s like I’m not done my day!”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1084822312473828">
<title>Taking the care out of caring work</title>
<p>Time constraints and workplace pressures influenced individuals’ experiences of providing client care. Participants identified feeling sad and frustrated by the emphasis placed on getting work done, as opposed to doing caring work. They described how time pressures resulted in task-focused care that felt rushed and incomplete. Dana reflected,
<disp-quote>
<p>The thing that’s hard about it is . . . when you’re in the client’s home . . . they have questions, they want to talk to you, you want to do a bit of teaching . . . to do your skills, and health teaching and documentation in 30 minutes, like really? . . . You feel rushed, you feel like, I’d like to do this and this, but I can’t . . . I was just kind of working on the clock . . . I would in a way provide less care . . . I think it’s sad.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Dana went on to acknowledge feeling disappointed in the care she was able to provide clients within the time allotted was “one of the reasons why [I] left.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1084822312473828">
<title>The work is not steady enough</title>
<p>Instability of work hours created a challenge for many participants, especially as it was unexpected. Hanna explained, “I never really thought I might have two people one day and a full day the next. I think I just assumed you would have full-time hours. I never really knew, no one ever told me.” The lack of stability in their work was identified as sufficient cause for several participants to begin looking for new jobs. Hanna further explained,
<disp-quote>
<p>I’ll be here until I find something better. It’s not enough full-time. I want an 80 hour full time job. Sixty-five hours (every two weeks), and I’m not even getting 65, is not enough . . . It’s not steady enough.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1084822312473828">
<title>It’s an expensive job</title>
<p>Once they began practicing independently, participants described being faced with a variety of personal expenses they had not anticipated. Expenses associated with using one’s own car and cell phone, in combination with a pay rate lower than that of nurses working in other health care sectors, was described as influencing participants to consider leaving their jobs. Robin mirrored the sentiments of a number of participants when she admitted,
<disp-quote>
<p>I see myself in another job in the future because I feel this job is costing me a lot of money. I am making about four dollars an hour less than hospital nurses, I’m using my car and spending so much money on that. I’m using my cell phone and spending money on that. My full time position is 65 hours every two weeks so I’m being paid less, my full time hours are less. I’m spending money; it’s an expensive job.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Study findings shed light on how the interplay of personal, relational, and systemic factors affected new graduates’ transition to independent practice and ultimately their decisions to remain in or leave home care work. Findings of this study suggest the availability of support both during and after preceptorship may be especially relevant for retention in a home care context. Support from various players enabled new graduates to develop the confidence they felt was necessary to do the job. This and other studies in both hospital<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1084822312473828">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1084822312473828"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1084822312473828"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1084822312473828">20</xref></sup> and home care environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1084822312473828">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1084822312473828">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1084822312473828">10</xref></sup> highlight the importance of support from preceptors and others in transitioning from the role of student to competent nurse. Indeed, findings of this study highlight the central role that support from preceptors, peers, and colleagues play in the transition process. Results also reinforce the value of extended orientation programs for nurses who begin their careers in home care, and provide insight into the impact of these types of programs on turnover and retention of new graduate nurses in a home care context.</p>
<p>Findings of this study are consistent with other research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1084822312473828">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1084822312473828">21</xref></sup> that has highlighted the importance of structured support by preceptors in creating confidence and fostering independence. In the current study, preceptors remained helpful beyond completion of formal preceptorships by offering ongoing assistance in problem solving and decision making.</p>
<p>As noted in previous research,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1084822312473828">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1084822312473828">9</xref></sup> support must be available from multiple sources. This study shows new graduates perceive support from team members as integral to easing their transition into independent practice, while support from other new graduates provides a sense of camaraderie. The value participants of this study placed on support suggests the presence of adequate support structures during orientation, preceptorship, and beyond may help retain new graduate nurses.</p>
<p>Despite the importance of support to the transition and retention of new graduate nurses in home care, this study also shows support may be inadequate as a singular strategy. This study, as well as others conducted in both hospital<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1084822312473828">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1084822312473828">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1084822312473828">22</xref></sup> and home care settings,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1084822312473828">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1084822312473828">8</xref></sup> indicates that being confronted by numerous unexpected realities of the job can negatively affect the transitioning process and ultimately retention. This study shows that like their peers employed in hospital settings, new graduates working in home care experience a similar element of surprise at various unexpected realities of nursing work. Unlike hospital nurses however, this study suggests that new home care nurses experience these realities only once they have begun independent practice. As a result, even lengthy orientation and preceptorship periods may not provide adequate opportunity to experience all aspects of the job. Findings also indicate that for some, the shock experienced when these realities come to light may be difficult to overcome and may play a central role in their intent to leave their jobs.</p>
<p>The impact of unexpected realities on new graduates is especially significant, as findings suggest the structure of the home care system may have an equal if not greater influence on retention of new graduate nurses, especially in jurisdictions like Ontario where home care services are procured and delivered through managed competition models. This, as well as other studies exploring issues of retention of nurses working in community settings,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1084822312473828">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1084822312473828">24</xref></sup> illustrates how structural factors that affect compensation for time and expenses and a system where instability of work hours is a norm, can contribute to nurses’ intent to leave home care. What is especially important is that in this study, the negative impact of these systemic factors for participants did not seem to be mitigated by success and support in the transitioning process. As such, strategies implemented at the employer level to help new employees transition into home care work may not be effective at combating the impact of broader systemic factors. Retention strategies therefore must be directed to address both systemic challenges and the need for support during the transition period.</p>
<sec id="section23-1084822312473828">
<title>Recommendations</title>
<p>Given the challenges related to nurse staffing shortages in home care, the effective recruitment and retention of nursing staff, including new graduate nurses, is important.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1084822312473828">2</xref></sup> Notwithstanding the impact of systemic factors on new graduate nurses’ experiences in home care, the findings of this study clearly support continuation of extended orientation and preceptorship programs for new graduate nurses beginning their careers in home care. While potentially expensive, costs associated with extended orientation programs might ultimately be mitigated by savings achieved through decreased turnover of new nurses. Indeed, these programs could provide the extra clinical and emotional support from preceptors, mentors, peers, and nursing colleagues that participants in this study and others have identified as critical to their transition into the job. Interactions with peers could be accomplished in person or via tele/videoconferencing. Furthermore, this study supports the importance of developing mechanisms within home care agencies to provide preceptors, clinical resource staff, and supervisors with increased education about strategies to support new graduate nurses, foster their independence, and assess their progress, confidence, and readiness for practice.</p>
<p>Although broad systemic change is unrealistic at this time, addressing systemic challenges is crucial. To minimize surprises stemming from the structure of the home care system, employers need to ensure new graduates are informed of the realities of home care nursing work including the potential for extended workdays, fluctuating work hours, additional work at home following the completion of their client visits, and possible expenses associated with using one’s own car and cell phone along with processes for reimbursement of these expenses. One way to increase this type of awareness is for home care agencies to work with academic partners to increase the number of clinical placements in home care. A second recommendation is to increase content about home care in nursing curricula. These recommendations may help new graduates develop a more realistic understanding of the realities of home care practice and thus help new nurses anticipate and strategize for the unexpected realities of the job.</p>
<p>Future research should include further exploration of new graduates’ experiences of developing confidence and independence, and the relationship of the process of transitioning on retention in a home care nursing context. Research formally evaluating the effectiveness of extended orientation and preceptorship programs in home care is warranted. A quantitative design could be used to explore the relationship between turnover intent among new graduate home care nurses and the personal, relational, and systemic factors that seem to be related to retention and turnover.</p>
<p>The use of phenomenological methodology allowed for a broad exploration of new graduate nurses’ experiences in home care. The three distinct dimensions of the new graduate nurses’ experiences (personal, relational, and systemic) can serve as a launching point for future research exploring new graduate nurses working in home care. Insight into factors affecting turnover of new graduate nurses in home care may be useful for home care employers in developing strategies to retain new graduate nurses both during and following orientation, preceptorship, and transition to independent nursing practice.</p>
