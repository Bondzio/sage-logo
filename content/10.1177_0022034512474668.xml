<abstract>
<p>The whisker pad area (WP) is innervated by the second branch of the trigeminal nerve and experiences allodynia and hyperalgesia following transection of the mental nerve (MN; the third branch of the trigeminal nerve). However, the mechanisms of this extra-territorial pain remain unclear. The ionotropic P2X<sub>7</sub> ATP receptor (P2X<sub>7</sub>) in microglia is known to potentiate, <italic>via</italic> cytokines, the perception of noxious stimuli, raising the possibility that P2X<sub>7</sub> and cytokines are involved in this extra-territorial pain. One day after MN transection (MNT), WP allodynia/hyperalgesia developed, which lasted for &gt; 8 wks. Activation of microglia and up-regulation of P2X<sub>7</sub>, membrane-bound tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (mTNF-α), and soluble TNF-α (sTNF-α) in the trigeminal sensory nuclear complex (TNC) were evident for up to 6 wks after MNT. Allodynia/hyperalgesia after MNT was blocked by intracisternal administration of etanercept, a recombinant TNF-α receptor (p75)-Fc fusion protein. Intracisternal A438079, a P2X<sub>7</sub> antagonist, also attenuated allodynia/hyperalgesia and blocked up-regulation of mTNF-α and sTNF-α in the TNC. We conclude that sTNF-α released by microglia following P2X<sub>7</sub> activation may be important in both the initiation and maintenance of extra-territorial pain after MNT.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Several studies have implicated ATP-gated P2X<sub>7</sub> ion channels (P2X<sub>7</sub>) in pain hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512474668">Honore <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512474668">Ito <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). The distribution of abnormal pain that accompanies peripheral neuropathies often does not coincide with nerve territories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034512474668">Tal and Bennett, 1994</xref>). This “extra-territorial pain” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034512474668">Tal and Bennett, 1994</xref>) has been reported in the trigeminal system. After transection of the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) or mental nerve (MN), the whisker pad area (WP), which is innervated by the maxillary nerve, displayed mechanical allodynia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034512474668">Iwata <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034512474668">Piao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034512474668">Takahashi <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). In this model, allodynia/hyperalgesia was not induced in the injured dermatome region, <italic>i.e.</italic>, the lower lip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034512474668">Takahashi <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>), and because the MN was completely transected, perception of stimulus to the lower lip was completely inhibited. Therefore, MN transection (MNT) causes extra-territorial, but not intra-territorial, pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034512474668">Takahashi <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). We have suggested that IL-1b released from astrocytes in the dorsal portion of the trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (Vc, where the third trigeminal branch terminates) in response to MNT acts on nociceptive neurons in the medial portion of Vc (where the second trigeminal branch terminates) to affect pain perception in non-injured skin territory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034512474668">Takahashi <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, minocycline (a microglia inhibitor) reduces cell activation and inhibits phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) in microglia and attenuates the development of pain hypersensitivity following IAN transection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034512474668">Piao <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Microglia are probably involved in the onset of allodynia in intact skin territories adjacent to the denervated region following MNT. Indeed, our recent study reports that phosphorylated p38 (p-p38 MAPK) may, <italic>via</italic> P2X<sub>7</sub>, induce intra-territorial pain in the same nerve territory following chronic constriction injury of the infraorbital nerve (CCI-IoN) in a mechanism most likely involving tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α release from microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512474668">Ito <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Several reports support the concept that microglia participate in the establishment, but not maintenance, of chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034512474668">Raghavendra <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512474668">Zhuang <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), although this paradigm remains unproven (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034512474668">Stuesse <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034512474668">Winkelstein and DeLeo, 2002</xref>).</p> <p>In the present study, we examined the role of P2X<sub>7</sub> and inflammatory cytokines produced by microglia in orofacial pain mechanisms at the intact facial region dermatomes following MNT and tested whether microglial activation mediates the initiation and/or maintenance of chronic pain in a MNT model.</p>

<title>Materials &amp; Methods</title>
<p>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (wt, 200-250 g; Charles River Laboratories, Yokohama, Japan) were used. Animals were kept in separate cages in a controlled environment (lights on 08:00–20:00, 22°C) with food and water freely available. The animal model adhered to the International Association for the Study of Pain ethical guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034512474668">Zimmermann, 1983</xref>) and ARRIVE guidelines for animal research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512474668">Kilkenny <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>) and was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Hiroshima University (Approval number A09-88).</p>
<p>MNT was performed by a method described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034512474668">Takahashi <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Briefly, the MN was exposed, ligated with 4-0 silk, and sectioned distal to the ligation. Sham-operated controls were rats whose MN were exposed but not transected.</p>
<p>Tactile allodynia/hyperalgesia was assessed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034512474668">Takahashi <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Briefly, the rats were habituated to stand on a soft pad and lean against the experimenter’s hand. A series of calibrated von Frey filaments with bending forces ranging from 0.4 to 60 g was applied to the WP. Active withdrawal of the head from the probing filament was defined as a response to a stimulus. Response frequencies [(number of responses/number of stimuli) × 100%] to a range of von Frey filament forces were determined to construct a stimulus-response (S-R) curve. Non-linear regression analysis of this curve produced an EF<sub>50</sub> value, defined as the von Frey filament force (g) that produces a 50% response frequency. Drug effects on this EF<sub>50</sub> were quantified in the ipsilateral, but not contralateral, WP, given our previous demonstration that allodynia/hyperalgesia was not detected in the contralateral WP following MNT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034512474668">Takahashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>) and that these drugs had no influence on normal pain responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512474668">Ito <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Drugs were delivered into the cerebrospinal fluid space around the medullary dorsal horn as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034512474668">Takahashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Briefly, PE10 tubing (Intramedic, Hellerup, Denmark) was inserted into the subarachnoid space with the tip located at the level of the Vc and fastened by silk sutures (5-0). A P2X<sub>7</sub>-selective antagonist (A438079, 3.5 mg/mL, 10 µL; TOCRIS Bioscience, Ellisville, MO, USA), a recombinant TNF-α receptor (p75)-Fc fusion protein (etanercept, 1 or 10 µg/mL, 5 µL; Enbrel™, Immunex, Seattle, WA, USA), or recombinant rat TNF (0.1 pg/µL, 10 µL; PeproTech EC Ltd., London, UK) was administered as a bolus <italic>via</italic> this PE10 catheter. Determination of A438079 concentration by CCI-IoN is described in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512474668">Ito <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). All drugs were dissolved in 0.15 M NaCl.</p>
<p>Immunofluorescence studies were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034512474668">Takahashi <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Briefly, 30-µm-thick sections of the trigeminal sensory nuclear complex (TNC) were incubated overnight with anti-P2X<sub>7</sub> antibodies (rabbit, 1:1,000; Alomone Labs Ltd., Jerusalem, Israel) or anti-Iba1 (goat, 1:400; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), anti-GFAP (mouse, 1:10,000; Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA), or anti-neuronal nuclei (NeuN mouse, 1:3,000; Chemicon International, Temecula, CA, USA). After being washed with 0.1 M PBS, sections were incubated for 2 hrs with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG, or Alexa Fluor 488- conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:400; Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, US). Digital images were captured by means of a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Lsm5 Pascal; Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) or fluorescence microscope (BZ-9000; Keyence, Osaka, Japan).</p>
<p>Preparation of spinal samples and western blotting were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512474668">Ito <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Briefly, a block of caudal brainstem tissue was excised, punched out, and homogenized in solubilization buffer. Protein (15 µg) was separated on 15% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (BIO-RAD Lab., Hercules, CA, USA). Blots were incubated with anti-P2X<sub>7</sub> antibody (rabbit, 1:500; Alomone Labs Ltd), anti-TNF-α (rabbit, 1:500; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-p-p38 MAPK (rabbit, 1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology), or anti-Iba1 (goat, 1:1,000, Abcam). Membranes were washed with TBS and incubated with horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:2,000; Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) or anti-goat IgG (1:2,000; BETHYL Lab. Inc., Montgomery, TX, USA), and immunoreactivity was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Plus kit; GE Healthcare, Hertfordshire, UK). We quantified protein in each lane by re-probing the membrane with anti-β-actin antibody (1:2,000; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) and by Coomassie blue staining. Processed films were digitized and immunoreactive bands densitometrically quantified with Image J software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). Pixel density in the relevant protein band is presented as a percentage of pixel density in the control band.</p>
<p>Data are presented as the mean ± SEM. Statistical comparisons of multiple groups were made by one- or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the Dunn-Bonferroni post-test. Any <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered significant in all cases. For animals subjected to repeated tests, ANOVA with repeated measures was used, with time representing a within-animal effect. <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered significant in all cases.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034512474668">Takahashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), mechanical stimuli elicited increased responses and reduced response thresholds in the ipsilateral, but not contralateral, WP from 24 hrs to 8 wks after MNT, a characteristic of tactile hyperalgesia and allodynia in intact facial region dermatomes following MNT (data not shown).</p>
<p>Western blotting demonstrated a significant increase in P2X<sub>7</sub> protein levels at all measured time points after MNT compared with naive rats (n = 5 for each) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512474668">Fig. 1a</xref>), but no difference between naive and sham-operated groups at 24 hrs and 3 days (n = 5). P2X<sub>7</sub> immunofluorescence was co-localized in the Vc with the microglial marker, Iba1, suggesting that these microglia express P2X<sub>7</sub>. Neither astrocytes nor neurons expressed P2X<sub>7</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512474668">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p>

Naive rats exhibited no overt signs of microglial activation in the Vc. However, on the ipsilateral side of the Vc after MNT, microglia had profound Iba1 immunoreactivity and were hyper- activated. After MNT, activated microglia were spread diffusely throughout the dorsal third of the Vc at 24 hrs before forming dense clusters focused within the ipsilateral dorsal portion of the Vc at 3 days and lasting over 3 wks. At 6 wks after MNT, activated microglia had once more spread diffusely across the Vc.</p>

TNC tissue was punched out and total protein isolated. Blots shown are representative of 5 independent repeats and show immunoreactive bands at 45 kDa (β-actin), 38 kDa (p-p38 MAPK), 25 kDa (mTNF-α), and 17 kDa (sTNF-α and Iba1).

<p>We then quantified Iba1 protein levels, which are determined by both the number of activated microglial cells and their degree of activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512474668">Scholz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) and are thus excellent markers of microglial activation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512474668">Fig. 2b</xref>, western blotting showed a significant increase in Iba1 protein levels at all measured time points after MNT compared with naive rats (n = 5 for each time point).</p>
<p>The TNF-α-converting enzyme (TACE/ADAM-17) cleaves membrane-bound TNF-α (mTNF-α) to generate soluble TNF-α (sTNF-α). Recently, we showed that p-p38 MAPK may, <italic>via</italic> P2X<sub>7</sub>, induce sTNF-α release by microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512474668">Ito <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>), so we also examined p-p38 MAPK, mTNF-α and sTNF-α protein levels in the Vc following MNT. We found a significant increase in p-p38 MAPK, mTNF-α, and sTNF-α proteins at all measured time points after MNT compared with naive rats (n = 5 for each time point) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512474668">Fig. 2b</xref>). There was no significant difference between the levels of Iba1, p-p38 MAPK, mTNF-α, and sTNF-α in naive and sham-operated groups at 24 hrs and 3 days after sham operation (n = 5).</p>
<p>We next discovered that intracisternal treatment of rats with the P2X<sub>7</sub> antagonist, A438079, starting at 30 min before MNT, completely prevented allodynia/hyperalgesia on the ipsilateral WP following MNT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512474668">Fig. 3a</xref>). After these behavioral tests, expression of P2X<sub>7</sub>, Iba1, p-p38 MAPK, and TNF-α in the TNC was examined by immunohistochemistry or western blotting. In both saline- and A438079-treated rats, we found that microglia in the ipsilateral Vc had profound Iba1 immunoreactivity and were in an activated state (data not shown). Similarly, P2X<sub>7</sub> and Iba1 proteins increased significantly in both saline- and A438079-treated rats compared with naive rats (n = 4 for each) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512474668">Fig. 3b</xref>), indicating that A438079 did not affect microglial activation or induction of P2X<sub>7</sub> following MNT. In contrast, A438079 significantly inhibited the up-regulation of mTNF-α, sTNF-α, and p-p38 MAPK levels following MNT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512474668">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p>

<p>To clarify the functional relevance of TNF-α in prolonged extra-territorial allodynia/hyperalgesia following trigeminal nerve injury in the rat WP, we examined the effects of intracisternal administration of etanercept. In pre-drug experiments, we confirmed a significant decrease in EF<sub>50</sub> in the ipsilateral WP at all measured time points after MNT compared with baseline. At each time point, saline (20 µL/rat, n = 5) or etanercept (5 or 50 ng/rat, n = 5 for each) was injected intracisternally. Administration of 50 (but not 5) ng etanercept significantly increased EF<sub>50</sub> on the ipsilateral WP relative to saline control rats and pre-drug values in the same group. These effects of etanercept were evident 2 to 48 hrs after administration and indicate that etanercept dose-dependently alleviates extra-territorial tactile allodynia/hyperalgesia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512474668">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we examined whether etanercept could prevent MNT-induced up-regulation of TNF-α in the TNC. At 24 hrs after MNT, saline (20 µL/rat; n = 4) or etanercept (50 ng/rat; n = 4) was injected intracisternally, and after a further 24 hrs, TNC tissue was punched out and total protein isolated. Etanercept, but not saline, prevented the up-regulation of sTNF-α but not that of mTNF-α (see Appendix Fig. 1).</p>
<p>Finally, we confirmed that intracisternal infusion of recombinant TNF induced tactile allodynia/hyperalgesia in the WP (Appendix Fig. 2, Appendix Results).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We aimed to investigate the functional role of P2X<sub>7</sub> and cytokines in trigeminal neuropathic pain in the WP (innervated by the maxillary nerve), following transection of the MN (a branch of the mandibular nerve). We demonstrated that activation of P2X<sub>7</sub> in microglia facilitates perception of noxious stimuli <italic>via</italic> TNF-α in the TNC and is essential for both the initiation and maintenance of extra-territorial allodynia/hyperalgesia following MNT.</p>
<p>Minocycline reduced microglial activation, inhibited p-p38 MAPK activation in microglia, and attenuated pain hypersensitivity in the WP following IAN transection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034512474668">Piao <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Therefore, hyperactive microglia could facilitate the onset of allodynia in intact skin territories adjacent to the denervated region following IAN transection. The middle and dorsal portions of the Vc receive afferents from the second and third branches of the trigeminal nerve, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034512474668">Noma <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Following MNT, microglial activation, which may induce TNF-α <italic>via</italic> P2X<sub>7</sub>, was induced in the dorsal Vc, where MN afferents terminate. Alternatively, our recent study demonstrated Fos activation evoked within the medial portion of Vc following application of non-noxious mechanical stimulation of the WP after MNT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034512474668">Takahashi <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). In addition, as shown in Appendix Fig. 1, etanercept prevents both the up- regulation of sTNF-α and the allodynia/hyperalgesia experienced following MNT, and thus may act as a scavenger that sequesters sTNF-α and precludes its visualization in western blotting. Treatment of rats with 3ʹ-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl) adenosine 5ʹ-triphosphate, a P2X<sub>7</sub> agonist, induced allodynia/hyperalgesia and up-regulation of sTNF-α and p-p38 MAPK in the TNC, and these responses (except p38 up-regulation) were inhibited by etanercept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512474668">Ito <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Analysis of these data suggests that, following MNT, sTNF-α released from microglia <italic>via</italic> P2X<sub>7</sub> activation at the dorsal portion of the Vc produces paracrine signaling, acting on nociceptive neurons in the Vc to affect pain perception in non-injured skin territories.</p>
<p>Our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034512474668">Takahashi <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>), with an identical MNT model, concluded that IL-1β released from astrocytes enhanced NMDA receptor phosphorylation on secondary neurons, which contributes to extra-territorial tactile allodynia/hyperalgesia. Our previous and present studies clearly demonstrated that there may be different pathways contributing to extra-territorial tactile allodynia/hyperalgesia <italic>via</italic> astrocytes or microglia. Although the priority of these different pathways remains to be established, intrathecal injection of astrocytes, which were prepared from cerebral cortexes of neonatal mice and briefly stimulated by TNF-α, induced mechanical allodynia in the paw (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034512474668">Gao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Therefore, there is a possibility that sTNF-α released from microglia following P2X<sub>7</sub> activation may activate astrocytes and induce the release of IL-1β in this MNT model.</p>
<p>In this study, the P2X<sub>7</sub> antagonist, A438079, was able to block changes in TNF-α, p-p38 MAPK, and behavior without altering Iba1 protein levels, suggesting that microglial activation during extra-territorial pain does not depend on P2X<sub>7</sub> and posing the interesting question of what <italic>does</italic> activate these microglia. Several endogenous molecules (<italic>e.g</italic>., ATP and fibronectin) induce both morphological microglial activation and allodynia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034512474668">Nakagawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034512474668">Tsuda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Microglia can also, in response to extracellular ligand binding, secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines that modulate neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034512474668">Inoue and Tsuda, 2009</xref>), although mice deficient in the neuronal chemokine, CCL21, developed no signs of neuropathic pain after spinal nerve injury, despite evident morphological microglial activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034512474668">Biber <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Based on these recent studies and our present study, microglial morphology may be insufficient to predict function in pathological pain scenarios. Nevertheless, our study clearly suggests that P2X<sub>7</sub> activation in microglia causes p38 MAPK phosphorylation and subsequent sTNF-α release, which may be involved in extra- territorial allodynia/hyperalgesia, but not in the morphological activation of microglia.</p>
<p>We conclude that sTNF-α produced by microglia following P2X<sub>7</sub> activation appears to be involved in both the initiation and maintenance of extra-territorial tactile allodynia/hyperalgesia following MNT (see also Appendix Discussion).</p>
