<p>In <italic>The Rhetoric of Racist Humour</italic>, Simon Weaver presents a rhetorical critique of racist humor, explaining “what racist humour does and how it does it” (p. 2). Weaver draws extensively on theory, literature, and many specific examples of relevant themes for various types of racist humor. This book fills a gap in the literature by discussing racist humor as an active part of the process of “othering” and ambiguity between racial groups, instead of as simply a result of these processes.</p>
<p>The introduction outlines the argument and presents current approaches to, as well as challenges associated with, studying humor. Chapters One and Two establish the foundation for analysis of the rhetoric of humor in general, and humor as order-building specifically. Chapter Three focuses on embodied racism and uses examples of U.S. internet joking, distinguishing this type of racist joke from non-stereotyped jokes. In Chapter Four, cultural racism, or “new racism,” is discussed and applied in examples of British stand-up comedy. Chapters Five and Six discuss reverse discourse as attempts to reverse initial racist meaning, and how it is applied in black and Asian comic performance, respectively. Chapters Seven and Eight focus on two specific examples of liquid, postmodern, or “layered” racism (p. 153): Sacha Baron Cohen’s character, Ali G, and the publication of cartoons illustrating the Islamic Prophet Muhammad in the Danish newspaper, <italic>Jyllands-Posten</italic>. The conclusion addresses the continuing shift toward postmodern humor and its accompanying polysemia.</p>
<p>The main themes are discussed throughout the book, but individual chapters may be especially useful for exploring a specific element or type of racist humor. Graduate students and scholars studying the sociology of humor, as well as those interested in related topics in popular culture and communications, will find this book informative.</p>
