<abstract>
<p>In this study, the authors investigated the role of social skills in disciplinary exclusion by examining parent and teacher ratings of students as having either high or low social skills. Data were drawn from 1,438 students from the Special Education Elementary Longitudinal Study. Findings indicated that social skills mediated disciplinary inclusion for students with the following characteristics: males, African Americans, students identified with emotional and behavioral disorders and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and students from low-income backgrounds. Moreover, students with high social skills were subject to disciplinary exclusion less often than peers with lower social skills. More research regarding the relationship of social skills to disciplinary exclusion is warranted due to the positive effects of high social skills.</p>

<p>Student conduct in schools and appropriate ways to deal with student misbehavior have traditionally been a primary concern of educators; however, recently, the topic has received even more attention in both general and special education due to increased accountability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1044207311422908">L. H. Brown &amp; Beckett, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1044207311422908">Sundius &amp; Farneth, 2008</xref>) as a result of recent legislation and the increase in use of zero-tolerance school discipline policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1044207311422908">Skiba &amp; Peterson, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Historically, teachers and administrators have used strategies such as verbal warnings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1044207311422908">Swinson &amp; Knight, 2007</xref>), loss of privileges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1044207311422908">Brownstein, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1044207311422908">Rusby, Taylor, &amp; Foster, 2007</xref>), detention, meetings with parents, and other techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1044207311422908">Colvin &amp; Kame’enui, 1993</xref>) to punish and deter student misbehavior. However, beginning in the early 1990s, many schools adopted zero-tolerance policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1044207311422908">Skiba, 2008</xref>) based on the assumption that harsh penalties would deter problem behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1044207311422908">Ewing, 2000</xref>) and create a climate conducive to learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1044207311422908">Rausch &amp; Skiba, 2004</xref>). Zero-tolerance policies in schools began with the passage of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1044207311422908">Gun-Free Schools Act (1994)</xref>. Federal policy mandated a 1-year expulsion for possession of firearms on school grounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1044207311422908">Skiba &amp; Peterson, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Two common practices of disciplinary exclusion are suspension and expulsion. Although expulsion is used infrequently compared with other methods of discipline, suspension is among the most common responses to misconduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1044207311422908">Skiba, 2000</xref>), especially in middle and high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1044207311422908">Skiba &amp; Sprague, 2008</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1044207311422908">Brownstein (2010)</xref>, between 1974 and 2006, rates of disciplinary exclusion almost doubled, from 3.7% of students in 1974 to 7.1% of students in 2006. Furthermore, during the 2007–2008 school year, almost half of all public schools took at least one serious disciplinary action against a student, with more than 75% of such actions being suspensions of 5 or more days, almost 20% being transfer to a specialized school, and 5% being expulsion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1044207311422908">Dinkes, Kemp, &amp; Baum, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1044207311422908">Sundius and Farneth (2008)</xref> found that the increase of disciplinary exclusion concerns administrators because provisions in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1044207311422908">No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) of 2001</xref> (NCLB, 2003) allow students to transfer to other schools if a school is considered “persistently dangerous.” NCLB allows each state to define “persistently dangerous.”</p>
<p>Although the intention of zero-tolerance policies is to make schools safer by instituting harsh penalties for students who bring weapons or drugs to school, these policies are used for less serious infractions as well. For instance, students have been suspended for being disobedient and disrespectful, for attendance problems, for general classroom disruptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1044207311422908">Skiba, 2000</xref>), for excessive noise, and for loitering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1044207311422908">Sundius &amp; Farneth, 2008</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1044207311422908">Dinkes et al. (2009)</xref> reported that the leading cause of serious disciplinary action is insubordination. These less serious infractions are not based on objective criteria but involve the judgment of school personnel, making application of suspension and expulsion a significant issue.</p>
<p>Despite the intent, disciplinary exclusion has been shown to have adverse consequences for students. For example, students who were subject to disciplinary exclusion were more likely to fall behind their peers academically, and disciplinary exclusion has been correlated with greater risk of dropping out of school and higher rates of exclusion in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1044207311422908">Brownstein, 2010</xref>). In addition, there is a correlation between schools with higher rates of exclusion and lower average passing rates on statewide tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1044207311422908">Skiba, Rausch, &amp; Ritter, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, disciplinary exclusion has not been shown to reduce behavior problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1044207311422908">Skiba, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1044207311422908">Verdugo, 2002</xref>), contrary to original assumptions.</p>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1044207311422908">1997</xref> amendments to the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1044207311422908">2004</xref> reauthorization (Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act) recognized that students with disabilities are entitled to, and perhaps need, special protection from disciplinary exclusion. A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1044207311422908">U.S. Department of Education (2000)</xref> study suggested that although students with the most severe emotional or behavioral problems constituted between 1% and 5% of a school’s population, they consumed more than 50% of teachers’ and administrators’ time. In addition, students with disabilities were less skilled at avoiding detection, and were more likely to be excluded due to poor social skills, judgment, and planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1044207311422908">Leone, Mayer, Malmgren, &amp; Meisel, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite special protections, students with disabilities have been disproportionately represented in disciplinary exclusion statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1044207311422908">Krezmien, Leone, &amp; Achilles, 2006</xref>). Although students with disabilities constitute approximately 11% of school-age students between the ages of 6 and 21, they constitute almost 20% of all suspensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1044207311422908">Leone et al., 2000</xref>). Several studies have shown that students with emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD), learning disabilities (LD), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) experience higher rates of exclusion than their peers in other disability categories and students in general education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1044207311422908">Achilles, McLaughlin, &amp; Croninger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1044207311422908">Krezmien et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1044207311422908">Wagner, Newman, &amp; Cameto, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1044207311422908">Zhang, Katsiyannis, &amp; Herbst, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, among these three disability categories (EBD, LD, ADHD), students identified as EBD were more likely to be subject to disciplinary exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1044207311422908">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>). The National Longitudinal Transition Study-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1044207311422908">SRI International, 2006</xref>) found that suspensions and expulsions of students identified with EBD increased considerably as they transitioned from elementary to middle and to high school and that these students dropped out of school at the highest rate, at greater than 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1044207311422908">Wagner et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Ethnicity has also been associated with higher rates of disciplinary exclusion for students with disabilities. For example, African American students are disproportionately referred and disciplined compared with Caucasian students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1044207311422908">Achilles et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1044207311422908">Kaufman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1044207311422908">Skiba, Peterson, &amp; Williams, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1044207311422908">Townsend, 2000</xref>) even though African American students do not misbehave at greater rates than their White, non-Hispanic counterparts as evidenced by similar disciplinary referral rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1044207311422908">Skiba, Michael, Nardo, &amp; Peterson, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1044207311422908">Skiba et al. (2004)</xref> found that African American students were four times as likely to be suspended and almost two and a half times as likely to be expelled as White students; Hispanic students as a group were nearly twice as likely to be suspended or expelled as White students. In addition, other research has indicated that Hispanic students and Native American students were also excluded at higher rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1044207311422908">Krezmien et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1044207311422908">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Other factors associated with disciplinary exclusion for students with disabilities are age, gender, and socioeconomic status (SES). Thus, disciplinary exclusion has been found to be a largely male phenomenon, and rates of exclusion for male students have tended to increase over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1044207311422908">Achilles et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1044207311422908">Fasko, Grubb, &amp; Osborne, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1044207311422908">Wagner et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, students from low SES backgrounds are excluded at higher rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1044207311422908">Skiba, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1044207311422908">Wagner et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Understanding the impact of students’ social skills on the chances of being excluded is important for decreasing disciplinary exclusion of students with disabilities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1044207311422908">Gresham, Sugai, and Horner (2001)</xref> viewed social skills as comprising five dimensions: (a) peer relational skills, (b) self-management skills, (c) academic skills, (d) compliance skills, and (e) assertion skills. Social skills deficiencies are an important defining characteristic in high-incidence disabilities such as LD, ADHD, mental retardation, and emotional disturbance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1044207311422908">Gresham et al., 2001</xref>), and social skills deficits mean that students with disabilities may have difficulties relating to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1044207311422908">Cadwallader, Cameto, Blackorby, Giacalone, &amp; Wagner, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Research involving social skills indicates their importance for success in school and later in life. For example, parents and teachers in the Pre-Elementary Education Longitudinal Study reported that social skills were an important indicator of ease of transition into kindergarten (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1044207311422908">Carlson et al., 2009</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1044207311422908">Hair, Jager, and Garrett (2002)</xref>, students with strong social skills were more apt to be accepted by peers and develop friendships, have stronger relationships with parents and peers, were seen as effective problem solvers, have greater interest in school, and earn higher grades. In addition, peer-related social skills increase in importance as students exit the elementary level due to the increased importance of peer ecology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1044207311422908">Crockett, Losoff, &amp; Petersen, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1044207311422908">Dornbusch, 1989</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1044207311422908">Kohler and Field (2003)</xref> identified social skills as necessary for successful transition to postsecondary life, whereas other research has found that social skills are an important general predictor of a student’s level of self-determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1044207311422908">Pierson, Carter, Lane, &amp; Glaeser, 2008</xref>). Moreover, investigating adults with mild intellectual disabilities, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1044207311422908">Holmes and Fillary (2000)</xref> found that higher social skills were related to perceived competency in the workplace regardless of task difficulty.</p>
<p>Despite the importance of social skills for several school outcomes, the relationship with disciplinary exclusion has not been well researched. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1044207311422908">Raffaele Mendez, Knoff, and Ferron (2002)</xref>, in a study of a large ethnically diverse school district in Florida, determined that elementary schools with low out-of-school suspension rates reported using social skills training to communicate behavioral expectations to students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1044207311422908">Meyer and Farrell (1998)</xref> studied the effect of their RIPP (Respond in Peaceful and Positive Ways) program, a curriculum that includes social skills instruction. Their findings indicated that students who participated in the RIPP curriculum displayed a lower incidence of violence and fewer in-school suspensions. It is important to note that these studies did not investigate social skills, but social skills were a part of the studies.</p>
<p>The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relationship between social skills and disciplinary exclusion to test our hypothesis that students with high levels of social skills are subject to less disciplinary exclusion. Specifically, we were interested in determining whether student social skills acted as a mediator of the relationship between disciplinary exclusion and student demographic characteristics (i.e., gender, ethnicity, primary disability, and household income) associated with higher rates of disciplinary exclusion. The underlying research question was, “Is the linkage between various student characteristics and disciplinary exclusion mediated by social skills?” To answer this question, we used extant data from the Special Education Elementary Longitudinal Study (SEELS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1044207311422908">Wagner, Kutash, Duchnowski, &amp; Epstein, 2005</xref>). Variables were extracted from the data set to examine student demographic characteristics of gender, age, disability, ethnicity, and family income. Disciplinary exclusion was investigated through data on suspension and expulsion, and social skills were investigated through selected items from a research version of the Social Skills Rating System (SSRS), which was included in the original SEELS study. In addition, selected school and teacher variables were included in the analysis as control variables. Variables are described in greater detail in the Method section.</p>

<title>Participants and Procedures</title>
<p>Participants and data were drawn from Wave 1 of the SEELS study, a study of the needs, experiences, and outcomes of a nationwide sample of students in special education aged 6 through 12 in 1999. SEELS was conducted by SRI International and funded by the U.S. Department of Education. Detailed information about the SEELS design is provided elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1044207311422908">Wagner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1044207311422908">Wagner, Marder, Blackorby, &amp; Cardoso, 2002</xref>) and summarized below.</p>
<p>SEELS participants were selected in two stages. First, a stratified (geographic region, size, and wealth) random sample of 1,124 local education agencies (LEAs) was selected from the universe of approximately 14,000 LEAs serving special education students in Grades 1 to 7. A total of 245 LEAs and 32 special schools agreed to participate in the study and subsequently provided rosters of students receiving special education services. From these rosters, a stratified (primary disability) random sample of 11,512 students was selected to participate. Data were collected in three waves between the 1999–2000 and 2004–2005 school years. Data were collected through parent interviews, teacher and school administrator questionnaires, and direct assessment of students.</p>
<p>Participants for the current study were selected through a two-step process. The outcome of this process was a subsample of students rated similarly by parents and teachers as demonstrating high or low social skills. First, only participants with complete information on the social skill items in the Parent Interview and the Teacher Questionnaire in Wave 1 were selected for analysis. A research version of the SSRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1044207311422908">Gresham &amp; Elliot, 1990</xref>) was used in the SEELS study consisting of selected items from the three subscales that comprise the SSRS: the Social Skills Scale, the Problem Behaviors Scale, and the Academic Competence Scale. In Wave 1, a total of 9,747 parents answered all relevant SSRS items, and 6,201 teachers answered all relevant SSRS items; 4,524 students had complete surveys from both parent and teacher.</p>
<p>Second, from the sample of 4,524 students, total score ratings were sorted to determine students rated as having high social skills by both parent and teacher and students rated as having low social skills by both parent and teacher. High scores were defined as 0.50 standard deviations above the mean of the sum score of both parent and teacher ratings of SSRS items, and low scores were defined as 0.50 standard deviations below the mean of the sum score of both parent and teacher ratings of SSRS items. If parents rated their child high and the teacher rated the student low or vice versa, the set of scores was not used for this analysis. This procedure resulted in 1,438 participants. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1044207311422908">Table 1</xref> presents demographic information for the overall Wave 1 SEELS sample (<italic>N</italic> = 9,747), the sample with complete social skills data from parents and teachers (<italic>n</italic> = 4,524), and the final sample used for the analyses after applying the method for determining students with high and low social skills (<italic>n</italic> = 1,438).

<p>The method used to select the sample has two advantages. First, examining only matched high or low ratings from both teacher and parent yields greater confidence that a student has higher or lower social skills than examining only parent or teacher ratings individually. Second, removing a half standard deviation above and below the mean for both rating scales allowed us to highlight the contrast between students with high versus low social skill. In other words, type of rating was divided into three groups (half standard deviation above the mean, half standard deviation below the mean, and the middle group between the two “half standard deviations”).</p>
<p>Although dividing a continuous variable into three groups and only using the two extreme groups for analysis can result in smaller sample size and lower statistical power, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1044207311422908">Gelman and Park (2009)</xref> noted that this approach could yield better communication of the results and understanding of the effects. In addition, compared with the traditional median- or binary-split approach, categorization of a continuous variable into three groups can still maintain reasonably high statistical power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1044207311422908">Gelman &amp; Park, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section4-1044207311422908">
<title>Dependent variables</title>
<p>The dependent variable for the first part of the mediation analysis was high social skills (0.50 <italic>SD</italic> above the mean) versus low social skills (0.50 <italic>SD</italic> below the mean) as rated by parents and teachers. SRI selected 11 items from the SSRS for the Parent Interview and 24 items for the Teacher Questionnaire. Parents and teachers rated students on skills such as (a) makes friends easily, (b) starts conversations rather than waiting for others to initiate, (c) cooperates with others without prompting, (d) avoids situations that are likely to result in trouble, and (e) controls temper in conflict situations with others. In addition, teachers rated students on school-related social skills such as (a) easily transitions from one classroom activity to another, (b) follows your directions, and (c) asks for what he or she needs to do his or her best in class.</p>
<p>Parents and teachers used the same rating scheme for each item (0 = <italic>the child “never” displayed the behavior</italic>, 1 = <italic>the child displayed the described behavior “sometimes,”</italic> 2 = <italic>the child displayed the behavior “very often”</italic>). The reliability, presented by Cronbach’s alpha, was 0.80 for the parent measure and 0.90 for the teacher measure. Of the 1,438 students in the final sample, 53% were rated by both parents and teachers as having high social skills, and 47% were rated as having low social skills. The parent and teacher social skill measures possessed similar normal distributions: the mean of the sum score of parent ratings was 1.22 with a standard deviation of 0.37; the mean of the sum score of teacher ratings was 1.21 with a standard deviation of 0.37.</p>
<p>The dependent variable for the second part of the mediation analysis was student disciplinary exclusion. Disciplinary exclusion was based on two items from the SEELS Parent Interview. The first item asked parents to indicate whether their child had been suspended during the past school year (<italic>yes</italic> = 1, <italic>no</italic> = 0); the second item asked parents whether their child had been expelled during the past school year (<italic>yes</italic> = 1, <italic>no</italic> = 0). Any student who was reported to have been suspended or expelled was scored “<italic>yes</italic> = 1” on disciplinary exclusion.</p>
<p>For this study’s sample of 1,438 students, 12.6% had been either suspended or expelled in the past year as reported by parents; almost 25% of students rated as having low social skills had been suspended or expelled in the past year, whereas less than 2% of students with high social skills were subject to disciplinary exclusion.</p>

<sec id="section5-1044207311422908">
<title>Predictor variables</title>
<p>Five student characteristics variables were selected for inclusion in the study based on the literature reviewed earlier in this article: age, gender, ethnicity, primary disability, and household income. Analysis of data indicated no extreme outliers, and selected items were found to be normally distributed. Students’ ages in Wave 1 ranged from 7 to 14 years. Gender of the students was coded as <italic>female</italic> = 1 (36.5%) and <italic>male</italic> = 0 (63.5%). We selected students with primary disability labels of EBD, ADHD, and LD for analysis and grouped all other students into the disability category of “other disabilities,” which served as the reference group. Ethnicity was grouped into four categories: Caucasian (70.4%), which was the reference group, African American (16.1%), Hispanic (9.8%), and other (3.8%). Household income was a variable in the SEELS data set that was coded as follows: “1” &lt; US$25,000 (32.7% of the sample), “2” = US$25,001 to US$50,000 (28.2%), and “3” &gt; US$50,000 (36.7%).</p>

<p>The purpose of this study was to examine social skills as a mediator of the relationship between student demographic characteristics and disciplinary exclusion. Given that certain school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1044207311422908">Achilles et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1044207311422908">Raffaele Mendez et al., 2002</xref>) and teacher characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1044207311422908">Bulach &amp; Berry, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1044207311422908">Martin &amp; Shoho, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1044207311422908">Raffaele Mendez et al., 2002</xref>) may be associated with disciplinary exclusion and/or social skills, we controlled for these potential effects in the analyses. Specifically, we controlled for two school characteristics: (a) urban school (<italic>yes</italic> = 1; <italic>no</italic> = 0) and (b) positive school climate, an existing variable in the SEELS data set based on teacher report of their perceptions of school climate that ranged from 3 (<italic>not positive</italic>) to 12 (<italic>very positive</italic>). We also controlled for four teacher characteristics: (a) type of teacher certification (<italic>special education certification</italic> = 1; <italic>other certification</italic> = 0), (b) years of teaching experience (intervally scaled), (c) previous professional development in working with at-risk students or students with disabilities (<italic>yes</italic> = 1; <italic>no</italic> = 0), and (d) previous professional development in behavior management (<italic>yes</italic> = 1; <italic>no</italic> = 0).</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Logistic regression was chosen to analyze the data given that the outcome variables were dichotomous (i.e., high vs. low social skills, and excluded vs. not excluded). Logistic regression models were estimated in SPSS V.16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1044207311422908">Statistical Package for the Social Sciences [SPSS], 2008</xref>). The results are reported as odds ratios.</p>
<p>To test our research question regarding the mediation role of student social skills in linking student characteristics predictors and disciplinary exclusion, we used the approach proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1044207311422908">Baron and Kenny (1986)</xref>. Following the Baron and Kenny approach, the following regression models were estimated: (a) the mediator (i.e., student social skills) was regressed on the independent variables (i.e., student characteristics) to establish the relationships between student characteristics and student social skills; (b) the dependent variable (i.e., disciplinary exclusion) was regressed on the independent variables to examine the direct effects of student characteristics on disciplinary exclusion; and (c) the dependent variable (i.e., disciplinary exclusion) was regressed on both the independent variables and the mediator to examine the mediation effect of social skills on student characteristics.</p>
<p>To establish the mediation effect of social skills, the following conditions must hold: The student characteristics variables must be significantly related to the presumed mediator (student social skills), the student characteristics variables must be significantly related to the dependent variable (disciplinary exclusion), and student social skills must also be significantly related to disciplinary exclusion. If these conditions are all satisfied in the predicted direction, the changes in the estimated coefficients of the individual student characteristics variables to disciplinary exclusion in the models with and without social skills (the mediator) would provide an intuitive estimation of the mediation effects. The magnitude of the effect of the student characteristics variables on disciplinary exclusion must be less in the model including the mediator (i.e., social skills) than that excluding the mediator. The “indirect” routine in Mplus (V6.1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1044207311422908">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2010</xref>) was also used to test the significance of the mediation effects from the independent variables to disciplinary exclusion.</p>

<p>The effect of social skills on disciplinary exclusion and the student characteristics variables is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1044207311422908">Table 4</xref>. As illustrated, lower social skills were significantly associated with a higher probability of disciplinary exclusion (β<sub>Social Skills</sub> = −2.57, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, odds ratio = 0.08). In fact, students rated by parents and teachers as having low social skills were 12.5 times (1/0.08) more likely to have been suspended or expelled in the previous school year than were students with high social skills. The effects of gender, primary disability, and household income on disciplinary exclusion were still statistically significant, but the magnitude of every effect was smaller in the regression model that included social skills. Reductions in these coefficients (i.e., the coefficients in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1044207311422908">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1044207311422908">4</xref>) can be used as the indication of significant mediation effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1044207311422908">MacKinnon, 2008</xref>). Changes in the magnitude of effect for student age and student ethnicity were minimal and were not examined because these student characteristics variables were unrelated to social skills, the mediator variable in the study (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1044207311422908">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study examined student social skills as a mediator of the relationship between student demographic characteristics and disciplinary exclusion. Research at the national, state, and local levels indicates that use of disciplinary exclusion as a consequence for misbehavior has risen since the introduction of zero-tolerance policies in the 1980s. Research also indicates that disciplinary exclusion approaches are of questionable effectiveness and, in fact, are associated with later adverse consequences for students, such as greater risk of dropping out of school and higher rates of exclusion in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1044207311422908">Brownstein, 2010</xref>). A majority of the research that has examined correlates of disciplinary exclusion has focused on student demographic characteristics.</p>
<p>The results of this study affirm findings from previous research documenting that older students, males, students identified as EBD or ADHD, African American students, and students from low-income families have a higher probability of experiencing disciplinary exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1044207311422908">Achilles et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1044207311422908">Kaufman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1044207311422908">Krezmien et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1044207311422908">Skiba et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1044207311422908">Townsend, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1044207311422908">Wagner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1044207311422908">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The fact that these results replicate results from past studies lends credibility to our mediation model. At the same time, the study extends current research through its examination of social skills as a mediator of the relationship between student demographic characteristics and disciplinary exclusion. Thus, students rated by parents and teachers as having low social skills were 12.5 times more likely to be excluded from school than were students with high social skills. The effect of social skills as a mediator of the relationship between student demographic characteristics and disciplinary exclusion was evident in three important areas. First, there was a 21% reduction in the magnitude of the relationship between gender and disciplinary exclusion when student social skills were considered. Second, student social skills reduced by 23% the probability of being excluded for students identified as EBD. Finally, the probability of exclusion for students from low-income families was reduced by 30% when student social skills were high.</p>
<p>These findings are noteworthy because, although research on disciplinary exclusion helps us to understand who is excluded, it does not tell us how to address the problem as the characteristics of students who are excluded are not amenable to change. Conversely, social skills can be improved. Whereas past research on disciplinary exclusion has not focused on social skills, our research indicates that students with high levels of social skills are excluded less often than students who are rated as having low social skills.</p>
<p>The literature base on the effectiveness of social skills training is mixed. Some meta-analytic research has found weak effect sizes for high-incidence disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1044207311422908">Kavale &amp; Forness, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1044207311422908">Mathur, Kavale, Quinn, Forness, &amp; Rutherford, 1998</xref>); however, other analyses that only included students with LD and behavioral difficulties resulted in improved effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1044207311422908">Beelman, Pfingsten, &amp; Losel, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1044207311422908">Gresham, 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1044207311422908">1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1044207311422908">Hollinger, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1044207311422908">McIntosh, Vaughn, &amp; Zaragoza, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1044207311422908">Zaragoza, Vaughn, &amp; McIntosh, 1991</xref>). Meta-analytic research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1044207311422908">Gresham et al. (2001)</xref> confirmed that social skills training yields a wide variety of effects, but the authors posited several issues that may result in low effect sizes. For example, many studies did not provide social skills training with sufficient frequency and intensity. In addition, studies included interventions that were not linked to students’ social skills deficits. Finally, the authors concluded that many of the studies did not account for generalization. As a result, interventions did not account for the fact that previous behaviors may be viewed as more efficient in reaching goals, which might cause lower overall effect sizes.</p>
<sec id="section10-1044207311422908">
<title>Limitations and Implications for Research and Practice</title>
<p>Readers should consider two limitations to this study. First, this study used self-report data from parents and teachers as the primary source of information for the variables investigated. The accuracy of self-report data can be a concern if respondents feel compelled to provide a socially desirable response. In this study, if some parents felt it was undesirable to report their son or daughter as having been suspended or expelled, it is possible that rates of disciplinary exclusion were underreported. However, the use of self-report as a source of research information has a long history in special education, especially in longitudinal follow-up studies, and previous research has shown high levels of agreement among parents, students, and teachers for factual information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1044207311422908">Bullis, Bull, Johnson, &amp; Peters, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1044207311422908">Levine &amp; Edgar, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, sampling weights were not used in this study and as such the findings should not be used to draw conclusions about the national population of students with disabilities. However, this study’s findings on the role of social skills as a potential mediator of disciplinary exclusion for students with disabilities provide information that can inform practice and future research. A strength of the study was its use of information from both parents and teachers, and the use of procedures to distinguish high versus low ratings from both respondent groups. By analyzing data from parents and teachers and by removing students near the middle of both distributions, the study increased the chance that students rated high or low we rated correctly.</p>
<p>The role of social skills as a mediator of the relationship between student demographic characteristics and disciplinary exclusion should be studied more closely. Future research might investigate the following: Do certain social skills operate more strongly than others (e.g., prosocial skills vs. trouble-avoidance skills) to reduce the probability of disciplinary exclusion? Do these relationships vary by age, gender, or primary disability? What is the role of social skills instruction in the development and implementation of behavior plans? The relationship between social skills instruction and behavior plans is especially important because federal law requires schools to develop behavior plans for students at risk for behavior problems. Therefore, understanding how behavior plans can help reduce exclusion is an important goal. Other questions might include the following: What characteristics of a behavior plan make them more or less likely to be followed by students or teachers? Similarly, what characteristics of social skill training programs are most effective and most likely to be followed by students or teachers?</p>
<p>There is much research on, and broad consensus regarding, the effects of early detection and intervention of students with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1044207311422908">C. Brown, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1044207311422908">Makrygianni &amp; Reed, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1044207311422908">Wanzek &amp; Vaughn, 2007</xref>). Research indicates that maladaptive behaviors should be addressed early (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1044207311422908">Egeland, Kalkoske, Gottesman, &amp; Erickson, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1044207311422908">Walker, Colvin, &amp; Ramsey, 1995</xref>). Therefore, it is important to know which tools have the best accuracy rate at detecting risk for maladaptive behavior. Research should ask the following: Which are the most appropriate social skill screening tools for young children? How early can we detect potential behavior problems? Which are appropriate instruments for a full behavior evaluation?</p>
<p>With an ever-increasing focus on high-stakes testing in our schools, social skills may be viewed as a secondary concern for practitioners. However, given the high future cost of disciplinary exclusion, both academically and financially, social skills should be of primary importance. As a result, some researchers recommend that all children entering school be screened for behavioral issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1044207311422908">Conroy &amp; Brown, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1044207311422908">Kauffman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1044207311422908">Walker, Ramsey, &amp; Gresham, 2004</xref>) and that social skills training begin after screening as necessary.</p>
<p>Although teachers receive training on general classroom management techniques, teachers report difficulty in planning and implementing individualized programs to improve student behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1044207311422908">Safran &amp; Oswald, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1044207311422908">Scott, Nelson, &amp; Zabala, 2003</xref>) and feel unsupported and unprepared to deal with challenging behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1044207311422908">Dake, Fisher, Pumpian, Haring, &amp; Breen, 1993</xref>). Therefore, teacher training programs must ensure that preservice teachers understand how to work with students with behavioral difficulties, and practicing teachers should receive continuing training to reduce office referrals that may lead to disciplinary exclusion.</p>
<p>Furthermore, teachers may benefit from continued training in strategies on teaching social skills in the curriculum. Although many teachers do not allot a specific block of time for social skills instruction, social skills lessons can be embedded throughout the instructional day. For example, an appropriate time to teach social skills is when students work in groups or as teams. In addition, there are numerous opportunities to emphasize social skills during nonacademic time. For instance, social skills are used on the playground, in the cafeteria, and during restroom breaks. In the end, given the relationship between self-determination and social skills to affect positive transition outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1044207311422908">Pierson et al., 2008</xref>), teachers should be mindful of opportunities to teach both sets of skills as they plan instruction.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1044207311422908">Gresham et al.’s (2001)</xref> suggestions for effective social skills training are vital when planning intervention. Teachers must ensure that training is of sufficient frequency and intensity. In addition, interventions must be linked to students’ social skills deficits. Finally, skills acquisition must be judged across settings to determine generalization.</p>
<p>Administrators are directly charged with making the final decisions concerning disciplinary exclusion. This means that they must understand the academic and financial implications of disciplinary exclusion. Trainers of administrators should emphasize both the effects of and alternates to disciplinary exclusion given its ineffectiveness. In addition, a proactive approach of continued inservice training of teachers is a powerful tool that administrators can employ to support both teachers and students, which should result in fewer opportunities to enforce disciplinary exclusion.</p>
<p>Research indicates that parent involvement improves student’s social outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1044207311422908">Powell, Son, File, &amp; San Juan, 2010</xref>). Therefore, it is critical that the behavioral goals that are being worked on at school can be reinforced at home by caregivers. Likewise, by involving parents, teachers may understand sources of behavior, gain insights into how to motivate students, and be aware of behavioral goals that are important to parents.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The findings of this research reinforce the troubling relationship between student demographic characteristics and disciplinary exclusion, but due to the malleable nature of social skills, they also offer hope. More research is needed to investigate the role of social skills and disciplinary exclusion. Based on the results of the present study, such research may lead to strategies for reducing the likelihood of exclusion for students who are most at risk.</p>
