<abstract>
<p>This article focuses on the methodological challenges in one interview of the 60 in-depth interviews that comprise a research study of Israeli Druze currently underway. The study is being conducted by a pair of researchers, one a Canadian living in Israel, an English and Hebrew speaker, and one an Israeli Druze woman, a Hebrew and Arabic speaker. The interview examined here involves two interviewers, two interviewees, three languages and at least two cultural frameworks. The analysis treats the interview as an intrinsic case in order to expose the various contexts of the interview and how they affect the construction of meaning in this complex research situation.</p>

<p>Discussion of insider–outsider research is not new, but the challenges each researcher faces while conducting a cultural study are new to each study, every time, and must be examined because “the biographical journeys of researchers greatly influence their values, their research questions, and the knowledge they construct” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077800413482102">Banks, 1998</xref>, p. 4). Examination of the ways one is influenced by one’s own background is essentially a process of private researcher reflection, though it may well also involve consultation with research participants and research colleagues. Making transparent and public the ways this process affects the collection and interpretation of research data and what ultimately become the research results has become an important part of writing qualitative research, an ethical issue, and an essential element of a study’s internal validity.</p>
<sec id="section1-1077800413482102">
<title>Purpose and Background</title>
<p>This article will examine the methodological and ethical challenges presented by one interview in a study currently underway that includes 60 in-depth interviews, 30 with Israeli Druze in their 20s, and 30 with others in their 40s to 60s. The purpose here is not to present analysis of the content of the interview but to explore the factors affecting its conduct. The article is presented in the first person voice of one researcher but it is a product of the cooperative research and reflections of both, and thus it is a coauthored product. I wrestled with whether to try to write it in the first person plural as “we,” but in the end it was clear that would be less authentic. Part of what unfolded here was my deepening awareness of these issues as I examined them from my outsider point of view, and my partner Randa’s revelations of insights she would otherwise have kept to herself had I not directly asked her questions about the interview, questions that arose during my processes of transcribing and translating the taped interview and then thinking about and writing this article. More than I had understood before, her insider position motivates her to both advance and protect the culture she loves. We learned more about ourselves and each other from the discussions that were initiated by the writing of this article. She read several drafts of the article and gave her comments.</p>
<p>While some of the methodological issues that arise here are similar to those related by two American-Israeli Jewish researchers studying Jewish-Arab dynamics in Israel and examining methodological ramifications of their own identities and their identity negotiations with Arab participants during qualitative interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077800413482102">Razon &amp; Ross, 2012</xref>), our context is different and in some ways even more complex. Our negotiations involve the researchers as much as the participants. I am a Canadian-Israeli who speaks English and Hebrew, and Randa is a Druze Israeli who speaks Hebrew and Arabic. Our research partnership involves cooperative research planning and data collection, discussions about analysis, and working together to identify themes, but our writing is weighted differently. Randa takes primary responsibility for writing in Hebrew and for dealing with issues closely related to the Israeli educational scene, and I take primary responsibility for writing and disseminating our work in English. This is not only because of language. The way we share responsibility is related to each of our particular strengths and our cultural and academic experiences. Randa knows the Israeli scene and especially the Druze and Arab communities. Her main interests are researching and raising the status of women and researching the needs of the Druze community in order to facilitate their passage into the modern world without losing their unique traditions and religion. My main interest is cultural study itself and aspects of qualitative methodology. Together we have formed a fruitful partnership.</p>
<p>The interview examined here involved two researchers, Randa an insider and I an outsider, three languages, and two interviewees. The interview was conducted simultaneously with two religious women, both just outside the age boundaries of our “older generation”: Yasmin, a mother in her 30s, and her mother-in-law Iman, in her 70s (names are pseudonyms).</p>
<p>The two researchers responded to a call by the Israeli Ministry of Education for study of the generation gap among Israeli Druze, regarding values, educational goals, social behavior, the status of women and adherence to Druze religion and tradition, between people in their 20s and those of their parents’ generation, in their 40s to 60s. The overall purpose of the study is to understand how these two generations are dealing with rapid social change. The 60 participants were selected in order to represent different Druze towns, each of which has its own demographic, social, and religious makeup, and people from different walks of life, including young people who are working, studying, in the army or unemployed, and older people who are religious, secular, community leaders, religious leaders, teachers and other professionals, and housewives. Analysis of the 60 interviews will be conducted through the identification of themes and subthemes related to the foci of the research, and examination of how themes cluster around age groups, professions, gender, different villages and other variables. This is classic content analysis, involving marking meaningful portions of the transcribed interviews, coding and reworking until a strong set of analytic categories is achieved. But first each interview will be analyzed as a unit of its own in order to create an analytic profile of each person. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077800413482102">Seidman (2006)</xref> describes it,<disp-quote>
<p>We interview in order to come to know the experience of the participants through their stories. We learn from hearing and studying what the participants say. Although the interviewer can never be absent from the process, by creating a profile in the participant’s own words, the interviewer allows those words to reflect that person’s consciousness . . . The story is both the participant’s and the interviewer’s. It is in the participant’s words, but it is crafted by the interviewer . . . crafting profiles (is) . . . a way to find and display coherence in the constitutive events of a participant’s experience, to share the coherence the participant has expressed, and to link the individual’s experience to the social and organizational context within which he or she operates. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077800413482102">Seidman, 2006</xref>, pp. 119-120)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I would agree that “the story is both the participant’s and the interviewer’s” because, as we have long acknowledged in qualitative research, the researcher’s background inevitably affects every aspect of the research, from research questions to conduct of data collection to analysis. But it is the participants’ voices we seek, their meaning we must discover. As the anthropologist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077800413482102">Victor Turner (1975</xref>, p. 8) once wrote, one should strive to have “an objective relation to one’s own subjectivity,” working to understand how subjectivity is at play in the research in which one is engaged.</p>

<title>The Druze in Israel</title>
<p>The Israeli Druze are a minority within a minority, part of the Arab population of Israel but different because their religion is not like that of Moslem or Christian Arabs and because their men serve in the army and thus have a different status among the Jewish population. Until the 1980s Israeli Druze were still living a traditional life, working the land, with most boys leaving school with a maximum twelve years of education (many with much less) and girls leaving sooner. Almost all were still traditionally religious, meaning, among other things, that women did not work outside the home, drive or leave their villages unless accompanied by a close male relative. Today the sheiks who are the community religious leaders impose a <italic>herem dati</italic>, religious sanctions, on women who break the rules and on mothers who permit their dependent daughters to do so. These religious sanctions prohibit one from participating in the religion, which is secret and closely guarded.</p>
<p>Change in Israeli Druze society has occurred for a variety of reasons. Mandatory army service for young men brings about a meeting with the broad, multicultural Israeli society, which has become highly technological in past decades. Technology and the Internet now intrude into almost every Druze home, and rising levels of education for both men and women and the meeting with broader society that higher education and professional work entail, have brought the Druze community, like many traditional societies, to a place of rapid change that has left the Druze struggling to find a way to protect their tradition and religion and survive as a community while making their way in the modern world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077800413482102">Court &amp; Abbas, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800413482102">Dana, 2009</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-1077800413482102">
<title>Yasmin and Iman</title>
<p>We arrived at Yasmin’s home on a cold, foggy winter day, the fog so thick that we could see almost nothing as we drove up and up a winding road to reach the isolated Druze village where the women live. One of Yasmin’s sons came out to meet us and guide us into the house. We sat around a pot-bellied stove in this traditional Arab home, the living room lush with carpets, couches, different sitting areas, and pictures of sheiks on the walls. Yasmin wore modest modern dress—long skirt, long sleeves, no jewelry or makeup, and Iman wore the traditional outfit of a religious Druze woman, long clothes all in black. When Iman goes out she covers her head. Yasmin’s two sons, aged 13 and 15, who speak only a few words of Hebrew, sat in and listened with interest. Her baby daughter slept in the other room.</p>
<p>Our plan had been to interview separately Yasmin and her husband, a businessman and politician, but he did not come home because of his workload and the fog (or so it seemed to me—Randa had a different idea, as she told me later. This is discussed below). Finding his mother there (she lives down the street with another son), we made the spontaneous decision to interview her as well. Randa thought it would be best to interview them at the same time in case the older woman was hesitant. The mother-in-law, Iman, spoke absolutely no Hebrew and Yasmin a very small amount of Hebrew. This is a sign of their seclusion. Most Israeli Arabs speak good Hebrew as this is the national language of commerce and higher education. All our interviews conducted to date have been in Hebrew, with occasional additional explanation in Arabic by Randa. This interview was conducted almost entirely in Arabic, with Randa pausing to summarize answers in Hebrew for me and for the tape recorder. I later transcribed the interview into English for ease of writing an article in English and for my own clarity of thinking. I speak and read Hebrew well but my thinking and writing are in English.</p>
<p>Randa is an insider to Druze culture and understands every nuance in a way no outsider could, sometimes adding her own interpretations, explanations, and even suggesting possible answers when a respondent is in doubt. I am an outsider in almost every way: Jewish, speak no Arabic and did not grow up in Israel, though I have been learning about Druze culture and religion for some years now from my friend, colleague, and former student, Randa. I would probably not have been accepted into this Druze home had I come alone (this is not true of all the Druze homes we interviewed in) and anyway, without Arabic there would have been no interview. Even had I been accepted and come with a translator, had I been the sole researcher, this would have been a different interview. I would have missed many nuances that Randa pointed out to me, and many follow-up questions that I would not have known to ask. I would not have been able to share my version of the local stories as Randa did, to joke and express shared pain, to create the level of intimacy that allowed Iman and Yasmin to speak freely. Randa’s insider status and the experiences she shares with the interviewees are essential here, but I sensed that they also caused her to redirect some responses in directions important to her. My vision was much more ignorant and in some ways more objective; hers was more passionate, more deeply informed, and more personal. We both brought strengths and weaknesses to this research, our intention and hope being that the insider–outsider combination would make us greater than the sum of our parts.</p>
<p>As I transcribed the results of this unusual interview, it occurred to me that its complexity makes it worth examining as a “case”; that it fits some of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077800413482102">Stake’s (1995)</xref> criteria for an intrinsic case study of special interest. Stake’s concept cannot be applied wholesale because he means in-depth study over time of a school, a program, a student. The concept is borrowed here in simplified form as a framework for examining the unique situation and intrinsic interest of this interview.</p>
<p>In order to give the reader context for the discussion that follows, a summary profile is presented. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077800413482102">Table 1</xref> shows the profile I composed from the interview transcript in English. The comments on content and process are mine and were made from my point of view, before consulting with Randa. She did not ask me to change anything in the profile except some identifying details, in case the people we interviewed could be identified. All of Yasmin and Iman’s answers are Randa’s summaries of what they said after she listened to their entire response to a question, except for statements in quotation marks, which are exact quotes immediately translated by Randa.</p>

<sec id="section4-1077800413482102">
<title>The Contexts of the Case</title>
<p>According to Stake, an <italic>instrumental</italic> case study delves into a case as an example of a phenomenon in order to achieve understanding of the phenomenon. We can learn about the phenomenon of violence in schools, for instance, through studying a school with a lot of violence and another with little violence. While an instrumental case study is concerned with context, not all contexts of the case are important to the study. An <italic>intrinsic</italic> case study, on the other hand, is worth studying because of its intrinsic interest, and it is treated as a world unto itself. “The more the case study is an intrinsic case study, the more attention needs to be paid to the contexts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077800413482102">Stake, 1995</xref>, p. 64). The identification of contexts and examination of how they generate filters through which the data is collected and interpreted, sheds light on the “organic chemistry” of the case.</p>
<p>What are the contexts in the case of this interview?</p>
<sec id="section5-1077800413482102">
<title>The Village</title>
<p>One context is the village in which Iman and Yasmin live. It is one of the more traditional and more self-contained of the Druze villages. One sign of this is the local sheiks’ gathering of the village’s postarmy young men once a week to instill Druze values and help them find a direction. This was a surprise to Randa, who said she had never heard of this kind of organization in any other village. Her own village has more interactions with the larger multicultural Israeli society and is less organized at the local level. The traditionalism and insularity (perhaps partly influenced by the geographical location, on top of a mountain in an isolated area) of Iman and Yasmin’s village influenced their lack of Hebrew (and thus a central part of the conduct of this interview) as well as the content of their answers. These are very traditional women, who are both wholeheartedly dedicated to their religion and tradition and at the same time understand that people must be educated in order to make their way in the modern world, even if, especially for women, there is a price to pay for this. But they would like to keep this price as limited as possible.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1077800413482102">
<title>The Insider Researcher</title>
<p>A second context is the cultural makeup of the two researchers. We work very much as a team and largely understand what each of us brings to the table and how we complement each other. The only studies we have done together so far have been in the Druze community. This is Randa’s passionate interest, her fervent hope, to help through her academic credentials and activities to bring her community safely into the future. She is much in demand for this kind of work, because few Druze, and very few Druze women, have a PhD and are committed to working both within and beyond their community. She shares deep understandings with our interviewees because, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077800413482102">Banks (1998</xref>, p. 5), “The cultural communities in which individuals are socialized are also epistemological communities that have shared beliefs, perspectives, and knowledge.” However, and this is important,<disp-quote>
<p>It is not their experiences per se that cause individuals to acquire specific values and knowledge during their socialization within their ethnic or cultural communities; rather, it is their <italic>interpretations</italic> of their experiences . . . How individuals interpret their cultural experiences is mediated by the interaction of a complex set of status variables, such as gender, social class, age, political affiliation, religion, and region . . . An individual scholar’s ideological commitments and knowledge claims cannot be predicted by his or her ethnic socialization because of the complex factors that influence knowledge production. Individuals socialized within cultural communities may endorse or oppose knowledge within their indigenous communities for a number of complex reasons. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077800413482102">Banks, 1998</xref>, p. 5)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We have certainly heard a wide range of Druze opinions and ideologies, from patriotism to extreme anger at the Israeli government, from secular to very religious values, from valuing higher education and participation in the modern world to yearning for a return to the agricultural life. Randa shares a conceptual vocabulary and a lifetime of experiences with other Israeli Druze, but because of her own life path and choices, her interpretations of these experiences are specific, not generic. Her great motivation to advance Druze women, to enable them to study and work without straying beyond at least the outer boundaries of Druze tradition, affects the questions she asks, the answers on which she follows up, and in this interview, her Hebrew summaries of Iman’s and Yasmin’s long responses in Arabic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1077800413482102">
<title>The Outsider Researcher</title>
<p>I am a complete outsider to Druze tradition and was not born or brought up in Israel. Randa told me that despite my growing general knowledge of Druze culture, from our years of working together, my reading of literature and our research visits to diverse Druze homes, I have no idea about the subcontexts that only an insider could understand. She calls it a “place-dependent mentality.” Each Druze village has its own subculture and worldview related to religion, tradition, women, other Arab groups, and the larger Israeli culture. There is even a unique accent in which Arabic is spoken in each different village. None of this is available to me.</p>
<p>I am an outsider even to the broad cultural context (not just the specific Druze context) in this study. The experience of living and working in Israel has sharpened my awareness of cultural nuance—not being from the mainstream culture does this, I have discovered—and nurtured my interest in methodology and the conduct of cultural study. Instinctively I seek lines of shared experience with people I interview in Israel, and almost always find them. Being from different cultures does not mean that two people do not share experiences. I tend to connect along the mother and grandmother lines, and the manifestation of this in this interview was my awareness of the two boys, their eagerness and optimism about the future. It made me angry for them that they don’t have a soccer field. I really did feel like an outsider with the two women, and was necessarily excluded by the language from chatting and jokes, but as the interview progressed there was a feeling that we all became more comfortable with one another. Once I saw that Yasmin did understand some Hebrew and we were able to exchange a few questions and responses directly, I connected more with her. But I was oblivious to almost every nuance in the stories of both women. I struggled to understand the words and Randa’s summaries of the words, and I took the words literally. This is not a bad thing—interviewees should be believed when they speak—but many things can lie behind words and I had no idea what they might be. I definitely took second place to Randa in the interviewing process, and this probably prevented me from following up as I might have had the language not been a barrier. On the other hand, many of the answers that I might have followed up on would probably not even have come to light had I been the sole interviewer.</p>

<title>The Relationship Between the Two Researchers</title>
<p>Randa and I are now colleagues, but we were once masters and then doctoral student, and advisor. Because of the history of our relationship, as well as insider-outsider issues, we negotiate through channels of mutual respect, sometimes working in complete complementarity and sometimes one bowing to the other’s “greater wisdom,” in both directions. We are true friends and really listen to one another, but we have discovered on many occasions that the things we don’t say may hold us back. One significant example: I did not think to ask Randa about her brief summary of Iman and Yasmin’s long discussion of how Druze religious secrets were being revealed on the Internet. I assumed that she saw the material as tangential to our topic and respected her decision. Only when I asked her a specific question about it, while thinking about writing this article, did she tell me that she was disturbed by some of the things that Iman said: that the Druze religion is the truest religion in the world, superior to others, and that is why its secrets must be diligently protected. Randa instinctively did not want me to hear this as she worried I would think it was in some way racist. She cares very much what I think about her and her community, and she cares what the world thinks about the Druze. My not asking and her not translating this material during the interview were both instinctive. Once we started talking about this, more contextual details were revealed to me, and I understood better what a delicate balance Randa must maintain between her role as researcher and her role as advocate for her community. We have a Moslem research assistant who is transcribing the Hebrew interviews as well as translating this entire Arabic interview into Hebrew, and Randa told me that she was very concerned that this woman would think Iman’s remarks were anti-Moslem. Randa assured the research assistant that we were collecting interviewees’ views on a variety of topics and to please transcribe word for word without worrying about the content. As we discussed this, Randa told me further that the Druze are generally not liked by Moslems in Israel because they serve in the army and that there is always a delicate balance to be kept. She said that Iman’s isolation in that village on the mountain might have contributed to her separation from the multireligious Israeli society and to her religio-centric views. Randa herself was raised in a mixed Druze, Moslem, and Christian village where the negotiation of religious understanding and acceptance between the three groups was always a social and political issue. She also walks a fine balance in terms of her career. She needs and wants to research and publish, and her interests lie in the Druze community, but because the community is so small, if she is seen to cross boundaries of privacy, of individuals or the community, in order to advance her career, she could be subject to social reprisals. She is the subject of adulation, respect, censure, and jealousy. This is for her both an ethical and a personal issue, and it becomes a multifaceted ethical issue for me as I want to support her academic career, protect her personally, and avoid causing harm to the Druze community, all the while being less than fully aware of the subtleties underlying all of these.</p>

<sec id="section9-1077800413482102">
<title>Multiple Participants</title>
<p>A fifth context is the fact that there were multiple participants in the interview. Putting aside issues of language and culture, the fact that there were two interviewers means that there was consultation (what to ask next, did we miss anything?) and compromise (let’s follow up or not follow up on this) and that made the situation different than it would have been with one interviewer. The fact that there were two interviewees not only split the time between them, so that each probably said less than she might have if she were the only one responding, it likely affected in some way the quality and content of their answers. On the one hand, they may have fed off each other’s answers and thought of additional things to say. On the other hand, and this is only speculation, one may have felt more restricted in what she chose to say because of the presence of the other. I did wonder if Yasmin felt restricted in any way by the presence of her mother-in-law. Also, either or both of the women may have been affected by the eager, alert presence of the two boys, who were listening to every word. Yasmin did glance at them from time to time, especially when she was talking about the importance of education. She may have stressed that area even more for their benefit.</p>
<p>There was actually a seventh person “present,” though he was not in the room. Only when I began looking at the processes of this interview as an intrinsic case, and asking Randa questions about her views on them, did she say that she thought Yasmin’s husband had reasons other than his work and the fog (my naïve assumption) for not making it home for our scheduled interview. Randa did not know this family personally, but she knew of Yasmin’s husband, who is well-known in the Druze community. He had done the polite thing and agreed to be interviewed, but according to Randa, he is not only a businessman and politician but leads a busy social life including parties and social activities from which his very traditional wife is totally excluded. Randa’s instinct was that he did not want to be interviewed, and this background to the family whose home we visited made her even more interested in probing issues about women with Yasmin and Iman.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1077800413482102">
<title>Four Women</title>
<p>The fact that the four participants in the interview were all women provides a sixth context. There were similarities and differences between us, but we are all mothers and two are grandmothers. This gave us a set of common experiences despite the differences in those experiences, and a line of communication not drawn by language or culture. I believe that this did affect the flow of the interview.</p>
<p>All of these contexts created filters through which Randa and I as interviewers asked, reacted, and interpreted. They all affected the data we collected, the questions we asked and did not ask, our decisions about what we see as important and what can be put aside, and our interpretations of meaning. Having looked at this interview as a case of intrinsic methodological interest I believe we will be more self-critical and more alert to context as we create profiles of other interviews and analyze the entire body of 60 interviews.</p>

<title>Whose Interview Is It, Anyway?</title>
<p>Many excellent reviews are available, in diverse social science fields, of the historical transformation, influenced by poststructuralism, of the qualitative researcher/interviewer over the last 50 years from unreflective holder of power and knowledge to reflective participant in the coconstruction of knowledge together with research subjects (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077800413482102">Gubrium &amp; Holstein, 2012</xref>; Heyl, 2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077800413482102">Yow, 1997</xref>, for reviews in narrative, ethnography, and oral history, respectively). The interviewer has moved metaphorically from being a “miner,” digging facts out of the ground of the interview, to being a “traveler,” meeting people and experiencing different landscapes on his or her research journeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077800413482102">Kvale, 1996</xref>). It is generally understood today that “Interviewing involves a complex form of social interaction” between interviewers and interviewees, and that “interview data are co-produced in these interactions” and reconstructed during the interpretation phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077800413482102">Heyl, 2005</xref>, p. 370). The interviewer is neither a paternalistic power-holder nor a passive recorder of others’ stories. Rather, an “active subjectivity . . . lurks behind the interviewer . . .” and this “active subject behind the interviewer is a necessary counterpart, a working narrative partner, of the active subject behind the respondent. The subject behind the interviewer is fully engaged in the coproduction of accounts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077800413482102">Gubrium &amp; Holstein, 2012</xref>, p. 33).</p>
<p>The question “whose interview is it?” has thus in important ways been answered by the diligent work of qualitative researchers over the years. It is <italic>our</italic> interview in every case, the interviewer’s and the interviewee’s. But sometimes (often?) the process of analysis makes it more the interviewer’s than the interviewee’s.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077800413482102">Denzin (2001)</xref> stated that, “Today we understand that we write culture, and that writing is not an innocent practice. We know the world only through our representations of it” (p. 23). And much more than this: “As researchers we belong to a moral community. Doing interviews is a privilege granted us, not a right that we have. Interviews . . . transform information into shared experience” (p. 24). A moral sensibility must underlie the researcher’s conduct at the level of both individual interviews and the writing of large-scale research reports. In every interview we have to examine how and how well we have captured the interviewee’s voice.</p>
<p>In writing research reports we are, as Denzin says, writing culture, creating “truth” for the reading public which becomes reified through our acts of researching and writing. This very article creates some “truth” about the Israeli Druze community. But such a partial “truth.” An article that results from the final analysis of 60 interviews will be more comprehensive, will draw conclusions about Druze culture, and will necessarily eliminate many individual stories and standpoints, presenting only those interview contexts that are common or especially noteworthy as we perceive it. We do not have access to the leading sheiks for our research, those who determine and enforce religious rules in the community, but how interesting it would be to interview some of these sheiks and hear about their efforts to protect their religion from disappearing into the maelstrom of modernity. What would they say and not say to this particular pair of researchers? How would we know what they are not saying, and why? Writing culture is hard, and its trustworthiness and dependability are tied both to methodological care and to ongoing attention to the morality of the research enterprise.</p>
<p>“Reflexivity” is almost the norm in qualitative research. But because of this there is a danger that reflexivity might become oddly nonreflexive, a kind of semiautomatic juxtapositioning of the researcher’s narrative alongside the participants’. In addition, if we focus too strongly on researcher self-examination it can become “self-indulgent, narcissistic and tiresome” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077800413482102">Pillow, 2003</xref>, p. 176). Pillow suggests that we seek “more ‘messy’ examples, examples that may not always be successful, examples that do not seek a comfortable, transcendent end-point but leave us in the uncomfortable realities of doing engaged qualitative research” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077800413482102">Pillow, 2003</xref>, p. 193).</p>
<p>One route to “messy” reflexivity may be not just examining the researcher’s narrative and his or her culture, status, and gender position in relation to those studied, but to look at <italic>all</italic> the different contexts at work in an interview. This means asking, in <italic>this one</italic> interview, what are the contexts affecting the production of knowledge? How are these contexts filtering and shading meaning, coloring the ways questions are posed and responses are offered, what is said, how it is said, and what is not said? The following questions may be helpful:</p>
<list id="list1-1077800413482102" list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>What place is this? Who chose it? What are its characteristics? What meaning/s does it have to the participant and/or the interviewer?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What is the cultural relation between the interviewer and the participant?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What cultural norms or rules are at work that may affect what is said and not said?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What issues of status, gender, or age may affect what is said and not said?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How can we know what is not being said?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How does the researcher decide what to leave out, what seems important, and how to summarize in an analytic profile?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If there is more than one researcher, what cultural, status, gender, age, or other factors may affect negotiations between the researchers?</p></list-item></list>
<p>In a study involving multiple participants and many interviews there is much analytic work to be done in terms of creating profiles from individual interviews, identifying shared themes between interviewees as well as unique perspectives, explaining these findings theoretically, and creating a coherent and trustworthy account that provides answers to research questions. One cannot be navel-gazing at every detail or the work would never get done. But it is essential to maintain a kind of methodological alertness as to how interview knowledge is coproduced.</p>
<p>Treating this one, unusual interview as an intrinsically interesting case methodologically, and identifying the different contexts of the interview, sharpened this alertness for both of us and reminded us how many things we may take for granted and not examine. It also painted a vivid picture of the multicolored tapestry of truth that we as researchers of culture attempt to weave.</p>
