<p>Speaking from a platform in Germany early in 2011, British prime minister David Cameron launched a scathing attack on the doctrine of ‘state multiculturalism’ and called on Europeans to ‘wake up to what is happening in our countries’. Warning of the dangers posed by ‘different cultures’ living ‘separate lives’, he argued that decades of ‘passive tolerance’ had led to breakdowns in cohesion and left young Muslims vulnerable to radicalisation. Previous governments, neutered by their fear of speaking the truth about the consequences of segregated communities, had unwittingly encouraged the weakening of national collective identities. It was time, he said, to ‘turn the page on the failed policies of the past’.</p>
<p>But Cameron’s remarks, portending a securitisation of integration policy and a demand for the maintenance of core (‘muscular liberal’) values, continue the trajectory of a particular set of ideas which, notwithstanding nuances in specific countries, have permeated policy-making and practice over the last decade. Against the backdrop of the deeply divisive ‘war on terror’ and a conspiratorial perception of the imposition of multiculturalism by previous governments, a series of perceptions about segregation, ghettoisation and integration have taken hold.</p>
<p><italic>‘Sleepwalking to Segregation’?</italic> is a valuable tool, which combats the untruths and misinformation that pervade current policies on ‘race relations’ and race. It aims to: ‘set the record straight on current claims about Britain’s “immigration burden”, about the level of racial or ethnic segregation and about minority ethnic groups’ willingness to integrate’. In doing so, it uses a diverse range of statistical sources, basing its analyses on an interpretation of data ‘to defend and to extend human rights’.</p>
<p>The book sets out to demythologise a set of dominant ideas, that: ‘Britain takes too many immigrants’; ‘so many minorities cannot be integrated’; ‘minorities do not want to integrate’; ‘Britain is becoming a country of ghettos’; and, Britain is becoming filled with ‘minority white cities’. Underpinning these myths is the claim, vocalised by the chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), Trevor Philips, that Britain is ‘sleepwalking to segregation’.</p>
<p>As the authors point out, the previous decade saw the development of a specific set of ideas about race and segregation, which marked a distinctive shift in race relations policies. At the same time, however, these policies continue a long historical trend within the UK of utilising statistical data in a form that has ‘developed (or not) in response to changing political and policy arenas’. In order to challenge such misreading and misrepresentation of knowledge, the authors argue that it is necessary to explore the context in which myths emerge. They do so, first, by analysing the notion that Britain ‘takes too many immigrants’, initially by exploring the basis of this perception and then deploying a range of statistical sources (such as, for example, the UK Census and information produced by the United Nations) to assess such claims. Importantly, the analyses that are presented within this book to debunk myths often do so by utilising the same sources of data upon which the myths are based in the first place. As the text shows, it is frequently a wilful misreading of data that enables such myths to gain political and popular currency.</p>
<p>With regard to beliefs about levels of immigration, for example, Finney and Simpson discuss the role of MigrationWatchUK, a thinktank that makes clear that it sees immigration to the UK as a form of threat. It features frequently here, in part because of the influence it has over debates, for the ideas that it vigorously espouses and promotes are shared by a wide range of organisations, political entities and media sources.</p>
<p>A strength of the book is the insight it provides into the ways in which particular ideas around immigration and segregation have become legitimised. For example, when exploring the much popularised notions that immigration has created housing shortages and that ‘diversity’ ultimately threatens security and stability, this text draws on references from a range of political parties. From one perspective, this reiterates the extent to which integrationist agendas have entered mainstream political thought. But, at the same time, Finney and Simpson cite sources to explain how such myths are, in some cases at least, based on ideas that are diametrically opposed to reality. So, for example, myths around immigration and housing gain prominence in a context where, in reality, ‘immigrants and their children tend to live in the more dense urban areas and with more people in each property’. Similarly, the notion of self-segregation, focused primarily on Asian families, is not only based on the misuse of evidence, but has gained currency despite the fact that the ‘White group is the most separated in Britain, in the sense of living in areas only with themselves’.</p>
<p>This is not a textbook, but rather a toolkit, which provides the wherewithal to dismantle myths, disingenuous claims and outright lies. It is a primer of statistics, facts and clearly argued passages, which provide ammunition to take apart some of the assumptions that underpin academic discourses, media outputs and policy proposals and measures. As the authors meticulously show, these distinct aspects of misinformation can be tackled separately, but, taken together, these myths have become what they describe as a ‘litany’, one that goes something like this: immigrants are a burden, taking jobs and resources, living piled together in segregated areas; segregation prevents integration, clashes with British culture, and heightens tension and breeds violence.</p>
<p>As well as providing a range of detailed statistics to tackle such ideas, the book gives a comprehensive analysis of the ways in which particular forms of knowledge come to occupy space as ‘common sense’. In doing so, it sets out a thorough exploration of the ways in which certain forms of knowledge are privileged at the expense of others and the manner in which ‘expert knowledge’ is generated. It is not enough, the authors argue, to simply explain that an organisation like MigrationWatchUK has a high-profile presence in public debate, even though its statistics are sometimes questionable, nor is it enough to simply point out that government ministers regularly reproduce chains of thought that are misleading and based on spurious claims. It is necessary to challenge these ideas and explore the context in which they gain currency in contemporary thought. The danger, as with any ‘myth-busting’ exercise, is that it can be reactive rather than proactive. Rather than setting an agenda, it is confined to the agenda that it is dismantling. But, as the authors point out, by dismantling myths, they are also clearing the terrain for an alternative set of perspectives, where statistics are used rather than abused. And, in that, this book is vital.</p>
