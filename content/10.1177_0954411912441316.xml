<abstract>
<p>Polyethylene wear is considered a threat to the long term survival of total knee replacements. The aim of this study was to investigate the contribution that resurfacing the patella makes to wear debris-induced osteolysis following total knee replacement. Ultra-high molecular-weight polyethylene wear particles were isolated from simulator lubricant. Particle shape, size, and volume distributions were recorded allowing the osteolytic potential of the wear debris produced in the patellofemoral joint to be estimated using the concept of specific biological activity and functional biological activity. Values were compared with those reported for the tibiofemoral joint. Specific biological activity for the patellofemoral joint was not significantly different from the values for the tibiofemoral joint of total knee replacement devices, and therefore, has a similar potential to stimulate osteolytic cytokine release from macrophages. Functional biological activity was significantly lower for the patellofemoral joint compared with the tibiofemoral joint. Functional biological activity was significantly lower for the patellofemoral joint compared with the fixed bearing and rotating platform total knee replacement devices. However, as patellar resurfacing is commonly fitted as part of a total knee replacement system, this results in a 20% increase in overall functional biological activity for the system. Therefore, implanting a patellar resurfacing will increase the potential for osteolysis in the knee.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Total knee arthroplasty has become a common treatment for severe arthritis. Despite widespread clinical use the debate on whether the patella should be resurfaced, or not, remains open.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912441316">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411912441316">3</xref></sup> Use of a patellar button in total knee arthroplasty varies considerably between countries. In the United States of America it is commonly considered the standard of care when performing primary total knee arthroplasty and most surgeons resurface the patella. It is also common in Denmark (76%) and Australia (43%), but not in England and Wales (33%), Norway (11%) or Sweden (14%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411912441316">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912441316">6</xref></sup> Significant wear of the patellar component has frequently been reported for both metal-backed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411912441316">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411912441316">10</xref></sup> and all-polyethylene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411912441316">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411912441316">13</xref></sup> designs. Wear debris-induced osteolysis remains a major area of concern for the long-term success of total knee arthroplasty,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411912441316">14</xref></sup> and there has been considerable effort to reduce wear of the tibial insert through improved implant design and the quality of the polyethylene, however, wear of the patellar resurfacing has received little attention.</p>
<p>The mechanism through which wear debris from total joint replacement prostheses can trigger osteolysis is well documented. Micrometre and submicrometre size polyethylene wear particles generated at the articulating surfaces of the implant accumulate in the capsule causing inflammation of tissue, bone resorption and aseptic loosening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411912441316">15</xref></sup> The biological reactions that lead to osteolysis have been shown to be dependent on particle size, volumetric concentration and shape.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411912441316">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954411912441316">19</xref></sup> Therefore, in order to understand the clinical implication of any given wear rate, it is necessary to characterise the quantity and morphology of the wear particles. Fisher et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954411912441316">20</xref></sup> presented a means of estimating the relative biological reactivity per unit volume of wear debris. This term is referred to as specific biological activity and is a function of debris size, size distribution and volume. The functional biological activity of a device can be estimated from the product of specific biological activity and the total wear volume over the particle size range. This methodology offers a means to estimate and compare the osteolytic potential of different devices by combining conventional wear volume measurements with particle analysis and the output from <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411912441316">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954411912441316">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954411912441316">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the contribution that resurfacing the patella makes to wear debris-induced osteolysis following total knee replacement (TKR). Wear particles were collected from an <italic>in vitro</italic> simulation of wear within the patellofemoral joint of a TKR system,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954411912441316">24</xref></sup> and compared with the particles produced in the tibiofemoral compartments of fixed bearing (FB) and rotating platform (RP) mobile bearing TKR systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954411912441316">25</xref></sup> Particle shape, size and volume distributions were recorded allowing the osteolytic potential of the wear debris produced to be estimated using the concept of specific and functional biological activity.</p>

<title>Wear testing</title>
<p>Wear particles were generated using the Leeds patellofemoral joint simulator from testing of the PFC Σ TKR with round dome patella (Depuy Int., UK) as previously reported by Ellison et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954411912441316">24</xref></sup> The femoral components were cobalt chrome alloy, whereas the patella buttons were machined from compression moulded GUR 1020 ultra-high molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), sterilised under vacuum using gamma irradiation of 2.5–4 MRad dosage (GVF sterilisation). This resulted in moderate crosslinking of the polymer. In total, six replicate prostheses were tested to a maximum of 4 million cycles (MC). Components were mounted such that the superior–inferior axis was horizontal. A time-dependent loading curve was applied with a peak load of 1.2 kN at heel strike and a minimum swing phase load of 100 N. A flexion–extension cycle of +11° and −12° was applied along with an ab-adduction rotation of +0.2° and −0.9°, and a superior–inferior translation cycle of +5 mm and −19 mm. Anterior-posterior translation and ab-adduction rotation were actively controlled. Medial-lateral translation and internal–external rotation of the patellae was free, constrained only by the inertia and friction of the simulator. This method has been shown to produce similar modes of wear (burnishing, pitting, scratching, delamination and surface deformation) and wear scar morphology on the patella as those observed in retrieved implants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411912441316">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954411912441316">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Wear particles from FB and RP mobile bearing TKR were generated from testing of the PFC Σ TKR system (Depuy Int., UK) under intermediate kinematics with lift-off as previously reported by Jennings et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954411912441316">25</xref></sup> As before, the femoral components were cobalt chrome alloy and the tibial inserts were machined from compression moulded GUR 1020 UHMWPE, which was processed in the same way as the patellar components. In total, six replicate prostheses of both designs were tested to a maximum of 5 MC. A time-dependent axial loading curve with a peak load of 2.6 kN and a flexion–extension cycle of 0 to +58° was applied for all testing. Tibial rotation was displacement controlled with internal–external rotation of ±5°. Anterior–posterior translation was displacement controlled for the FB TKR applying displacement of 0 to 5 mm. For RP knees the anterior–posterior motion was operated under force control and resulted in a range of movement from 0 to 4 mm. Femoral condylar lift-off was achieved by introducing an ab-adduction rotation torque of 3 Nm applied to the tibial component. The resulting adduction moment produced up to 1 mm of femoral condylar lift-off during the swing phase of the gait cycle, returning to full contact during the stance phase. This method was chosen as it increases wear over simulation without lift-off,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954411912441316">25</xref></sup> and therefore provides a worst case comparison for assessing magnitude of the particle dose from the patellofemoral joint.</p>
<p>All wear tests were run at a cycle rate of 1 Hz. Throughout, 25% (v/v) newborn calf serum (Harlan Serlab, Loughborough, UK) with 0.1% (w/v) sodium azide solution in de-ionised water was used as the lubricant. The lubricant was changed every one-third MC and stored at −19 °C immediately after collection for wear particle isolation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0954411912441316">
<title>Particle isolation</title>
<p>Samples of the simulator lubricant were taken from four of the replicate wear tests at random. As the wear rate of the patellofemoral joint was relatively low three samples were taken from each replicate at three consecutive time points over the first 2 MC. The samples from each station were then pooled providing a sufficient volume of debris to allow particle analysis. This resulted in a total of approximately 900 ml of serum, which was subsequently freeze dried (Thermo Savant Modulyo D-220) in order to reduce the volume to a practical quantity (&lt;100 ml per sample). Wear particles were isolated from the tibiofemoral joint of fixed and RP mobile bearing TKR systems at the 3 MC time point. The lubricants from four replicate simulator stations for each system were analysed.</p>
<p>All samples were characterised using the digestion and isolation protocol previously reported by Richards et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954411912441316">26</xref></sup> Samples were digested using 12M KOH in aliquots of 10 ml of serum in a water bath at a temperature of 60 °C for 2 days, until fully digested. Subsequently, 10 ml of 2:1 chloroform:methanol solution was added to the samples, which were incubated at room temperature for a further 24 h. Samples were centrifuged at 500 g for 20 min, and the supernatant transferred into a clean universal. Chloroform:methanol and centrifuge steps were repeated 3–4 times until the supernatant was clear, indicating that all contaminating proteins and lipids had been removed. Samples were pooled and an equal volume of 96% (v/v) absolute ethanol added. Salt precipitation was removed by the addition of an equal volume of ultra-pure water (Fresenius Kabi, Runcorn, UK) and the samples were incubated overnight at a temperature of 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged at 20,200 g for 2 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was decanted and an equal volume of ultra-pure water added. The solution was filtered through a sequence of 10 µm, 1 µm and 0.015 µm polycarbonate membrane filters (Whatman International Ltd., Maidstone, UK). Filters were dried under an infra-red lamp (Phillips, Guildford, UK) for 2–3 h. Filtration and drying took place in a class 1 laminar flow cabinet in order to reduce contamination of samples.</p>

<sec id="section5-0954411912441316">
<title>Particle analysis</title>
<p>A small section of each filter was mounted on an aluminium stub (Agar Scientific, Essex, UK) with double-sided carbon pads and coated with 5.0 nm platinum/palladium using a sputter coater (Agar Scientific, Essex, UK), prior to analysis using a high-resolution field emission gun-scanning electron microscopy (FEGSEM; Leo 1530, LEO Electron Microscopy Ltd, Cambridge, UK). The methodology employed was developed to ensure objective analysis of wear particles. Three random fields of view were taken over 6 or 7 magnifications per filter as detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411912441316">Table 1</xref>. This method ensured randomisation of microscopy methods, while ensuring that the full range of particle sizes were analysed on each filter. A total of 60 images were analysed using Image Pro Plus image analysis software (v4.5.1, Media Cybernetics, USA) for each replicate sample. Measurements of maximum length, width, area and perimeter were recorded for a minimum of 150 particles per sample (range 171–496 particles). These data were used to calculate particle frequency distribution and the percentage area distribution. Total particle volume, <italic>V(r)</italic>, for particles in the size ranges &lt;0.1 µm, 0.1−1.0 µm, 1.0−10 µm and &gt;10 µm was computed using area and assuming a constant thickness. The volumetric concentration was calculated by <italic>C(r)</italic> = <italic>V(r)/V</italic><sub>T</sub>, where <italic>V</italic><sub>T</sub> is the total volume for all particles.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Over the past two decades there has been considerable interest in reducing the osteolytic potential of wear debris in replacement joints. Much of this effort has focused on improved implant design and the development of modified UHMWPE materials to minimise the wear rate and, therefore, the amount of debris released <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, it is important to remember that the biological activity of the wear debris is a function of particle shape, size, frequency and quantity, and not bulk wear volume alone. Thus, characterisation of wear debris is a key step in the <italic>in vitro</italic> testing of any artificial joint replacement.</p>
<p>This article has reported the osteolytic potential of the patellofemoral joint of the PFC Σ TKR system through measurement of the mean specific biological activity, functional biological activity and particle shape, size and volume distributions by isolating UHMWPE debris from the lubricant from a joint wear simulator. Particle isolation was successful from the pooled serum samples from the joint simulator, despite the low wear rates. The results were compared with existing data for the tibiofemoral joint of the same TKR system that had been analysed using the same particle isolation methodology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0954411912441316">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0954411912441316">31</xref></sup> These data sets reported the characterisation of the wear particles from the FB and RP PFC Σ TKR variants tested in the Leeds knee wear simulator under intermediate kinematics with lift-off.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954411912441316">25</xref></sup></p>

<title>Comparison with FB and RP variants tested under intermediate kinematic conditions with lift-off</title>
<p>The mode of the frequency distributions was in the &lt;0.1 µm size range for all three devices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411912441316">Figure 2</xref>). There were no significant differences between the particle frequency distributions of the patellofemoral compartment and the two designs of tibiofemoral compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411912441316">Figure 2</xref>). On comparison of the volume distributions with the particle distribution, similar trends were observed for all three devices, with the mode of the distribution being in the &gt;10 µm size range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411912441316">Figure 3</xref>). However, there were some statistically significant differences. The RP tibiofemoral joint generated significantly greater volumes of larger particles (&gt;10 µm size range: <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 ANOVA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411912441316">Figure 3</xref>). In addition, the patellofemoral joint generated significantly greater volumes of particles in the 1−10 µm size range compared with the FB tibiofemoral joint (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 ANOVA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411912441316">Figure 3</xref>). These results indicated that the patellofemoral joint generated higher volumes of smaller wear particles compared with the tibiofemoral joint in the two TKR devices, although these results were not always statistically significant (ANOVA).</p>
<p>The specific biological activity for the particles isolated from the patellofemoral joint was similar to those for the FB and RP tibiofemoral joints (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954411912441316">Table 2</xref>). This indicated that they have a similar potential to stimulate osteolytic cytokine release from macrophages and will contribute to the overall biological activity of particles produced post TKR surgery.</p>
<p>The functional biological activity value was significantly lower for the patellofemoral joint compared with the two tibiofemoral joints investigated (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 ANOVA), which was a consequence of the lower wear rate associated with this device; (3.1 mm<sup>3</sup>/MC<sup>24</sup>) compared with the FB and RP tibiofemoral joints (16.4 and 16.9 mm<sup>3</sup>/MC<sup>25</sup>). However, it is important to note that a patellar resurfacing is typically implanted as part of a TKR system. From the wear rates predicted in the prior simulator studies the addition of a patellar component would add 19% to the volume of wear debris generated compared with one without a resurfacing. Furthermore, these wear particles have equal specific biological activity to those produced in the tibiofemoral joint, increasing the functional biological activity for the system by 20% and 17.5%, respectively, for the FB and RP TKR designs. This indicates that implanting a patellar resurfacing will increase the potential for osteolysis in the knee. In a register-based study, Lygre et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0954411912441316">32</xref></sup> reported that TKRs with a resurfaced patella were associated with a statistically higher risk of revision owing to aseptic loosening of the tibia component than those without. The increased dose of wear particles may be an explanation for this increase, although other factors, such as alteration of the extensor-mechanism, should also be considered.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study adds new information to the debate on whether the patella should be resurfaced during total knee arthroplasty. The particles from the patellofemoral joint had similar specific biological activity values to those produced from the tibiofemoral compartment. As a patellar resurfacing is commonly fitted as part of a TKR system the functional biological activity for the system is increased. Therefore, implanting a patellar resurfacing will increase the potential for osteolysis post TKR.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study has investigated the biological activity of polyethylene wear debris produced in the patellofemoral joint of TKR. The specific biological activity for the debris was not significantly different from the values for the tibiofemoral joint of TKR devices, and therefore, has a similar potential to stimulate osteolytic cytokine release from macrophages. As a patellar resurfacing is commonly fitted as part of a TKR system, the resulting extra wear debris increases the overall functional biological activity for the system. Therefore, implanting a patellar resurfacing will increase the potential for osteolysis in the knee.</p>
