<abstract>
<p>Three terpolymers (P(MAA-BA-MMA)) of methyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, and methyl methacrylate, with different inherent viscosity and carboxyl values were used as compatibilizer for polyvinyl chloride/wood flour composite. The effects of P(MAA-BA-MMA) on improving compatibility between polyvinyl chloride and wood flour and the composite’s mechanical properties were studied. It is found that the P(MAA-BA-MMA) with inherent viscosity of 33.87 mL/g and carboxyl value of 3.93 mmol/g can the most greatly improve the mechanical properties of composites. The effects of this terpolymers’ content on the mechanical properties, density, water absorption, and processing properties of composite were investigated in detail. The results show that the P(MAA-BA-MMA) can enhance mechanical properties and increase density, decrease water absorption, and improve processing properties of composite, and also reveal a relationship between the trend of P(MAA-BA-MMA)’s influence on tensile strength and that of its influence on density and water absorption. When P(MAA-BA-MMA) is at the optimum loading, the tensile strength and density of the composite are the largest, meanwhile its water absorption is the smallest. This relationship provides a shortcut for optimizing the formula of polyvinyl chloride/wood flour composite effectively. Scanning electron microscope results show that the interface between wood flour and polyvinyl chloride in the polyvinyl chloride/wood flour composite is blurred and combined well after wood flour is treated with P(MAA-BA-MMA).</p>

<sec id="sec1-0731684412441684" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Wood-plastic composite (WPC) is typically referred to a kind of material with plastic as matrix and fibrous materials of plant origin as filler. The latter can be wood flour (WF) or sawdust, or agricultural plant residues, or other types of natural fiber. Because WF is hydrophilic, it is inherently incompatible with hydrophobic plastics such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Hence, the adhesion and interface between them is poor, and it fails to optimally transfer stress between the two phases, when loaded. Thus, to obtain WPC with good performances, two principal problems should be solved: uniform distribution of the filler in the plastic matrix and the interfacial adhesion between them.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684412441684">1</xref></sup> Similarly, the problem exists in the PVC-based WF composites, and many efforts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684412441684">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684412441684">3</xref></sup> have been done to improve the interfacial adhesion between WF and PVC by using coupling agents, such as isocyanates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684412441684">4,5</xref></sup> and silanes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684412441684">6</xref></sup> Most mechanical properties of the composites were improved by them. For example, coupling agents based on alkoxysilanes are frequently employed for celluloses fibers. Hydrolysis of alkoxyl groups with subsequent reaction with hydroxyl groups from cellulose can provide chemical bonding with the fibers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731684412441684">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684412441684">8</xref></sup> and ultimately improve the mechanical properties of the composite. In spite of these benefits, the silane-coupling agents have not been extensively used in PVC/WF composites, mainly due to its high cost as well as the difficulty in evenly coating the surface of wood fibers, owing to its sensitivity to hydrolyze and self-condense. Consequently, silane-coupling is not a desirable coupling agent in this application. Furthermore, the adding of coupling agents is of little help to improve the processing properties of PVC/WF composite. Thus, an usual method is to add a lubricant such as stearic acid salt, fatty acids, and paraffin to improve its processing properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684412441684">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Sombatsompop et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684412441684">10</xref></sup> reported on the effects of acrylic-based processing aids P(MMA-co-BA) and P(MMA-co-EA) on processibility, rheology, thermal and structural stability, and mechanical properties of PVC/wood-sawdust composites, and they found that although P(MMA-co-BA) and P(MMA-co-EA) did not improve the mechanical properties of the composites, they did greatly improve the thermal and structural stability and processibility. The paper also confirmed that the polyacrylate chain could enhance the thermal and structural stability properties and the processing properties of PVC/WF composite to some extent.</p>
<p>Terpolymers, named P(MAA-BA-MMA) here, of methyl acrylate (MAA), butyl acrylate (BA), and methyl methacrylate (MMA) are synthesized and designed as a novel compatibilizer for PVC/WF composite. To the best of our knowledge, no effort has been made to use P(MAA-BA-MMA) to improve the compatibility and processing properties of PVC/WF composite. As P(MAA-BA-MMA) contains both acrylate groups that have good compatibility with PVC resin and acrylic acid groups that may form a chemical or hydrogen bond with hydroxyl group on WF surface, the improvement of processing, thermal and mechanical properties of the composite will be expected to be beneficial at the same time from this compatibilizer. This study will address them. Although the effects of compatibilizer type and content on the mechanical properties,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684412441684">11,12</xref></sup> water absorption,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731684412441684">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731684412441684">14</xref></sup> density,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731684412441684">15</xref></sup> and so on have been mostly involved in current researches in this field, few articles have dealt with the internal relationships of these properties. Thus, the aim of this work is to report the effects of different kinds of P(MAA-BA-MMA) and their contents on the mechanical and processing properties, water absorption, and the micro-fracture morphology of PVC/WF composite and will also reveal the internal relationships of compatibilizer content on the effects of mechanical properties, water absorption, and density.</p></sec>

<p>PVC (type: SG-5, K-value: 67, density: 1.40 g/cm<sup>3</sup>) used in this study was purchased from Henan Shenma Chemical Industry Limited Co., Ltd (Henan, China). WF (<italic>Cunninghamia lanceolata</italic>) was kindly supplied by a local lumber mill in Fujian Province of China and was screened with a 40 mesh sieve (≤0.425 mm) before being used. This kind of WF contains 44.04% of cellulose, 11.78% of semicellulose, 33.51% of lignin, and 10.67% of other ingredients according to the reference.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731684412441684">16</xref></sup> Several industrial grade additives such as dioctyl phthalate (DOP) plasticizer with relative density of 0.985 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (20°C) was purchased from Longwei Chemical Limited Co., Ltd (Wuhan, China), dustless lead salt complex thermostabilizer with density of 2.50 g/cm<sup>3</sup> used was CT-B, from Jiangxi Xufeng Chemical Industry Co., Ltd (Jiangxi, China). Liquid paraffin external lubricant with relative density of 0.850 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (20°C) and barium stearate internal lubricant with density of 1.145 g/cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684412441684">3</xref></sup> were purchased from Yantai Chemical Co., Ltd (Guangzhou, China).

Compatibilizers P(MAA-BA-MMA), hereafter abbreviated as C1, C2, and C3, are the three terpolymers of MAA, BA, and MMA by solution free-radical polymerization in our laboratory. Briefly, purified MAA, BA, and MMA with a desired mass ratio (that is MAA/BA/MMA = 60/20/20, MAA/BA/MMA = 60/10/30, MAA/BA/MMA = 50/20/30, respectively), enthanol, 1.5% AIBN of the total monomer, and 15% t-dodecyl mercaptan of the total monomer were added into the three-necked flask equipped with a thermometer, a condensator, and a stirrer. The polymerization reactions were carried on for 5 h at 80°C. After polymerization, the resulting P(MAA-BA-MMA) was separated from t-dodecyl mercaptane by precipitation method. The three terpolymers have inherent viscosities and carboxyl values of C1, C2, and C3 are 41.85, 33.87, and 39.07 mL/g and 3.60, 3.93, and 3.19 mmol/g, respectively.</p></sec>

<p>All the composites for each recipe were prepared carefully under the same conditions as follows. Based on the formulations, weighed amount of PVC resin, dried WF, and other additives were first mixed in the SHR-25A high-speed mixer mentioned above at 1400 rpm and 105–110°C for 15 min, then the mixture was fed into a XK-180 two-roll mill from Shanghai Rubber Machinery Inc. (Shanghai, China) at 175 ± 5°C for 5 min. The blending slice was compression-molded into a 250 mm × 250 mm plate at 175 ± 5°C and 12 MPa for 13 min in a YX-25(0) semi-automatic press from Shanghai Zimmerli Weili Rubber &amp; Plastic Machinery Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China) then at room temperature and 12 MPa for 20 min in another press of the same type. Quintuplicate were performed for each specific composite. The finished composite plates were cut into samples of various sizes and conditioned in a laboratory at 25 ± 1°C for 24 h before being examined. The nominal thickness was 2 mm for water absorption, tensile, and impact strength testing samples, while the nominal thickness was 4 mm for flexural testing samples.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec6-0731684412441684"><title>Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectra</title>
<p>Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of treated or raw WF were recorded with a KBr pellet between 400 and 4000 cm<sup>−1</sup> using a Nicolet Avatar 360 FT-IR spectrometer from Nicolet Instrument Corporation (Madison, USA). Dried WF were dispersed in potassium bromide and compressed into pellets. The spectra were corrected for the presence of moisture and carbon dioxide in the optical path. All WF were Soxhlet-extracted with acetone solvent at 80°C for 24 h to remove impurity and the compatibilizer that was not chemical bonded to WF.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0731684412441684"><title>Mechanical properties</title>
<p>Tensile, flexural, charpy impact, and water absorption tests were carried out according to GB/T Standard of China. A CMT 4202 electromechanical universal testing machine from SANS (Shenzhen, China) was employed to evaluate the tensile and flexural property according to the method of GB/T 1040-2006 and GB/T 9341-2000, respectively. The crosshead speeds during the tensile and flexural measurements were 10.0 and 1.0 mm/min, as well as the specimens cut from the compression molded plates were with a nominal size of 75 × 10 × 2-mm and 80 × 10 × 4-mm, respectively. During the three-point flexural testing, the support span length was kept to be 40 mm. Five specimens for each sample were tested to obtain the average value for determination. The charpy impact strength of the notched specimens was measured using a ZBC-4 C plastic pendulum impact testing machine from SANS (Shenzhen, China) following the method of GB/T 1043-93. Specimens with a nominal size of 80 × 10 × 2-mm were cut from the compression-molded plates. For each treatment level, 10 samples were tested.</p>
<p>All tests were performed at the room temperature.</p>
<sec id="sec8-0731684412441684"><title>Contact angle and surface tension</title>
<p>Dried WF were pressed into tablets using a FW-4A powder compressing machine from Top Instrument Inc.

The contact angles of different liquids on compressed tablets of WF were measured by a JY-82 contact angle testing instrument from Chengde Testing Machine Central Factory (Hebei, China). The liquids used for testing were distilled water, glycol, cyclohexane, liquid paraffin, and aniline, their surface tension values can be found in reference 17.

Obviously, the increase of C=O stretching vibration strength is from ester in P(MAA-BA-MMA).

This is because C2 has the smallest inherent viscosity and the largest carboxyl value. The smaller inherent viscosity of P(MAA-BA-MMA) is more helpful in its spreading on the surface of WF and wrapping the WF up, and more carboxyl in P(MAA-BA-MMA) has more opportunities to react with hydroxyl from WF surface.

<p>Parameters such as average torque, fusion temperature, and plasticization time, etc. can reflect the processing properties of a composite. Better processing properties of WPC show lower average torque and fusion temperature and shorter plasticization time. Fixing the other components in the formula and only changing the content of compatibilizer, the test results of the relationship between compatibilizer C2’s content and average torque value, fusion temperature, and plasticization time are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684412441684">Figure 3</xref>.

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684412441684">Figure 3</xref>, when the compatibilizer content increases from 0 to 3 phr, the average torque of composite falls by 3.8 N·m.

The effect of compatibilizer’s content on the fusion temperature is similar to that of the average torque. And the plasticization time decline all the way, that is, inverse proportionality relationship in plasticization time to compatibilizer’s content. These all illustrate that C2 can improve the processing properties of composite. As MMA and BA segments in C2 have good compatibility with PVC matrix, they can play a certain plasticizer role in the PVC/WF composite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684412441684">10</xref></sup> Moreover, C2 can improve the dispersibility of WF in PVC matrix.

<p>From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412441684">Figure 5(a)</xref>, it is found that C2 can improve the tensile strength significantly. With the adding of C2, the tensile strength of composites with different WF’s content all increase in varying degrees compared to the corresponding raw composites. The more WF's content, the more obvious improvement of tensile strength becomes after treatment. However, all systems revealed that the tensile strength of composite will decrease as the presence of excess compatibilizer. The results indicate that rational use of compatibilizer in systems of different WF's content should be done. The compatibilizer’s optimal content for 20, 30, and 40 phr WF system is 1, 3, and 3 phr, respectively.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412441684">Figure 5(b)</xref> shows the elongation at break of PVC/WF composites with various contents of WF decrease significantly compared to neat PVC. The more WF's content, the more obvious decrease of the elongation at break. However, the adding of compatibilizer increases the elongation at break compared to the corresponding raw system, but when further adding compatibilizer, the elongation at break shows gentle downward trend. Overall, the effect of compatibilizer on elongation at break is not obvious.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412441684">Figure 5(c)</xref>, the impact strength of PVC/WF composites for various contents of WF rise at first and then decline as the compatibilizer concentration increases. When the WF's content is 20 phr and the compatibilizer is 1 phr, the impact strength increases by 35.9% compared to the raw composite, and even exceeds that of neat PVC. To get the best impact strength, the compatibilizer contents for WF systems of 20, 30, and 40 phr are 1, 3, and 3 phr, respectively.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412441684">Figure 5(d)</xref>, when the raw WF’s content is above 30 phr, the flexural strength of composite exceeds that of neat PVC. As the compatibilizer is added, the changes of flexural strength of composites are irregular, but on the whole they increase to some extent, and the biggest increase is 30.3%. The best compatibilizers’ contents for WF systems of 20, 30, and 40 phr are 5, 5, and 7 phr, respectively.</p>
<p>Young’s modulus of a material can be used to measure the difficulty of its elastic deformation when a stress is forced to the material. The bigger Young’s modulus, the smaller elastic deformation. This also means the stiffness of material is bigger. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412441684">Figure 5(e)</xref>, the addition of WF increases the Young’s modulus of the composite, the effect trend of C2 content on Young’s modulus of composite also first increases and then decreases.</p>
<p>Flexural modulus also can reflect the stiffness of material when the material occurs bending deformation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412441684">Figure 5(f)</xref>, it can be found that WF help to increase the flexural modulus of the composite, and the flexural modulus of the composite is higher than that of neat PVC except for the lower WF (20 phr) in its raw and treated states. The reason is that WF belongs to rigid particle and can form strong resistance and prevent the deformation of composites under external stress. In addition, it can be found that the right loading of C2 can increase the flexural modulus of composite, especially in the system of 20 phr WF. When the C2 content is 1 phr, the flexural modulus increase from 1576.72 to 1878.34 MPa, increased 19.13%.</p>
<p>To sum up, when the compatibilizer content is appropriate, the mechanical properties of composite would improve greatly. This is because P(MAA-BA-MMA) has amphiphilic functional groups that can improve the interfacial adhesion between PVC matrix and WF. On one hand, the -COOH of P(MAA-BA-MMA) form hydrogen or a certain chemical bond with the −OH from WF surface. So the compatibilizer combines inseparably with WF and change the strong polar surface of WF resulting from its multi-hydroxy, and this have been confirmed by FTIR spectra. On the other hand, the BA and MMA segments of P(MAA-BA-MMA) have excellent compatibility with PVC, which will promote the dispersion of WF in PVC matrix. Therefore, as the content of P(MAA-BA-MMA) increases, the –OH from WF will be gradually react, and the compatibility between WF and PVC matrix will be improved, so the mechanical properties of composite can be gradually improved. But the WF surface covered with excessive P(MAA-BA-MMA) will form weak interface with PVC matrix and lead to the decline of mechanical properties because P(MAA-BA-MMA) has lower relative molecular weight (the inherent viscosity only of 33.87 mL/g) and its strength is much lower than that of PVC matrix.</p>
<p>Further clear evidence of C2’s effect can be detected in SEM photos of PVC/WF composite. There are obvious interface with crack between WF and PVC in the raw composite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684412441684">Figure 6(a)</xref>); moreover, some of the WF are pulled out, the fracture surface of composite is smooth, showing a typical brittle fracture. However, in the treated composite at 1 phr C2’s content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684412441684">Figure 6(b)</xref>), the interface becomes blurred and none microvoid exists, some WF particles have been detached and few have been pulled out. In addition, the fracture surface of composite is rugged. These all show the interface between WF and PVC matrix in the treated composite is improved and the interface strength is enhanced after treatment of C2. Therefore, the treated composite manifests macroscopically the improvement of mechanical properties.

<sec id="sec19-0731684412441684"><title>Effect of C2’s content on density of composite</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684412441684">Figure 7(a)</xref> and (b) shows the effects of compatibilizer’s content on the theoretical and found density of PVC/WF composite, respectively. Theoretically, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684412441684">Figure 7(a)</xref>, the adding of high-density WF will lead to an increase in composite’s density, while the low-density compatibilizer will lead to a decrease in density. However, the actual measurement results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684412441684">Figure 7(b)</xref>) are not consistent with the theory forecast. The found density declines with the increase of WF’s content, while under the condition of fixed WF’s content, the found density increases with initial incorporation of compatibilizer then decreases for higher values of compatibilizer’s content. The main reasons for those differences are that the change of porosity caused by the compatibility among various components is ignored in the theoretical calculation, and the composite is regarded as an ideal, non-gap, and compact combination body. In this study, the found density of composite is mainly affected by two factors: one is the density of various components in the composite and the other is the porosity’s change which is mainly caused by the compatibility between WF and PVC matrix. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684412441684">Figure 7(b)</xref>, the increase of high-density WF's content does not lead to the increase in composite’s density but to its decrease. This indicates that the porosity in the composite is enhanced with the increase of WF loading, and the extent of density’s decline caused by porosity exceeds the extent of density’s increase caused by increment in WF's loading. Adding of compatibilizer at first causes an increasing trend and then a decreasing trend in density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684412441684">Figure 7(b)</xref>), and the reason for this is that C2 can improve the compatibility between WF and PVC matrix and reduce the porosity of composite, thus the density is improved. But after the WF is covered completely with compatibilizer, adding more low-density compatibilizer will lead to a decline in density of composite.

<sec id="sec20-0731684412441684"><title>Effect of C2’s content on water absorption of composite</title>
<p>Water absorption by WPC materials may lead to a number of unpleasant events. One is board distortions, swelling, and buckling. Another is mold propagation. Also, saturation of WPC boards with water sometimes decreases flexural modulus of the boards, and hence, results in a higher deflection under load. Besides, water absorption leads to a faster board deterioration, oxidation (water is a catalyst of plastic oxidation), and other negative consequences. So the water absorption of WPC will affect its durability. The value of water absorption is determined by the porosity of composite, nature fiber content, and the water absorption of the matrix itself. For the WPC with given formula and processing technology, the only factor determining the value of water absorption is the porosity of the composite, which is affected by the compatibility between WF and PVC. If the compatibility is poor, the interface between them will be obvious and many microvoids exist in the composite, thus the composite manifest macroscopically lower density and higher water absorption; on the contrary, if the compatibility is good, the two-phase interface will be blurry and the porosity will be reduced, and the composite will manifest macroscopically higher density and lower water absorption.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684412441684">Figure 8</xref> shows compatibilizer C2’s content on the water absorption of PVC/WF composite. Compared with neat PVC, the addition of raw WF increases water absorption substantially; the greater the raw WF’s content, the higher the water absorption of the composite. As the PVC matrix is hydrophobic (the water absorption of neat PVC is only 0.08%, which can be ignored), the increase of water-absorbent WF and the increase of the porosity of composite resulting from raw WF’s incompatibility with PVC matrix are responsible for this. However, after the addition of C2, the water absorption of PVC/WF composites decrease significantly, but if continuing to increase the compatibilizer’s content, it increases slightly. Reasons for this are that the carboxyl in C2 can form a certain chemical bond or hydrogen bond with the –OH from WF surface, and this results in the covering of WF with C2 which prevents WF from absorbing water; meanwhile, C2 improves the compatibility between PVC and WF, and reduces the porosity of composite, thereby reducing the exposure surface area of WF to water. So these two reasons are responsible for the decline of the water absorption of composite. As for the reason why the excessive compatibilizer causes the increase of water absorption, it may be that C2 also has strong water absorbent due to the carboxyl and ester functional groups in it.

<sec id="sec21-0731684412441684"><title>Analysis of relationships among C2’s content, tensile strength, found density, and water absorption</title>
<p>Hereinbefore, we analyzed the relationship among C2’s content, tensile strength, theoretical and found density, and water absorption. We find that, in the composite of WF’s content of 20, 30, and 40 phr, the tensile strength, found density, and water absorption of composite all get the best at the same content of compatibilizer of 1, 3, and 3 phr, respectively. This relationship can be clearly found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0731684412441684">Figure 9</xref>. It implies that the found density, water absorption, and tensile strength of the composite have a certain relation, that is, the bigger the found density, the smaller the water absorption and the bigger tensile strength in the corresponding system. The effects of compatibilizer’s content on found density, water absorption, and tensile strength relate with each other. These phenomena confirm that the compatibility of WF and PVC are improved after the treatment of WF; when the compatibilizer content is appropriate, the porosity of composite decreases to the minimum, the density reaches the largest and water absorption reaches the lowest, the WF and PVC matrix combine most tightly, and the internal defects are the least, therefore the mechanical properties appear the best. This relationship can provide an efficient shortcut for formula selection.

<sec id="sec22-0731684412441684" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The FTIR spectra confirm that the carboxyl in terpolymer P(MAA-BA-MMA) of MAA, BA, and MMA can form a certain chemical bond with WF surface so that P(MAA-BA-MMA) is able to combine firmly and chemically with WF surface and can not be cleared away in Soxhlet extraction. The treatment effects of P(MAA-BA-MMA) have a great connection with its molecular weight and carboxyl value. Among the three kinds of P(MAA-BA-MMA) with different molecular weight and carboxyl values, the one with inherent viscosity of 33.87 mL/g and carboxyl value of 3.93 mmol/g can most greatly improve the mechanical properties of composites: the fullest extent of tensile strength, elongation at break, flexural strength, and impact strength are increased by 62.7, 37.3, 30.3, and 35.9%, respectively. In addition to the improvement of mechanical properties, P(MAA-BA-MMA) also have a beneficial impact on the processing properties of composite. It can cause a decline in average torque value, fusion temperature, and plasticization time, which is significant to the PVC-based WPC that is hard to process. Moreover, it is found that P(MAA-BA-MMA) can enhance the density and decrease the water absorption of the composites, and there is also a certain relationship between the trend of P(MAA-BA-MMA)’s influence on the tensile strength and that of its influence on density and water absorption. When P(MAA-BA-MMA) is at the optimal content, the tensile strength and density are the largest while the water absorption is the smallest. The relationship can be applied to the research of formulation of PVC-based WPC. All of these beneficial results are obviously relevant to the improving of compatibility between WF and PVC with P(MAA-BA-MMA), and this is confirmed by contact angle, surface tension, and SEM results.</p></sec>
