<p>A <italic>right</italic>-wing grassroots movement? Or a retooled, corporate-controlled vehicle for the same old Republican right? That question has surrounded the Tea Party phenomenon since its emergence in the winter of 2009. The Republican losses in the 2012 elections—due in no small part to the unpopularity of Tea Party Senate candidates—have brought that debate into the heart of the Republican Party itself.</p>
<p><disp-quote><p><bold><italic>The Republican losses in the 2012 elections [were] due in no small part to the unpopularity of Tea Party Senate candidates.</italic></bold></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>For readers of this journal who approach history and politics within the framework of class analysis, there are other related issues: What is the social base of Tea Party groups? Do they represent, as their proponents and some analysts claim, the authentic voice of the white working class? Is the Tea Party a classic middle-class populist movement, frustrated by government and big business but antiworker in its orientation? Does it even fit the definition of “movement” at all? Finally, can a classical historical materialist framework help us understand the Tea Party in relation to the class structure of the United States today?</p>
<p>To answer these questions, it may be helpful to first see what those who have studied the Tea Party have to say about its political appeal and its contradictions.</p>
<sec id="section1-1095796012471639">
<title>A Social Movement or a Retooled Republican Right?</title>
<p>From the beginning, figures in the Republican establishment and conservative media outlets promoted Tea Party activities—an advantage never afforded to social movements of the left. The famous rant by CNBC reporter Rick Santelli in February 2009, calling for a “Chicago Tea Party” to protest the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), was only the most prominent example.</p>
<p>Even Theda Skocpol and Vanessa Williamson, who emphatically argue that the Tea Party represents a bona fide grassroots movement, acknowledge that its big-money political action committees and free-market foundations gave the Tea Party a national reach while Fox News and other conservative media outlets greatly amplified Tea Party activists’ voice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1095796012471639">1</xref></sup> Moreover, as Ronald P. Formisano shows, there is continuity in both personnel and politics between the Tea Party formations and previous iterations of the Republican right since the Ronald Reagan era. After the Republican loss of Congress in 2006 and the White House in 2008, he writes that the Tea Party became a means to “purify the Republican brand” as GOP donors poured money into ostensibly populist organizations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1095796012471639">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is wrong to see the Tea Party as simply a creation of the Republican establishment. In his book, <italic>Pity the Billionaire</italic>, Thomas Frank contends that GOP operatives tapped into popular sentiment over the economic crisis. The series of protests at the summer 2009 town hall meetings with members of Congress over health care reform were proposed by Republican operatives. Soon, Frank writes, the demonstrations followed a “path from the contrived to the genuine . . . The chance to inflict spectacular humiliation on some politician before the eyes of the nation was apparently the opportunity for which thousands had been waiting.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1095796012471639">3</xref></sup> In her book on the Tea Party, <italic>New York Times</italic> reporter Kate Zernike is categorical, calling it “an authentic popular movement, brought on by anger over the economy and distrust of government—at all levels, and in both parties.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1095796012471639">4</xref></sup> Washington rallies—most notably that organized by former Fox News personality Glenn Beck in August 2010—have drawn tens of thousands of Tea Party supporters. While the turnout was dwarfed by left-wing and progressive protests in the capital, the actions did highlight the existence of a range of local Tea Party groups.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1095796012471639">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The question is how durable the alliance between the corporate Republican establishment and the activist base will be. Thomas B. Edsall calls the Tea Party part of the “coalition of the haves” that links the interests of the “1 percent” to the higher-income sections of the middle class. Nevertheless, Edsall points out that the corporate embrace of the Tea Party has highlighted contradictions between middle-class activists and the big-business agenda. Former Representative Dick Armey, now a major conservative political fundraiser, portrays the Tea Party as a popular endorser of right-wing plans to slash Social Security and Medicare.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1095796012471639">6</xref></sup> However, the pensioners and middle-aged local Tea Party stalwarts who depend on those programs want them left untouched, because they feel <italic>they’</italic>ve earned those benefits.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1095796012471639">7</xref></sup> Edsall contends that when Tea Party supporters say they want to get rid of entitlements, they mean cutting programs that, they believe, go to undeserving African-Americans and immigrants.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1095796012471639">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>This racism, even if expressed in a coded manner, helps corporate interests divert Tea Party anger away from big business. Even Zernike, who views open racists among the Tea Party as a fringe element, admits that “the movement was inherently attractive to people who believed that the government had coddled minorities and the disadvantaged.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1095796012471639">9</xref></sup> In 2010, she notes, some 52 percent of Tea Party supporters said that “too much” had been made of the problems facing black people.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1095796012471639">10</xref></sup></p>
<p><disp-quote><p><bold><italic>The corporate embrace of the Tea Party has highlighted contradictions between middle-class activists and the big-business agenda.</italic></bold></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>But such indirect expressions of racial animosity are just the tip of the iceberg, argue researchers Paul Street and Anthony DiMaggio: “The Tea Partiers’ racial attitudes reflect a heavily mediated corporate-neoliberal ideology that denies the role of any forms of structural oppression in the creation of black misery.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1095796012471639">11</xref></sup> Indeed, opinion polls found self-identified Tea Party supporters as holding racial attitudes well to the right of the majority of the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1095796012471639">12</xref></sup> This could prove to be a liability for the Tea Party’s corporate backers, and several prominent Republican voices blamed the election defeat on the Tea Party–driven effort to focus primarily on white voter turnout.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1095796012471639">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another source of potential conflict between Tea Party supporters and the business interests is the bank bailouts. Libertarians active in the Tea Party espouse the ultrafree market perspectives promoted by two key patrons of the movement, billionaires Charles and David Koch. The libertarians must sometimes sit uneasily beside activists from the Christian Right, which has used the Tea Party as a vehicle for its own agenda. What unites them, argues Zernike, is “the belief that a strict interpretation of the U.S. Constitution is the solution to government grown wild.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1095796012471639">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>But this alliance can break down easily when it comes to policy, as illustrated by the famous Tea Party picket sign that read, “Keep Your Government Hands Off My Medicare.” Furthermore, grassroots Tea Partiers occasionally have been resentful at corporate attempts to control the operation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1095796012471639">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Immigration is another source of friction between the Tea Party’s popular base and corporate backers. Some 83 percent of Tea Party supporters in 2010 saw immigration as a “serious problem.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1095796012471639">16</xref></sup> Tea Party activists have helped drive the debate ration well to the right by supporting harsh local and state anti-immigration laws,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1095796012471639">17</xref></sup> measures viewed with unease by many employers of immigrant labor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1095796012471639">18</xref></sup> Following the 2012 elections, key Republican politicians signaled their willingness to compromise on immigration reform, not only to appease the business lobby but also to help the GOP escape its white demographic cul-de-sac.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1095796012471639">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yet for now, argue Skocpol and Williamson, the Tea Party is unlikely to crack up over such differences: “No one should expect real fireworks between elite free-market advocates and local Tea Partiers . . . If an organization seems to be against Obama and liberals, Tea Partiers are trusting to the point of gullibility.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1095796012471639">20</xref></sup> It remains to be seen if these predictions will hold up as the Republican Party quarrels over whom to blame for its failure in 2012. While moderates blame the Tea Party for costing them the Senate and scaring away voters from presidential candidate Mitt Romney, the Tea Party counters that the problem was that Romney was not conservative enough.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1095796012471639">21</xref></sup></p>

<title>Politics and the Middle Class</title>
<p>This characterization of the Tea Party—angry and resentful toward big business, yet ultimately procapitalist and conservative—dovetails with the classical Marxist analysis of the middle class.</p>
<p>In <italic>The Communist Manifesto</italic>, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels set out to define a working-class political worldview in distinction to what they called petty bourgeois (small capitalist) political currents of their day. They concluded that the petty bourgeoisie was Janus-faced, looking in two directions at once. Certainly, small entrepreneurs are constantly squeezed by the pressure of big capital. At the same time, however, they are often small-scale employers, or at least aspire to be. Even owners who get their hands dirty in the shop are exploiting the labor of those who work alongside them.</p>
<p>Politically, therefore, Marx and Engels saw the politics of the petty bourgeoisie as vacillating. The shopkeeper or merchant was open to a critique of the banks and government officials, and sometimes even led the way in movements for democratic reforms. Yet as a class, the petty bourgeoisie was also wary of, and even hostile toward, labor unions and working-class political organization.</p>
<p>The rise of fascism in Europe in the 1920s and 1930s compelled Marxists to further develop their analysis of the middle class. Even before the First World War, industrialization had undermined the traditional petty bourgeoisie and given rise to a new strata of corporate and state functionaries. The war and postwar economic crises further destabilized the old and new middle class, which looked for salvation from economic and social forces it saw as threatening.</p>
<p>A new middle-class movement—fascism—then emerged as Benito Mussolini led a popular organization that combined rhetorical anticapitalism with the violent suppression of unions and working-class political parties. The Italian Communist leader Antonio Gramsci, however, pointed out a contradiction between fascism’s plebian social roots and the wealthy industrialists who financed Mussolini’s dictatorship, noting that Mussolini’s economic views were a throwback to the “pre-war years, the period before the ‘trusts’ and the concentration of industrial capital in banks.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1095796012471639">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Leon Trotsky developed a similar argument in his analysis of the rise of fascism in Germany. Because working-class parties had failed to win over the middle class to a socialist program, he wrote, the Nazis could win middle-class support by co-opting anticapitalist slogans while smashing working-class organization:<disp-quote>
<p>German fascism, like Italian fascism, raised itself to power on the backs of the petty bourgeoisie, which it turned into a battering ram against the organizations of the working class and the institutions of democracy. But fascism in power is least of all the rule of the petty bourgeoisie. On the contrary, it is the most ruthless dictatorship of monopoly capital.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1095796012471639">23</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The Marxist analysis of fascism is relevant again in Europe, given the rise of far right and even openly Nazi parties.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1095796012471639">24</xref></sup> In the United States, where matters are not nearly so acute, the Marxist approach gives us critical insight into the politics of the changing middle class under the impact of the economic crisis.</p>

<title>The U.S. Middle Class in Transition</title>
<p>In the United States, as in other advanced countries, the rise of modern industrial society gave rise to a new middle class of professionals and managers as the social weight of shop owners and farmers declined in the postwar era. Still, the traditional petty bourgeoisie continued to hold ideological sway over the new middle class and sections of the working class.</p>
<p>

<p><bold><italic>The Marxist approach gives us critical insight into the politics of the changing middle class under the impact of the economic crisis.</italic></bold></p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Thomas Frank argues that the Tea Party benefited from a procapitalist ideological default setting in the American middle class. He quotes the sociologist C. Wright Mills’ 1951 classic, <italic>White Collar</italic>:<disp-quote>
<p>Over the last hundred years, the United States has been transformed from a nation of small capitalists into a nation of hired employees; but the ideology suitable for the nation of small capitalists persists, as if that small-propertied world were still a going concern.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1095796012471639">25</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>More than half a century later, Frank finds Mills’ analysis still relevant to explain the Tea Party’s version of populism, which identifies bureaucratic big government as the enemy, rather than rapacious corporations.</p>
<p>In Mills’ day, however, the new middle class benefited from the New Deal consensus and supported it politically, ensuring near continuous Democratic dominance of Congress from the 1930s to the 1990s. Cocooned in corporate and governmental bureaucracies, the middle class was not pulling to the right. More or less inert politically, it would continue to vacillate between the labor movement and business, Mills argues.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1095796012471639">26</xref></sup> The challenge at that time was to explain the quiescence of the middle class, not its turn to the right.</p>
<p>Other prominent Marxist-influenced writers took up the analysis. Andre Gorz, writing some sixteen years after Mills, also takes the measure of a new “technocracy” that mediates between capital and labor in the modern industrial state. Like Mills, Gorz sees this strata as largely eschewing politics: “Depoliticization is the ideology of technocracy itself.” “For [the technocrat],” Gorz continues, “the only truth is smooth functioning; and he sees value only in immediately applicable propositions. The rest is utopia.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1095796012471639">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the United States, the end of the postwar boom destabilized life for this putatively apolitical new middle class. The employers’ offensive against unions that began with the New York City fiscal crisis in the mid-1970s and the defeat of the PATCO strike gave capital momentum as it squeezed wages and benefits of both workers and salaried personnel. Austerity programs that reduced the social wage with cuts in education and social services hit sections of the middle class as well as workers.</p>
<p>The two major parties accepted capital’s new consensus of a break with the New Deal settlement. Their challenge was how to carry it out while maintaining a political base. It was not easy. Democratic President Jimmy Carter’s shift to the right on deregulation and domestic spending cuts alienated labor and other sections of his party’s base, sparking a primary fight and opening the way for Ronald Reagan’s election in 1980. Reagan’s GOP had reinvigorated itself by tapping the energy of a newly organized Christian Right and by following Richard Nixon’s strategy of bringing the old “Dixiecrat” white Southern voting base into the GOP.</p>
<p>Ever since, Republican Party operatives have successfully merged an increasingly aggressive probusiness, antiworker agenda with appeals to sections of the middle class on conservative social issues while systematically trying to capture the state for the benefit of the wealthy. To do so, the right struck a populist pose: “From now on it would be a movement not of bankers and manufacturers, but of outsiders, of rebels, of freedom fighters, even,” wrote Thomas Frank in 2008. “It would recruit and mobilize the embittered and the aggrieved—blue-collar patriots worried about the Soviet threat, born-again Christians watching their culture fall apart—and form them into a vast grassroots insurgency.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1095796012471639">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>This strategy worked in the 1980s as the Reagan boom reconfigured middle-class politics. The ideological hangover of the old petty bourgeoisie that Mills described got a new boost in what Steve Fraser described as the “capitalist version of liberationist theology.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1095796012471639">29</xref></sup> Free markets were extolled as the alternative to the failures of Big Government and entrepreneurialism hailed as a way to shake up or eliminate slothful and inefficient manufacturers.</p>
<p>Workers—and a broad swath of the middle class—were bound to be losers under this harsh new regime. “As the New Right’s leaders recognized, social issues were the only hope for winning the working class and Middle Americans over to an economic agenda that was unabashedly old right—anti-labor and pro-business,” Barbara Ehrenreich wrote at the close of the Reagan era.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1095796012471639">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>By the 1992 elections, the Democrats had adapted to this approach. Michael Lind contends that Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter “have been more conservative in economics than Nixon and Eisenhower.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1095796012471639">31</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section4-1095796012471639">
<title>The U.S. Middle-Class and Right-Wing Politics Today</title>
<p>The economic crisis has shattered the assumptions of the U.S. middle class. For example, in 2008, as the recession began, the approximately 658,500 front-line supervisors of production and operating workers had a mean annual wage of $53,500, putting them ahead of most blue-collar workers but leaving them financially vulnerable to the housing bust and mass layoffs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1095796012471639">32</xref></sup> As defined by income, this layer has also suffered from excruciatingly slow job growth in the recovery: the number of full-time employees in the middle quintile was essentially flat between 2010 and 2011, compared with a 17.3 percent growth at the bottom quintile and a 2.5 percent rise at the highest one.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1095796012471639">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>People who worked for a salary but considered themselves middle class now find themselves pushed down the social ladder as their jobs are deskilled or even eliminated by technology or crisis-driven downsizing. As investigative journalists Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele note, the long-term rise in inequality has hammered large sections of the middle class as well as workers. They point out how the evisceration of traditional defined-benefit pensions and the housing bust have shattered the expectations of professionals and managers along with workers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1095796012471639">34</xref></sup> Moreover, professional and technical jobs long considered impervious to outsourcing, such as engineering and “knowledge processing” tasks, are being shifted overseas in increasing numbers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1095796012471639">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>These sections of the recession-battered middle class are potentially open to a hard right political agenda. While the Tea Party is a very long way from the far-right parties in Western Europe that successfully challenge traditional conservative parties, its emergence shows the relevance of the traditional Marxist view of the middle class as a vacillating social layer that is drawn either to the left by a strong workers’ movement or to the right by capital and its political representatives.</p>
<p>Given the weakness of organized labor and the left—and the unions’ reluctance to challenge Obama—the Tea Party was able to count on populist resistance, at least until the Occupy movement came along. But that was too late for the Democrats in the 2010 elections. In his updated history of the Democratic Party, Lance Selfa argues that disillusionment with the president, not a hard rightward shift, lay behind the GOP landslide in the 2010 election:<disp-quote>
<p>It was bad enough that the Tea Party right seemed to capture the “populist” tenor of the times, but popular organizations that should have been mobilizing to push the administration were instead pressed into service as the last line of defense for a corporate party that disdains them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1095796012471639">36</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section5-1095796012471639">
<title>The Contradictions of the Tea Party’s Success</title>
<p>The Republicans recaptured the house in 2010, with longtime politicians like Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina and Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota serving as a bridge between the new activists and the traditional GOP electoral machine. Out of sixty-three Republicans that ousted Democrats, some forty-two were tied to the Tea Party.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1095796012471639">37</xref></sup> Voters who put Obama in office two years earlier stayed home, disillusioned by the administration’s failure to carry out an economic program that would benefit working people and youth. According to exit polls, voters were much more likely to be white and older than the U.S. population as a whole—the demographic sweet spot for the Tea Party.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1095796012471639">38</xref></sup></p>
<p><disp-quote><p><bold><italic>Given the weakness of organized labor and the left, the Tea Party was able to count on populist resistance, at least until the Occupy movement came along.</italic></bold></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Yet even in the 2010 Republican landslide, there were clear signs that the Tea Party had limited appeal. The far-right campaigns of Sharron Angle in Nevada and Christine O’Donnell in Delaware allowed Democrats to retain seats many thought they would be likely to lose.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1095796012471639">39</xref></sup> Ironically, it was Tea Party–backed House Republicans who blew up a bipartisan budget deal in the summer of 2011 that would have severely cut social spending while imposing mild tax increases on the rich.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1095796012471639">40</xref></sup> Similar tensions delayed the authorization of an increase in the U.S. debt ceiling, raising questions over whether the Tea Party caucus had overreached. The 2012 elections only heightened those concerns as Tea Party–backed Senate candidates lost elections in Indiana and Missouri that they were deemed certain to win, largely due to outrage over the candidates’ comments on rape.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1095796012471639">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>The near-term outlook for the various Tea Party efforts will depend on the internal Republican debate over the outcome of the 2012 elections. Certainly the wealthy donors and conservative media outlets that have promoted the Tea Party will continue to push a business-driven agenda to further slash government spending, including Social Security and Medicare—if not through the Tea Party and the Republican right, then by means of a “grand bargain” reached by President Obama and the GOP.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1095796012471639">42</xref></sup></p>
<p><disp-quote><p><bold><italic>The near-term outlook for the various Tea Party efforts will depend on the internal Republican debate over the outcome of the 2012 elections.</italic></bold></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>For their part, big-money Tea Party backers like the Koch brothers and corporate-funded lobbying groups like FreedomWorks aim not to shatter the U.S. political consensus, but to drive it further to the right so that policy goals that once seemed unthinkable could now be within reach. The Tea Party has already benefitted its corporate backers by furthering the austerity agenda and giving a Democratic president the political cover to contemplate cuts in social spending that would likely provoke a rebellion if pushed by a Republican president. Despite Republican losses in the 2012 elections, more austerity is on the way—and as the title of Edsall’s recent book puts it, it will continue to remake American politics.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is by no means certain that the angry middle-class activists will remain simply foot soldiers for the Republican Party. The long-term economic crisis will provide a basis for the extreme right to grow in the United States, drawing upon the ugly tradition of white supremacy, vigilante racism, and antilabor violence, along with nativism. Those who support the self-organization of working people must take up the challenge and put forward an alternative vision based on social justice and workers’ right to organize.</p>
