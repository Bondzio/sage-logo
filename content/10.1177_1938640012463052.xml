<abstract>
<p><italic>Purpose</italic>: Debate exists over optimal treatment for acute Achilles tendon ruptures. Recent literature suggests the mini-open technique may provide the reliability of the open repair with the decreased complication rate of non-operative treatment. This retrospective review compares acute tendon ruptures treated with one of two techniques: open repair (TO) or mini-open repair (MOA). <italic>Methods &amp; Results</italic>: Records were reviewed and 34 patients were found to meet the inclusion criteria for open or mini-open repair of an acute Achilles tendon rupture with follow up of at least 12 months. TO (n=16) and MOA (n=18) had no statistically significant differences in age at time of injury [TO: 41 + 2.5 years (range 20 – 68); MOA: 46 + 2.5 years (range 33 – 73)] or time between injury and surgical repair [TO: 15 + 2 days (range 2 – 30); MOA: 15 + 2 days (range 2 – 30)]. Post-operative VISA-A scores were 82 + 10 (range 42 – 98) and 92 + 5 (range 66 – 100) for TO and MOA, respectively. Significant differences were found in the time between surgical intervention and beginning of rehabilitation [TO: Post op day 37 + 5 (range 21 – 46); MOA: Post op day 19 + 2 (range 7 – 32)] and the time between surgical intervention and full return to activity [TO: Post op month 7 + 1 (range 4 – 11); MOA: Post op month 5 + 0.6 (range 4 – 11)]. <italic>Conclusion</italic>: These results suggest that the mini-open repair provides acceptable surgical outcomes while optimizing patient function after Achilles tendon repair.</p>

<p>Rupture of the Achilles tendon is the third most common major tendon rupture,with an incidence of 18 per 100 000.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640012463052">1</xref></sup> The increasing frequency of this injury has been correlated to the intermittent involvement in athletic activities among a sedentary population.

<p>Open Achilles tendon repair allows direct visualization of apposing ruptured tendon ends, but is frequently associated with postoperative complications such as wound edge necrosis, dehiscence, scar hypertrophy, adhesions, infections, and sural nerve injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938640012463052">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938640012463052"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938640012463052"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938640012463052"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938640012463052">15</xref></sup> The majority of conventional open repair techniques involve a long incision invading poorly vascularized skin, extensive stripping of the paratenon contributing to potential infection, adhesions, and wound healing problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640012463052">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938640012463052">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938640012463052">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>First described by Ma and Griffith,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640012463052">7</xref></sup> percutaneous approaches were developed to avoid extensive surgical dissection, thereby minimizing disturbance to local blood supply. The ability of the surgeon to debride hematoma is obviously decreased in the percutaneous repair, and the ability to realign the tendon ends may be diminished as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1938640012463052">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1938640012463052">17</xref></sup> The cadaveric work of Hockenbury and Johns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1938640012463052">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1938640012463052">17</xref></sup> recognized a major limitation of the percutaneous technique, demonstrating a maligned Achilles tendon stumps in 4 of 5 tendons repaired with a percutaneous technique.</p>

Calder and Saxby modified that technique and recommended a small horizontal incision 1 cm distal to the proximal tendon stump, attempting to improve wound healing and cosmetic appearance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1938640012463052">22</xref></sup> Strength of the Achillon repair was investigated in a cadaveric study, and it was found to have a higher load to failure than the Krackow locking stitch.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1938640012463052">23</xref></sup> A recent meta-analysis of 277 patients supported this technique, identifying no differences between an open repair and a mini-open repair in rate of complication or infection with a significantly higher incidence of subjective good to excellent results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1938640012463052">24</xref></sup></p>

The purpose of this study is to directly compare the functional results of the mini-open repair to the open repair for management of an acute Achilles tendon rupture.</p>
<sec id="section1-1938640012463052" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Records were reviewed for all patients who underwent surgical management for an Achilles tendon rupture performed between January 2002 and January 2010. Inclusion criteria included a repair of an acute Achilles tendon rupture performed by open or mini-open technique, complete medical records, and follow-up of at least 12 months. Patients were excluded from the review if a procedure was performed for a condition other than an acute Achilles tendon repair (ie, repair of a chronically torn tendon, longitudinal tendon repairs, Haglund’s resection) and if follow up was less than 12 months. A total of 34 patients (18 mini-open Achilles tendon repairs and 16 open Achilles tendon repairs) met the inclusion criteria for this study.</p>
<p>The open Achilles tendon repair procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1938640012463052">Figure 1</xref>) used in this study involved a longitudinal posterior incision made slightly medial to the midline. The paratenon was carefully reflected and hematoma was evacuated. Frayed tendon edges were debrided. The tendon was re-approximated with a large-gauge nonabsorbable suture using a Krackow locking suture technique. The surgical incision was closed in layers. A below the knee gravity equinus cast was applied for 4 to 6 weeks. Progression to functional rehabilitation and progressive return to activities subsequently occurred.</p>

</fig>
<p>All mini-open Achilles tendon repairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1938640012463052">Figure 2</xref>) performed used a technique modified from Assal et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1938640012463052">21</xref></sup> A transverse incision was made over the site of the tendon rupture and deepened via blunt dissection to the level of the paratenon. The paratenon was incised and reflected, all hematoma evacuated, and the tendon edges debrided. An Achillon device (Integra Lifesciences Corporation, Plainsboro, NJ) was used for tendon repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1938640012463052">21</xref></sup> The internal prongs of the instrument were placed around the edges of the Achilles tendon but deep to the paratenon. Three sutures were passed proximally. All sutures were placed through the main substance of the tendon. This process was repeated distally. The device was removed. All sutures were tied with the tendon appropriately tensioned. It should be noted that as the sutures were tied, the tendon edges were able to be visualized through the surgical incision, thereby preventing the mal-alignment noted by previous authors for other similar techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1938640012463052">16</xref></sup> The surgical incision was closed in layers. A below the knee gravity equinus cast was applied for approximately 2 weeks. Functional rehabilitation was started when the below the knee cast was removed and the patient began to ambulate in a CAM walker with heel wedges that were progressively removed. Patients subsequently progressed to full, unrestricted activity.</p>

<p>Retrospective analysis was performed comparing age at the time of injury, length of time between injury and surgical correction, location of incision, procedure performed, initiation of rehabilitation postoperatively, full/unrestricted return to activity, and complications. All patients were assessed with the Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment–Achilles (VISA-A) score. The VISA-A score is a specific, reliable, valid indicator of Achilles tendinopathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1938640012463052">28</xref></sup> The survey uses 8 questions in which patients score multiple subjective complaints concerning morning stiffness of the Achilles tendon, pain during stretching, pain during flat walking, pain with walking downstairs, pain with single leg heel raises, pain with single leg hops, and pain with sporting activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1938640012463052">28</xref></sup> The “perfect” score for this is 100, with healthy subjects typically scoring 96 to 100.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1938640012463052">29</xref></sup></p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Patients were separated into 2 groups: the open group (TO) and the mini-open Achillon group (MOA). Sixteen patients were included in the TO group, and 18 patients were included in the MOA group.</p>
<p>The TO group had a patient population with an average age of 41 ± 2.5 years (range = 20-68). The average number of days between injury and surgical intervention was 15 ± 2 days (range =1-30). In this group, 15 patients had a longitudinal incision while 1 patient had a curvilinear incision. Rehabilitation was initiated at postoperative day 37 ± 5 (range = 21-46). Full, unrestricted return to activities on average occurred at postoperative month 7 ± 1 (range = 4-11). There were 3 (18.8%) cases of wound dehiscence, with 2 requiring additional surgery. No other complications were noted in this group. The postoperative VISA-A score for the TO group was 82 ± 10 (range = 42-98). All patients healed and returned to full functional activity.</p>
<p>The MOA group had a patient population with an average age of 46 ± 2.5 years (range = 33-73). The average number of days between injury and surgical intervention was 15 ± 2 days (range = 2-30). In this group, 17 patients had a transverse incision while 1 patient had a longitudinal incision. Rehabilitation was initiated at postoperative day 19 ± 2 (range = 7-32). Full, unrestricted return to activities on average occurred at postoperative month 5 ± 0.6 (range = 4-11). There were 2 (11%) complications in this group: 1 partial re-rupture that was treated with an open repair and 1 dehiscence. The re-rupture occurred in a patient who prematurely removed their walking boot at 27 days postoperative and slipped on ice. The partial re-rupture was repaired acutely under local anesthesia and results are included in this study. The postoperative VISA-A score for the MOA group was 92 ± 5 (range = 66-100). All patients healed and returned to full functional activity.</p>
<p>In comparing the 2 groups, the age at the time of injury (<italic>P</italic> = .196; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1938640012463052">Figure 3</xref>) and time between injury and surgical intervention (<italic>P</italic> = .293; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1938640012463052">Figure 4</xref>) were not statistically different between groups. The time between surgical intervention and initiation of functional rehabilitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1938640012463052">Figure 5</xref>) was found to be significantly less in the MOA group when compared with the TO group (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Acute Achilles tendon ruptures are a relative common injury of the lower extremity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640012463052">1</xref></sup>; however, optimal care for this condition continues to evolve.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1938640012463052">30</xref></sup> Debate exists over the most optimal treatment for this injury: nonoperative care, percutaneous repair, mini-open repair or open repair of the acute tendon rupture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1938640012463052">30</xref></sup> Recent literature advocates the use of the mini-open technique as a safe and effective means of repairing a ruptured Achilles tendon with fewer complications than associated with an open repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1938640012463052">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1938640012463052">26</xref></sup> The current study retrospectively compared a group of patients treated with traditional open repair to a group of patients who were treated with the Achillon mini-open repair and found the VISA-A score to be higher in the mini-open repair group than the traditional open repair group.</p>
<p>Kakiuchi published a report comparing the treatment of acute Achilles tendon ruptures with a new limited open approach to an open repair method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1938640012463052">18</xref></sup> The study compared 12 patients treated with limited open repair to 10 patients treated with traditional open repair. Although no recognized scoring system was used to assess the patients, evaluation was performed through interviews and physician examination demonstrating statistically significant better outcomes in the limited open repair group.</p>
<p>Bhattacharyya and Gerber compared the postoperative morbidity of a group of patients treated with the mini-open technique to a group of patients treated with the more traditional open technique,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1938640012463052">31</xref></sup> with full weight bearing allowed 8 weeks after surgical repair in both groups. There was an increase in postoperative wound infections and delayed wound healing in the open repair group. The authors concluded that the Achillon instrumentation may provide a cost-effective repair as the lack of wound complications in this group decreased opiate use and decreased costs associated with wound care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1938640012463052">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some authors have questioned the strength of the mini-open repair when directly compared with the more traditional open repair. Ismail et al addressed this question in their 2008 comparison of the mini-open technique to the Kessler method of repair on simulated Achilles tendon ruptures in sheep. It was found that the mean load to failure was not statistically significantly different between the mini-open and the Kessler methods of repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1938640012463052">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rebeccato et al compared the open approach, the combined mini-open and percutaneous technique, and the percutaneous technique in a total of 52 patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640012463052">5</xref></sup> Postoperatively, the strength of the previously injured and repaired extremity was 75% in the open repair group, 88% in the percutaneous repair group, and 92% in the combined mini-open and percutaneous procedure group when compared with the uninvolved extremity. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were taken on these patients and it was found that the area of the posterior calf of the uninjured leg compared with the injured leg was 82% in the open repair, 81% in the percutaneous procedure, and 91% in the combined mini-open and percutaneous procedure. These authors subsequently concluded that that the combined mini-open and percutaneous repair gave significantly better results than the other 2 procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640012463052">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Aktas and Kocaoglu reported the only prospective, randomized control trial published to date comparing the open and mini-open techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1938640012463052">33</xref></sup> A total of 40 consecutive patients were enrolled in the trial and randomized into the open or the mini-open groups. The open repair consisted of the Krackow end-to-end suture repair, and the Achillon technique was similar to that reported by Assal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1938640012463052">21</xref></sup> The ACFAS hindfoot score was 98.7 in the open group and 96.8 in the mini-open group, which was not found to be significantly different. Despite functionally similar, the 2 groups differed, with the mini-open group having decreased local tenderness, fewer adhesions, and decreased scar and tendon thickness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1938640012463052">33</xref></sup> The authors concluded that the mini-open repair with the Achillon device was safe, reliable, and practical for the use in Achilles tendon repairs with a low risk of complications.</p>
<p>A recent meta-analysis compared 6 randomized controlled trials for Achilles tendon repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1938640012463052">24</xref></sup> A total of 277 Achilles repairs were included in this review—136 mini-open repairs and 141 open repairs. The analysis yielded no difference in results between groups for incidence of re-rupture, tissue adhesion, sural nerve injury, deep infection, or deep vein thrombosis. However, the mini-open group had a significantly decreased rate of infection, with a 3-fold higher incidence of subjective good to excellent results.</p>
<p>This retrospective review compared a group of patients treated with traditional open repair to a group of patients who were treated with the Achillon mini-open repair. The 2 groups of patients were similar in age at the time of injury and elapsed time between injury and surgical correction; however, there was a significant difference between initiation of rehabilitation and the amount of time to unrestricted activity in the mini-open Achillon group. The strength of the study is the comparison of 2 surgical techniques for the repair of an acute Achilles tendon rupture with a focus on functional outcomes. The limitation of the study is a small patient population and its retrospective design.</p>
<p>Surgical repair of the acute Achilles tendon rupture is traditionally associated with high postoperative morbidity and wound complications. With new instrumentation and mini-open techniques, it is clear that surgical treatment of this condition is evolving to optimize outcomes and minimize complications.</p>
