<abstract>
<p>This study compares data from the Connecticut Offender Reentry Program (CORP) and retrospective data for inmates who received standard treatment planning services from the Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addictions Services (DMHAS). Analysis of DMHAS data investigated characteristics (demographic, psychiatric, and prison classification scores) and recidivism rates of 883 individuals. A program evaluation was later completed on a separate cohort of 88 individuals who participated in CORP. Comparison of the study results found that 14.1% of the CORP participants were rearrested within 6 months of discharge compared to 28.3% of the DMHAS group. This study concluded that younger age and having a co-occurring substance use disorder appear to be predictors of recidivism. A distinctly smaller percentage of CORP participants were recidivistic, indicating support for specialized reentry programs.</p>

<body>
<p>Growing numbers of offenders with mental illness are involved in the U.S. criminal justice system. In 2005, more than 700,000 state prison inmates and nearly 500,000 jail inmates reported having a recent history or current symptoms of mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078345811421117">James &amp; Glaze, 2006</xref>). Since the advent of deinstitutionalization, correctional facilities have arguably become a repository for many mentally ill individuals, whose behaviors often intersect with the criminal justice system resulting in imprisonment. Overcrowded prisons and fragmented community mental health services compound the problem of providing adequate treatment for the mentally ill offender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078345811421117">Torrey, Kennard, Eslinger, Lamb, &amp; Pavle, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Inmates with severe mental illness and co-occurring substance use disorders comprise a large portion of this population. Studies have shown that 70% or more of participants sampled had both a severe mental disorder and a substance abuse disorder, and this pattern is seen in both male and female offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078345811421117">Hartwell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078345811421117">Teplin, Abram, &amp; McClelland, 1997</xref>). This rate is comparatively higher than that in the psychiatric population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078345811421117">Abram, Teplin, &amp; McClelland, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078345811421117">Teplin et al., 1997</xref>). Offenders having a co-occurring substance use disorder frequently have “compounded problems,” including higher rates of homelessness, probation violations, recidivism, and criminal activity related to substance use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078345811421117">Hartwell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078345811421117">McNiel, Binder, &amp; Robinson, 2005</xref>). Criminal justice cases are more complex and tend to involve substance abuse for those with mental illness when compared to offenders with mental illness alone. Inmates with an additional diagnosis of a substance use disorder are in some cases less likely to receive services. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078345811421117">Teplin, Abram, and McClelland (1997)</xref> conducted a study investigating mentally disordered women receiving services in jail. The analysis showed that women having schizophrenia or mania and comorbid drug use or dependence were less likely to receive services than those who had major depression and comorbid drug use or dependence.</p>
<p>Given the issues described, it is not surprising that the high rate of mentally ill offenders returning to incarceration is a national problem. Poor identification of psychological disorders in detainees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078345811421117">Ford et al., 2007</xref>) and subsequent lack of treatment or disjointed treatment inside the facility is a disservice to the offender who, upon reentry into the community, remains improperly treated for mental illness. The behaviors associated with their untreated or improperly treated illness places them at risk once again for reoffending. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078345811421117">Lovell, Gagliardi, and Peterson (2002)</xref> found that the first year after release is often the time when reoffending behavior occurs, and 77% of new offenses occurred during this time period. Mental health treatment needs follow the individual; this illustrates how discharge planning and follow-up contacts are critical to ensuring continuity of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078345811421117">Osher, Steadman, &amp; Barr, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078345811421117">Steadman, Morris, &amp; Dennis, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate characteristics of mentally ill offenders from two groups: inmates who received standard treatment planning services from a state mental health agency (Department of Mental Health and Addictions Services [DMHAS]) and mentally ill offenders who participated in a specialized reentry program (Connecticut Offender Reentry Program [CORP]). Specific factors were reviewed to investigate whether any variables were associated with the likelihood of rearrest. Recidivism rates in the DMHAS group and the CORP group were compared to help determine if, and to what extent, the CORP intervention contributes to the successful reintegration of offenders beyond current Connecticut Department of Correction (CDOC) and DMHAS treatment needs identification.</p>
<sec id="section1-1078345811421117">
<title>Background</title>
<p>The CDOC and the DMHAS formed an interagency collaborative program to ensure continuity of care for DMHAS clients in a manner that encourages community reintegration and decreases recidivism. Established in 1996, this program helps reduce the likelihood that recently released offenders with mental health needs will “fall through the cracks” and miss opportunities to be connected to social services by breaking down barriers between systems and providers and disrupting the cycle of untreated mentally ill offenders returning to prison.</p>
<sec id="section2-1078345811421117">
<title>Description of CORP</title>
<p>Serious and violent offenders are those who commit felony crimes such as aggravated assault, robbery, and rape. These acts often involve the use of a weapon and result in injury or threat of injury. Serious and violent offenders with significant mental health and co-occurring substance use disorders have been found to be inadequately served by the state’s current treatment systems and identified as a group in need of a model program to ensure continuity of care upon release from prison. When transitioning back to the state’s three largest urban centers, these offenders were found to be especially at high risk of homelessness, arrest, and reincarceration. To address these needs, the CORP program was developed to include three components: a corrections-based Life Skills Reentry Curriculum, collaborative reentry planning sessions to identify and prioritize life concerns, and implementation of the reentry plan through targeted community services and criminal justice supervision.</p>
<p>Participants were screened to meet eligibility criteria, which included prisoners (men and women) age 18 and older who were incarcerated in one of the two major Connecticut correctional institutions, had 6 to 12 months left on their sentence, had been convicted of a serious or violent offense, had a significant mental health disorder and substance abuse disorder, and were in need of prerelease skills training and postrelease services such as housing, mental health/substance abuse treatment, or vocational assistance. Candidates were identified and referred to CORP by CDOC staff. If eligibility criteria were met and the individual was interested in participating, he or she was accepted into the program and placed into a CORP group consisting of 6 to 12 individuals.</p>
<p>The groups were organized around eight program modules. Within program modules are program sessions, which are conceptually related to their representative program modules. For example, under Program Module 3, “Managing Feelings,” there are three sessions called “Are You Under Stress?” “Anger Styles—Escalating,” and “Working Through Fear” (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078345811421117">Table 1</xref>). Group cycles lasted 9 to 12 months and met twice a week. Sessions were facilitated by a PhD-level psychologist, a social worker, or a bachelor-level paraprofessional with experience conducting groups with the mentally ill and in corrections who have been trained in the curriculum. All CORP clinicians followed the same curriculum format and all received the same training facilitated by the CORP program manager over the course of several weeks. CORP clinicians also met monthly in a peer-led supervision as a way to standardize administration of the therapy intervention and maintain treatment adherence among the program participants. Once discharged, CORP participants continued to have contact with a CORP therapist and received case management in the community.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The current study investigated characteristics and reoffense rates of individuals in two programs. The first group of individuals was discharged from the CDOC to the DMHAS between July 1, 1998, and January 31, 2004. These data were compared to a separate group of individuals who participated in the CORP program. The University of Connecticut Health Center Institutional Review Board approved the study (IRB #04-233-2).</p>
<sec id="section4-1078345811421117">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 883 DMHAS individuals and 88 CORP individuals. For the DMHAS group, 89% were male and 11% were female, with ages from 18 to 77 (<italic>M</italic> = 35). The racial breakdown was 42.9% African American, 36.1% White, 20.6% Hispanic, and 0.3% Other. The CORP group consisted of 44% males and 56% females, with ages from 23 to 58 (<italic>M</italic> = 39). Racial groups included 52.3% African Americans, 25.6% Hispanics, 20.9% Whites, and 1.2% Other.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1078345811421117">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Analyses were performed separately on two data sets. Using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), the data sets were then merged by matching on these common variables: gender, age, and homelessness.</p>
<p>Descriptive analyses (frequencies, means, and ranges) were conducted to describe the demographics of the comparison groups, CDOC risk classification scores, the nature of their group participation, rates of group participation, housing status, rates of recidivism, mental illness, and co-occurring substance abuse disorders.</p>
<p>For the analyses, recidivism was defined as rearrest within 6 months following discharge from the facility. A logistic regression model was used with gender, age, homelessness, and presence of a co-occurring substance use disorder entered as the independent variables and rearrest as the dependent/outcome measure.</p>
<p>Information derived from the analysis was used to address the following questions:<list list-type="bullet">

<title>Research Question 1</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1078345811421117">Table 2</xref>, Demographic Characteristics, the two groups are similar in age (DMHAS, average age 35 and CORP, average age 39) and race (African Americans comprised the largest percentages in both groups: DMHAS, 43%, and CORP, 52%). Although the mean ages were similar, <italic>t</italic> tests showed that the groups were significantly different, <italic>t</italic> (969) = 3.778, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Regarding race, the groups were not significantly different when African Americans were compared to non-African Americans (χ<sup>2</sup> = 2.2, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> = .138) and when Hispanics were compared to non-Hispanics (χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.9, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> = .335). The proportion of females in the DMHAS group was expected to be significantly smaller because sampling was from 18 correctional facilities and only 1 facility in Connecticut house females. In the CORP sample, the gender percentages were more closely equivalent (44% males and 56% females). In the DMHAS group, the most frequent offenses were in the burglary/larceny/fraud category, comprising 16.5%. For the CORP group, the most frequent offense was assault (23%). Overall, the DMHAS group had 24% violent offenses and the CORP group had 34% violent offenses.</p>

<p>An interesting finding was the difference in the number of homeless individuals among the two groups: 35.9% of DMHAS clients were homeless as compared to only 8% of the CORP participants. This is noteworthy for the CORP group, given that homelessness is a problem specific to this population and an area of need when considering transitional service planning.</p>
<p>All participants in the CORP program had a mental illness and co-occurring substance abuse disorder as this was one of the eligibility criteria for entering the program. In the DMHAS sample, 66% had a co-occurring substance abuse disorder compared to 34% who had mental illness alone. It is evident that comorbidity of mental illness and substance abuse is prevalent in this population overall and is also consistent with high rates of prisoners with mental illness and co-occurring substance abuse disorders found in previous studies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1078345811421117">
<title>Research Question 2</title>
<p>In the DMHAS sample, 15.6% were rearrested within 3 months of discharge and another 12.6% were arrested in the period from 3 to 6 months postdischarge. To investigate the possibility of having a mental illness and co-occurring substance abuse disorder affecting recidivism, a logistic regression analysis was conducted separately on the DMHAS sample using gender, age, homelessness, and presence of mental illness plus a co-occurring substance use disorder as predictor variables. The analysis revealed that age was significantly associated with rearrest, with younger offenders more likely to be rearrested (β = −.03, Wald = 9.13, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Further regression analysis added reincarceration as an outcome variable. Although having mental illness and a co-occurring substance abuse disorder was not significantly associated with rearrest, it was significantly associated with reincarceration (odds ratio = 1.42, Wald = 3.87, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).</p>
<p>For the CORP sample, 9.1% were rearrested within 3 months of discharge and another 4.5% were rearrested in the 3- to 6-month time frame. Recidivism rates of both groups are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1078345811421117">Figure 1</xref>

<p>Logistic regression analysis performed on the combined data sets showed that age was the only variable significantly associated with rearrest (β = −.02, Wald = 7.14, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Findings from the DMHAS sample suggest that being younger and having mental illness and a co-occurring substance use disorder may be key characteristics in the prediction of rearrest and reincarceration.</p>
<p>Statistical results from the combined groups identified age as the primary factor associated with recidivism. Younger offenders comprise a sizable percentage of the overall prison population and the numbers are growing. The earlier that intervention can occur with these offenders, the better their chances of making a successful and permanent transition into the community.</p>
<p>When the additional variable of having mental illness and a co-occurring substance use disorder was entered into a logistic regression analysis performed on those in the DMHAS group who became reincarcerated, a significant association was revealed. This finding provides support for reentry programs like CORP to focus their designs on treating and providing services specifically for the mentally ill offender with a co-occurring substance use disorder.</p>
<p>Receiving standard treatment planning services alone does not necessarily reduce the likelihood that an individual will reoffend, as nearly one third of the DMHAS sample had come into contact with the criminal justice system again within 6 months. Looking at the same time frame, it appears that the CORP program has been more successful in the goal of reducing recidivism, with a lower percentage of CORP participants becoming rearrested as compared to the DMHAS sample (14.1% vs. 28.3%, respectively). This could be due to several factors. The CORP program used a group therapy method of providing life skills information to inmates as early as 1 year from discharge, enhancing regular face-to-face encounters with facilitators and peers. The curriculum also addressed issues specific to the needs of this population. Examples of program sessions that focus on mental health and substance abuse include “Coping With Schizophrenia,” “Let’s Talk About Medications,” “What Are Your Warning Signs?” and “Road to Recovery, Risky Situations.”</p>
<p>After discharge, facilitators continued to have contact with the participants until a connection was made to a provider, ensuring linkages between the individual and a service. Most of these postdischarge contacts involved personal meetings. The CORP program also addressed housing, and extra efforts were made to avoid placement in a shelter. CORP facilitators identified those at risk of homelessness and placed them on waiting lists early in the program to increase the likelihood of receiving residential services such as placement in group homes. “Housing: Exploring the Options” is a module in the healthy living skills programming. Although transitional reentry services offered through DMHAS are successful in identifying needs for those with mental illness returning to the community and creating linkages to outside agencies, contact often ends after the initial referral is made. This may have an impact on continuity of care upon reentry. A discharge planner assists the inmate in connecting to a provider prior to release from prison, but this process involves fewer meetings than one would receive in a life skills group, and it may not be initiated early enough to account for waiting list time frames.</p>
<p>These findings and differences suggest that formalization of treatment planning services may be necessary to ensure that follow-up and continuity of care occur.</p>
<sec id="section10-1078345811421117">
<title>Study Limitations</title>
<p>Limitations in collecting data for the DMHAS group include the use of retrospective data, restricted means of data collection, and limited access to information. The evaluators relied on data that had been recorded in logbooks and databases. Most information could be verified between two sources. However, procedures such as direct interviewing and review of correctional medical charts may have been helpful to collect more accurate and detailed information. Although data concerning the receipt of services for former offenders were available, details about programs, duration of service, number and quality of provider contacts, and adherence were unavailable. Follow-up activity to ensure services were received or maintained beyond the initial contact was not conducted.</p>
<p>Limitations in collecting data for the CORP group relate to programmatic changes that could be implemented in the further developing stages of the program. Objective measures of learning group skills or levels of psychological functioning were lacking. However, because the CORP program is in the initial phases of development, the results from the evaluation can be used to inform future development and more data can be analyzed to illustrate the ultimate outcome of the program.</p>

<title>Implications for Further Research</title>
<p>This comparison study illustrates that prerelease intervention and postrelease treatment planning services may need to be more specialized or structured to reduce recidivism activity. A follow-up study on these participants or a repeated measures study examining outcomes over time would enhance our understanding of the contributions of these findings to successful reentry for mentally ill offender populations. At the time this study was conducted, follow-up data on rearrest and reincarceration rates were available up to 6 months postdischarge. A longer period of follow-up would yield more information concerning variables associated with recidivism.</p>
<p>From a service perspective, obtaining detailed services data within and outside the facility, in essence to follow the client, would be important in understanding treatment success. This is crucial since it is known that lower recidivism is linked to receiving community case management and that receiving jail-based case management increases the chances of receiving community-based case management upon release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078345811421117">Ventura, Cassel, Jacoby, &amp; Huang, 1998</xref>). Stronger case management services that include more advocacy and persistence in gaining client engagement have been explored in past studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078345811421117">Lamb &amp; Weinberger, 1998</xref>), which support findings from the CORP program evaluation.</p>
<p>There is growing community interest in strengthening mental health services for released offenders to reduce recidivism and adapting policies to better coincide with individualized needs of people with mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078345811421117">Hartwell, 2004</xref>). Implementation and modification of co-occurring disorder treatment programs in the past 10 years have already shown positive outcomes, such as reductions in recidivism activity, substance abuse, and mental health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078345811421117">Peters, LeVassuer, &amp; Chandler, 2004</xref>). Development of more personalized interventions in diverse care settings will be supported by examining community and intervention delivery approaches and how they may affect intervention outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078345811421117">National Institute of Mental Health, 2008</xref>). Coordinated, comprehensive services are needed that emphasize increased collaborative discharge plans with community agencies and the criminal justice system. The CORP program in Connecticut is an example of one such initiative that was created to address these issues, offering a specialized program designed to meet the unique reentry needs of mentally ill offenders with co-occurring substance abuse disorders. Conducting programmatic comparisons once the evidence for CORP has been well demonstrated would enhance the science regarding partnerships between mental health and corrections agencies with the targeted outcome to ease the burden of treating the increasing numbers of the mentally ill in the criminal justice system. This study begins to address the gap in information regarding the factors that contribute to providing quality treatment to the mentally ill offender with a co-occurring substance abuse disorder.</p>
