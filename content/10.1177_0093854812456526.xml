<abstract>
<p>Few studies have examined whether psychopathic-like traits predict recidivism in detained youth. The current study investigated the predictive validity of self-report of psychopathic-like traits for official recidivism. Participants were 223 detained male adolescents from all three Flemish youth detention centers, who were assessed with the Youth Psychopathic Traits Inventory (YPI). Two to four years later, official information on recidivism was collected. Recidivism was defined in four ways. Neither the affective dimension nor the broader construct of psychopathy (i.e., total YPI score) was predictive of recidivism above and beyond criminal history. The behavioral and interpersonal dimensions, however, significantly added to the prediction of substance-related recidivism. Overall, psychopathic-like traits in detained adolescents assessed by means of the YPI did not convincingly predict recidivism. Implications of the findings are discussed.</p>

<body>
<p>Psychopathy is a multidimensional construct defined by affective, interpersonal, and behavioral characteristics, such as lack of empathy, shallow affect, lack of guilt, manipulation, lying, grandiose self-worth, sensation-seeking behavior, impulsivity, and irresponsibility. To better understand the developmental origins of psychopathy, researchers have begun to examine psychopathic-like traits in children and adolescents. Similar to their adult counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0093854812456526">Walters, 2003</xref>), minors high in psychopathic-like traits are among the most severe antisocial individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0093854812456526">Andershed, Kerr, Stattin, &amp; Levander, 2002</xref>), have difficulties processing emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093854812456526">Marsh et al., 2008</xref>), and are prone to externalizing rather than internalizing problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0093854812456526">Salekin, Neumann, Leistico, DiCicco, &amp; Duros, 2004</xref>). In addition, the few available longitudinal studies on the topic suggest that psychopathic-like traits are relatively stable during the transition from childhood to adolescence and from youth to adulthood (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0093854812456526">Andershed, 2010</xref>, for a review).</p>
<p>Yet although research on adult criminals has convincingly demonstrated that psychopathy predicts recidivism (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0093854812456526">Leistico, Salekin, DeCoster, &amp; Rogers, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0093854812456526">Salekin, Rogers, &amp; Sewell, 1996</xref>), the relation between psychopathic-like traits in delinquent minors and recidivism has received little attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0093854812456526">Douglas, Epstein, &amp; Poythress, 2008</xref>) and yielded mixed findings. For example, although some prospective studies in detained juveniles reported that psychopathic-like traits as measured by the Psychopathy Checklist: Youth Version (PCL:YV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093854812456526">Forth, Kosson, &amp; Hare, 2003</xref>) predicted later violent or general recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0093854812456526">Corrado, Vincent, Hart, &amp; Cohen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0093854812456526">Salekin et al., 2008</xref>), other prospective studies failed to observe such relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0093854812456526">Edens &amp; Cahill, 2007</xref>). The few available prospective studies and inconsistent results are surprising given researchers have started to apply the psychopathy construct to minors to identify youth at high risk for violence and chronic offending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0093854812456526">Salekin, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In the current article we examine to what extent psychopathic-like traits in detained male adolescents predict recidivism 2 to 4 years later. Moreover, we specifically address two issues that rarely have been considered simultaneously in previous studies. The first issue relates to the question of whether one should focus on the affective dimension or use the broader psychopathy construct to predict recidivism. The second issue relates to the importance of psychopathic-like traits to predict recidivism relative to other relevant predictors (e.g., criminal history).</p>
<sec id="section1-0093854812456526">
<title>Using One Dimension or All Dimensions?</title>
<p>Although psychopathy is a multidimensional construct, some researchers explicitly focus on the affective dimension (AD) (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093854812456526">Frick, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0093854812456526">Frick &amp; White, 2008</xref>). Their argument is that only the AD differentiates between subgroups of adolescent offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0093854812456526">Caputo, Frick, &amp; Brodsky, 1999</xref>) and children with disruptive behavior disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0093854812456526">Christian, Frick, Hill, Tyler, &amp; Frazer, 1997</xref>), whereas the interpersonal dimension (ID) and behavioral dimension (BD) do not. These researchers therefore consider the AD to be the most important dimension to identify psychopathic-like adolescents <italic>within</italic> the total population of antisocial youth (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093854812456526">Frick, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0093854812456526">Frick &amp; White, 2008</xref>). Consequently, the AD is likely to be the best dimension to predict recidivism.</p>
<p>Yet enthusiasm for an explicit AD focus may be tempered for at least three reasons. First, the argument for focusing on AD is mainly based on two relatively small cross-sectional studies in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0093854812456526">Christian et al., 1997</xref>) and adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0093854812456526">Caputo et al., 1999</xref>) that used the Antisocial Process Screening Device (APSD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093854812456526">Frick &amp; Hare, 2001</xref>). Scores on different measures of the dimensions underlying psychopathy correlate only very modestly with each other (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093854812456526">Cauffman, Kimonis, Dmitrieva, &amp; Monahan, 2009</xref>). Therefore, it may be rash to conclude on the basis of a few studies with only a single measure of psychopathy that the AD dimension is the most important of all psychopathy dimensions. Second, in the four studies that examined the predictive value of the AD in detained youth when controlling for the other psychopathy dimensions, only one study showed that the AD/ID and the BD of the Psychopathy Checklist–Revised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0093854812456526">Hare, 2003</xref>) predicted official recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0093854812456526">Brandt, Kennedy, Patrick, &amp; Curtin, 1997</xref>). In the three other studies, however, the BD and/or the antisocial dimension of the PCL:YV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093854812456526">Cauffman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0093854812456526">Vincent, Odgers, McCormick, &amp; Corrado, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0093854812456526">Vitacco, Neumann, &amp; Caldwell, 2010</xref>) and the ID of the Youth Psychopathic Traits Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093854812456526">Cauffman et al., 2009</xref>) predicted recidivism. Also in adults, the antisocial dimension demonstrated incremental validity above and beyond the other three PCL–R dimensions in predicting recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0093854812456526">Walters, Knight, Grann, &amp; Dahle, 2008</xref>). Third, by focusing on one particular dimension one may lose sight of the original construct, an issue that is addressed in depth below.</p>
<p>Taken together, the empirical evidence for the predictive value of the AD to predict recidivism appears limited. In fact, the absence of the superior prediction for scores on the AD in severe antisocial adolescent and adults relative to the other dimensions argues against a sole focus on features of the AD. Because this focus is likely to influence future research and clinical work with antisocial youth (e.g., current proposal to use the AD as specifier within conduct disorder of the fifth edition of the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0093854812456526">Frick &amp; Moffitt, 2010</xref>), future studies that examine the usefulness of this sole focus on the AD with other psychopathy measures are urgently warranted.</p>
<p>In contrast to the single focus on the AD, some researchers argue that focusing on one particular dimension runs the danger of losing sight of the original construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093854812456526">Hare &amp; Neumann, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0093854812456526">Neumann, Hare, &amp; Newman, 2007</xref>). For instance, in a large study of adolescent offenders, a super-ordinate factor accounted for the majority of the variance in all the psychopathy dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0093854812456526">Neumann, Kosson, Forth, &amp; Hare, 2006</xref>). Also, a psychopathy total score predicts recidivism better than the AD score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093854812456526">Cauffman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0093854812456526">Vincent et al., 2008</xref>). The superordinate factor thus seems to capture something essential that is missed when focusing on one particular dimension. This point of view suggests that a psychopathy total score may be a better predictor of recidivism than any single dimension score. Yet few studies present results from analyses in which a total psychopathy score was used to predict recidivism together with results from analyses in which the predictive value of each psychopathy dimension relative to the others was examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093854812456526">Cauffman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0093854812456526">Vincent et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Incremental Contribution of Psychopathic-Like Traits</title>
<p>Decades of research and clinical work repeatedly demonstrate that factors related to the past best foretell the future. It is not surprising that a meta-analysis on many different risk factors in already delinquent youth demonstrated that criminal history is the strongest predictor of recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093854812456526">Cottle, Lee, &amp; Heilbrun, 2001</xref>). A crucial question, thus, is whether the AD or the total psychopathy score predicts recidivism, especially after controlling for criminal history. An important concern raised by several researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0093854812456526">Asscher et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093854812456526">Murrie, Boccaccini, McCoy, &amp; Cornell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0093854812456526">Seagrave &amp; Grisso, 2002</xref>) relates to the stigma the psychopathy construct is likely to induce. Therefore, it can be argued that psychopathy measures should not be used unless they have some added value beyond other less prejudicial and easy to obtain variables such as past antisocial behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0093854812456526">Edens, Campbell, &amp; Weir, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0093854812456526">Walters et al., 2008</xref>). It is surprising that few studies have evaluated the incremental contribution of psychopathy measures once criminal history is controlled. Again, these studies have yielded mixed findings. For example, although in one study psychopathic-like traits as measured by the APSD had incremental predictive validity over and above a host of other control variables (e.g., criminal history) to predict general recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0093854812456526">Salekin, 2008</xref>), this finding was not replicated in another study using the same instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0093854812456526">Douglas et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0093854812456526">
<title>The Current Study</title>
<p>The current study was designed to examine whether psychopathic-like traits as measured by the Youth Psychopathic Traits Inventory (YPI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0093854812456526">Andershed et al., 2002</xref>) predict recidivism in detained male adolescents. Several authors have described the YPI as a promising self-report instrument to measure psychopathic-like traits in adolescents (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0093854812456526">Kotler &amp; McMahon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0093854812456526">Skeem &amp; Cauffman, 2003</xref>). Yet the predictive utility of the YPI to predict recidivism has been examined in only one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093854812456526">Cauffman et al., 2009</xref>). This interesting article, however, had some features that may restrict a thorough examination of the YPI’s utility to predict recidivism in detained adolescents. First, only about one fifth of the adjudicated participants in the Cauffman et al. study were detained or in jail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0093854812456526">Schubert et al., 2004</xref>), making it difficult to conclude whether the YPI is useful to predict recidivism in “pure” samples of detained adolescents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0093854812456526">1</xref></sup> Second, the YPI data were used to predict short-term official recidivism (i.e., 6 and 12 months later; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093854812456526">Cauffman et al., 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0093854812456526">2</xref></sup> To examine psychopathic-like traits in adolescence and their prospective relation to offending into young adulthood, longer follow-up periods are needed (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0093854812456526">Edens &amp; Cahill, 2007</xref>). Third, in line with most studies on youth psychopathy, both official nonviolent and official violent crimes were collapsed into one general official recidivism outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093854812456526">Cauffman et al., 2009</xref>). Given heightened interest in severe forms of interpersonal crime, it is important to know whether the YPI is predictive of official violent recidivism in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0093854812456526">Edens et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Examining the usefulness of self-report measures to assess psychopathic-like traits and recidivism is important for several reasons. First, in youth detention centers it is difficult to include parents as informants for screening and assessment purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0093854812456526">Colins, Vermeiren, Schuyten, Broekaert, &amp; Soyez, 2008</xref>). Therefore, self-report instruments may be an appropriate alternative to instruments that rely on parents to measure psychopathic-like traits (e.g., the APSD). Second, because some studies recently demonstrated that self-report measures of psychopathic-like traits predicted recidivism (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093854812456526">Cauffman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0093854812456526">Salekin, 2008</xref>), such self-report instruments may be of considerable importance for risk assessment purposes. Third, most studies have used the PCL:YV to predict recidivism. Although the PCL:YV is currently the most reliable and valid measure of assessing psychopathic-like traits among detained adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0093854812456526">Andershed, Hodgins, &amp; Tengstrom, 2007</xref>), it requires extensive training and is time-consuming and costly to use with all detained youth. Brief and easy-to-complete self-report measures therefore may provide an economic advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093854812456526">Lilienfeld &amp; Fowler, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>For the reasons mentioned above, the current study examines whether self-reported psychopathic-like traits in detained male adolescents are predictive of recidivism 2 to 4 years later. The following hypotheses were tested:</p>
<list id="list1-0093854812456526" list-type="order">

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Between January 2005 and February 2007, 305 recently detained minors (younger than 18) from all three youth detention centers (YDCs) for boys in Flanders (i.e., the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium) were randomly selected from the entire population of detained youth. Criteria for inclusion were being of Belgian or Moroccan origin, being detained for at least 1 month, and having sufficient knowledge of Dutch. The first two inclusion criteria were required for two major reasons. First, many youth in the YDC are of non-Belgian origin (e.g., Turkish, Polish, Sudanese). Given time restrictions, it was not possible to include enough youth from various origins that would allow meaningful group comparisons (e.g., Turkish vs. Belgian). Therefore, we decided to focus on the largest “non-Belgian” subgroup in the YDC, namely, youth of Moroccan origin. Second, to recruit the most deviant youth and to allow enough time for approaching and investigating the participant, an expected detention duration of 1 month at minimum was required. Eventually, we were able to interview all participants between 3 days and 3 weeks after their detention intake. In Flanders, youth can be referred to one of these three YDC by a juvenile judge in the preliminary phase (i.e., pretrial detention) or after being sentenced (posttrial incarceration). To the best of our knowledge, all participants in the current study were pending final trial.</p>
<p>Of the 305 boys, 14 could not be approached because of practical circumstances (e.g., daily activities, confinement), 45 boys refused participation, and 1 did not have sufficient knowledge of Dutch, resulting in a participation rate of 80% (<italic>N</italic> = 245). Of the 245 participants, 22 were excluded because of incomplete data collection or because one public prosecutor did not deliver recidivism data, resulting in a final sample of 223 boys.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0093854812456526">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>This study was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of the Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, Ghent University. Because the YDC has been ordered by decree to observe the juveniles assigned to them (e.g., screening for emotional problems), the IRB waived the requirement to get parental consent. Selected detainees were approached individually and given oral and written information about the aims, content, and duration of the interviews. They were assured that their information was confidential and that refusal to participate would not affect their judicial status or stay in the YDC. The boys then could consult their primary caregivers or other adults about participation. Participants were required to give written informed consent before starting the study. Participants were approached and assessed following a standardized protocol. Participants were assessed in a private area in the YDCs by the first author or by one of two final-year university students who did not belong to the YDC staff. Participating youth did not receive compensation.</p>

<title>Psychopathic-like traits</title>
<p>The current study used the YPI to assess psychopathic personality traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0093854812456526">Andershed et al., 2002</xref>). The YPI is a self-report questionnaire that consists of 50 items, organized into 10 subscales of 5 items. Each item is scored on a 4-point Likert-type scale with scores ranging from 1 (<italic>does not apply at all</italic>) to 4 (<italic>applies very well</italic>). The YPI is based on a three-factor model of psychopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0093854812456526">Cooke &amp; Michie, 2001</xref>). Factor 1 of the YPI represents an arrogant and deceitful ID, Factor 2 a callous unemotional or deficient AD, and Factor 3 an impulsive and irresponsible BD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0093854812456526">Andershed et al., 2002</xref>). In the present study alpha coefficients for the YPI three factors (i.e., by using all items in each factor) and the YPI total score (i.e., by using all YPI items) were as follows: α = .88 for the ID, α = .73 for the AD, α = .85 for the BD, and α = .92 for the YPI total score. The three YPI factors were moderately correlated (<italic>r</italic> = .56-.60), with the greatest association between the ID and BD. In line with previous YPI studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0093854812456526">Andershed et al., 2007</xref>), the three factors were created by computing the mean scores for the subscales (by summing up the mean subscale scores in the respective factor and then dividing by the number of subscales in that factor). The total score of the YPI was created by computing the mean scores for all the 10 subscales (by summing up the 10 subscales and then dividing by 10).</p>

<sec id="section9-0093854812456526">
<title>Criminal history and official recidivism</title>
<p>We collected participants’ arrest data from the registration system of the public prosecutor. This registration system provides information about the number and type of arrests before and after their 18th birthday. Criminal history is the age at which participants were first charged for any type of crime (e.g., shoplifting, violence, insults) and the total number of arrests before participation in our study. Violent rearrest refers to murder, manslaughter, sex offenses, assault, and theft with violence. Severe nonviolent rearrest refers to burglary; minor nonviolent rearrest refers to theft, shoplifting, vandalism, fire setting, and other minor offending, such as traffic offenses (e.g., driving without a license), threats (e.g., threaten to hurt someone), and insults (e.g., the speaking of improper and defamatory words tending to seriously insult someone). Substance-related rearrest refers to use, possession, and dealing of drugs (alcohol not included). General rearrest refers to violent, severe nonviolent, minor nonviolent, and/or substance-related rearrests. The mean follow-up period was 1,206.20 days (i.e., 3.3 years; <italic>SD</italic> = 191.42 days; range = 718-1,478 days).</p>

<title>Sociodemographic characteristics</title>
<p>Standardized information about age, origin, and parental or caretaker’s occupation was assessed by means of a questionnaire designed by the authors. Socioeconomic status (SES) was made operational by dichotomizing parental or caretaker’s occupation. Parental SES was placed in the low category (vs. high) if both were unemployed or held a low-level job (unskilled and skilled labor).</p>

<title>Seriousness of recidivism (dependent variable)</title>
<p>Although frequent offenders are generally serious offenders, some frequent offenders are not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0093854812456526">Tolan &amp; Gorman-Smith, 1998</xref>). To allow an accurate definition of “serious offenders,” both frequency and severity of offending should be taken into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0093854812456526">Hoeve et al., 2008</xref>). We therefore created three recidivism groups using the following steps.</p>
<p>In the first step, we assigned different levels of seriousness to each type of crime committed in the follow-up period. In line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0093854812456526">Cohen (1986)</xref>, we considered violent offenses as the most serious offenses, followed by substance-related offenses, burglary, and minor nonviolent offenses. We chose this classification for two reasons. First, the Cohen classification resembles our view that violent offenses in general have a greater impact on the physical integrity of the victim and public safety than other types of offenses. Second, substance-related offending is related to acquisitive crimes (e.g., to maintain substance use; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0093854812456526">Anglin &amp; Perochet, 1998</xref>) as well as violent crimes (e.g., to enforce rules in the illegal drug market; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0093854812456526">White, Loeber, Stouthamer-Loeber, &amp; Farrington, 1999</xref>). As Cohen considered the level of seriousness of substance-related offending in between nonviolent and violent offenses, we preferred this classification over classifications in which substance-related offending for example was considered only to be more serious than a misdemeanor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093854812456526">Mulder, Brand, Bullens, &amp; van Marle, 2010</xref>) or more serious than hitting a teacher (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0093854812456526">Chung, Hill, Hawkins, Gilchrist, &amp; Nagin, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In the second step, we weighted each of the four types of offenses by coding minor nonviolent rearrests as Level 1, burglary as Level 2, substance-related rearrests as Level 3, and violent rearrests as Level 4. Specifically, for each participant the total number of minor nonviolent rearrests was multiplied by 1, the total number of burglaries by 2, the total number of substance-related rearrests by 3, and the total number of violent rearrests by 4.</p>
<p>In the third step, we created a combined continuous measure (i.e., seriousness of recidivism) by summing up participants’ multiplied total number of minor nonviolent rearrests, multiplied total number of burglaries, multiplied total number of substance-related rearrests, and multiplied total number of violent rearrests. This combined continuous measure could not be used in linear regression because assumptions for this kind of analysis were violated.</p>
<p>Therefore, and based on this combined continuous measure, participants were assigned to one of three groups in a final step. Participants who scored below the 25th percentile were assigned to the minor recidivism group. Participants who scored between the 25th and 75th percentile were assigned to the moderate recidivism group. Participants who scored above the 75th percentile were assigned to the serious recidivism group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0093854812456526">
<title>Other recidivism definitions (dependent variable)</title>
<p>To allow a comparison with other studies, we also considered violent recidivism separate from severe nonviolent recidivism (i.e., burglary) and substance-related recidivism in secondary analyses. Because almost all participants (83%) were rearrested for minor nonviolent crimes, we did not focus on this type of nonviolent reoffending.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0093854812456526">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>Differences between seriousness of recidivism subgroups in variables of interest were examined with χ<sup>2</sup> for categorical variables and one-way analyses of variance for continuous variables. Bonferroni correction was used for multiple comparisons.</p>
<p>The association of psychopathic-like traits with seriousness of recidivism (minor vs. moderate vs. serious) was tested by ordinal logistic regression (OLR; link function: logit). The proportional odds assumption underlying OLR was verified by means of the test of parallel lines. We present proportional odds ratio (<italic>OR</italic>) and 95% confidence interval (CI) values when time at risk, age of first arrest, and total past arrests were the only predictors in the model (Model 1) and when all three YPI dimension scores or the YPI total score were included as predictors as well (Model 2). To test whether psychopathic-like traits add to the prediction of recidivism above and beyond age of first arrest and total past arrests, we present the block χ<sup>2</sup> statistic for each block and changes in −2 log likelihood ratio between Model 1 and Model 2.</p>
<p>As violent, serious nonviolent, and substance-related rearrests were nonnormally distributed, each type of recidivism was dichotomized (yes vs. no) and entered as a dependent variable in binary logistic regression analyses (method = enter). The same two sets of predictors as used in the OLR analyses were included in these analyses. All tests were two-tailed, with .05 as the standard for statistical significance. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0.</p>

<p>In addition to the information presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0093854812456526">Table 1</xref>, our total sample showed very high rates of recidivism, with 92.4% (<italic>n</italic> = 206) having at least one new arrest during the follow-up period. Specifically, 83.0% (<italic>n</italic> = 185) were minor nonviolent recidivists, 41.3% (<italic>n</italic> = 92) were serious nonviolent recidivists (e.g., burglars), 41.3% (<italic>n</italic> = 92) were substance-related recidivists, and 66.4% (<italic>n</italic> = 148) were violent recidivists.

<p>Taking both frequency and severity of rearrests into account, three recidivism groups with different levels of seriousness were created: a minor recidivism group (<italic>n</italic> = 43), a moderate recidivism group (<italic>n</italic> = 123), and a serious recidivism group (<italic>n</italic> = 57). The serious recidivism group was less often from Belgian origin, was arrested for the first time at a younger age, and had a higher number of rearrests for all types of crime compared to minor and moderate recidivism groups. In addition, youth in the serious recidivism group committed more crimes in the past than those categorized in the minor recidivism group (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0093854812456526">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>This article examined whether self-reported psychopathic-like traits predicted recidivism in detained youth. The AD of the YPI and the YPI total score did not add to the prediction of recidivism beyond criminal history. The ID and BD of the YPI, however, were related with substance-related recidivism. In general, the present study suggested that self-reported psychopathic-like traits as measured by the YPI are not useful for predicting other than substance-related recidivism, among detained male adolescents.</p>
<p>The current study does not support the suggestion that the AD is the most predictive dimension of recidivism for antisocial youth. This finding converges with those of recent studies on serious delinquent adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093854812456526">Cauffman et al., 2009</xref>) as well as with adult psychiatric patients, offenders, and inmates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0093854812456526">Walters et al., 2008</xref>). Of course, given that psychopathy involves a deficit in recognizing emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093854812456526">Marsh et al., 2008</xref>), it can be argued that juveniles are unaware of or unable to report these traits themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0093854812456526">Rutter, 2005</xref>). It is interesting that APSD parent and/or teacher ratings have been found to predict criminal behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0093854812456526">Dadds, Fraser, Frost, &amp; Hawes, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0093854812456526">Frick, Stickle, Dandreaux, Farrell, &amp; Kimonis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093854812456526">McMahon, Witkiewitz, &amp; Kotler, 2010</xref>). Future studies are needed to test whether the AD as rated by parents and/or teachers is more strongly related to recidivism than other dimensions. If so, then parent and teacher ratings of the AD in detained male adolescents may be preferred to self-report when trying to predict recidivism. Finally, the total YPI score was also not predictive of serious recidivism group membership. In line with previous research in seriously delinquent adolescents using expert-rater based measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093854812456526">Cauffman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0093854812456526">Vincent et al., 2008</xref>), we also could not support the assumption that the broader construct of self-reported psychopathy is a better predictor of serious recidivism than the AD.</p>
<p>The current study showed that the assessment of psychopathic-like traits in detained male adolescents by means of the YPI does not predict official violent recidivism. This finding converges with two recent studies in juvenile justice youth that showed that two other well-known self-report measures of psychopathic-like traits (i.e., APSD and Childhood Psychopathy Scale; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0093854812456526">Lynam, 1997</xref>) were not related to violent recidivism after controlling for relevant variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0093854812456526">Douglas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0093854812456526">Salekin, 2008</xref>). Yet our finding is not in line with those regarding three less frequently used self-report measures (i.e., NEO Psychopathy Resemblance Index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0093854812456526">Lynam &amp; Widiger, 2007</xref>]; Self-Report Psychopathy Scale–II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0093854812456526">Hare, 1991</xref>]; Personality Assessment Inventory–Antisocial Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093854812456526">Morey, 1991</xref>]) of psychopathic-like traits being predictive of violent recidivism when relevant control variables were included in the analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093854812456526">Cauffman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0093854812456526">Salekin, 2008</xref>). As many youth are identified as psychopathic on one measure but not on another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093854812456526">Cauffman et al., 2009</xref>), it is possible that finding a relation between psychopathic-like traits and violent recidivism may depend on the instrument used. Given the scarcity of research, this issue needs further study as the construct of psychopathy is increasingly being used in clinical practice and for legal decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0093854812456526">Edens et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, it is also possible that an instrument has predictive utility in one specific setting but not in another. For example, although the YPI total score has been related with official recidivism in a sample of adjudicated youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093854812456526">Cauffman et al., 2009</xref>), the current study showed that this may not be the case in detained youth.</p>
<p>If neither the YPI total score nor any of the three YPI dimensions provide additional predictive utility above past behavior, then there is no reason to use the YPI to assess future risk in detained male adolescents. However, in the present study the ID and BD of the YPI significantly added to the prediction of substance-related recidivism above and beyond criminal history. The ID was negatively related to this type of recidivism, a surprising finding given that this YPI dimension has previously been found to be related to substance-related offending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0093854812456526">Poythress, Dembo, Wareham, &amp; Greenbaum, 2006</xref>). In addition, substance-related recidivism was predicted by the BD of the YPI. This latter finding converges with previous studies demonstrating a relation between impulsive and irresponsible behavior (as assessed by the BD subscale of the YPI) and drug-related offending (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0093854812456526">Coid et al., 2007</xref>). However, neither the AD (often considered as the core feature of the construct) nor the broader construct (i.e., YPI total score) was positively related with future substance-related arrests. Therefore, it can be questioned whether the psychopathy construct itself is predictive of substance-related recidivism or whether alternative explanations are more likely. For example, because substance use disorders (SUD) are associated with impulsive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0093854812456526">Verdejo-Garcia, Lawrence, &amp; Clark, 2008</xref>) and substance-related recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0093854812456526">Colins et al., 2011</xref>), the BD may no longer be related to substance-related rearrests after controlling for a history of SUD. Unfortunately, our sample size did not allow us to include other variables that may moderate the relation between psychopathy and recidivism (e.g., SUD). This study limitation warrants future studies with larger sample sizes to address the importance of relevant covariates in predicting recidivism.</p>
<p>The present research has several strengths that should be noted. First, it made use of a prospective design with a substantial time span during which most participants reached young adulthood. Second, it examined the incremental predictive utility of psychopathy by including relevant control variables. Third, the current study used an alternative approach to define recidivism by taking both frequency and severity of offending into account. This allowed us to test whether self-reported psychopathic-like traits were positively associated with serious recidivism group membership. This latter association was expected given that psychopathic-like youth are considered to be among the most serious and versatile offenders.</p>
<p>Some further limitations should also be considered when interpreting the results. First, we defined criminal history and recidivism using official arrest data and thus may have underestimated the degree to which youth actually offend. Given the evidence that the predictive usefulness of psychopathy may depend on the source of recidivism information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093854812456526">Cauffman et al., 2009</xref>), more studies are needed with different methods to assess criminal behavior (e.g., arrest, conviction, self-report). Second, because we collected YPI data only at the initial assessment, we do not know whether recidivists have a high YPI score at the end of the follow-up period. Thus, future research should simultaneously assess psychopathy and offending to delineate the developmental trajectory of psychopathic personality traits and antisocial conduct across a larger time span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0093854812456526">Salekin, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, in the current study psychopathic-like traits in detained adolescents assessed by means of the YPI did not convincingly predict recidivism. The current findings do not support the construct of psychopathy being increasingly used for legal decision making. Future research, therefore, is warranted to test whether our findings can be replicated with other measures of psychopathic-like traits than the YPI and with other informants than detained youth themselves (e.g., parents).</p>

<p>A closer inspection of both samples also suggested that the current sample is more severely antisocial regarding criminal history and recidivism than the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093854812456526">Cauffman, Kimonis, Dmitrieva, and Monahan (2009)</xref> sample. That is, 44.5% of the participants in the Cauffman et al. study were adjudicated for violent crimes against persons (e.g., murder, rape) and 26.9% for property crimes (e.g., arson, burglary). In addition, these participants on average have committed 2.3 offenses prior to study enrollment and 1.8 during the 3-year study. In the current study 74% participants had an official history of violent offenses and 56% of serious property offenses (i.e., burglary and/or arson) before being included in the study. The averages of total past offenses participants had committed prior to our study and during our 2- to 4-year follow-up were 12.64 and 9.80, respectively (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0093854812456526">Table 1</xref>).</p></fn>
