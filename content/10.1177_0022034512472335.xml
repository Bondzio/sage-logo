<abstract>
<p>Locally applied bisphosphonates may improve the fixation of metal implants in bone. However, systemic bisphosphonate treatment is associated with a risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). We hypothesized that local delivery of bisphosphonate from the implant surface improves the fixation of dental implants without complications in a setting where systemic treatment induces ONJ. Forty rats were randomly allocated to 4 groups of 10. All groups received a titanium implant inserted in an extraction socket. Group I received the implants only. Group II received dexamethasone (0.5 mg/kg). Group III received dexamethasone as above plus alendronate (200 µg/kg). Group IV received zoledronate-coated implants and dexamethasone as above. The animals were sacrificed 2 weeks after tooth extraction. All 10 animals with systemic alendronate treatment developed large ONJ-like changes, while all with local treatment were completely healed. Implant removal torque was higher for the bisphosphonate-coated implants compared with the other groups (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.03 for each comparison). Micro-computed tomography of the maxilla showed more bone loss in the systemic alendronate group compared with groups receiving local treatment (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001). Local bisphosphonate treatment appears to improve implant fixation in a setting where systemic treatment caused ONJ.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Bisphosphonate coatings improve the fixation of metal implants in bone. This has been shown in animal experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034512472335">Tengvall <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022034512472335">Wermelin <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022034512472335">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034512472335">McKenzie <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), as well as in osteoporotic bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034512472335">Stadelmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034512472335">Roshan-Ghias <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Recently, it was shown that a bisphosphonate coating improved the fixation of dental implants in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034512472335">Abtahi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034512472335">2012a</xref>). In a randomized double-blind study, fibrinogen-coated dental implants with immobilized pamidronate and ibandronate were inserted into human maxillae. Implant stability measured with resonance frequency (ISQ) and radiographic appearances were improved compared with those of controls, and no complications were registered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034512472335">Abtahi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012a</xref>).</p>
<p>Once released from the surface of a coated implant, bisphosphonate reduces osteoclast activity, thereby changing the balance of bone turnover in favor of bone formation, leading to a net gain in local bone density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022034512472335">Wermelin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). The improved early fixation might reduce the rate of late failures and could also facilitate a shorter time to full loading. However, the association between systemic bisphosphonate treatment and ONJ has raised the concern that local treatment <italic>via</italic> the implant surface might also lead to ONJ.</p>
<p>There is evidence for a link between the use of systemic bisphosphonates (especially those given intravenously) and osteonecrosis of the jaw in cancer patients, whereas oral surgical procedures exposing bone to the oral cavity increase the risk of ONJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034512472335">Marx <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034512472335">Mavrokokki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034512472335">Barasch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034512472335">Fellows <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). It appears that this condition would be more appropriately described as osteomyelitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034512472335">Aspenberg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512472335">Dodson <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Recently, an animal experiment showed that primary osteocyte death is not necessary for the development of jaw osteonecrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512472335">Abtahi <italic>et al</italic>., 2012b</xref>). Possibly, a reduced capacity to resorb bone impedes the removal or separation of bacterially contaminated bone from adjacent sterile bone.</p>
<p>The published clinical study of bisphosphonate-coated dental implants used pamidronate and ibandronate in rather small amounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034512472335">Abtahi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012a</xref>). To study the possible risk of eliciting ONJ, we now studied a coating with a more potent bisphosphonate (zoledronate). Implants with this coating were implanted into a rat model, where systemic bisphosphonate treatment leads to ONJ-like lesions in all cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512472335">Abtahi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012b</xref>). We hypothesized that the bisphosphonate-coated screws would improve the fixation of implants exposed to the oral cavity, even under circumstances where systemic treatment is known to lead to ONJ.</p>

<title>Materials &amp; Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0022034512472335">
<title>Animals and Study Design</title>
<p>Male Sprague-Dawley rats, 10 wks of age, were used. All rats underwent extraction of the left maxillary first molar, and a titanium screw was implanted into one of the extraction sockets. The rats were randomly allocated by lottery to 4 groups of 10 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/randomize1.cfm">http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/randomize1.cfm</ext-link>). Three of the groups received uncoated screws. Group I (Control) received no drug treatment. Group II (Dexamethasone) received dexamethasone (0.5 mg/kg; subcutaneously once daily for 4 consecutive days starting 2 days prior to surgery). Group III (Systemic) received dexamethasone as above plus alendronate (200 µg/kg; subcutaneously once daily for 14 days). Group IV (Local) received a zoledronate-coated screw and dexomethasone as above. The animals were sacrificed by carbon dioxide 2 wks after tooth extraction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0022034512472335">
<title>Experimental Parameters</title>
<p>The main hypothesis was that the coated implants would be better fixed than controls under circumstances where systemic bisphosphonates lead to ONJ-like lesions. Therefore, we measured removal torque as the primary variable. As a secondary end-point, we noted the presence of any ONJ-like lesions. Finally, we estimated the amount of remaining bone at the entire extraction site, as well as in the immediate vicinity of the implant, by micro-CT.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0022034512472335">
<title>Coating Procedure</title>
<p>The screws were coated with fibrinogen matrix into which zoledronic acid was embedded. The screws were prepared as follows: After being cleaned, the screws were incubated in a fibrinogen solution (2 mg/mL) in acetate buffer for about 10 min. The screws were rinsed in MilliQ water and then incubated in a zoledronic acid solution for about 20 min. By use of isotope-labeled bisphosphonate in a parallel series, the bisphosphonate amount <italic>per</italic> screw was found to be approximately 400 ng. We used human plasminogen-depleted fibrinogen (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA, 341578-500MG) and synthetic zoledronic acid (Enzo LifeSciences, Farmingdale, NY, USA; ALX-430-153-G001).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0022034512472335">
<title>Surgery</title>
<p>The rats were anesthetized with isoflurane, and buprenorphine (Temgesic 0.05 mg/kg, Reckitt Benckiser (RB) Pharmaceuticals, Berkshire, England) was administered pre-operatively. Buprenorphine was also given every 12 hrs for 2 days after surgery. The left maxillary first molar was removed by a luxation technique. A triangular portion of the gingiva (2 x 2 mm), with its base at the anterior margin of the extraction defect, was removed to increase the likelihood of ONJ-like changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512472335">Abtahi <italic>et al</italic>., 2012b</xref>). A titanium self-drilling screw (1.5-mm diameter and 3-mm length titanium self-drilling screw, Synthes, Matrix, West Chester, PA, USA; length of threaded portion, 2 mm) was then inserted into the socket of the mesiopalatal root of the left maxillary molar. The head of the screw was positioned just above the margin of the palatal gingiva.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0022034512472335">
<title>Macroscopic Inspection</title>
<p>After the animals’ death, the insertion site was inspected and photographed by an examiner blinded for treatment allocation. Each animal was classified as having an ulcer or not.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0022034512472335">
<title>Removal Torque Measurements</title>
<p>The maxilla was harvested <italic>en bloc</italic>, and the titanium screws were tested for removal torque in a computerized materials testing machine (100R, Admet, Norwood, MA, USA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022034512472335">Skoglund <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Samples were held firmly by hand, and the machine turned the screw at a speed of 0.4 degrees/sec. Sampling was stopped when the screw had turned 90 degrees.The load-deformation curve always showed a peak at the beginning, before the screw loosened. The height of this peak (maximum removal torque) was noted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0022034512472335">
<title>Micro-CT Measurements of Entire Extraction Site</title>
<p>Formaldehyde-fixed maxillae (both sides) were obtained for micro-CT scanning. The imaging parameters were set at 50 kV source voltage, with a 1-mm aluminum filter by micro-CT Scanner 1174 (SkyScan, Antwerpen, Belgium). The nominal resolution and rotation step were 15 µm, 0.1° over 180°, respectively. Frame averaging over 5 images was used. Samples were scanned in 70% ethanol. The dataset was reconstructed with NRecon software (SkyScan, Antwerpen, Belgium). Beam hardening, ring reduction, and Gaussian smoothing were applied. The micro-CT analysis was done with dedicated CTAN software (SkyScan, Antwerpen, Belgium).</p>
<p>The investigator first tried to designate 10 of the available 38 specimens as having “more” resorption and the others as having “less”. This classification was based on an arbitrary judgment of the degree of radiolucency between the root sockets. While doing this, we noted that the coronal portion of the alveolar septa had been fractured in some samples due to extraction trauma. Therefore, we selected the apical 2/3 of the sockets for quantitative analysis. A coronal plane through the maxilla was defined in Data viewer software (SkyScan, Antwerpen, Belgium) by symmetry of all dental roots. This plane was then moved up or down to make a coronal section through the roots, 2/3 of their length from the apex. On this section, a standard ellipse (1.86 x 3.2 mm) was placed so that most of the root sockets were covered. Finally a parallel coronal section was chosen through the apex of the roots. The ellipse and the sections together delineated the volume of interest. The total bone volume within this volume of interest was calculated by the µCT-computer program and expressed as a percentage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512472335">Figs. 1A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512472335">1C</xref>).</p>

<title>Micro-CT Measurements in the Immediate Vicinity of the Implant</title>
<p>A coronal plane through the maxilla was defined as above. This plane was then moved up or down to identify the most coronal part of the threaded titanium screw. On this section, a standard cylinder (1.53-mm diameter and 2-mm length) was then placed, parallel to the long axis of the mesiopalatal socket so that the threaded parts of the screws (2 mm) were covered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512472335">Fig. 1D</xref>). The total bone volume within this cylinder was calculated by the µCT-computer program and expressed as a percentage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0022034512472335">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The main hypothesis was that the coated implants (with dexamethasone treatment) would yield a higher removal torque than the dexamethasone-treated group. Following a significant Kruskal-Wallis test, these 2 groups were compared by the Mann-Whitney test. Thereafter, the coated group was similarly compared with the other groups. This sequential analysis avoids the problem of mass significance. The secondary variables were analyzed similarly. For the remaining bone volume at the extraction site, the hypothesis was that systemic treatment would be different from the other groups, and for the bone density at the implant, the hypothesis was that the coating would increase density.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section12-0022034512472335" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The animals tolerated anesthesia and tooth extraction well. At the end of the dexamethasone treatment, the rats had lost weight, but none lost more than 14% of its body weight. After discontinuation of dexamethasone therapy, body weight increased, except for 3 rats (with maximum 13% total loss). Two implants in the Control group failed to osseointegrate and were excluded from the analysis (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022034512472335">Table</xref> for summary of results).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We found that the bisphosphonate coating improved the mechanical fixation of the screws in an environment associated with a high risk of ONJ. This was in contrast to the consistent development of ONJ-like changes after systemic bisphosphonate treatment, with an impaired fixation.</p>
<p>Rat models of ONJ have been developed by the administration of a combination of bisphosphonate and dexamethasone. Dexamethasone appears necessary for the model to work and could be seen as a way to mimic the impairment of the immune system contributing to the risk of ONJ in humans. Most models use systemic zoledronate, whereas we used alendronate, because our previous experience with 200 µg/kg of alendronate had shown a strong inhibition of osteoclastic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034512472335">Hilding and Aspenberg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512472335">Aspenberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). It is a weakness of this study that different drugs were used for systemic <italic>vs</italic>. local treatment. We chose to do this for practical reasons related to our previous experience, since there should be no important difference between their biological effects. Moreover, because zoledronate is a more potent bisphosphonate than alendronate, we have created a “worst case scenario” for the local treatment group. Another weakness is that we limited the study to a follow-up of 2 wks only. This was partly for reasons of animal ethics, and partly because new lesions, appearing after the gingiva has healed, are unlikely. In a previous similar study, no ONJ-like lesion appeared when the gingiva was intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512472335">Abtahi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012b</xref>). This study showed typical histological signs of osteonecrosis in the ONJ-like lesions.</p>
<p>We found more bone loss in animals with systemic drug treatment (at the level of the apical portion of the mesiopalatal socket) than animals receiving coated screws. This level was chosen to avoid the coronal portion, where tooth extraction trauma alone might cause resorption. Moreover, previous histology in rats showed that osteonecrosis extends from the marginal level to the apical portion of the root (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512472335">Senel <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022034512472335">Yamashita <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512472335">Abtahi <italic>et al</italic>., 2012b</xref>).</p>
<p>Paradoxically, the group that had received a high dose of systemic bisphosphonate was the one that showed most bone loss on micro-CT. We have previously noted in untreated rats that tooth extraction leads to rapid local bone resorption and delineation of sequestra that are extruded through the healing gingiva (unpublished observations). This suggests that rapid resorption and elimination of bacterially contaminated bone is important for the lesion to heal and become covered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034512472335">Aspenberg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512472335">Dodson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Bisphosphonate can improve implant fixation in animals and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034512472335">Tengvall <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512472335">Kajiwara <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022034512472335">Wermelin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022034512472335">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034512472335">Stadelmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034512472335">Abtahi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034512472335">2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034512472335">McKenzie <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034512472335">Roshan-Ghias <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). There are 2 reasons to apply this principle by local treatment. First, the local concentrations can be higher (at least initially). Second, adverse effects such as ONJ or atypical femur fractures might be avoided. However, although bisphosphonate-coated dental implants have already been tested successfully in a randomized human trial, it has been suggested that they would confer risks of ONJ, at least in the vicinity of the implant. Our results suggest that this risk is small, the locally treated implants had the best fixation, and the systemically treated the poorest. It has been demonstrated that zoledronate eluted from an implant remains in its vicinity with minimal systemic distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034512472335">McKenzie <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Therefore, if deleterious changes would occur in humans, it would be easy to remove the implant and the bone in its vicinity, and thereby the bisphosphonate.</p>
<p>Previous studies of screws in rat tibia with a similar coating have shown both increased removal torque and increased pull-out force. The increased removal torque was related to a larger area of the implant surface being in contact with bone. No increase in bonding between implant and bone was shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034512472335">Tengvall <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022034512472335">Wermelin <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022034512472335">2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In the present study, the screws were coated with a fibrinogen matrix with zoledronate. The implants were estimated to carry about the same total amount of bisphosphonate <italic>per</italic> surface area. Zoledronate is about 1000 times more potent than pamidronate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034512472335">Green, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034512472335">2002</xref>). This suggests that even a very high local bisphosphonate activity can be tolerated in the bone adjacent to dental implants, since no signs of osteonecrosis were observed with zoledronate-coated screws.</p>
<p>Moreover, local treatment of periodontitis with a gel containing a very high concentration of alendronate was successful in regenerating a large part of the lost bone, whereas placebo had little effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034512472335">Pradeep <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034512472335">Sharma and Pradeep, 2012a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034512472335">b</xref>). None of the patients developed ONJ. This, again, underscores the low risk associated with local bisphosphonate treatment in humans.</p>
<p>In conclusion, in our rat model, local bisphosphonate treatment was less prone to cause ONJ than was systemic treatment. The improved fixation of bisphosphonate-coated dental implants in humans might be achieved with a smaller risk of such complications in comparison with systemic treatment.</p>
