<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study, which is part of a wider study of professional ethics, was to describe nurses’ perceptions of their rights in Italy. The data were collected by open-ended focus group interviews and analyzed with inductive content analysis. Based on the analysis, three main themes were identified. The first theme “Unfamiliarity with rights” described nurses’ perception that their rights mirrored historical roots, educational content, and nurses’ and patients’ position in the society. The second theme, “Rights reflected in legislation” highlighted that working and professional Italian legislation played a strong role. The third theme, “Managerial barriers for nurses’ rights” underlined the nurses’ perceptions that nursing management had the responsibility to create the conditions where nurses’ rights could flourish. This study intends to contribute to the debate on this underexplored topic.</p>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733012466001">4</xref>
</sup> Nurses’ rights as a concept can be divided into three separate but closely intertwined types: human rights, professional rights, and employment rights. Human rights are ethical by nature and a basis for nurses’ rights.<sup>

</sup> Proponents of international human rights argue that nurses have the right to be treated with respect in their professional relationships in whatever settings they practice their work. Nurses also have the right to advocate for themselves without having to fear negative consequences and the right to be respected by other health professionals.<sup>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Nurses’ professional rights are both ethical and legal by nature: they are not only based on nurses’ international and national codes of ethics but are also commonly documented in national employment legislation. The content of nurses’ professional rights refers to the right to practice their profession, be respected by other health professionals and the society; promote their professional societal status;<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733012466001">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733012466001">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733012466001">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733012466001">14</xref>
</sup> and practice in a safe, healthy, and ethical environment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733012466001">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733012466001">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733012466001">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733012466001">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733012466001">15</xref>
</sup> They also have the right to advocate for patients’ interests. As a part of their professional rights, nurses also have the so-called earned rights that are both ethical and legal by nature but do not apply to all nurses. Earned rights are accumulated, based on education and work experience,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733012466001">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733012466001">14</xref>
</sup> such as the right to administer some particular treatments (e.g., intravenous cannulation or drug prescription).</p>
<p>Nurses’ employment rights are legal by nature. They not only rest on national constitutions and health-care legislation but also on national work contracts, which vary from country to country.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733012466001">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969733012466001">16</xref>

</sup> National legislation regulates nurses’ rights to practice and the scope of professional autonomy, including the right to work in a safe environment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733012466001">2</xref>
</sup> This contextual nature of employment rights is reflected in our research conducted in the Italian setting. In Italy, there has been a rapid national evolution based on legislative changes for the nursing profession in recent years.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969733012466001">20</xref>
</sup> The year 1999 was a milestone for nursing and all the healthcare professions with the declaration of a new Law, n. 42 (<italic>Disposition concerning health professions</italic>), sanctioning the autonomy of each profession. This law was anticipated by the <italic>Profilo Professionale</italic> (1994), a Decree of the Ministry of Health that stated clearly, for the first time, that only registered nurses could be responsible for the provision of general nursing care and that these health workers had to have an academic degree and pay a subscription fee to their professional register.</p>
<p>Despite defined ethical and legislative bases, tension in terms of nurses’ rights is evident in the contextual nature of nursing practice. International and national frameworks, especially cultural<sup>

</sup> and individual differences, such as age,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0969733012466001">24</xref>
</sup> gender and sexual orientation,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0969733012466001">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969733012466001">26</xref>
</sup> create large variations in the implementation of nurses’ rights, although they should already have been guaranteed by human rights. In addition, nurses’ increased mobility highlights the differences in rights in work settings,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969733012466001">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0969733012466001">28</xref>
</sup> and nurses’ and patients’ different roles<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<p>Although much has been written about the important role of professional ethics, few studies have considered nurses’ rights; above all, there is no empirical research.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733012466001">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0969733012466001">38</xref>
</sup> Previous studies have focused on important issues such as industrial action by nurses,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969733012466001">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733012466001">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0969733012466001">34</xref>
</sup> nurses’ human rights,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733012466001">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0969733012466001">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0969733012466001">39</xref>
</sup> and nurses’ rights as part of professional ethics.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733012466001">1</xref>
</sup> However, professional ethics is constantly changing<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0969733012466001">40</xref>
</sup> because it depends on every social and cultural context in which nursing is practiced.<sup>

</sup> Continuous reflection is therefore needed on its contextual nature,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0969733012466001">40</xref>
</sup> but supporting professional autonomy requires a focus on the rights of the profession.<sup>

<title>Ethical considerations</title>
<p>Ethical approval was obtained from the participating institutions and the participants studying in postqualifying courses in each of the universities where the data were collected. The purpose of the study was explained to the participants before the focus group interviews. Upon arrival at the first meeting, nurses signed an informed consent form. Interviews were coded by random numbering of focus groups to ensure confidentiality. To improve trustworthiness, the selected group of participants, the data collection, and the analysis process were described clearly.

Two authors (M.K. and A.S.) conducted the data analysis, allowing various categories to emerge from the codes and themes. The researchers met regularly to discuss emerging findings and reach consensus on data analysis. Preliminary results were then discussed among researchers, clarified, and reconceptualized into broader themes, describing the characteristics of nurses’ perceptions of their rights in Italian nursing practice setting.<sup>

<title>Unfamiliarity with rights</title>
<sec id="section9-0969733012466001">
<title>A history without rights</title>
<p>The participants described that throughout history, nurses lacked their own rights, similar to other health professionals, but nurses suffered more because of their proximity to physicians and medical supremacy. Their duties were emphasized in part as a consequence of a traditional vocational religious role that nursing had in the past. They stated that this history of subordination to physicians still influences their work nowadays: nurses have fewer rights than duties when compared with other health professionals. They pointed out that in Italy, nursing had been performed by nuns with a strong vocational and serving attitude, and the prevailing mentality was to overrate the role of the medical profession to the detriment of the nurses. Given this setting, participants found that duties were prioritized in nursing practice and also in nursing codes of ethics. Most nurses saw themselves as carrying out the doctors’ orders even in the current era of professional autonomy because social factors still have not changed:
<disp-quote>
<p>There are some colleagues who, when faced with a problem, say, “I’m going to call the doctor,” then what are we talking about? Unquestionably then the patient also says, “I want to speak to a physician.” (FG 1)</p>
<p>We are to blame for not insisting on our rights ... We keep on working as if physicians rule and everyone else has to obey their orders. (FG 4)</p>
<p>Compared to the past, when nuns worked as part of their mission and religious order ... it was subordinated to duties, with no mention about rights. (FG 5)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0969733012466001">
<title>Inadequate education on rights</title>
<p>Nurses found it difficult to define the relationship between rights and duties because they understood some matters to be a right and a duty at the same time. This was confusing: for example, they stated that they had the duty to maintain professional competence, and at same time, they had the professional right to study and improve their competence. The participants reported that nurses’ rights had been unfamiliar to many of them and were not mentioned at all nor taught in basic nursing education. Nurses who held the old nursing diploma were not acquainted with rights, neither during basic nor postbasic education. All participants agreed that during nursing education, when rights were mentioned during lectures, they were not emphasized as part of an autonomous profession:
<disp-quote>
<p>I never thought of nurses’ rights, and I don’t think anyone ever explained the concept to us. (FG 5)</p>
<p>I think they are not taught because it’s like saying I’m giving you a weapon, and it’s not right [for the nurse]. (FG 1)</p>
<p>I have learned rights through my work contract. (FG 4)</p>
<p>We [nurses] do not have a clear idea [on nurses' rights] ... we should have specific education about them. (FG 5)</p>

<title>The right to be treated as persons</title>
<p>However, the participants highlighted that before claiming professional rights, professional nurses have to be aware of their human rights and have these acknowledged. This meant that nurses have the right to be treated with dignity and respect by patients and other health professionals. Consequently, they understood that they have the right to be individual persons, the right to be respected with their individual differences in terms of culture, religion, and gender, and these features had to be taken into account in nursing practice as well:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think everybody has rights, first as human beings each working in a certain way, and then as nurses. (FG 1)</p>

<title>Confusing nursing national evolution</title>
<p>Nurses found that in Italy, their rights were unclear due to the rapid national evolution of the nursing profession. Their role and competences had given rise to confusion regarding their rights in recent years. The participants experienced disarray regarding practical rights between nurses and physicians; they often wondered what kind of rights they did have, and what kind of practical and legislative boundaries there were between professions. Nurses also found that their rights had been marginalized due to the impact of the importance of patients’ rights. Today patients are familiar with their rights, in the sense that patients’ rights overrule those of nurses. However, according to the participants, the concept of patient rights is also controversial because of the notions of possible duties that patients have:
<disp-quote>
<p>While being part of a profession that is evolving and with all the new legislation, probably we are not conscious of our rights ... we are not fully aware. (FG 1)</p>
<p>Yes, this [Italian] nursing evolution has taken account of nurses’ role in a new way. We are not aware of our rights. (FG 4)</p>
<p>I think [the priority] are the rights of the patients. They overshadow everything else. (FG 5)</p>
<p>I think about patients’ rights, that is, I don’t think about nurses’ rights. (FG 5)</p>
<p>They [the patients] have to respect me. (FG 1)</p>
<p>The priority in nursing education is orientated to fulfil patients’ needs. We are culturally organized in this way and we fail to foster our rights for this reason. (FG 5)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0969733012466001">
<title>Legislation-based rights</title>
<p>Nurses described these rights as the right to regulate work (the right to have fixed working hours and the right to regular breaks), appropriate income for their work (sufficient salary, paid overtime, and annual leave), environmental working conditions (staff room, air temperature, and lighting), social benefits (paid sick leave), and access to professional development (right to study). Based on current legislation, nurses felt that they were in an intellectual profession with autonomy. This guarantees their rights, such as the right to autonomous evidence-based decision making in their field of competence, the right to lifelong learning, and the right to have their say in the formulation of the strategic aims of the organizations for which they work. However, the participants had experienced lack or insufficient information of shared protocols and nursing documentation, and being unaware of rights and duties, thus jeopardizing their professional autonomy and personal attitudes:
<disp-quote>
<p>We have [rights-based] laws and norms. (FG 1)</p>
<p>We do have [a right to] lifelong learning. (FG 4)</p>
<p>We have a right to autonomy, but it has not been recognized [in our health care organization]. (FG 2)</p>
<p>We should value ourselves, there are norms and they have to be put into practice. (FG 1)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0969733012466001">
<title>Limitations of legislation-based rights</title>
<p>However, these nurses stressed that the application of legislation-based rights is limited; for example, individual clauses, such as employees’ right to study leave (150 h/year), could not be granted to all employees entitled to it due to understaffing of the wards. Based on current legislation, nurses in public and private sectors had different rights, and often in the private sector, nurses have the chance to negotiate their rights with employers on an informal and an individual basis. Nurses argued that because of favoritism, the number and quality of rights often depended on personal contacts with individuals who held a strategic role within healthcare organizations or trade unions in either the private or the public sector:
<disp-quote>
<p>You do not have rights, because you are obliged to eat a quick sandwich so as not to create problems [during the lunch break when working two consecutive shifts]. (FG 4)</p>
<p>In the public sector you have more rights compared to the private sector. (FG 3)</p>
<p>I don’t know what is the role of IPASVI [Federazione Nazionale Collegi Infermieri; the Italian Nursing Regulatory Board] in promoting our rights in the work setting. (FG 3)</p>
<p>I was satisfied because they [unions] have always fought [for our rights]. (FG 1)</p>
<p>If you are not a member of the union, you will not be protected by the union. (FG 5)</p>
<p>I have colleagues who are mothers. I have seen them face difficulties [with their rights], simply because they have children. (FG 4)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Nurses also described that the misuse of legislation-based rights revealed some unethical behaviors in nursing practice, to ease their own work or achieve their own personal goals. Sometimes, nurses also misused their legislation-based rights by taking unearned advantages and benefits in terms of misusing the right to paid sick leave or right to autonomous decision making on patient treatment:
<disp-quote>
<p>Because everybody uses these laws, some have abused these laws, people have taken their right to excess. (FG 5)</p>

<title>Managerial barriers for nurses’ rights</title>
<p>The interviewees described that legislation-based nurses’ rights are ignored by the management staff within the healthcare organizations. They had experienced their rights being overlooked and even rejected because of their low status within the organization. This invisibility was also referred to the perception that they had not been heard by nurse managers or recognized as members of a profession. Nurses who were interested in nurses’ rights claimed that this had also been defined as a problem by managers, putting the nurses at risk of being stigmatized as “troublesome” persons or even being dismissed. This was especially the case in the private sector where their work contracts were less secure:
<disp-quote>
<p>They [nurse managers] don’t listen to us; if you try to speak [of rights] you clash against a wall. (FG 5)</p>
<p>I have to feel ashamed of having breakfast ... because some nurse managers are annoyed that we have breakfast in the morning. (FG 3)</p>
<p>If you enquire about your rights, it may be detrimental: you have to follow the rules or you can be fired. (FG 2)</p>
<p>We have rights to information ... if a nurse is informed about organizational issues, you are more involved and committed to the organization and your work. (FG 2)</p>
<p>I now work freelance, I can work seven days out of seven, but if you are not always available, you will never be called again. (FG 3)</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study produces new empirical findings about nurses’ rights in practice and clarifies how Italian nurses understand their rights. Nurses’ rights are a relatively unfamiliar concept for nurses in their history and education. However, they are an inherent part of their practice and professional national legislation has played a strong role in defining the basis of nurses’ rights. Based on our findings, we will highlight three discussion questions. The first question is the local and global nature of nurses’ rights. The participants in this study highlighted that the Italian legislation and work contracts for nursing and health professionals are a common basis and are guaranteed cornerstones for their rights as professionals. They often mentioned several influential documents relating to Italian nursing (e.g. Min. Decree 739/94, Law no. 42/1999). According to the previous literature, national and local legislation is an elementary,<sup>

</sup> part of nurses’ rights. However, from a global perspective, nurses are working in different practical settings in a wide variety of national legislations. It is noteworthy that despite local legislation for employment rights, nurses have their human<sup>

</sup> rights, which are documented, international by nature, and shared with all nurses. From this point of view, nurses are protected by their local rights but do not rely on them. For this reason, international discussion of national nurses’ rights is needed to highlight national differences and to stimulate debate about common international nurses’ rights—including human rights, professional rights, and employment rights.</p>
<p>The second question is that participants in this study related their rights (or lack of their rights) to factors, which in previous studies have been connected to, for example, bullying<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0969733012466001">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0969733012466001">54</xref>
</sup> or job (dis)satisfaction<sup>

</sup>—organizational hierarchy, role conflicts, disregard, and discrimination. In our study, the lack of psychological well-being caused by the hierarchy intrinsic to the organizations that maintain the biomedical model<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0969733012466001">57</xref>
</sup> of top–down communication and old organizational models. That increased the nurses’ perception that they were not supported enough or even considered as troublemakers when they asked for their rights. The participants’ experienced being as an ‘invisible’ group of professionals without rights within the healthcare organization.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0969733012466001">41</xref>
</sup> In addition, in line with previous studies, nurses’ human rights were challenged, too.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969733012466001">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733012466001">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733012466001">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0969733012466001">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0969733012466001">39</xref>
</sup> The many dimensions of ethical environments<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0969733012466001">58</xref>
</sup> are linked to the promotion of professional well-being that fosters nurses’ rights. It is noteworthy that professional ethics is never independent from the current culture and context,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0969733012466001">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0969733012466001">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0969733012466001">41</xref>
</sup> and several internal and external changes have acted as an impulse to reflect and rethink professional ethics.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0969733012466001">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0969733012466001">59</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0969733012466001"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0969733012466001">61</xref>
</sup> For this reason, there is a great need for updating the rights included in professional ethics. Professions without rights have been identified as being professions with low social status and a high risk of developing powerless behavior.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0969733012466001">22</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The third question is the relationship between nurses’ duties and rights. From a general perspective, the participants highlighted the influence of the duty-based history of nursing,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0969733012466001">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0969733012466001">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0969733012466001">60</xref>
</sup> which prevented nurses from standing up for their rights. There has been much debate on this point because of the nature of nursing in caring for ill and weak people, and the traditional reliance on an ethos of selfless care and dedication.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0969733012466001">61</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0969733012466001"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0969733012466001">63</xref>
</sup> Nurses are also people who have their own needs and should have their rights. Despite to their high commitment to patients and their work, nurses are also persons with needs and their rights should have been respected. The thesis of proportionality<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0969733012466001">63</xref>
</sup> in considering strike action, which takes into account the special (but not radically different) characteristics of nursing, is a moral principle that has to be followed and has to be seen as part of the postmodern good nurse.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0969733012466001">64</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Curtin and Flaherty<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733012466001">14</xref>
</sup> describe nurses as having duties to assure that they carry out their obligations, but their rights will ensure their conditions while they are fulfilling their duties. From this standpoint, the professional ethics of autonomous nurses guide them to achieve their professional purposes and goals in the society.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0969733012466001">65</xref>
</sup> Professional ethics constitute a solid basis for the profession and provide freedom and power for autonomous decision making.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0969733012466001">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0969733012466001">66</xref>
</sup> It could, therefore, be argued that nurses’ rights have to become the framework of professional autonomy. Professional autonomy demands that the aim and mission of the profession are clear and serve the profession itself. The legal (and ethical) rights of a profession seek to ensure those conditions that allow nurses to fulfill the aim and mission of their profession.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733012466001">14</xref>
</sup> Hence, rights are not a self-value but an instrumental value of the profession. However, an autonomous profession needs inherent rights; otherwise, it is not autonomous.</p>
<p>In the future, the role of the autonomous nursing profession will be focused<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0969733012466001">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0969733012466001">68</xref>
</sup> on aiming to achieve and ensure the full extent of its education and practice.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0969733012466001">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0969733012466001">69</xref>
</sup> This poses challenges also for professional ethics and requires educational changes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0969733012466001">67</xref>
</sup> A current challenge is how to find applicable strategies and the tools to make nurses’ rights visible in practice. Globally, nurses work in different settings that affect their practice, and in addition, nurses and patients represent different cultural frameworks. All these pose additional demands for nursing education to obtain a major understanding of the nurses’ rights in relation to the different roles and contexts in nursing practice.</p>
<sec id="section18-0969733012466001">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study focused on describing nurses’ rights from their point of view. Selecting just nurses studying at the postgraduate level is a limitation of this study; however, participants had experience in nursing practice and were able to open up sparsely studied phenomena. In the future, nurses’ rights could and must also be analyzed from other points of view and countries: nurses working in different fields, patients, physicians, and other health professionals also need to contribute to this debate. Using only focus groups can distort an issue due to an uneven discussion of the topic.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0969733012466001">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Although professional ethics have been widely studied in previous research, the need for constant reflection is a necessity because of its contextual nature. As a basic element of an autonomous nursing profession, nurses’ rights have not been considered sufficiently, especially empirically. Nurses’ rights are an inherent part of practice, related to long- and short-term changes in nursing and legislation nationally and internationally, and also strongly connected to work contracts. All nurses need to be aware of their rights and have the tools and strategies to recognize and apply them in nursing practice. Since nurses work in different settings and with a wide range of healthcare professionals, their rights need to be addressed from a multidimensional and interdisciplinary perspective.</p>
