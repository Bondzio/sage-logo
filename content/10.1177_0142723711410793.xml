<abstract>
<p>Preschoolers’ ability to produce, read, and use written marks (notating skills) reflects an early understanding of the functions of print. The relation between preschoolers’ notating skills and parents’ level of assistance when notating, talk about the purpose of writing, and elaborative talk was examined. Sixty preschoolers played a grocery-list task, where they produced, decoded, and used notations for problem-solving. Then, parents and children played the grocery-list task together and discussed a past event. Children with better notating skills had parents who provided more assistance when notating and used more elaborative talk, but did not talk more about the purpose of writing. Findings suggest the role of parental talk styles and level of assistance in preschoolers’ understanding of the functions of print.</p>

<p>Prior to mastering spelling and decoding in school, children produce and read back a variety of written marks. Children develop from making written marks that are idiosyncratic (e.g., scribbles) to iconic (e.g., drawings and tallies) to conventional (e.g., letters and Arabic numerals) (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0142723711410793">Bialystok &amp; Codd, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0142723711410793">Ferreiro &amp; Teberosky, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0142723711410793">Hughes, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0142723711410793">Lee &amp; Karmiloff-Smith, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0142723711410793">Levin &amp; Bus, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0142723711410793">Sulzby, Barnhart, &amp; Hieshima, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0142723711410793">Tolchinsky, 2003</xref>). In this study, we refer to these written marks or external representations produced, read, and used in communicative or problem-solving contexts as notations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0142723711410793">Tolchinsky, 2007</xref>). By characterizing them as notations, we aimed to include written marks representing information about objects, personal names, verbs, etc. (which are usually identified in the literature as emergent writing), and number or quantity information (which are typically studied in the literature on early numeracy).</p>
<p>It is important to study preschoolers’ notating skills because they reflect how children come to develop an early understanding of the functions of print. Children who produce, read, and use notations must have some appreciation of the intentional nature of written marks: one intends to make a written mark in order to communicate and/or remember some information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0142723711410793">Goodman, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0142723711410793">Werner &amp; Kaplan, 1963</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0142723711410793">DeLoache, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0142723711410793">Namy, 2005</xref>). Children who produce, read, and use notations must also have some appreciation of the referential nature of written marks: a written mark refers to something other than itself (e.g., an idea) by virtue of perceptual similarity (e.g., a picture of a boat refers to a boat), or conventionality (e.g., ‘M’ refers to the sound /m/) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0142723711410793">Peirce, 1897/1955</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0142723711410793">Bates, 1979</xref>).</p>
<p>Several studies of symbolic development have examined children’s appreciation of the intentional and referential nature of diverse symbols, including gestures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0142723711410793">Namy, Campbell, &amp; Tomasello, 2004</xref>), drawings and pictures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0142723711410793">Bloom &amp; Markson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0142723711410793">Callaghan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0142723711410793">Preissler &amp; Carey, 2004</xref>), simple maps and 3D-models (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0142723711410793">DeLoache, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0142723711410793">Liben &amp; Myers, 2007</xref>), printed words (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0142723711410793">Bialystok &amp; Martin, 2003</xref>), and videos (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0142723711410793">Troseth &amp; DeLoache, 1998</xref>). This research has typically recognized the importance of both roles, the producer and the user of a symbol, thus studying children’s role-taking in a communicative and/or problem-solving situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0142723711410793">Namy, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0142723711410793">Tomasello, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0142723711410793">2007</xref>). For example, children’s production and/or use of pictures and gestures have been investigated in the context of communicating some information to others (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0142723711410793">Namy et al., 2004</xref>) or as a source of information to solve a problem such as finding a hidden object in a larger space (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0142723711410793">DeLoache, 1995</xref>). In the domain of notating skills, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0142723711410793">Munn (1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0142723711410793">1998)</xref> examined preschoolers’ ability to produce and use numeric notations in a problem-solving situation. In these studies, children were asked to register the quantity of blocks hidden in four identical tins. Then children had to use their notations to solve a problem: finding out which of the four tins had an additional or a missing block. Munn found that preschoolers produce an array of numeric notations, but can only use them functionally to solve a problem when they are highly conventionalized (i.e., Arabic numerals).</p>
<p>Research on emergent writing (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0142723711410793">Richgels, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0142723711410793">Sulzby et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0142723711410793">Tolchinsky, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0142723711410793">Treiman, 1993</xref>) and early numeracy (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0142723711410793">Aunio, Aubrey, Godfrey, Pan, &amp; Liu, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0142723711410793">Geary, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0142723711410793">Ginsburg, Choi, Lopez, Netly, &amp; Chi, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0142723711410793">Nunes &amp; Bryant, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0142723711410793">Seo &amp; Ginsburg, 2003</xref>), has usually focused on mastering the conventions of print (whether letters or numerals), rather than on children’s ability to understand the functions of print. Mastering conventions of print includes knowing the name of letters and numbers and printing them, knowing how to sound out letters, and print concepts. Notably, the term ‘print concepts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0142723711410793">Clay, 1979</xref>) does not involve understanding the functions of print. It is restricted to book knowledge such as directionality of reading and pointing to the beginning and end of a book, and conventional print skills such as differentiating pictures from print, letters from words, and letter forms such as capital letters.</p>
<p>Overall, less attention has been given to how children produce, read, and use written marks, even when they are not conventional, for purposes such as communicating or remembering information about objects and quantities. In standardized tests of emergent writing, children are asked to write some information that is dictated to them, but writing is not presented to children as a functional tool in a meaningful context. Standardized tests of early numeracy typically focus on skills such as counting objects, matching numerals with the quantities they represent, basic arithmetic abilities (addition and subtraction), and logical principles (e.g., conservation). It is not obvious to young children that writing (whether letters or numerals) is a communicative tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0142723711410793">Tolchinsky, 2003</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0142723711410793">Bialystok, 1995</xref>) or that it can serve a functional purpose in real life, such as a mnemonic aid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0142723711410793">Vygotsky, 1929/1978</xref>). Thus, more research is needed in order to understand how children come to appreciate the functions of print and to identify the factors that may be involved in the development of this ability. This is the first study to investigate children’s appreciation of the intentional and referential nature of writing, that is, their early understanding of the functions of print, by assessing their ability to assume both the role of the producer (‘encoder’) and the user (‘decoder’) of their own notations to solve a problem.</p>

<title>Parent–child interaction and children’s notating skills</title>
<p>Parents are the main mediators of children’s learning in early childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0142723711410793">Brooks-Gunn, Berlin, &amp; Fuligni, 2000</xref>). At home, parents and children engage in conversations and activities around letters and numbers from very early on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0142723711410793">Durkin, Shire, Riem, Crowther, &amp; Rutter, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0142723711410793">Hayden &amp; Fagan, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0142723711410793">Kang, Kim, &amp; Pan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0142723711410793">Tare, Shatz, &amp; Gilbertson, 2008</xref>). Self-reports and observational studies show that parents usually encourage their children to write their first name, use conventional and nonconventional notations in activities such as sending cards and letters to relatives (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0142723711410793">Richgels, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0142723711410793">Sulzby et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0142723711410793">Teale and Sulzby, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0142723711410793">Treiman, 1993</xref>), and print numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0142723711410793">Blevins-Knabe, Berghout, Musun-Miller, Eddy, &amp; Jones, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0142723711410793">Blevins-Knabe &amp; Musun-Miller, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0142723711410793">LeFevre, Clarke, &amp; Stringer, 2002</xref>). Parents also report engaging with their children in activities involving writing and numeracy such as shopping, cooking, being timed, and playing certain board games (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0142723711410793">LeFevre, Skwarchuk, Smith-Chant, Fast, &amp; Kamawar, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0142723711410793">Nunes &amp; Bryant, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0142723711410793">Saxe, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0142723711410793">Song &amp; Ginsburg, 1987</xref>). To our knowledge, there are no studies on the relation between parent–child interaction and preschoolers’ notating skills for problem-solving. However, studies from three different research literatures have identified aspects of parent–child interaction that are important for children’s early literacy and numeracy, and their symbolic development: parents’ mediation, the specific content of parents’ talk, and the context of parents’ talk.</p>
<sec id="section2-0142723711410793">
<title>Parents’ mediation</title>
<p>Mediation refers to the level of scaffolding or cognitive support parents provide in interaction with their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0142723711410793">Vygotsky, 1929/1978</xref>). The quality of parental mediation has been linked to children’s numeracy, writing, and reading skills. For example, several studies have demonstrated that parents who adapt the strategies they model and/or the instructional techniques they use to their children’s abilities in tasks involving number or mathematical reasoning have children with better numeracy skills such as counting and arithmetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0142723711410793">Benigno &amp; Ellis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0142723711410793">Bjorklund, Hubertz, &amp; Reubens, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0142723711410793">Saxe, Guberman, &amp; Gearhart, 1987</xref>). Other studies have found that mothers’ writing mediation is concurrently related to kindergarten children’s conventional word writing, word recognition, and phonological awareness and uniquely predicts children’s spelling and reading comprehension in second grade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0142723711410793">Aram &amp; Levin, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142723711410793">2004</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0142723711410793">Burns &amp; Casbergue, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0142723711410793">DeBaryshe, Buell, &amp; Binder, 1996</xref>). Writing mediation refers to the degree to which parents: (a) allow or encourage the child to write letters on her/his own, i.e., print mediation; (b) encourage the child to retrieve phonemes/syllables and link them with specific letter names, i.e., grapho-phonemic mediation; and (c) make references to orthographic rules. Furthermore, parents of preschool children who received training in writing mediation had children with greater gains in alphabetical skills than parents who received training in book-sharing or arts-and-crafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0142723711410793">Aram &amp; Levin, 2009</xref>). Taken together, these studies show that the quality of parents’ assistance has immediate and non-immediate effects on children’s conventional numeracy, writing, and reading skills.</p>
<p>In this study, we focused on parents’ mediation when preschool children produced notations to solve a problem. Of particular interest to this study was the level of cognitive support parents provided in an autonomy-supportive manner when children produced notations. Parents who are more supportive of the child’s autonomy follow the child’s lead by allowing or encouraging the child to choose how to represent the information (e.g., drawing, writing the first letter of a word, a combination of both), and choose the colors with which to write. Less autonomy-supportive parents write for the child, dictate letters or numbers for the child, hold the child’s hand when the child is writing, and/or choose what colors the child should use to write. Variability in levels of autonomy support provided by parents in interaction with their preschoolers is widely reported (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0142723711410793">Cleveland &amp; Reese, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0142723711410793">Leyva, Reese, Grolnick, &amp; Price, 2008</xref>). Prior research shows the positive effects of parents’ autonomy support on children’s interest in learning (engagement) and motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0142723711410793">Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0142723711410793">Grolnick &amp; Ryan, 1987</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0142723711410793">Assor, Kaplan, &amp; Roth, 2002</xref>). Thus, we focused on parents’ notating mediation in relation to children’s early understanding of the functions of print. We aimed to investigate whether there was a link between children’s notating skills and parents’ mediation (particularly around written representations of number and object) in the preschool years. In doing so, we are extending the research on parental mediation to children’s early understanding of the functions of print as a precursor to literacy and numeracy skills.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0142723711410793">
<title>Content of parents’ talk</title>
<p>Several studies have shown that the content of parents’ talk in interaction with their children influences children’s understanding of external representations. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0142723711410793">Braswell and Callanan (2003)</xref> reported that mothers who talked about the distinctive features of drawings while playing a collaborative drawing game had children who, over the course of the game, modified their drawings to make them more sophisticated and understandable to their mothers. In a planning study, mothers who provided comments and help interpreting and using a pictorial plan to construct a toy had children with greater anticipatory use of plans in a post-test task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0142723711410793">Gauvain, de la Ossa, &amp; Hurtado-Ortiz, 2001</xref>). In a math task of ratios and proportions, children benefited more from mothers who talked about the specific mathematical content involved in the task (i.e., maternal statements about ratios or proportions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0142723711410793">Pan, Gauvain, Liu, &amp; Cheng, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>These studies suggest that the content of parental talk might be linked to the development of children’s early understanding of the functions of print (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0142723711410793">Szechter &amp; Liben, 2004</xref>). In this study, we also examined whether preschoolers’ notating skills were related to the content of parents’ talk. We were interested in whether parents talk with their preschoolers about the purpose of writing as a tool to convey and/or remember information and, if so, how this talk was related to preschoolers’ notating skills.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0142723711410793">
<title>Context of parents’ talk</title>
<p>Another set of studies has demonstrated that parents’ talk during decontextualized conversations, those that are focused on temporally displaced events rather than ongoing events, is related to children’s print skills. One example of a highly decontextualized conversation is when parents and children discuss past events together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0142723711410793">Snow, 1983</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0142723711410793">Fivush, Haden, &amp; Reese, 2006</xref> for a review). Mothers who use a highly elaborative style in these decontextualized conversations have children with more advanced print concepts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0142723711410793">Reese, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0142723711410793">Sparks &amp; Reese, 2009</xref>). Elaborative reminiscing is a talk style characterized by a greater use of open-ended questions (e.g., what, where, who, why) and evaluative feedback that invites the child to provide more information about the past event and to add more pieces of information to construct a story in rich detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0142723711410793">Haden, 1998</xref>). Variability in levels of elaboration provided by parents when reminiscing with their children have been found among families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0142723711410793">Fivush et al., 2006</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0142723711410793">Leyva et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>To date, the mechanism explaining the link between parents’ elaborative reminiscing style and children’s print concepts has not been well specified. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0142723711410793">Fivush et al. (2006)</xref> suggested that an elaborative reminiscing style requires children to distance cognitively from their immediate experience and work on information that is not perceptually available, for example, by drawing causal relationships, making inferences, and predicting different potential outcomes. Presumably, this cognitive distancing is similar to the cognitive demands used when interpreting print and comprehending a written story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0142723711410793">Snow, 1983</xref>). Thus, mothers who use an elaborative reminiscing style may be helping their children’s abstract thinking skills, which then aid children in acquiring print concepts. From this perspective, elaborative reminiscing might benefit a range of cognitive, linguistics and sociocognitive skills that involve distancing or perspective-taking, such as theory of mind, emotion understanding, memory and an understanding of print (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0142723711410793">Fivush et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0142723711410793">Wareham &amp; Salmon, 2006</xref>). The link between children’s print skills and adults’ talk during decontextualized conversations is not specific to parents. Preschool teachers’ decontextualized talk is also related to kindergarten children’s print concepts, letter recognition, and writing and story concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0142723711410793">Dickinson &amp; Tabors, 2001</xref>). Importantly, to date the link between children’s print concepts and maternal elaborative reminiscing style has only been found in kindergarten children and is limited to children’s appreciation of one specific aspect of print: its conventionality.</p>
<p>In this study we explored whether there was a link between children’s notating skills and parents’ elaborative reminiscing style. In doing so, we extended the literature on the context of parents’ talk to preschool children and to a different aspect of print development, notating skills, which reflects an understanding of the intentional and referential nature of writing. Including a non-literacy interaction task such as past-event talk also helps us to assess the specificity or generality of links between parent–child talk and children’s print acquisition.</p>

<title>The present study</title>
<p>The goal of this study was to investigate whether preschool children’s early understanding of the functions of print was related to parents’ mediation, talk about the purpose of writing, and their elaborative reminiscing talk. To assess early understanding of the functions of print, we designed a grocery-list task. In this task, children were asked to make a list (‘encode’), read back their list (‘decode’), and use their list (‘check’) to make sure the correct items were bought at a pretend store. This is an ecologically valid numeracy/writing/reading activity that is meaningful and familiar for children in western cultures. It also has a clear functional purpose: one makes and reads a grocery list to solve a problem – to remember what to buy at the store – and one checks the list to know whether one has bought everything one needed. The grocery-list task also gives children the opportunity to convey information about both type and quantity of food, thus revealing children’s emergent writing and early numeracy development. We assessed children’s early understanding of the functions of print through their ability to encode, decode, and check the list (notating skills) in the grocery-list task because it allowed an examination of how children produced and used written marks for a functional purpose, i.e., to remember and check information. We call this version of the task, ‘the solo trial of the grocery-list task’ because children received no adult instruction or assistance in encoding, decoding, or checking the grocery list (notating skills).</p>
<p>To assess the quality of parents’ mediation when children make notations to remember some information (from now on notating mediation), we designed a ‘joint trial of the grocery-list task.’ In this trial, parents were asked to make and check a grocery list with their children. Parents’ talk about the purpose of writing was measured during the joint trial of the grocery-list task. Finally, parents’ elaborative reminiscing talk was assessed during a past-event conversation with their children.</p>
<p>In this study, we administered the solo trial first, and then the joint trial of the grocery-list task. We adopted this design for several reasons. First, we were interested in assessing children’s independent level of early understanding of the functions of print before they received any specific instruction, feedback, or support from an adult in this task. Thus, the solo trial had to be administered first. In the solo trial children did not receive any feedback or instruction from the researcher. Thus, all children shared a very similar experience with the grocery-list task prior to engaging in the joint trial. Second, in the joint trial we were mostly interested in the parents’ verbal and nonverbal behaviors; we did not assess children’s early understanding of the functions of print. Parents were told that children had previously played a game related to grocery shopping with a researcher, but were unaware of what the task involved. Hence, the joint trial of the grocery-list task was a new task for the parents. Third, the joint trial of the grocery-list task was a fairly new and challenging experience for children because it involved a different pretend grocery store with different and unfamiliar items to buy: avocados and limes. A pilot study showed that using these fruits rather than popular fruits such as apples and bananas made the task more demanding for children and elicited parents’ notating mediation.</p>
<p>We controlled for several variables that might be linked to children’s early understanding of the functions of print and/or parents’ notating mediation, talk about the purpose of writing, and elaborative talk: child age, knowledge about grocery lists, letter/word and numeral recognition and print concepts, receptive vocabulary, and phonological awareness. In addition, we controlled for home literacy practices and parental education. We asked parents to report the frequency with which they engaged in joint book reading and teaching letters and numbers. We also asked parents to report whether they made grocery lists on a regular basis and whether children ever watched their parents and/or helped them make grocery lists.</p>
<p>In line with research on parents’ mediation in emergent writing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0142723711410793">Aram &amp; Levin, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142723711410793">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0142723711410793">2009</xref>) and early numeracy tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0142723711410793">Benigno &amp; Ellis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0142723711410793">Bjorklund et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0142723711410793">Saxe et al., 1987</xref>) and their autonomy support (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0142723711410793">Assor et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0142723711410793">Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0142723711410793">Grolnick &amp; Ryan, 1987</xref>), we expected that children who are better at encoding and decoding their own written marks would have parents who provide higher quality assistance in notating during the grocery-list task. We explored whether parents engaged in talk about the purpose of writing in the joint trial of the grocery-list task. If so, then we would expect a positive relation between children’s notating skills and the presence and amount of parents’ talk about the purpose of writing, in line with prior research on external representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0142723711410793">Braswell &amp; Callanan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0142723711410793">Gauvain et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0142723711410793">Pan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0142723711410793">Szechter &amp; Liben, 2004</xref>). Finally, we explored whether there was a relation between children’s notating skills and parents’ elaborative reminiscing talk. We expected to gather evidence that would shed light on why and how the structure of parents’ talk in a reminiscing task is related (or not) to preschoolers’ notating skills.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section7-0142723711410793">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The participants were 60 preschool children (32 girls and 28 boys) and their parents (53 mothers and 7 fathers); 83% were European American, 10% were African American, 7% were other ethnicity; 92% of parents had a bachelor’s (or higher) degree and 8% had a 2-year-college or a high-school degree. The children ranged in age from 46 to 63 months (<italic>M</italic> = 53 months, SD = 6.2 months). None of the children was able to read or write independently at the time of the study according to parent report. Participants were recruited through ads in parents’ clubs and newsletters and from three daycares located in central Massachusetts. To facilitate scheduling, parents elected where they preferred the study to be conducted: 14 chose a university lab, 20 chose home, and 26 chose the child’s daycare. All parents reported that the primary language spoken at home was English and of these, 10% reported also speaking a second language at home. The sample was for the most part white and from middle-SES. These demographic characteristics are representative of the area from which participants were recruited.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0142723711410793">
<title>Tasks and procedure</title>
<p>The researcher visited parent–child dyads individually at their preferred location. The researcher first invited the child to play several ‘games’ for the first 25–30 minutes of the session in a separate room. The first ‘game’ was always the solo trial of the grocery-list task, and then several conventional print knowledge (letter/word and numeral recognition and print concepts), and language tests (receptive vocabulary and phonological awareness). The order of presentation of the conventional print knowledge and language tests was counterbalanced. While the child was completing these tasks, the parent filled out a questionnaire on home literacy practices and demographic information in a different room. Thus, the parent was not aware of the kind of tasks the child had completed with the researcher. Then parent and child were reunited and asked to play a new grocery-list task with a different ‘grocery store’ (joint trial) and to talk about something that they did together in the past. Half of the parents played the grocery-list task first and then talked about a past event, and half completed the tasks in the opposite order. The total duration of the session was around 45–50 minutes. Children were given a small gift for their participation at the end of the session. Children were videotaped during the solo trial of the grocery-list task and parents and children were videotaped during the joint trial of the grocery-list task and the past-event conversations. Their utterances were transcribed for later analyses.</p>
<sec id="section9-0142723711410793">
<title>Solo trial of the grocery-list task</title>
<p>The materials for the grocery-list task were: a small basket, a piece of paper, a box of markers (7 different colors) and the ‘grocery store,’ which was a plastic opaque box (17′ × 9′ × 6′) with a lid and four compartments. The store had 20 wooden fruit props (5 of each kind): apples, pears, bananas, and oranges. A small table with two chairs for the child and the researcher to sit was called ‘home.’ The researcher announced that they were going to pretend to go grocery shopping. The child was then shown the ‘grocery store’ and asked to identify each kind of fruit in it. All children easily recognized the fruits. Then the researcher put the lid on the box and placed the ‘grocery store’ about 3 feet from ‘home.’ The researcher told the child that she had too many things to buy at the store and was afraid she might forget something. She then asked the child: ‘What can we do to remember all the things we need?’ If the child thought about producing a list (or writing it up) the researcher said: ‘Good idea! What is a grocery list?’ If the child did not think of producing a list, the researcher said: ‘How about we make a grocery list? What is a grocery list?’ The child’s knowledge about grocery lists was used as a control variable. Regardless of the child’s answer, the researcher stated what a grocery list was: ‘A grocery list is when you put down on paper all the things that you need to buy before you go grocery shopping, so you don’t forget them.’</p>
<p>The child was asked to make a list with the following items: 3 apples, 5 pears, 2 bananas, and 4 oranges. The researcher provided only general positive feedback (e.g., ‘nice job’), but no specific instruction or feedback on the child’s performance was provided. The child was not corrected if she or he made any errors. If the child mentioned that she or he did not know how to write/read yet, the researcher said: ‘That’s OK. Just put down something on paper so we remember this is what we need at the store.’ Next, the researcher announced that the store was closed and would open in 15 minutes, and invited the child to play one of the conventional print knowledge tests in the meantime. By introducing a standard 15-minute delay we insured that any decoding was not simply the memory of a momentary intention when initially making the mark (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0142723711410793">Bloom &amp; Markson [1998]</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0142723711410793">Munn [1998]</xref> for a similar procedure). The researcher asked the child to read back the list before going grocery shopping; no help was provided. Researcher and child then walked to the ‘grocery store’ with the basket and the list, and grabbed the fruit they needed. The researcher, however, deliberately ‘forgot’ to buy one pear. Because the researcher never counted the fruit aloud for the child and always handed more than one fruit to the child, no child realized that there was one pear missing. Then the researcher and child went back ‘home.’ The researcher looked at the basket and announced that they might have forgotten something at the store and asked the child: ‘What can we do to make sure we bought everything we needed?’ If the child did not think about checking the list, the researcher suggested the child to do so. The researcher never assisted the child in producing, decoding, or checking the list.</p>

<sec id="section10-0142723711410793">
<title>Joint trial of the grocery-list task</title>
<p>The materials were the same as the solo trial, except for the grocery store, which in this case had on display only 10 wooden fruit props (5 limes and 5 avocados). Avocados and limes were chosen because a pilot study showed that their similar shape and color presented a challenge for children to encode and decode, and thus, elicited parents’ mediation in producing the list.</p>
<p>Parents were told that the child had previously played a game related to grocery shopping with the researcher. They were also told that this was a new game with a different pretend store and different fruit props than the ones the child had previously seen with the researcher. Instructions to parents were given in written form, so that the child would not be aware of them. The researcher insured parents understood the three steps: (1) making the list (4 avocados and 5 limes), (2) going to the store and ‘forgetting’ one lime, and (3) checking the list. Parents were encouraged to let their child be the ‘grocery-list maker,’ but to provide help if necessary; they were not explicitly asked to help their children decode the grocery list after they produced it. Parents were not instructed to talk about the purpose of writing as a tool to remember or convey information.</p>

<title>Parent–child past-event conversation</title>
<p>Parents were asked to think about a one-time special past event that they experienced with their children (e.g., a visit to the science museum), and to talk about it with their child as they normally would (following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0142723711410793">Reese, Haden, &amp; Fivush, 1993</xref>).

<sec id="section12-0142723711410793">
<title>Conventional print knowledge tests</title>
<p>Children’s conventional knowledge about letters and numbers was assessed using three tests. In the <italic>letter/word recognition</italic> test (taken from the Wide Range Achievement Test, WRAT-3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0142723711410793">Stone, Jastak, &amp; Wilkinson, 1995</xref>), children were presented with 22 index cards: 12 cards with a single printed letter (10 index cards contained the 10 letters from the WRAT-3 and two index cards contained letters from the child’s name) and 10 cards with printed words from the first line of the WRAT-3 (e.g., cat, book). Children were asked to say the name of the letters and to recognize the words. In the <italic>numeral recognition</italic> test (taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0142723711410793">Munn, 1994</xref>), children were presented with 10 index cards showing printed numbers (from 0 to 9) and were asked to identify the numerals. In the <italic>print concepts</italic> test (taken from Concepts of Print; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0142723711410793">Clay, 1979</xref>), children’s book knowledge and conventional print skills were measured with 10 items such as differentiation between pictures and words and identification of capital letters and words. The book used was <italic>Just shopping with mom</italic> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0142723711410793">Mercer Meyer (1989)</xref>. Importantly, the researcher did not read the book to the child, only used it to ask the child to point to the pictures, the words, the letters, and so on. Thus, there was no effect of the content of the book on children’s performance.</p>

In this task, the child is presented with four pictures. The researcher names each picture, and then asks the child to identify (point to or say) the picture that begins with the sound produced orally by the researcher.

<title>Measures and scoring</title>

<title>Children’s notating skills</title>
<p>We formed a composite measure of children’s notating skills in the solo trial of the grocery-list task. This composite was based on their individual scores in encoding, decoding, and checking the list. Scores on <italic>encode the list</italic> were based on a 6-point scale (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0142723711410793">Munn, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0142723711410793">Tolchinsky, 2003</xref>) which ranged from idiosyncratic (e.g., scribbles), to iconic (recognizable pictures, tallies) to conventional (e.g., Arabic numbers, letters). Two raters separately scored 25% of children’s grocery lists. They first scored each notation (or group of notations) representing information about a type of fruit and then averaged the scores across the four types of fruits to encode (i.e., apples, pears, bananas, oranges). The same procedure was followed for information about quantity of fruit. First each notation representing quantity of fruit was scored and then averaged across the four quantities (i.e., 3 [apples], 5 [pears], 2 [bananas], 4 [oranges]). Shrout–Fleiss intraclass correlation coefficients on the average scores was .82 for information about type of fruit and .84 for information about quantity of fruit. One of the raters coded the remaining 75% of the grocery lists. Average scores on information about type and quantity of fruit were then averaged to obtain a final score.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0142723711410793">1</xref></sup> Scores on <italic>decode the list</italic> were based on the average total number of pieces of information about type and quantity of fruit correctly decoded (ranging from 0 to 4). The researcher coded this information on-line as the child decoded her or his grocery list, giving a 1 or 0 for each piece of information about type of fruit and for each piece of information about quantity of fruit depending on whether it was correctly decoded. Scores were summed across the four pieces of information about type of fruit information; the same procedure was followed for information about quantity. The final score on decode was the average score obtained on information about type and quantity of fruit. Scores on <italic>check the list</italic> were based on the total number of information about type and quantity of fruit correctly checked (ranging from 0 to 4). The same on-line coding and sum and averaging procedure used in decoding was followed for assigning scores in checking the list.</p>
<p>Children’s scores on encoding, decoding, and checking the list were significantly intercorrelated (<italic>r</italic>s ranged from .76 to .81, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The estimated internal-consistency reliability of these scores was high (standardized Cronbach’s alpha reliability = .92). To form a composite measure, we conducted a principal component analysis which yielded a single major factor (eigenvalue = 2.6, accounts for 86% of total standardized variance). This factor score was used in all subsequent analysis involving children’s notating skills. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0142723711410793">Table 1</xref> shows the range of scores for the hypothesized outcome of notating skills, as well as for predictors and covariates.</p>

<title>Parents’ notating mediation</title>
<p>We used a 5-point scale adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0142723711410793">Aram and Levin (2001)</xref> to assess the parent’s willingness to allow the child to make her or his own decisions (e.g., choose a strategy to notate), while offering guidance and feedback during the grocery-list task (i.e., if the child chose to make scribbles, the parent posed questions that helped the child choose better notating strategies, such as drawing pictures or color code scribbles). Anchor points in this global scale were: (1) a list written by the parent with no help from the child, or done by the child without any parental feedback and/or support; (3) both parent and child contributed to the list, with the child playing a secondary role; (5) a list was encoded entirely by child, with the parent providing feedback and/or support throughout the process. It is important to note that some level of parental mediation was necessary to produce a useful list because none of the children was able to write independently and because a pilot study showed that producing differentiated drawings of avocados and limes was challenging for preschoolers. Two raters coded 25% of the transcripts independently to check inter-rater reliability (Shrout–Fleiss intraclass correlation coefficient = .84). The remaining transcripts were coded by one of the raters.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0142723711410793">
<title>Parents’ talk about writing</title>
<p>Parents’ utterances during the grocery-list task were scored based on whether it included explanations, comments, or questions about the goal of writing and/or required the child to connect writing with the goal of retrieving specific information later on. Examples of these type of comments are, ‘Can you write 4 [avocados] so that we remember how many we need to get?’ or ‘If we don’t write what we need, we will forget it.’ We recorded parents’ content of talk in two scores: a dichotomous and a continuous score. The dichotomous score (TALK) indicated the presence/absence of talk about writing. Parents were given credit (score of 1) if they asked at least one question, or introduced at least one comment or explanation about the goal of writing during the grocery-list task. A continuous score (WRITING) was based on the proportion of total utterances coded that included talk about writing. For example, if the parent produced 12 utterances during the grocery-list task and introduced comments or explanations or asked questions in 2 of them, the continuous score was 2/12 = .17. Two raters coded 25% of the transcripts independently to check inter-rater reliability (Cohen’s kappa = .87). The remaining transcripts were coded by one of the raters.</p>

<title>Parents’ elaborative talk</title>
<p>Parents’ elaborative reminiscing talk was assessed using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0142723711410793">Haden’s (1998)</xref> coding scheme. We coded parents’ utterances as elaborative in the past-event conversation if they contained new information, or repetitive if they contained no new information, and then subcoded each elaborative and repetitive utterance as open-ended questions (e.g., ‘Where did we go for your birthday?’), yes/no questions (e.g., ‘Did you play on the beach?’), or statements (e.g., ‘They are called poems, poems about each dinosaur’). Evaluations (child says ‘Pietro’ and mother says ‘That’s right’), place holders (e.g., ‘That’s all!’), fill-in-the-blank questions (e.g., ‘And then we played on the . . .’), and off-task utterances were also coded. The final score was based on the proportion of open-ended elaborative questions out of the total number of on-task coded utterances; we used proportions to account for differences in length of conversation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0142723711410793">Reese, 1995</xref>). We used open-ended elaborative questions, and not total number of elaborations (which includes yes/no question and statements), because past research has identified these questions as particularly important for children’s responding in the conversations and across time (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0142723711410793">Fivush et al., 2006</xref>). Two raters independently coded 25% of the transcripts to check inter-rater reliability (Cohen’s kappa = .81). The remaining transcripts were coded by one of the raters.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>All children completed the solo trial of the grocery-list task and the conventional print knowledge tests. One parent did not complete the past-event conversation (due to extreme inattentiveness of the child) and two parents did not complete the joint trial of the grocery-list task and the past-event conversation due to difficulties scheduling a time to conduct the parent–child tasks in any of the available locations. Missing data for these three parents were replaced by the sample mean scores in order to retain all cases in the analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0142723711410793">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007</xref>). We compared the findings before and after mean substitution, in sensitivity analyses, and found that they did not differ. Thus, we report here the findings obtained after mean substitution for missing data.</p>
<p>Preliminary analyses were conducted to determine whether the environment where parents and children were observed (university lab, home, or the child’s daycare) had an effect on children’s and parents’ target measures. No statistically significant differences were found among these three groups after controlling for child age (ANCOVAs, all <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .10). Thus, location of study was not considered in further analyses.</p>
<p>Thirty percent of the parents did not engage in talk about the purpose of writing during the joint trial of the grocery-list task. Scores on amount of parents’ talk about writing were negatively skewed and scores on the frequency of joint book reading were positively skewed. To reduce skewness, we applied a square-root transformation of scores on amount of talk, and a logarithmic transformation of scores on joint book reading before analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0142723711410793">Singer &amp; Willett, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Thirty percent of the children in the sample made some kind of comment about ‘not knowing how to write or read/not knowing the ABC’s’. No statistically significant differences in notating skills or conventional print skills were found between the group of children who made this kind of comment and the group that did not (<italic>t</italic>-tests, all <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .10). We conducted <italic>t</italic>-tests and found no differences by gender on children’s and parents’ measures (all <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .10); thus child gender was also eliminated from subsequent analyses. Overall, 75% of parents reported making shopping lists on a regular basis and 28% of parents reported that their children had, at least once, helped them make a list. These answers bore no relation to any children or parents’ measure (ANOVAs, all <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .10). Hence, we did not include these variables in any subsequent analyses. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0142723711410793">Table 1</xref> for descriptive statistics for the outcome (children’s notating skills), predictors (parents’ measures), and covariates (children’s language and conventional skills, home literacy environment, and demographic characteristics).</p>
<p>Parents’ notating mediation, talk about writing, and elaborative reminiscing talk were not intercorrelated (<italic>r</italic>s ranged from −.01 to −.15, all <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .10). This indicates that the parents’ measures (predictors) used in this study were independent. Preliminary analyses also showed that children’s notating skills were positively related to their conventional skills (<italic>r</italic> = .49, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and remained significantly associated to them even after accounting for child age (p<italic>r</italic> = .34, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Notating skills were not associated with children’s receptive vocabulary (<italic>r</italic> = −.09, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .10). Children’s conventional skills were not related to parents’ notating mediation (p<italic>r</italic> = .19, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .10), talk about writing (p<italic>r</italic> = .17, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .10), or elaborative style (p<italic>r</italic> = −.11, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .10) after controlling for child age.</p>
<p>We used ordinary-least-squares (OLS) multiple regression analysis to address our research question. See <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0142723711410793">Appendix</xref> for a detailed explanation of the model fitted in our regression analysis.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0142723711410793">Table 2</xref>, we present a taxonomy of fitted OLS multiple regression models. In Model 1 we included the main effects of the covariates (child age, language, knowledge about lists, conventional print skills, phonological awareness, home literacy practices, and parental education) on the outcome. Child age and conventional print skills were positively and statistically related to children’s notating skills. Frequency of parents’ teaching letters and numbers to their children was negatively significantly related (<italic>p</italic> = .06) to children’s notating skills. Child language, knowledge about lists, phonological awareness, and parents’ frequency of book reading and parental education were not associated to children’s notating skills.</p>

<p>In Model 2 we added the main effects of the predictors, i.e., parent measures (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0142723711410793">Table 2</xref>). Parents’ notating mediation and elaborative talk were positive and significantly related to children’s notating skills even after controlling for the effects of all covariates. In addition, the effects of child age and conventional print skills remained statistically significant, while the negative effect of frequency of teaching letters and numbers was no longer present. Child vocabulary, phonological awareness, book reading practices, and parental education remained not associated with children’s notating skills.</p>
<p>We conducted a general linear hypothesis (GLH) test to determine whether we could drop non-statistically significant predictors and covariates from the model. In this test we contrasted the goodness of fit of a full model (Model 2 which includes all predictors and covariates and accounts for 64% of the outcome variance) to that of a reduced model (including only the effects of parents’ mediation and elaborative style, child age, and conventional print skills and accounting for 57% of the outcome variance). We found that Model 2’s goodness of fit was not any better than that of the reduced model (<italic>F</italic>(7, 47) =1.11, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .10). Hence, we dropped the joint effects of parents’ talk about writing and several covariates on children’s notating skills.</p>
<p>In subsequent models we tested for interaction effects of predictors and covariates on notating skills and found that these were not statistically significant. Thus, Model 3 is our ‘final reduced model’ containing the significant main effects of parents’ mediation and elaborative style, child age, and conventional print skills (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0142723711410793">Table 2</xref>). Children whose parents provided higher levels of notating mediation, and those who were more elaborative when reminiscing, had better notating skills in the grocery-list task. Parents’ mediation and elaboration accounted for 25% of the variance in children’s notating skills. Child age and conventional print skills were also associated with better notating skills. These covariates accounted for 32% of the variance in children’s notating skills. Taken together, these findings indicate that two aspects of parent–child interaction are related to children’s notating skills in the grocery-list task: parents’ notating mediation and their decontextualized conversation in the form of elaborative reminiscing. These associations were statistically significant even after accounting for important covariates including child age, language, knowledge about grocery lists, conventional print skills, phonological awareness, frequency of book reading and teaching letters and numbers, and parental education.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study investigated whether and how parents play a role in the development of children’s notating skills, that is, their ability to encode, decode, and check information using written marks for problem-solving, which reflects their early understanding of the functions of print. We assessed three aspects of parent–child interaction: parents’ notating mediation, the presence and amount of parents’ talk about the purpose of writing in a grocery-list task, and their decontextualized conversation in the form of elaborative reminiscing with their children. These measures of parent–child interaction were not intercorrelated. Thus, parents who provided more notating mediation in the grocery-list task were not necessarily talking more about the purpose of writing or using more elaborative talk in decontextualized conversations with their children. This finding is consistent with prior research showing independence of parents’ level of autonomy support from their reminiscing talk and other measures of parent–child interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0142723711410793">Cleveland &amp; Reese, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0142723711410793">Fivush et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Children who were better at notating information using written marks in the grocery-list task had parents who provided more high-quality assistance when children produced written marks. Specifically, parents of children with better notating skills were more likely to mediate in an autonomy–supportive manner by allowing or encouraging children find ways to encode the information. This finding supports previous research indicating the positive link between parents who encourage and support the child’s interests, rather than their own, and children’s task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0142723711410793">Assor et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0142723711410793">Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0142723711410793">Grolnick &amp; Ryan, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0142723711410793">Leyva et al., 2008</xref>). The correlational nature of this study does not allow us to determine whether the directionality of the link between children’ notating skills and parents’ mediation is from children to parents or vice versa. However, we can conclude that there was no immediate carry-over effect of parents’ mediation style on children’s notating skills because the solo trial always occurred before the joint trial of the notating task. Our results could suggest that children with better notating skills in an independent writing task might be driving parents to provide a more autonomy-supportive assistance when children notate in a joint writing task. However, the reverse might also be true: parents who provide more notating mediation in a joint writing task may help children to encode and decode information in a more successful manner in an independent writing task. Further research should explore whether there is a causal link between children’s notating skills and parents’ mediation.</p>
<p>Parents’ elaborative reminiscing was also positively and uniquely related to children’s notating skills, reflecting an understanding of the functions of print. Parents who used a higher proportion of open-ended questions adding new pieces of information during a decontextualized conversation had children with better notating skills in the grocery-list task. This is an important finding because it extends prior research in two ways: (1) by establishing a link between parents’ elaborative reminiscing and children’s print skills at a younger age than demonstrated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0142723711410793">Fivush et al., 2006</xref>); and (2) by extending this link beyond children’s conventional print skills to their notation skills reflecting their understanding of the functions of print. Parents who are more elaborative in a decontextualized conversation have preschool children who are more advanced at appreciating print as a communicative tool: written marks are intended to stand for ideas. Does elaborative reminiscing help children’s abstract thinking skills, which then generalize beyond conversation to include a deeper appreciation of the intentional and referential function of language? Parents’ elaborative talk may help children connect their representation of an event (their memory) with the spoken words about the event (the reminiscing conversation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0142723711410793">Reese, 1995</xref>). Because conversations about past events focus on absent objects and events, this kind of talk may be particularly helpful in promoting children’s abstract thinking, but experimental research that compares directly talk about the present and the past is needed.</p>
<p>The presence and amount of parents’ talk about the purpose of writing was not related to children’s notating skills. It is important to note that parents were not instructed to engage in this kind of talk, but that most of them (70%) spontaneously discussed this topic at least once with their children during the grocery-list task. There are several ways to explain the lack of association between parents’ talk about the purpose of writing and children’s notating skills. First, although this kind of talk was present in most parent–child interactions, the amount of talk was relatively low, with most parents only mentioning the purpose of writing once during the duration of the grocery-list task. It is possible that parents did not intensively engage in this talk because they assumed that their children already had this knowledge (i.e., they already understood the intentional nature of making a grocery list). Thus, they tailored their verbal and nonverbal scaffolding to other aspects of writing, for example, the shape or the sound of letters. In future longitudinal research, we could assess whether the link between parents’ talk about the purpose of writing and children’s notating skills will become visible in subsequent years. It is possible that these preschoolers whose parents spontaneously talk about the purpose of writing would later on display more sophisticated notating skills or even print skills later in school. Third, unlike other studies on the relation between the content of parents’ talk and children’s understanding of spatial representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0142723711410793">Braswell &amp; Callanan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0142723711410793">Gauvain et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0142723711410793">Szechter &amp; Liben, 2004</xref>), we did not test the pre-post immediate learning effects of parents’ talk on children’s performance. Children would be more likely to benefit from parents’ talk about the purpose of writing had this content been accessible before the presentation of the solo trial of the grocery-list task. Thus, it is plausible that we would find this relation had we reversed the order of the tasks. However, we used this order of tasks because we wanted to examine children’s independent level of early understanding of the functions of print before they were given any feedback or assistance in this task (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0142723711410793">Pan et al., 2006</xref>, for a similar study design). Future studies could examine the link between parents’ talk about the purpose of writing and children’s notating skills when the joint trial of the grocery-list task is presented first.</p>
<p>There are some limitations to this study, such as the small sample size and the homogeneity in demographic characteristics. Also, although there was no instruction in the solo trial of the grocery-list task, children had prior experience with the grocery-list task before playing the joint trial of the task with their parents. In future studies it would be important to determine whether parents play the grocery-list task with their children in the same manner when no prior experience with the task is given.</p>
<p>This study contributes to the larger literature on early literacy and symbolic development in at least two important ways.</p>
<p>First, the merits of the grocery-list task are supported by the evidence gathered in this study. Children’s performance in the grocery-list task, i.e., notating skills, was related to their conventional skills (letter/word and number recognition and print concepts). Parents’ notating mediation and elaborative talk were related to notating skills even after accounting for their conventional skills, age and other covariates. However, children’s conventional skills were not yet related to any of our parents’ measures. These findings suggest that the grocery-list task is a valid task to assess early literacy and symbolic development. It also shows that by examining children’s notating skills we are indeed tapping a separate ability, early understanding of the functions of print, which is different from knowledge about the conventions of print. Our design does not allow us to determine whether an early understanding of the functions of print precedes or is a precursor to mastering conventions of print. Clearly, both skills are necessary for literacy acquisition, and although statistically related, they are still independent abilities at least in the preschool years. In future studies, we hope to determine how both abilities come together to support literacy skills in school.</p>
<p>Second, this study contributes to the larger literature by extending the links between parents’ printing mediation and reminiscing style and children’s writing, numeracy, and reading skills to the preschool years. Prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0142723711410793">Aram &amp; Levin, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142723711410793">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0142723711410793">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0142723711410793">Reese, 1995</xref>) has focused on parents’ assistance and reminiscing style in relation to kindergarten and older children’s literacy skills. Other research has studied parental mediation (i.e., strategies and instructional techniques) during the preschool years, but has not focused on assistance in representing quantities or objects in written form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0142723711410793">Benigno &amp; Ellis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0142723711410793">Bjorklund et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0142723711410793">Pan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0142723711410793">Saxe et al., 1987</xref>). This is the first study to examine the role of parents’ mediation, talk about writing, and reminiscing style in relation to preschool children’s understanding of the functions of print. Parents’ notating mediation and reminiscing style were related to children’s early understanding of the functions of print, but not yet to their conventional skills. This suggests that in the preschool years, what parents do and say may play a role in children’s symbolic, numeracy, and literacy development, although it does not yet relate to children’s mastery of the conventions of print. Finding this continuity is important because it helps researchers revise and bridge theories about parenting and children’s early literacy and numeracy and symbolic development. Although becoming literate and mastering symbolic systems such as writing and number are part of the same sociocognitive process, there are very few efforts to bridge the field of early literacy and numeracy development with that of symbolic development. This study represents one of the first attempts at integrating these three areas of research.</p>

<p>where NOTATING represents the sophistication of the notating skills of a child <italic>i</italic> in the solo trial of the grocery-list task. Parameter β<sub>0</sub> is an intercept, β<sub>1</sub> represents the impact of the presence of parents’ mediation in the joint trial of the grocery-list task (MEDIATION), β<sub>2</sub> is the effect of the presence of parents’ talk about writing (TALK), β<sub>3</sub> is the effect of the amount of parents’ talk about writing in the joint trial of the grocery-list task (TALK × WRITING), β<sub>4</sub> is the effect of parents’ elaborative talk in a past-event conversation (ELABORATIVE), and γ represents the effects of a vector of controls on the outcome. If estimates of the parameters β<sub>1</sub>, β<sub>2</sub>, and β<sub>3</sub> are positive and statistically significant then we know that children who have better notating skills have parents who use more notating mediation, talk about writing (measured by presence and amount), and elaborative talk. Notice that the model contains the main effects of predictor TALK and the two-way interaction of predictors TALK and WRITING but not the main effect of predictor WRITING. We adopted this specification to account for the fact that parents who did not talk (TALK = 0) had no values of predictor WRITING. This means that parameter β<sub>2</sub> represents the impact of talk about writing for parents who actually talked about the purpose of writing.</p>

<p>There were two instances where children mistakenly registered a different quantity of fruits (i.e., 5 oranges instead of 4, 6 pears instead of 5). Raters did not penalize these children for accuracy in registering information about quantity of fruit. Both children were given full credit because they both successfully encoded information about quantity using recognizable pictures (albeit not exactly the information provided by the researcher) and then decoded and used this information to check that all items were bought at the store.</p></fn>
