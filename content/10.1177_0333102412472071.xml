<sec id="sec22-0333102412472071"><title>Background</title>
<p>Migraine is a disorder of the brain and is thought to involve activation of the trigeminovascular system, which includes the peripheral afferent projection to the nociceptive specific dura mater, as well as the central afferent projection to the trigeminal nucleus caudalis. Stimulation of the blood vessels of the dura mater produces pain in patients that is referred to the head similar to headache.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec23-0333102412472071"><title>Headache mechanisms</title>
<p>The likely reason for the pain is because the vascular structures of the dura mater, including the superior sagittal sinus and middle meningeal artery, are richly innervated by a plexus of largely unmyelinated sensory nerve fibers from the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal ganglion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec24-0333102412472071"><title>Methodology</title>
<p>Stimulation of these nociceptive specific nerve fibers is painful and produces neuronal activation in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis. Preclinical models of headache have taken advantage of this primarily nociceptive pathway, and various animal models use dural trigeminovascular nociception to assay aspects of head pain. These assays measure responses at the level of the dural vasculature and the central trigeminal nucleus caudalis as a correlate of trigeminovascular activation thought to be involved in headache.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec25-0333102412472071"><title>Summary</title>
<p>This review will summarize the history of the development of models of dural trigeminovascular nociception, including intravital microscopy and laser Doppler flowmetry at the level of the vasculature, and electrophysiology and Fos techniques used to observe neuronal activation at the trigeminal nucleus caudalis. It will also describe some of pitfalls of these assays and developments for the future.</p>

<p>Migraine is a chronic and disabling disorder of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0333102412472071">1</xref>) that affects up to 15% of the population at any one time. It has a debilitating effect on the quality of a sufferer’s life and is estimated to cost the United States and European economies $19.6 billion and €27 billion a year in lost personnel hours, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0333102412472071">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0333102412472071"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0333102412472071">4</xref>). This huge burden on the global economy is not reflected in the level of funding that is provided to research in understanding this condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0333102412472071">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0333102412472071">6</xref>), and yet over the last 25 years there have been huge steps in our understanding of the pathophysiology of this condition. While the exact pathophysiology of migraine is still not fully understood, it is thought to involve activation of the trigeminal afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0333102412472071">1</xref>), which densely innervate dural structures and project to second order neurons in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis and C<sub>1</sub>–C<sub>2</sub> region of the spinal cord (trigeminocervical complex, TCC). Studies in patients from the mid-20th century were able to demonstrate that while the brain is largely insensate, pain can be generated by stimulation of blood vessels of the dura mater in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0333102412472071">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0333102412472071">8</xref>**) and this pain is referred to the head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0333102412472071">9</xref>**). These discoveries led to the vascular hypothesis of migraine and an emphasis on cerebrovascular changes. There was also proliferation in preclinical research into the nerve fibers that innervate the dural vasculature, and the likely involvement of the trigeminovascular system (reviewed by Moskowitz in 1984 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0333102412472071">10</xref>)), and the subsequent development of animal models of migraine. Ironically, with our greater understanding of the trigeminovascular system, the emphasis of migraine pathophysiology has moved to a more neural view, and how the brain may be involved in the modulation of the trigeminovascular system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0333102412472071">11</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0333102412472071"><title>Trigeminovascular system – historical viewpoint</title>
<p>The trigeminovascular system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0333102412472071">10</xref>) includes the pseudounipolar trigeminal ganglion that has central afferent projections to the trigeminal nucleus caudalis in the medullary spinal cord, and a peripheral projection, largely from the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal ganglion, which innervates the cranial blood vessels and other cranial structures, including the pain-sensitive dura mater. There is also a reflex connection from the trigeminal nucleus to the parasympathetic outflow to the craniovasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0333102412472071">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0333102412472071"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0333102412472071">14</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0333102412472071">Figure 1</xref>). Several potent vasodilator peptides are present in the cell bodies of the trigeminal ganglion and project nerve fibers to cranial vessels, including calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P, neurokinin A and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0333102412472071">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0333102412472071"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0333102412472071"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0333102412472071">18</xref>).
<fig id="fig1-0333102412472071" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Overview of the trigeminovascular system. The trigeminovascular system relevant to headache includes the pseudounipolar trigeminal ganglion (TG) and its afferent projections to the trigeminal nucleus caudalis and C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> regions in the medullary and cervical spinal cord (TCC), and its peripheral afferent projections mainly from the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve to the cranial blood vessels and other cranial structures, including the pain-sensitive dura mater. There is also a reflex connection from the trigeminal nucleus to the parasympathetic outflow to the craniovasculature (gray neuron) known as the trigeminal autonomic reflex arc, via the superior salivatory nucleus (SuS), which is the origin of cells of the parasympathetic vasodilator pathway. The parasympathetic projection to the craniovasculature is predominantly via the greater petrosal nerve branch (green) and the facial nerve (purple) and its synapse with the sphenopalatine (SPG, pterygopalatine – in human) ganglion. Electrical stimulation (ES) of the dural vasculature causes activation of the dural blood vessels, neuronal activation of the TCC and the SuS.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0333102412472071-fig1.tif"/>

<sec id="sec3-0333102412472071"><title>Sterile neurogenic inflammation</title>
<p>Given the hypothesis that migraine and other headache disorders are believed to involve activation of the trigeminovascular system, preclinical assays were developed to demonstrate this activation; it was believed that the changes that took place in animals were similar to those during primary headaches. Originally, studies that concentrated on understanding the anatomy and pharmacology of nociceptive activation of the trigeminovascular system used stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion. Trigeminal ganglion stimulation in animals and humans results in increase in cerebral blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0333102412472071">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0333102412472071">20</xref>), facial flushing and increase in skin temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0333102412472071">21</xref>) and an increase in the concentration of CGRP and substance P levels in the external jugular vein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0333102412472071">22</xref>). Additionally in rats, trigeminal ganglion stimulation results in dural neurogenic plasma protein extravasation (PPE) and vasodilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0333102412472071">23**</xref>). This led to the hypothesis that the initial trigger for migraine may be a sterile inflammatory response at the level of the dura mater, as a consequence of the release of substance P and neurokinin A, causing an increase in vascular permeability and activation of trigeminal afferents to stimulate the trigeminovascular system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0333102412472071">24</xref>). This hypothesis was supported largely by the fact that anti-migraine treatments, ergot alkaloids and sumatriptan, were effective at inhibiting dural neurogenic PPE in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0333102412472071">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0333102412472071">26</xref>). However, the subsequent development and failure of specific extravasation antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0333102412472071">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0333102412472071">28</xref>) and neurokinin 1 receptor antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0333102412472071">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0333102412472071">30</xref>) based on this hypothesis has somewhat damaged this idea. The role of dural neurogenic PPE has recently been reviewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0333102412472071">31</xref>), and it is hard to sustain an argument that it plays an important role in migraine neurobiology.</p>
<p>While the use of trigeminal ganglion stimulation as a model of migraine is considered somewhat redundant today, the research that was conducted during the 1980s and early 1990s was crucial in improving our understanding of the anatomy and pharmacology of the trigeminovascular system, as well as proving an important screen for the development of the 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub>, “triptan”, class of drugs. It was also the first assay to demonstrate neuronal activation at the level of the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0333102412472071">32**</xref>), using Fos immunoreactivity as a marker of activation and it is information that still guides us today.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0333102412472071"><title>Trigeminovascular dural nociception</title>
<p>As models of PPE and the use of trigeminal ganglion stimulation have slowly decreased in headache research, methods that activate trigeminovascular afferents via stimulation or manipulation of the dura mater have somewhat taken over. Many similarities between responses after dural manipulation techniques and migraine have been demonstrated. The dura mater is considered far more nociceptive specific, and in the cat stimulation of the superior sagittal sinus, whose stimulation causes pain in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0333102412472071">33</xref>), produces greater increases in cerebral blood flow than trigeminal ganglion stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0333102412472071">34</xref>). Moreover, stimulation of the superior sagittal sinus also produces release of CGRP via trigeminal neurons and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0333102412472071">35**</xref>), presumably via activation of parasympathetic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0333102412472071">36</xref>). Interestingly, during severe migraine only increases of CGRP in the extracerebral vasculature have been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0333102412472071">37**</xref>), while VIP is additionally released during various trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0333102412472071">37**</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0333102412472071"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0333102412472071"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0333102412472071">40</xref>). There is one study that shows an exception to this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0333102412472071">41**</xref>), where CGRP levels were not raised in patients with less developed migraine. It is noteworthy that during the studies exploring PPE, systemic application of substance P, neurokinin A and capsaicin were all able to induce PPE in the dura mater in rodents, whereas CGRP was the only molecule unable to demonstrate a PPE response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0333102412472071">23**</xref>). These studies taken together illustrate the importance of CGRP in migraine and the dural trigeminovascular nociception assay and why this assay may offer greater similarities in exploring pathophysiological mechanisms of migraine than the PPE assay.</p>
<p>Studies that use the dural vasculature as a means to activate trigeminovascular nociceptive neurons have allowed us to more fully characterize the anatomy of the trigeminovascular system and ascending projections that may be involved in migraine pathophysiology. This anatomy has been thoroughly described and reviewed in previous articles and therefore will not be covered here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0333102412472071">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0333102412472071">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0333102412472071">43</xref>). In brief, though, stimulation of dural structures results in activation in the TCC and areas of the brainstem and diencephalon. This is important because as advanced technologies have allowed us to image patients’ brains during spontaneous and triggered migraine (see the review article in this special issue on “Pearls and pitfalls and imaging in headache”), there is a clear correlation with what is observed during migraine with what we know from animal models that use stimulation of the nociceptive-specific craniovasculature to activate the trigeminovascular system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0333102412472071"><title>Dural electrical stimulation</title>
<p>Dural electrical stimulation takes advantage of the evidence that dural structures including the superior sagittal sinus and middle meningeal artery (MMA) are richly innervated by a plexus of largely unmyelinated nerve fibers from the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal ganglion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0333102412472071">44</xref>). Therefore, electrical stimulation of the vascular structures they innervate has been used to produce antidromic stimulation of the peripheral projection of the trigeminal nerve, and orthodromic stimulation of the central projection to the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0333102412472071">Figure 1</xref>). There are various techniques that have been used to observe the responses of trigeminovascular nociception, which include intravital microscopy and blood flow monitoring at the level of the dural vasculature, and for neuronal responses electrophysiology and immunoreactivity of the early gene <italic>c-fos</italic> mRNA and its product Fos protein, which is a nuclear protein rapidly activated after neuronal activation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0333102412472071"><title>Pearls of measuring changes in the cranial vasculature</title>
<p>Electrical stimulation of the dural vasculature and activation of the trigeminal nerve causes the release of vasoactive neuropeptides and subsequent changes in caliber of the vessels and blood flow. It is thought that during migraine activation of this peripheral afferent projection, the subsequent release of vasoactive peptides can cause vasodilation of cerebral and cranial blood vessels, which may contribute to further nociceptive transmission via activation of the trigeminal afferent projections to the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0333102412472071">45</xref>). This process can result in pain, or the perception of pain, as the sensory information is processed in higher-pain processing centers. Measuring the changes to the vasculature as an indication of activation of the trigeminal nerve provides considerable utility in identifying receptors that are capable of modulating nociceptive stimuli that are clinically relevant. The two methods used, intravital microscopy and laser Doppler flowmetry, vary slightly but carry many similarities.</p>
<sec id="sec7-0333102412472071"><title>Intravital microscopy</title>
<p>Intravital microscopy was developed by Williamson and colleagues and uses a thinned closed cranial window with video microscopy to visualize the dural and pial blood vessels, and allows direct measurement of changes to the diameter of the blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0333102412472071">46**</xref>). Most commonly in rats, the MMA, or a branch of it, is measured. Placing bipolar stimulating electrodes onto the dural surface near to the MMA, but not touching it, and applying a nociceptive stimulus with electrical current (usually 10 Hz, 1–5 ms duration with 0.1–0.3 mA, equivalent to 30–50 V) causes a rapid and reproducible vasodilation of the dural meningeal blood vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0333102412472071">Figure 2A</xref>). Maximum vasodilation can take up to 30 s, and slowly over several minutes the vessel caliber returns to baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0333102412472071">Figure 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0333102412472071">47**</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0333102412472071"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0333102412472071">49</xref>). It is thought that the vasodilation during neurogenic dural vasodilation is driven by local release of CGRP from activated nociceptive Aδ-fibers that innervate the dural vasculature, at the level of the vessel, by activating CGRP receptors on the smooth muscle of the vessel causing vasodilation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0333102412472071">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, while intravenous administration of vasodilator agents CGRP, substance P and neurokinin A are also able to evoke vasodilation of the meningeal vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0333102412472071">46**</xref>), only systemic administration of CGRP antagonists, CGRP<sub>8–37</sub> or olcegepant, are able to significantly attenuate the neurogenic dural vasodilation response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0333102412472071">Figure 2D</xref>), whereas NK<sub>1</sub> antagonists are ineffective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0333102412472071">47**</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0333102412472071">49</xref>). This matches the clinical evidence that NK<sub>1</sub> antagonists demonstrate no clinical efficacy in either the acute or preventive treatment of migraine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0333102412472071">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0333102412472071">30</xref>), while CGRP antagonists are extremely effective in the acute treatment of migraine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0333102412472071">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0333102412472071">51**</xref>). The neurogenic dural vasodilation assay (or transcranial electrical stimulation assay) has also been able to predict the clinical efficacy of the 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> agonists, “triptan,” class of drugs, which must serve as the gold standard for any preclinical assay, as well as dihydroergotamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0333102412472071">47**</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0333102412472071">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0333102412472071">53</xref>), which are thought to inhibit the pre-synaptic release of CGRP from the peripheral afferent trigeminal nerve terminal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0333102412472071">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0333102412472071">C</xref>). There are also other compounds that inhibit neurogenic dural vasodilation and are clinically effective, including µ-opioid receptor antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0333102412472071">54</xref>), nitric oxide synthase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0333102412472071">48</xref>) as well as the migraine-preventive topiramate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0333102412472071">55</xref>). This assay has been used to screen novel compounds, which may prove in the future to have clinical efficacy including cannabinoid CB<sub>1</sub> receptor agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0333102412472071">56</xref>), orexinergic molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0333102412472071">57</xref>) and calcium-activated potassium channel modulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0333102412472071">58</xref>). It has also helped dissect the varied pharmacology of the trigeminovascular system at the peripheral neuromuscular junction and therefore mechanisms that may underlie migraine, as well as identifying the actions of known and novel therapeutic compounds.

<sec id="sec8-0333102412472071"><title>Laser Doppler flowmetry</title>
<p>Laser Doppler flowmetry is a very similar technique to intravital microscopy, but uses the measurement of changes in meningeal blood flow as an indication of activation of the trigeminovascular system, and it is essentially an indirect measure of vessel caliber. It was a precursor to intravital microscopy, using an open cranial window, with laser Doppler probes placed at the MMA to record changes in flow. Similar methods have used stimulation of the dural vasculature using electrical current (2–20 Hz, 0.5 ms, 10–20 V for 30 s) to cause a reproducible increase in meningeal blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0333102412472071">59</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0333102412472071"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0333102412472071">61**</xref>). These increases are attenuated by the administration of 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> receptor agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0333102412472071">59</xref>), CGRP receptor antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0333102412472071">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0333102412472071">61**</xref>) and nitric oxide synthase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0333102412472071">62</xref>), similar to neurogenic dural vasodilation.

<sec id="sec9-0333102412472071"><title>Pitfalls of measuring changes in the craniovasculature</title>
<p>Detailed methods for each assay and equipment used are outlined in the original articles and should be referred to; however, there are further considerations and cautions that experimenters should be aware of during these procedures. Any in vivo anesthetized procedure requires adequate anesthetic and reliable methods to assess the anesthesia depth and animal physiology; we refer the reader to the literature for detailed accounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0333102412472071">64</xref>). Measuring changes in the craniovasculature as a response to trigeminovascular activation can be very much affected by the cardiovasculature of each animal. Changes in blood pressure, either up or down, can alter both blood flow and vessel caliber, with increases in blood pressure often resulting in compensatory vasoconstriction and reduced blood flow, while decreases in blood pressure result in vasodilation and increase in blood flow. Likewise if the temperature of the animal is not regulated properly, the vessel size can change. It is therefore necessary to provide adequate and stable anesthesia throughout to maintain stable physiological parameters over the course of the study and have methods to continuously assess vital physiology, such as blood pressure and ventilation. Further, there has not been a systematic approach to study the effect of different kinds of anesthetics on the cranial vasculature per se, and in general different labs use different anesthetic approaches. In the published literature barbiturates, pentobarbital and thiopental, the hypnotic propofol, and urethane have all been used and demonstrate reliable vasodilation in response to chemical vasodilators and stimulation of peripheral trigeminal afferents, although it may be difficult to compare results with different anesthetics as the independent effects of each is unknown. Surgically the techniques differ in that intravital microscopy uses a closed cranial window whereas laser Doppler measurement has used an open window. A closed window is certainly more physiological; it is less likely to activate and irritate trigeminal afferents as a consequence of removal of the bone and less likely to create bleeding. Indeed anecdotal reports from Dr. Williamson during the development of the intravital assay state that measurement of vessel caliber with an open window was difficult because the blood vessels would remain dilated throughout the study. This might imply the peripheral afferent trigeminal nerve endings are irritated and there is release of neuropeptides beyond what might be induced by the assay itself, and therefore the vessel caliber cannot be adequately controlled. Therefore it is crucial that the skull not be broken during surgery as this is likely to induce excessive vasodilation. Recent improvements to the methods have used a combination of both intravital microscopy and laser Doppler flowmetry measurement, with a closed cranial window. Results show increases in blood flow with transcranial stimulation, but they do not achieve the same level of increase as in the open window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0333102412472071">49</xref>), although lower current intensity was used. The open-window approach does offer one major advantage over the closed-window method, where substances can be applied locally to the dura mater to determine their effects on blood flow or blood vessel caliber. During trigeminal nerve stimulation, release of vasodilator peptides is locally at the level of the dura mater, and this does not affect the systemic cardiovasculature, therefore studies to understand only the local effects of these vasodilator peptides are helpful and use local dural application. However, the closed-window approach more often needs to use systemic administration of vasodilator peptides, as these molecules have little or no effect when administered locally to the cranium. Systemic application will inevitably affect the whole body, something that is unlikely to occur during their release in migraine. This method can produce profound cardiovascular affects that significantly alter dural blood flow and caliber and confound the observations made on the dural vasculature. More recently, though, intra-carotid injections have been demonstrated to significantly reduce these cardiovascular affects. On the other hand, with local open-window application these molecules have been demonstrated to be potent vasodilators, have no impact of the cardiovasculature, and perhaps more appropriately reflect their local release during trigeminovascular nerve activation and their possible release during migraine.</p>
<p>It is important to conduct the surgery carefully, and to minimize the amount of drilling used. Drilling will inevitably activate the peripheral trigeminal afferents and cause vasodilation in itself, so a rest period of an hour is recommended before experimentation begins. Also, care needs to be taken to prevent bleeding on the skull and over the dura mater. These bleeds can irritate and sensitize nerve endings, resulting in excessive vasodilation and a blood flow increase that does not recover. Bleeding from the skull during the preparation and drying out of the tissue during the course of the experiment can be reduced by application of bone wax to the skull, and hydration of the closed cranial window can be maintained under warm mineral oil. Finally, care needs to be taken with the placement of the bipolar stimulating electrodes. It is very important that once baselines are established that the same level of current be applied to the skull or dura mater each time. Placing the electrodes in an area free from blood and interstitial fluid will reduce changes in electrical current level applied and maintain consistency of response. The electrode should be placed so it is neither over the artery nor depressing the skull, which could impair dural blood flow. To check that a good contact between the skull and the electrode has been made, the cranial window should be stimulated with single pulses (10 V, 5 Hz 1–5 ms) and the delivered current can be calculated using an oscilloscope that measures the voltage drop across a 1 kΩ resistor in parallel, so that a 20 mV deflection represents current delivered to the skull of about 20 mA. If a poor connection between the electrode and skull is observed by high impedance, the electrode should be repositioned on the skull, or further drilling performed if it was considered the skull thickness is the cause of the poor contact.</p>

<sec id="sec10-0333102412472071"><title>The future</title>
<p>These assays provide a very good method for understanding the pharmacology of the peripheral junction of the trigeminal nerve and have proved to be excellent predictors of clinical efficacy, particularly for predicting the clinical efficacy of acute therapeutics, with an action thought to be in the trigeminovascular system. Migraine is thought of as a disorder of the brain, and therapeutic molecules that get into the brain are likely to be more clinically effective. This assay may therefore appear to be less relevant than neuronal methods described below. However, the importance of the cranial vasculature and the role of vasodilation and activation of meningeal nociceptors from the periphery in activating the trigeminovascular system are still hotly debated. Improved methods that have combined measurements of the craniovasculature alongside neuronal techniques provide interesting and conflicting results about the importance of the vessels and CGRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0333102412472071">65**</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0333102412472071">66**</xref>). There is also one example of neurogenic dural blood vessel changes in wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0333102412472071">67**</xref>), which opens up the possibility of studies in transgenic mouse migraine models in the future. These techniques are complicated in the smaller animals, and the dural blood vessels much less responsive, but mouse models can still provide a gateway to a better understanding of migraine mechanisms that we do not have with rats. It is certain that these methods will continue in the future and they serve as an excellent assay to screen novel targets of the trigeminovascular system, and particularly molecules that do not to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). They will continue to help us explore the importance of the vasculature and brain in the pathophysiology of migraine.</p>

<sec id="sec11-0333102412472071"><title>Pearls of measuring changes in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis and brain</title>
<p>It seems clear now that migraine is primarily a disorder of the brain. This includes not only the maintenance of migraine pain but also, more importantly, the initiation of a migraine attack. Experimental evidence from imaging studies in humans and experimental animals, as well as clinical symptoms such as the premonitory symptoms, which may appear 24–48 hours prior to migraine pain and therefore long before a migraine aura starts – in the case of migraine with aura – seem to confirm the importance of central processes in migraine. The TCC in the brain is a key relay center of the trigeminovascular system involved in the transmission of nociceptive information from the head and cranial vasculature to the brainstem and higher pain processing structures. Therefore measuring changes of neuronal activity in this structure in response to dural nociceptive stimulation is an attractive approach to study pathophysiological mechanisms and potential therapeutic agents in migraine. Neuronal activity in the TCC can be measured with indirect measurements, such as the analysis of Fos immunoreactivity, or with direct electrophysiological recordings placing an electrode directly in the relevant nucleus in the brainstem and measuring neuronal activity.</p>
<sec id="sec12-0333102412472071"><title>Fos immunoreactivity</title>
<p>Fos protein is the product of the <italic>c-fos</italic> gene, a nuclear protein that regulates the transcription of other target genes. Fos was first isolated directly from human tumors and therefore is categorized as an oncogene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0333102412472071">68**</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0333102412472071">69</xref>). <italic>c-Fos</italic> is classified as an immediate-early gene as it is rapidly activated by a variety of stimuli including neuronal depolarization and neurotransmitters and transiently expressed in a variety of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0333102412472071">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0333102412472071">70</xref>). Its activation occurs within five mins and continues for 15–20 mins, and the synthesis of Fos protein follows mRNA expression and is detectable within 30 mins and is continuously expressed as long as the stimulus remains. Depolarization activates membrane receptors that initiate a second messenger cascade that induces long-term neuronal changes. Activation of the secondary messenger system results in the up-regulation of the immediate-early genes, including <italic>c-fos,</italic> which produces transcription factors including the <italic>c-fos</italic> protein, Fos. Fos is then transported to the nucleus, where it forms a heterodimeric complex with <italic>c-jun</italic> transcription factor, which in turn binds to the AP-1 DNA site and modulates the function of the late response genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0333102412472071">Figure 3</xref>). Fos protein has a half-life of two hours when the stimulus ceases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0333102412472071">71</xref>), but the time of expression of Fos depends on the stimulus and species investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0333102412472071">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0333102412472071">73</xref>). Therefore it is important prior to the study to understand the process and timing of when it will be optimal to detect a Fos signal in the study. The Fos protein is normally visualized using immunocytochemical techniques. Fos protein is a normal protein that can be observed at low levels in many cell types, including neurons and glia, and many studies show that Fos immunoreactivity can be used as a marker of nociception in the nociceptive-specific laminae of the spinal cord. Intuitively higher counts of Fos immunoreactive cells is indicative of higher neuronal activation, although a lack of Fos does not necessarily mean lack of neuronal activation, as in some cases other secondary messenger pathways are relevant. For example, staining for cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-responsive element binding protein (CREB) is often considered a more reliable marker in the trigeminal ganglion than Fos. Electrical, mechanical and chemical stimulation of dural structures result in Fos immunoreactivity in the TCC nociceptive-specific laminae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0333102412472071">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0333102412472071">74**</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0333102412472071">75**</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0333102412472071">76**</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0333102412472071">77**</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0333102412472071"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0333102412472071"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0333102412472071"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0333102412472071">81</xref>).

<sec id="sec13-0333102412472071"><title>Electrophysiological recordings within the TCC</title>
<p>Electrophysiological techniques provide a direct measure of neuronal activation and are a real-time assessment of these changes. These studies use lower stimulation thresholds to observe the responses of a depolarized nociceptive nerve fiber compared to observing Fos immunoreactivity, and therefore perhaps provide a more physiological approach. The surgery necessary for electrophysiological recording of neuronal activity requires exposure of brainstem areas, including the TCC, with careful dissection. After removal of the dura mater, a thin tungsten or stainless steel electrode with an impedance of 0.5–1.0 MΩ is placed in the TCC. One of the advantages of electrophysiology is that during the experiment one can assess the general placement of the electrode in the anatomical area of the trigeminal nucleus by assessing the cutaneous and dural receptive field response to brushing and pinching, due to the well-described somatotopical organization of the trigeminal nerve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0333102412472071">Figure 4</xref>). In general the rostral-most portion, nearest the pons, of the trigeminal nucleus is more responsive to innocuous inputs than noxious, while the caudal portion is more nociceptive specific (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0333102412472071">Figure 4A</xref>). Electrical stimulation of the dura mater provides a nociceptive-specific input to the TCC, and this explains why electrophysiological recording in the TCC take places predominantly in caudal regions of the trigeminal nucleus, as well as the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> regions of the spinal cord. While the trigeminal nucleus does follow the curvature of the outer surface of the medulla, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0333102412472071">Figure 4A</xref>, in general the dorsal-most portion of the trigeminal nucleus reflects mainly innervations from the V3 (mandibular) region of the trigeminal nerve. Moving ventrally through the nucleus is the V2 (maxillary) innervation of the trigeminal nerve, which reflects mainly the middle portion of the face including the nose and just below the eye. Finally, the V1 (ophthalmic) division of the trigeminal nerve, which predominantly innervates the area above the eye, including the intracranial dura mater, is found in the most ventral region of the dorsal horn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0333102412472071">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0333102412472071">B</xref>). It is important to note that these boundaries are not clearly separated, as there is overlap between the specific divisions of the trigeminal nerve and the regions of the face, head and intracranial structures that they innervate. The recorded signal is a result of neuronal activity of a cluster of neurons. The size of the clusters of neurons very much depends on the size of the tip and the impedance of the recording electrode. A smaller tip very often results in higher impedance of the electrode and translates into a smaller cluster of cells involved in the recorded signal. Most frequently wide-dynamic range (WDR) neurons are analyzed that respond to noxious pinch and innocuous brush in the receptive fields of facial branches of the trigeminal nerve, as well as a nociceptive signal from the dura mater. The experimental setup allows recording of neuronal background activity and thereby also offers the possibility to analyze neuronal sensitization or the expansion of a receptive field throughout the course of an experiment. This subject is covered in more detail in “Pearls and pitfalls of experimental in vivo studies in headache: Peripheral and central sensitization.” However, for the analysis of trigeminal activation with respect to headache research, the recording of stimulus-evoked activity of Aδ- and C-fibers is more specific as it more closely resembles the biochemical changes that occur during migraine, and the pharmacology of therapeutics have been shown to reliably affect these responses. Therefore, dural electrical stimulation offers some advantages over assays that record background activity and observe changes in response to chemical manipulation of the dura mater and the consequent sensitization of the trigeminovascular system, although these methods still have an important place in migraine research. In this model a cranial window is drilled and a bipolar stimulating electrode is placed proximate to the MMA to activate the trigeminal nerve fibers that innervate this vascular body during electrical stimulation. Usually the electrical stimulus consists of a series of square wave pulses (for example 20 pulses with a frequency of 0.5 Hz) each with up to 0.5 ms duration and a voltage that usually ranges between 5 and 15 V. Post-stimulus histograms (PSTH) are then established from the recorded signal in the TCC. Depending on the delay between the electrical stimulation of the dura mater and the response elicited in the TCC, cells are differentiated into neurons receiving either Aδ- or C-fiber inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0333102412472071">Figure 4C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0333102412472071">90**</xref>). The advantage of this method lies in the fact that it directly analyzes central neuronal activity with a relatively low variability of the recorded signal, resulting in a lower number of experimental animals necessary. Furthermore, recordings allow an objective and observer-independent analysis of the data. This highly reliable in vivo model has been used for testing a broad range of compounds potentially effective in migraine treatment, such as the “triptans” and dihydroergotamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0333102412472071">91**,92**,93**</xref>) and CGRP receptor antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0333102412472071">94</xref>). It has also predicted the failure of NK<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0333102412472071">84</xref>) and extravasation inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0333102412472071">95**</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0333102412472071">96</xref>). Dural electrical stimulation and electrophysiological recording is now used as a common assay to screen anti-migraine efficacy of novel molecules and to help understand the pathophysiology of migraine and other primary headache disorders.

<sec id="sec15-0333102412472071"><title>Fos immunoreactivity</title>
<p>Measurement of Fos immunoreactivity is the simplest method of quantifying neuronal activity but has substantial shortcomings. First of all, compared to electrophysiological recordings, it is only an indirect measurement as Fos expression is a result of neuronal activity. Fos expression is considered to be highly unspecific since many factors can induce its expression and the minimal nociceptive signal necessary to produce a Fos immunoreactive signal is undefined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0333102412472071">97</xref>), and responses are not in real time. Therefore meticulous control of the depth of anesthesia is required to avoid Fos expression as a result of surgery-induced pain. We further recommend the use of locally applied lidocaine before making skin incisions as these can already induce a substantial amount of Fos expression in the areas of interest. One of the major limitations of the Fos technique is the assessment of a Fos cell. There are established published criteria for assessing Fos cells; essentially cells are considered positive if they are stained as dark brown or black (when using the DAB/Nickel method), round or ovoid structures with variable degree of staining intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0333102412472071">87</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0333102412472071"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0333102412472071"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0333102412472071"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0333102412472071"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0333102412472071"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0333102412472071"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0333102412472071"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0333102412472071"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0333102412472071"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0333102412472071"/>**,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0333102412472071">98</xref>). Furthermore the dark stained nuclei of Fos-positive cells have to be clearly distinguishable from non-specific background staining in a magnification range of ×4 to ×20, using a light microscope, to be considered as positive. However, this judgment is extremely subjective despite having these standard guidelines and therefore results vary significantly between animals, and counting suffers from a significant observer-dependent bias. To ensure a reliable interpretation, the counters should be blinded to the treatment groups and at least two independent counters should analyze the tissue sections. In addition, the high variation in cell counting frequently requires a high number of experimental animals to ensure reliable results and interpretations. Finally, due to these methodological weaknesses the results do not allow quantification in exact numbers that correlate in a linear pattern with increasing neuronal activity. They allow only an ordinal interpretation. Therefore only non-parametric statistics should be used for data analysis.</p>

<sec id="sec16-0333102412472071"><title>Electrophysiological recording</title>
<p>Electrophysiological techniques have many benefits over using the Fos method as a marker of neuronal activation. It is a direct measurement of neuronal changes, and the exact dynamics of the stimulus are known that create a neuronal nociceptive signal. In general the signal necessary to evoke a nociceptive response is considerably less than required in Fos studies. It is also a real-time assessment of neuronal activity changes. Despite being one of the most reliable and predictive models for headache research, electrophysiological recordings have their pitfalls. Electrophysiological recordings require expensive equipment and a substantial amount of training until useful data acquisition can be achieved. One of the main practical issues that affect the outcome is noise from surrounding equipment. Therefore meticulous care should be exerted in establishing good insulation throughout the whole experimental setup as well as removal of unnecessary electrical equipment. Moreover, the minimum level of surgery to provide adequate exposure of targets sites should be performed to prevent extensive skin and muscle lesions as well as bleeding, which may sensitize neurons and as a consequence lead to an increase in background activity that might significantly affect stimulus-evoked recordings. The animal should be given time to rest after surgery before experimentation begins, usually an hour. This allows time for recovery of cells after surgery and for physiological parameters to stabilize. As always, maintaining stable anesthesia and having a measure of physiological output will aid the success of experiments, as one can respond to subtle changes quickly. Movement of the experimental setup or animal should be avoided since minuscule movements at the spinal cord can change the location of the recording electrode, leading to a different response or even complete loss of the neuronal activity of the recorded cluster of cells. Care should also be taken to avoid fluid accumulation in the cranial window where the stimulating electrode is placed. Fluid accumulation leads to a spread of the applied current leading to a loss of signal and/or stimulation of the surrounding muscles affecting the recorded signal or even leading to muscular movements that might alter the position of the recording electrode. To prevent fluid accumulation or drying out of the dura mater, a few drops of mineral oil should be applied on the cranial window. If muscular contraction cannot be avoided, the use of a neuromuscular blocker such as pancuronium bromide can be considered; this will also prevent movement artifacts at the level of the recording electrode. However, in this case even more precautions should be taken to ensure a sufficient and constant depth of anesthesia. As mentioned above, it is of crucial importance that the vital parameters (blood pressure, temperature, etc.) be kept at constant physiological levels as, for example, a relatively small reduction of blood pressure can induce a significant reduction of neuronal activity. Finally, it is recommended that several methods be used in parallel to ensure reliable and interpretable results. For example, if only receptive field analysis is performed the results are less reliable since even when using von Frey hairs as a standardized stimulus, it is very difficult to always apply the tactile stimulus at a comparable pressure and duration. Moreover, the simple approximation with the hand and the brush or von Frey tool to the recording electrode usually causes noise that might significantly affect the small effects that this stimulation induces per se. Therefore, measurement of (electrical) stimulus-evoked activity in conjunction with background activity in the TCC is probably the most accurate and reliable method of trigeminal activation for headache research.</p>

<sec id="sec17-0333102412472071"><title>Measuring neuropeptide changes</title>
<p>Neuropeptides, especially CGRP, are of crucial importance in the pathophysiology of migraine. The discovery of elevated plasma levels of only CGRP during severe migraine by Goadsby et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0333102412472071">37**</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0333102412472071">99</xref>), which return to normal levels after sumatriptan administration, has greatly enhanced the understanding of migraine. Interestingly, experimental animal models that used dural electrical stimulation demonstrate clear correlation with this, with release of CGRP, alongside vasoactive intestinal peptide, important in TACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0333102412472071">35**</xref>), while trigeminal ganglion stimulation in humans and cats caused CGRP release but also the NK<sub>1</sub> agonist, substance P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0333102412472071">22**</xref>). Following this, studies have demonstrated that infusion of human CGRP triggers migraine attacks in migraineurs in the same pattern and time frame as nitric oxide donors do, which is the induction of an immediate headache followed by a delayed migraine-like headache (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0333102412472071">100**</xref>). Despite its strong vasodilatory effects, probably central neuronal actions of CGRP are of crucial importance in the pathophysiology of migraine. In experimental in vivo models, Storer et al. demonstrated that microiontophoresed CGRP onto TCC neurons increase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0333102412472071">94</xref>). The ongoing pursuit over the last 20 years to understand the exact role of CGRP in the pathophysiology of migraine and its effects on the trigeminovascular system culminated in the development of CGRP receptor antagonists, and the proof of concept of their clinical efficacy was proven in a clinical trial using the intravenously administered CGRP receptor antagonist BIBN4096BS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0333102412472071">51**</xref>). Therefore, since CGRP is released into the extracerebral circulation upon trigeminal activation, measuring CGRP levels in plasma is an obvious approach for in vivo models in headache research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec18-0333102412472071"><title>Pitfalls of measuring neuropeptide changes</title>
<p>Despite the positive clinical and experimental studies, measurement of CGRP has been proven to be more difficult and less reliable for the prediction of potential migraine treatments than initially thought and is covered in greater detail in “Pearls and pitfalls of neuropeptide studies of headache.” The release of CGRP during spontaneous migraine attacks has been the subject of controversial discussions. However, discrepancies in the published data may be related to difficulties in probe handling and analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0333102412472071">101**</xref>). CGRP has a very short half-life of a few minutes. Therefore, immediately after blood sampling the plasma needs to be cooled and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), as well as protease and peptidase inhibitors (for example, aprotinin), have to be added to prevent degradation of the peptide. Blood samples then need to be stored at −80°C until further processing. Another difficulty lies in the fact that the increase of CGRP concentration in plasma is relatively small and suffers from significant inter-individual variations, requiring a high sample number and a sensitive assay for probe analysis. This problem is further aggravated if blood samples are taken from distal sites such as the radial or femoral artery as the small amounts of released CGRP get further diluted. Furthermore, it is not known at which point during a spontaneous migraine attack CGRP concentrations increase in the extracerebral circulation and how long the increase lasts, hampering an adequate sample collection. This may explain the negative results of Tvedskov et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0333102412472071">41**</xref>), analyzing CGRP concentrations in spontaneous migraine attacks, since in this study blood samples were drawn many hours after the initiation of the painful phase of the migraine attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0333102412472071">41**</xref>).</p>
<p>In animal models, CGRP measurement has further difficulties. Electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion does induce CGRP release but applying such a strong stimulus into the trigeminal ganglion probably induces mechanisms that are not necessarily important in spontaneous migraine attacks. This is demonstrated by the fact that substance P and neurokinin A are also released, but not during migraine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0333102412472071">22**</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0333102412472071">37**</xref>). Hence the dural electrical stimulation method does seem optimal, as it demonstrates clear translational response and predicts the clinical failure of NK<sub>1</sub> antagonists and extravasation inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0333102412472071">102</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0333102412472071">103</xref>). In general, stimulus-induced CGRP release is short lasting, peaking within a few minutes after stimulation, making sample collection even more difficult. Furthermore, in rodent plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) the CGRP concentration ranges are close to the sensitivity levels of commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Due to the required volume for analysis, CSF samples and plasma samples in mice need to be diluted to achieve the necessary amount. However, the dilution makes analytic results less exact, and if they fall below the detection limit of the kit, even impossible to assess. Commercially available radioimmunoassay (RIA) kits have a slightly better sensitivity but include all the pitfalls as well as regulatory and safety issues that come along with handling radioactive substances.</p>
<p>Finally, from a pathophysiological standpoint it has to be considered that evidence suggests that CGRP does not cross the BBB as its infusion induces a dilatation of the MMA but not of the MCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0333102412472071">104</xref>). Therefore, if the BBB remains intact, which might be questioned in spontaneous migraine attacks, can it be evaluated in the experimental setting? CGRP measured in the extracerebral circulation must originate from the peripheral parts of the trigeminal system. However, since CGRP does not activate peripheral meningeal afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0333102412472071">65**</xref>) and local application of a CGRP receptor antagonist onto the dura mater does not affect spinal trigeminal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0333102412472071">105</xref>), its peripheral site of action is probably not important for the generation of migraine. Therefore, interpretations on the basis of CGRP release in the extracerebral circulation have to be taken with caution.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec19-0333102412472071"><title>The future</title>
<p>The measurement of functional changes in the TCC will continue to be an outstanding tool for further understanding of the pathophysiology of migraine and for the screening of potential anti-migraine drugs. In that sense direct electrophysiological recordings are clearly superior to the measurement of Fos immunoreactivity. Electrophysiological studies are and will continue to gain importance as migraine is more and more seen as a disorder of central origin rather than being the result of peripheral or vascular events. The dissection of peripheral versus central effects of tested compounds recordings within the TCC will complement intravital microscopy, which clearly addresses peripheral parts of the trigeminovascular system. Analysis of neuropeptides will probably focus mainly on CGRP, as the other neuropeptides are of only secondary importance.</p>
