<abstract>
<p>Urban environments typically experience increased average air temperatures compared to surrounding rural areas – a phenomenon referred to as the Urban Heat Island (UHI). The impact of the UHI on comfort in naturally ventilated buildings is the main focus of this article. The overheating risk in urban buildings is likely to be exacerbated in the future as a result of the combined effect of the UHI and climate change.</p>
<p>In the design of such buildings in London, the usual current practice is to view the use of one generic weather file as being adequate to represent external temperatures. However, the work reported here demonstrates that there is a considerable difference between the overheating performance of a standard building at different sites within London. This implies, for example, that a building may wrongly pass or fail criteria used to demonstrate compliance with building regulations as a result of an inappropriate generic weather file being used. The work thus has important policy implications.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Practical application:</italic></bold> The Greater London Authority has recently developed, with the Chartered Institute of Building Services Engineers, guidance for developers to address the risk of overheating in buildings via the provision of weather files for London relating to three zones. While such an initiative is welcomed, it may be that a weather file <italic>tailored</italic> to the building location would be preferable. Of course, this would add further complexity to the process and a view would have to be taken as the viability of such an approach. The work presented in this article, however, suggests that serious consideration should be given to the use of tailored weather data for regulatory purposes.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0143624411416064"><title>1 Background</title>
<p>Urban environments typically experience increased average air temperatures compared to surrounding rural areas. This phenomenon is referred to as the Urban Heat Island (UHI) and arises due to the radiative, thermal, moisture and aerodynamic properties of urban environments differing from their rural counterparts. The phenomenon is usually quantified by the Urban Heat Island Intensity (UHII), defined as the difference between urban and background temperatures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143624411416064">1</xref></sup> Much work carried out to date has focused on the effect of UHI on the energy demand of buildings within cities.<sup>2</sup> However, in addition to HVAC energy demands, the UHI also has implications for <italic>comfort</italic> in naturally ventilated office buildings – the main focus ofthe work reported here. Usual current practice to inform the design of developments in London is to use one generic weather file (theHeathrow ‘Design Summer Year’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143624411416064">3</xref></sup>) to represent temperatures across London.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0143624411416064"><title>2 Objectives</title>
<p>The main objective of this work is to understand the consequences of using <italic>generic</italic> ratherthan <italic>local</italic> weather data in the thermal design of naturally ventilated office buildings in London. In order to put the scale of this effect into context, we compare it with the impacts of projected climate change and choice of passive ventilation strategy.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0143624411416064"><title>3 The UHI and overheating in non-domestic buildings</title>
<p>This section presents a review of the literature with respect to the UHI and overheating in buildings in heating dominated climates.</p>
<sec id="sec4-0143624411416064"><title>3.1 Factors contributing to UHI</title>
<p>The main factors contributing to the UHI include reduced radiant cooling at night, increased storage of solar energy by building materials, a reduction in evaporation from vegetation and decreased convective heat loss caused by lower wind speeds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143624411416064">1</xref></sup> Anthropogenic heat sources in city centres can also be significant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143624411416064">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The UHII in London varies with distance from the centre, with temperatures typically increasing towards the centre.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143624411416064">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143624411416064">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143624411416064">6</xref></sup> Recent urban climate work carried out by the EPSRC-funded LUCID project (‘the development of a Local Urban Climate for the Intelligent Design of cities’) has further investigated the spatial structure determinants of London's UHI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143624411416064">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143624411416064"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143624411416064"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143624411416064">10</xref></sup> A clear relationship between high UHII values and high urban to rural land use fractions has been demonstrated. It has also been shown that advection effects tend to shift the centre of the UHI. A much stronger relationship between distance and temperature has been reported at night than during the day.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143624411416064">11</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0143624411416064"><title>3.2 Microclimatic effects</title>
<p>In addition to the radial distance from thecentre, microclimatic effects also influence the air temperature at individual sites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143624411416064">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143624411416064">11</xref></sup> Various studies have investigated the influence of urban physical characteristics on theUHI intensity. A study by Kolokotroni and Giridharan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143624411416064">2</xref></sup> investigated the relationship between several physical characteristics and changes in outdoor air temperature in London during the summer months, under a range ofgeographical and climatic conditions. For example, surface albedo is an important variable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143624411416064">2</xref></sup> Urban fabric tends to be characterised by low albedo, therefore absorbing heat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143624411416064">6</xref></sup> and leading to increased temperature. Aspect ratio (height to width ratio of streets) has also been identified as a factor having a significant effecton outdoor air temperature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143624411416064">2</xref></sup> Höppe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143624411416064">12</xref></sup> measured the air temperature at a number of different sites within Berlin and found that surrounding structures have a significant influence on the air temperature at the sites. Temperatures in yards and courtyards were around 3 K higher than temperatures in open sites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143624411416064">12</xref></sup> Smith and Levermore<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143624411416064">6</xref></sup> also reported that building density had a significant effect onUHII.</p>
<p>The presence of water in cities has also been shown to be a key factor,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143624411416064">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143624411416064">13</xref></sup> with areas around water experiencing cooler air temperatures than a street located ∼ 200 m away.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143624411416064">5</xref></sup> Various studies have focused on the effect of vegetation on local temperature, with results indicating that the presence of parks has a significant effect on air temperature in cities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143624411416064">5</xref></sup> The green density ratio (green area to environmental area ratio) was identified as a significant variable in influencing outdoor temperature inLondon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143624411416064">2</xref></sup> A study by Spronken-Smith and Oke<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143624411416064">13</xref></sup> investigated the ‘park cool island’ (PCI) effect. Temperatures in and around various parks in city centres were measured and compared to temperatures in the surrounding built environment. The researchers concluded that the PCI depends on the type and size of parks, and varies with time of day. Under some conditions, the daytime temperature in parks can be up to 5 K lower than in surrounding areas. The effect of PCI on air temperature was shown to be limited to a distance of one park width from the park.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143624411416064">13</xref></sup> In summary, a number of factors, in addition to distance from the city centre, have the potential to have a significant effect on local external temperatures.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0143624411416064"><title>3.3 Effects of local temperatures on building energy demands</title>
<p>In a study on the energy demands in air-conditioned buildings by Kolokotroni et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143624411416064">11</xref></sup> the London UHI was shown to have a positive effect on heating-dominated buildings due tothe lower heating demands during winter. On the other hand, the increased temperaturesin the city centre had a negative effect oncooling-dominated buildings in London. Increased temperatures in urban centres can have a significant effect on the energy required to heat and cool buildings, therefore it was concluded that site location should be taken into consideration by designers when making design estimates for energy consumption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143624411416064">11</xref></sup> Recent work with regard to the heating demand of London's dwellings reached the same conclusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143624411416064">14</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0143624411416064"><title>3.4 Building design strategies to improve thermal comfort</title>
<p>Mechanical cooling is not the ideal way of reducing temperatures in buildings in cities as itrequires energy and produces waste heat thatis emitted into the surrounding environment, thus tending to increase the UHI. Passive cooling strategies therefore have potential advantages and have been employed in buildings in cities, including night cooling coupled with high thermal mass, the effectiveness of which was investigated as part of this work.</p>
<p>Night ventilation has been identified as auseful strategy for cooling office buildings inthe UK. The technique utilizes the typicallyrelatively large diurnal temperature rangeoccurring during summer in the UK. Combining the ventilation strategy with high thermal mass allows the building to absorb internal heat during the day, thus easing internal temperatures, then use cooler night air to reject absorbed heat.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143624411416064">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143624411416064">15</xref></sup> Simulations of typical UK office buildings showed that using optimised ventilation rates, the technique may decrease internal temperatures by around 3°C compared to a building with no night cooling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143624411416064">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>A study by Kolokotroni et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143624411416064">16</xref></sup> investigated the effect of night ventilation on the cooling energy demand of a typical office building situated in various locations across London. The study concluded that using an optimized night cooling strategy would eliminate the need for artificial cooling in a rural office.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143624411416064">16</xref></sup> Other studies have reported that the effectiveness of night ventilation is reduced significantly by the increased temperatures within cities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143624411416064">17</xref></sup> Specific site air temperature therefore needs to be considered when assessing the applicability and potential of passive cooling techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143624411416064">11</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec8-0143624411416064"><title>3.5 Criteria used in assessing indoor thermal comfort</title>
<p>There is currently no single definition of indoor overheating in UK buildings. Hence, there is a multitude of assessment criteria - four of them are briefly summarized below.
<list id="list1-0143624411416064" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Single temperature threshold exceedance: Current UK guidance recommends that operative temperatures in office buildings should not exceed 28°C for more than 1% of occupied hours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143624411416064">3</xref></sup> A key limitation of this approach is that thermal discomfort predictions may be exaggerated in the middle of summer when the population has adapted towarmer weather and 28°C may not appear too hot. On the other hand, overheating may be underestimated in the shoulder months (spring and autumn) when people are likely to find lower temperatures uncomfortable. The effects of short bursts of warm weather when adaptation may not be complete are also likely to be dealt with inadequately.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Degree-hour exceedance: An alternative criterion suggested by Nicol et al<italic>.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143624411416064">18</xref></sup> involves measuring ‘degree-hours’ above a threshold temperature, rather than just the number of hours, thus providing a measure of not only occurrence but also severity of overheating.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Thermal performance during an extreme warm period: A further method to assess thermal comfort is to analyse the internal temperature during the hottest warm period during the year. It has been shown that a very short hot spell can cause greater discomfort than a prolonged warm period as occupants do not have time to adapt to the changing temperatures,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143624411416064">18</xref></sup> therefore it is important to analyse internal air temperatures during short hot periods. This approach also gives an indication of the effectiveness of building design strategies in improving thermal comfort.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Adaptive comfort criterion<italic>:</italic> Other criteria, however, take into consideration the <italic>adaptive</italic> approach to thermal comfort. This approach states that the temperature at which people are most comfortable is related to outdoor conditions. It is therefore assumed that the maximum permissible temperature is also related to external conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0143624411416064">19</xref></sup> Nicol et al<italic>.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143624411416064">18</xref></sup> suggested using the ‘comfort temperature, <italic>Tc</italic>’ when measuring overheating in office buildings.

<p>The comparative assessment of overheating criteria is not the purpose of the present article. Despite being heavily criticized, thesingle temperature exceedance model is commonly used as an overheating criterion by the UK industry. Hence, it has been used as the primary comfort criterion in this study. Nevertheless, a comparison is also made against results obtained by using the adaptivecomfort criterion given its likely future prominence.</p>

<sec id="sec9-0143624411416064"><title>4 Methodology</title>
<sec id="sec10-0143624411416064"><title>4.1 Weather file generation</title>
<p>The study used a series of customized local weather files – relating to both current and projected future urban climates.</p>
<p>(a) Heat island effects: Local hourly temperature data for the period September 1999 – August 2000 for 26 different sites across an East-West transect of the Greater London Area was provided via use of the London Site Specific Air Temperature (LSSAT) model developed by Kolokotroni et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143624411416064">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Monitored data is available for this period but it was necessary to involve the use of a model as there was no <italic>full</italic> relevant set of monitored data available i.e. there were gaps in the records. The LSSAT model used in the work was developed as part of the LUCID project and has been shown to generate localized external air temperature profiles across London with appropriate accuracy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143624411416064">20</xref></sup> Due to the nature of the model (Artificial Neural Network), its predictions are almost identical to the measurements for the period of the monitored data (1999-2000) as this was the period that was used to train the model. The matching of measurements/predictions has been tested extensively for many locations during the development of the LSSAT model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143624411416064">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143624411416064">20</xref></sup> <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values for the relationship between modelled and monitored hourly temperatures of 0.97–0.99 were achieved. The value of <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> for seasonal average temperatures (in the form of HDD and CDH) was even higher – more than 0.99. So, although LSSAT predictions are used for the present work, the data are almost identical to the measurements in this case, because the monitoring period was used for the generation ofthe weather files.</p>
<p>The sites were selected in such a way so as to achieve a wide variety of urban morphologies and resulting local climatic conditions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143624411416064">2</xref></sup> ranging from the densely built area around the British Museum (FW00 and FE00) to thereference rural site in Langley Country Park (WW11). The approximate locations of the temperature measurement sites on the London map are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143624411416064">Figure 1</xref>. Of these sites, 20 were selected for the current study.

<p>The site-specific temperature values were input to the EnergyPlus Weather Converter tool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143624411416064">22</xref></sup> to generate EnergyPlus format local weather files for each site. The study focuses on the impact of external temperature variation on internal temperature. Whilst external temperature is a key factor that influences the thermal performance of a building, an additional set of environmental variables is needed to construct a full EnergyPlus weather file. This includes relative humidity, wind, atmospheric pressure, cloud cover, global and diffuse solar radiation. However, no such monitored or modelled data is available at the required spatial and temporal resolution across London. Thus, the LSSAT site-specific external air temperature predictions were collated with monitored data from the nearest weather stations during the same time period(September 1999–August 2000). This data was made available via the British Atmospheric Data Centre.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143624411416064">23</xref></sup> The only complete relevant and reliable monitored dataset of relative humidity, wind, atmospheric pressure and cloud cover for the given time period was provided by the Met Office London Heathrow weather station. Global and diffuse solar radiation data was provided from the London Weather Centre. Such an approximation is deemed reasonable for the purposes of the study given that (a) relative humidity is not expected to be significant in the calculation of internal temperature and (b) solar radiation is expected to remain reasonably constant across London.</p>
<p>(b) Climate change scenarios: The site-specific weather files were subsequently ‘morphed’ according to the 2050s Medium-High emissions UKCIP02 climate change scenario.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143624411416064">24</xref></sup> The morphing process was carried out using theCCWeatherGen tool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143624411416064">25</xref></sup> and is based on themethodology for constructing future weather files developed by Belcher et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143624411416064">26</xref></sup> Asis pointed out by the authors of the tool,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143624411416064">27</xref></sup> the output of the morphing procedure should be treated with caution: The relative changes inthe various environmental variables quoted in the UKCIP02 scenarios compare to the baseline timeframe from 1961 to 1990.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143624411416064">24</xref></sup> However, for the purposes of this study, the data used as the baseline current climate is theyear 1999–2000. It is expected, thus, that theresulting ‘Medium-High 2050s’ weather files will overestimate theclimate change impact somewhat. Nevertheless, the original UKCIP02 labels are used here to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>During the study, UKCP09, the most recent version of UKCIP climate change projections, was also made available.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143624411416064">28</xref></sup> Within the context of the EPSRC-funded PROMETHEUS research project, Eames et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143624411416064">29</xref></sup> have proposed a methodology that allows the creation of future design weather years using UKCP09. The key differences between the weather files for building simulation based on UKCIP02 and UKCP09 are that the latter are (a) provided at a finer spatial resolution and (b)generated by adopting a probabilistic approach. Nonetheless, although UKCP09 weather files were provided for major UK cities at the time of the study, theweather generator engine was not made publicly available. Consequently, the UKCP09 projections could not be used to build customized weather files for the LSSAT locations. Importantly, however, results obtained by simulating the thermal performance of a typical UK dwelling using UKCP09 weather files have been shown to be consistent with results obtained by UKCIP02.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143624411416064">29</xref></sup> This indicates that the UKCP09 projected mean change in key environmental variables, e.g. external air temperature, between the current climate and the time period under examination, i.e. 2050s, remains within the range predicted by UKCIP02. Furthermore, although the novel element of UKCP09 probabilistic projections facilitates future overheating risk assessment, such an analysis exceeded the scope of this article. Forthe above reasons, it was decided to useUKCIP02 for the purposes of the presentstudy.</p>

<sec id="sec11-0143624411416064"><title>4.2 Building description</title>
<p>The building model was based on a typical, naturally-ventilated open plan office (type 2), as described in ECON 19,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143624411416064">30</xref></sup> as this was considered to be representative of free-running office buildings in UK cities. It had a rectangular plan, oriented with longer sides facing north/south, and a total floor area of 2000 m<sup>2</sup>. A typical wall construction was used, consisting of an external brick layer, insulation, concrete and an internal plasterboard layer. Windows were double glazed with 50% glazing ratio on all facades. The U-values for all constructions were as specified in Approved Document L2A.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143624411416064">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>The internal floor/ceiling slab was composed of 400 mm thick dense concrete, which was selected due to the night ventilation strategy employed in the building. The high thermal mass complements the night cooling strategy by absorbing heat during the day then rejecting it during the night, thus lessening the peak daytime operational temperature in the building.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143624411416064">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Internal gains in the building were as specified in the UK National Calculation Methodology (part of the Building Regulations) for open plan office buildings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143624411416064">32</xref></sup> Hot water radiator heating with natural ventilation was used, including night ventilation through high-level windows from June to August.

<sec id="sec14-0143624411416064"><title>5.1 Impact of the UHI on comfort</title>
<p>Considering the external conditions first, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0143624411416064">Figure 3</xref> shows the variation in mean external temperature with distance from the British Museum. The graph shows that there is asignificant correlation between external meantemperature and distance, with temperature decreasing as distance from centre increases. Interestingly, this relationship appears stronger on the West (<italic>R</italic><sup>2 </sup>= 0.932) compared to the East axis (<italic>R</italic><sup>2 </sup>= 0.775). However, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0143624411416064">Figure 4</xref>(a) shows the percentage of hours during which the external temperature exceeds 28°C (i.e. the temperature relevant to the CIBSE comfort criterion, which recommends that the operative temperature in non-air-conditioned offices should not exceed 28°C for more than 1% of occupied hours) for all the locations. The percentage of occupied hours during which the external temperature exceeds 28°C is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0143624411416064">Figure 4</xref>(b). Both graphs show that there is a weaker relationship between external temperature exceeding 28°C and distance from the centre than was the case for the mean temperature. Additionally, sites at an identical distance on the east and west transects yielded different results, further suggesting that distance from the centre alone is not an adequate predictor of such a temperature metric.

<p>The results confirm the importance of using an appropriate weather file, specific to the design site, rather than a generic file when predicting internal temperatures and overheating in buildings, as the variations between sites may lead to a considerable variation in internal temperature, overheating and energy demand. This is particularly pertinent for free-running, night-ventilated buildings, in which internal thermal comfort is more sensitive to external conditions. With regard to the use of the current CIBSE criterion to demonstrate compliance with Building Regulations, using generic instead of site-specific weather files may be important in determining whether thebuilding passes or fails with respect to overheating.</p>

<p>The base case building model was set up toinclude night ventilation during the summer months. A further model was simulated without night cooling, so as to assess the effectiveness of this technique under both current (1999–2000) and future conditions. Since the strategy relies on the diurnal temperature difference to allow the building to expel daytime heat gains, it is expected that night cooling will become increasingly important in the future as the diurnal temperature range is expected to increase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143624411416064">29</xref></sup> Analysis of the diurnal temperature range during a warm 10-day period (2nd – 22nd August) shows that it is indeed projected to increase in the future, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0143624411416064">Figure 8</xref>.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0143624411416064">Figure 9</xref> shows the overheating performance of the building model under four conditions; with and without night ventilation in using 1999–2000 and 2050s weather files.

<p>The chart shows that night ventilation is currently very effective in reducing overheating, with most locations experiencing 1% less overheating hours when the strategy is used. This increased to over 2% when 2050s weather files were used. It has been suggested that theUHI decreases the effectiveness ofnight ventilation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143624411416064">17</xref></sup> It is indeed the case that absolute temperatures are higher at the centre of the city. However, comparing the change in overheating resulting from using night cooling across the different locations, there is no clearrelationship between cooling potential and distance from the centre. Furthermore, sites at an identical distance from the centre perform very differently when night cooling is used. Thisindicates that change in overheating performance cannot be predicted based solely on distance from the centre.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0143624411416064">Figure 10</xref> shows the change in mean internal temperature during occupied hours in a hot period, resulting from a change in location, future climate and employing a night ventilation strategy.

<p>The figure shows that changes to external temperatures due to projected climate change have the greatest effect on indoor air temperature and overheating. Nevertheless, noting again that current CIBSE guidance recommends that operative temperatures should not exceed 28°C for more than 1% of occupied hours,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143624411416064">3</xref></sup> location does play a significant role in determining whether a building may pass or fail the overheating criterion. A shift in location can decrease overheating hours by 1% or cause a 0.7% increase. Night ventilation is almost as significant as shifts in location, reducing overheating during occupied hours by 0.9%.</p>

<sec id="sec19-0143624411416064"><title>6.1 Main conclusions</title>
<p>The analysis carried out demonstrates that whilst internal comfort is related to distance from the city centre, very local microclimatic effects at individual sites also have a significant effect. Site characteristics, including artificial surface coverage ratio, green surface coverage ratio and ground floor space index, need to be taken into consideration. In addition, modelling work in the LUCID project has demonstrated that advection is also a critical factor that is likely at times to shift the centre of the UHI away from the centre of London. Therefore, it is not sufficient to infer local temperatures based solely on the distance from the centre of a city.</p>
<p>Results from simulations using morphed 2050s weather files show that there is a significant projected increase in operational temperatures in the future. Analysis of the different model versions, with and without theuse of night cooling, shows that night ventilation coupled with thermal mass is very effective in reducing internal temperatures. The cooling potential of night cooling is expected to be even greater in the future due to the greater diurnal temperature range.</p>
<p>A comparison of the effects of future climate, night ventilation and changes in location on indoor air temperature and overheating showed that changes to external temperatures due to climate change have the greatest effect. However, the impacts of location are significant and should be considered.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec20-0143624411416064"><title>6.2 Limitations and further work</title>
<p>A key limitation of the present study is that only external temperature was assumed to vary between sites, due to the lack of wind speed and relative humidity data at a fine temporal and spatial resolution. Clearly, wind speed, as well as overshadowing from other buildings, are expected to affect ventilation and convective heat transfer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143624411416064">11</xref></sup> Nevertheless, the aim of this article is to demonstrate the potential impact of weather file use on indoor overheating assessment in urban environments and so these limitations are not particularly significant for this purpose. They could, however, be addressed in the future when localised London weather data is provided by more sophisticated local urban climate models such as the ones developed within the context of the LUCID project. Further work will address these issues.</p>
<p>Another limitation of the study is that it made use of the CIBSE one-temperature approach to estimate overheating risk. Aswas mentioned earlier, alternative overheating criteria, such as the adaptive thermal comfort approach, might have been more appropriate for a more in-depth understanding of human thermal comfort perceptions. Therefore, an attempt was made to explore the city-wide differences in thermal discomfort by repeating the analysis of the four conditions presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0143624411416064">Figure 9</xref> (with and without night cooling, during the current andfuture climate) by using the adaptive thermal comfort criterion described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec8-0143624411416064">section 3.5</xref> d). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0143624411416064">Figure 11</xref>, thermal discomfort levels appear to be slightly higher as one moves from the centre to the outskirts (<italic>R</italic><sup>2 </sup>= 0.623 and <italic>R</italic><sup>2 </sup>= 0.553 on the West and East axis, respectively, for the night ventilation scenario under the current climate). This is due to the fact that the threshold ‘comfort temperature’ closely follows the local external temperature. The adaptive thermal comfort model assumes that the population groups living in the centre will be acclimatized to the higher temperatures. This might not be the case for a large part of the London population that lives in the (cooler) suburbs and commutes to work to office spaces in central London. Further work is therefore required in order to produce thermal discomfort estimates for various lifestyle profiles across London.
<fig id="fig11-0143624411416064" position="float"><label>Figure 11</label><caption><p>Variation in percentage occupied hours 3°C above the adaptive thermal comfort temperature <italic>T</italic><sub>c</sub> with distance from British Museum, with and without night ventilation</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0143624411416064-fig11.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Notably, although the use of the adaptive approach alters the absolute values of the thermal discomfort estimates, a large inter-station overheating difference can still be observed, hence strengthening the argument for weather files tailored to a particular site.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec21-0143624411416064"><title>6.3 Recommendations</title>
<p>Both distance from the centre and local microclimatic effects should be considered in the design of buildings, as these effects have a significant influence on both energy use and comfort. There is a considerable difference between the thermal performance of a building at different sites. This implies, for example, that a building may wrongly pass or fail criteria used to demonstrate compliance with building regulations as a result of an inappropriate generic weather file being used.</p>
<p>The Greater London Authority (GLA), in collaboration with CIBSE, has developed guidance for developers to address the risk of overheating in buildings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0143624411416064">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143624411416064">34</xref></sup> The guidance allows developers to take a risk-based approach to reducing overheating by providing different future hourly weather data to usein building simulation models. These data take account of the location of the development with respect to the UHI via the use of three different weather files. While such an initiative is welcomed, it may be that a weather file tailored to the building location would bepreferable. Of course, this would add furthercomplexity process and a view would have to be taken as the viability of such an approach. The work presented in this article, however, suggests that serious consideration should be given to this methodology. The relevant tailored weather files could be provided, for example, via the outputs of the LSSAT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143624411416064">16</xref></sup> or other LUCID models for London.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143624411416064">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143624411416064"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143624411416064">10</xref></sup></p>
