<abstract>
<p>This article reviews andragogy as the philosophy resident in the broad arena of experience-based learning. Beneath the umbrella of experience-based learning lie the specific classroom orientations of student-centered learning, problem-based learning, and classrooms as organizations. These orientations contribute to the creation of autonomy-supportive classrooms that focus more fully on student experience as a means to greater learning. The exhaustive review of the literature on student experience in teaching environments is the foundation for claims to fuller integration of this approach and discussion that focuses on the student as the original reason for the existence of the classroom. The article closes with a call for more student-focused andragogy, its relevance for Millennial learners, and recommendations for educators.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is not uncommon to hear of managers’ perceived irrelevance of their management studies to their postcommencement work experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr146-1052562912456296">Mintzberg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr163-1052562912456296">Porter &amp; McKibbin, 1988</xref>). Given these concerns, this review is a call to educators to bridge what transpires in the classroom at both undergraduate and graduate levels with the professional work world students will soon inhabit. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-1052562912456296">A. Y. Kolb and Kolb (2005)</xref> called for educators to enhance the presence and process of experiential education as a medium through which students’ learning styles could be addressed. Their call was for a broader and deeper appreciation of learning that considers the learners, thus making it more salient and meaningful for their development. This is particularly relevant for Millennial students and their learning styles. As a response, this article reviews andragogy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-1052562912456296">Knowles, 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1052562912456296">1984</xref>) as a philosophical foundation to help understand the classroom environment’s contribution to greater student learning and engagement through the use of experience-based learning (EBL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1052562912456296">Andresen, Boud, &amp; Cohen, 2000</xref>). Variations of EBL include student-centered learning (SCL), classrooms as organizations (CAO), and problem-based learning (PBL). These three approaches reflect broad interpretations of EBL, which defies being reduced to a set of clean and tidy strategies or recipes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1052562912456296">Andresen et al., 2000</xref>). The result is intended to help the reader gain a broad understanding of the value of experience-focused education, which is then interpreted through the lens of autonomy-supportive (AS) classrooms. AS classrooms call for greater emphasis on student experience and student involvement in education. In sum, andragogy is treated as the broad philosophical umbrella under which EBL and the three identified orientations function. These three orientations manifest the principles contained in Knowles’s work on andragogy and offer educators new avenues by which they might create more sustainable and relevant learning environments for their students. Sustainable and relevant learning is at the heart of AS classes. Finally, this article interprets the AS learning environment in terms of the Millennial generation, as this is the new and entering class of students with whom we must craft meaningful learning experiences. These relationships are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1052562912456296">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Although this review relies on a broad literature, there is a significant presence of articles from the <italic>Journal of Management Education</italic> (<italic>JME</italic>). This makes sense as it is the premier journal concerned with EBL for management educators. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1052562912456296">Beatty and Leigh (2010)</xref> identified the unique topics for each of three pedagogy journals, including <italic>JME, Management Learning</italic> (<italic>ML</italic>), and <italic>Academy of Management Learning &amp; Education</italic> (<italic>AMLE</italic>). <italic>JME</italic>’s unique topics included “exercise, experiential, environment, team, pedagogical, activity, project, and tool” (p. 377). This is compared with “academic, faculty, leadership, science, success, future, and the United States” (p. 377) for <italic>AMLE</italic> and “literature, reflection, debate, practitioner, managerial, and the United Kingdom” (p. 377) for <italic>ML</italic>.</p>

<title>Andragogy</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-1052562912456296">Knowles (1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1052562912456296">1984</xref>) defined andragogy as the art and science of helping adults learn and presented it as an alternative to pedagogy, which literally means the art and science of educating children. These terms are often used synonymously, although inaccurately. Knowles made the following assumptions about adult learning: (a) adults need to know why they need to learn something, (2) adults need to learn experientially, (3) adults approach learning as problem solving, (4) adults learn best when the topic is of immediate value, and (5) as an adult’s concept of self becomes more oriented toward being an independent person, she is more self-directed in her learning.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-1052562912456296">Lindeman (1926)</xref> (influenced by Dewey), who preceded Knowles, claimed that the modern adult learning process is backward, where the subject matter and teacher often take precedence, leaving the learners and their experience in an underrated second place. This results in too great of a focus on someone else’s experience and knowledge. Andragogy’s assumptions reframe the educator’s perspective and provide a fresh approach to student-focused initiatives. Indeed, some (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1052562912456296">Forrest &amp; Peterson, 2006</xref>) call for wholesale substitution of the word <italic>pedagogy</italic> with <italic>andragogy</italic> on the premise that it more accurately captures the essence of what higher-education professors are attempting to accomplish. Andragogy serves as an organizing construct underlying the practice of SCL, CAO, and PBL. The fundamental premise is that classroom activities reflected in the practices of SCL, CAO, and PBL incorporate andragogy’s five assumptions and aid in creating AS classrooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr170-1052562912456296">Reeve, Bolt, &amp; Cai, 1999</xref>), which better serve Millennial learners.</p>
<sec id="section3-1052562912456296">
<title>Arguments for the Integration of Practice and Theory</title>
<p>A practice-based interpretation of learning was one of two broad trajectories at the heart of the reintroduction of <italic>ML</italic> in 1994 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1052562912456296">Fox, 2009</xref>). This “turn” (p. 371) occurred at a time when there was a concurrent shift toward the inclusion of more qualitative studies in the social sciences. This was followed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1052562912456296">DeFillippi’s (2001)</xref> opening comments in <italic>ML</italic> that called for more education driven by project-based reflective practices. The broad topic of practice and interaction in the learning task beyond mere lecture was then addressed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1052562912456296">Arbaugh (2005a)</xref> in the June 2005 edition of <italic>AMLE</italic>. Further support for the inclusion of adult learning principles in the construction of learning environments was provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr175-1052562912456296">Roglio and Light (2009)</xref>, who declared their value and drew attention to “instructional strategies, collective learning, and curriculum design” (p. 156) in executive education. Further still, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr206-1052562912456296">Whetten (2007)</xref> has called for more PBL, application of material to on-the-job settings, contact with practicing managers, reflection, and greater interaction between students, peers, and the instructor. Last but far from least, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1052562912456296">Armstrong and Fukami (2009)</xref> have corralled the writings of some of the greatest management scholars on the planet in a collection of essays addressing the whole of management learning education and development. Given this rich foundation for engaging in activity beyond the limits of the textbook, the following literature review offers more specific support.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr166-1052562912456296">Raelin (2007)</xref> echoed the call for greater integration of theory and practice and implored us to “pay . . . special attention . . . to the processes that encourage more knowing-in-action and their outcomes” (p. 496). This, he said, will aid in better understanding the teacher’s role in relation to students’ learning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr147-1052562912456296">Mintzberg and Gosling (2002)</xref> provided research geared toward bridging the domains of education and practice. They wrote about confronting the multiple borders to “get beyond “students,” beyond “globalization,” beyond “teaching,” and beyond the “business functions” (p. 64). All this transcendence was in service to reflecting “thoughtfully on experience” (p. 64). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1052562912456296">Charlebois and Giberson (2010)</xref> also talked of borders in their work with Marketing students and a two-semester project that incorporated in-class case competition during the first semester with international experience for the winners during the second semester. Other examples include <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-1052562912456296">Marshall (2008)</xref>, who bridged the divide between the theoretical and practical for consulting engineers; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr177-1052562912456296">Romme, Georges, and Putzel (2003)</xref>, who helped students apply organizational behavior concepts as they learned them (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr165-1052562912456296">Putzel, n.d</xref>.); and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr150-1052562912456296">Nadkarni (2003)</xref>, who explored the differences in the mental models of students through implementing variations of the traditional lecture/discussion format, an experiential format, and a hybrid version of the two.</p>
<p>The integration of thought and action has clear practical implications for the effectiveness of our classroom efforts. The magnitude of the work of some of those cited above as great thinkers in management education cannot be denied and foreshadows what is to come in business education lest we, the educators, choose to relegate ourselves to the equivalent of the rotary dialed phone. The studies also set the stage for the authors reviewed in the EBL section below. The reviews of research in the three focus areas are intended to provide support and examples of where EBL practices have been conducted. They also provide numerous outlets for action that fosters healthy conditions for the AS class to emerge and offer the readers concrete examples that they may want to consider in creating their next course.</p>

<title>Experience-Based Learning</title>
<p>There are numerous models of EBL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1052562912456296">Boud &amp; Pascoe, 1978a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1052562912456296">1978b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1052562912456296">Dewey, 1938</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-1052562912456296">D. A. Kolb, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr202-1052562912456296">Weil &amp; McGill, 1989</xref>). An early version proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1052562912456296">Boud and Pascoe (1978a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1052562912456296">1978b</xref>) identified three critical elements that must be present for a learning environment to be considered experiential. These include (a) some level of learner control, (b) some reflection of the real environment in the learning environment, and (c) self-involvement of the learner. These three criteria create a simple metric by which anyone who wants to implement EBL in his or her classroom can measure his or her efforts at setting the stage.</p>
<p>What does EBL offer the management learning agenda beyond what is currently provided through more traditional content/lecture formats? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr151-1052562912456296">Navarro (2008)</xref> surveyed the top 50 MBA programs in the United States and found that although there has been a call for reform toward a 6-point ideal, with experiential learning as Point 2, that ideal for many programs remains more of a “normative construct than a positive reality” (p. 109). In response, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1052562912456296">Hoover, Giambatista, Sorenson, and Bommer (2010)</xref> reported on a 5-year experientially based whole-person learning approach oriented toward developing skills in communication, leadership, teamwork, decision making, and planning. Others have reviewed specific experiences and their contribution to learning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1052562912456296">Baker, Jensen, and Kolb (2005)</xref> studied conversation as the very vehicle of experiential learning; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr211-1052562912456296">Wyss-Flamm and Zandee (2001)</xref> studied conversation in terms of finite and infinite games (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1052562912456296">Carse, 1986</xref>); and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-1052562912456296">Lerner (1995)</xref> helped students understand typical group role types in their experiences of working in groups. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1052562912456296">Gilson (1990)</xref> undertook further research on conversation and interaction and suggested that the instructor’s ability to create an environmental context that encouraged effective classroom dialogue also served to facilitate student experience, learning, and development. Gilson claimed that this interaction was particularly important in undergraduate settings, where development can be “nurtured or fettered” (p. 79) by the classroom experience that is in part crafted by the instructor. Gilson quotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1052562912456296">Gallos (1988)</xref>, who said, “we should not assume that our students are already the autonomous, independent, and responsible individuals that we would like them to be; in fact, major studies of students during college years . . . tell us that they are not” (p. 74).</p>
<p>Reframing students’ experiences as learning tools can provide a personal context for the more traditional activities of a classroom. This bridge building can aid in connecting the lived experience of students to their yet-to-be-lived experience of working in their careers postgraduation. Employing students’ experience connects well to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1052562912456296">Boud and Pascoe’s (1978a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1052562912456296">1978b</xref>) three elements above, where students maintain some level of learner control, their experience has elements of the real environment in the learning environment, and they feel personally involved in the project and process. Given <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1052562912456296">Boud and Pascoe’s (1978a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1052562912456296">1978b</xref>) three elements of experiential learning environments, SCL, PBL, and CAO qualify as focus areas available for consideration. Although these three provide more specific examples than the general term EBL, they stand as broader interpretations than those cited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1052562912456296">Andresen et al. (2000)</xref>, which included “internships, work placements, on-the-job training, excursions, adventure and wilderness trips, studios, laboratories, workshops, clinicals, practicums, case study approaches, action research, role plays, hypotheticals, and simulations” (p. 231) as various contexts. As a result, SCL, PBL, and CAO cast a solid foundation for anyone who considers implementing an EBL approach to his teaching.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1052562912456296">
<title>Student-Centered Learning</title>
<p>SCL focuses on student opportunities, activities, and responsibilities that are driven by what attracts the students and what they are curious about (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1052562912456296">Estes, 2004</xref>). This approach takes the place of more traditional approaches to learning characterized by teacher- and content-driven initiatives. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr174-1052562912456296">Rogers (1983)</xref> defined an important precondition for the instructor of SCL as “a leader or person who is perceived as an authority figure in the situation, is sufficiently secure within herself and in her relationship to others that she experiences an essential trust in the capacity of others to think for themselves, to learn for themselves” (p. 188). SCL is predicated on this “essential trust” and focuses more on what the students do and why they believe they are doing those things and less on what the teacher does. This helps develop independence and motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1052562912456296">Biggs, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1052562912456296">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr184-1052562912456296">Shuell, 1986</xref>) and helps students see their contribution to the learning enterprise through planning, interacting, and learning assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1052562912456296">Cannon, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Creating meaning for students is a challenge in many classes. A student-centered approach helps students focus on topics that are relevant to their needs, lives, and interests, thereby connecting them to what is salient in their lived experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-1052562912456296">McCombs &amp; Whistler, 1997</xref>). When approached from this perspective, students become stakeholders in the learning process who can collectively address the diverse interests and learning styles present in their classrooms. As a result, students experience themselves as competent problem solvers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1052562912456296">Aaronsohn, 1996</xref>), which leads to greater levels of confidence in their abilities and less attribution of successful outcomes to luck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr153-1052562912456296">North Central Regional Educational Laboratory, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>A student-centered approach requires a change in teaching methods. No longer can the class activities and focus be determined solely by the teacher. Teachers must consider students’ needs and interests and be available to how those change across semesters. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-1052562912456296">McCombs and Whistler (1997)</xref> found that when classes take this approach, there is an increase in motivation, actual learning, and performance. Retention is also increased since students process material through multiple avenues of apprehension and do not just passively receive information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr185-1052562912456296">Silberman, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Some specific writing on student-centered education was offered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1052562912456296">Bilimoria and Wheeler (1995)</xref>, who provided “guidelines for implementing a learning-centered classroom” (p. 410). They suggested that teachers (a) reconceptualize education as driven by learning; (b) provide opportunities for self-directed learning; (c) reshape the authority relationship in the classroom, (d) adopt a relational learning approach; (e) pay attention to the context, inputs, and processes of learning; and (f) foster lifelong learning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr167-1052562912456296">Ramsey and Fitzgibbons (2005)</xref> focused on learner-centered education in their discussion of “being” with students in the classroom as opposed to “doing” something to students. These authors encouraged teachers to give up some control and join students in their learning. Their philosophy states, “We’re here to learn together and you (the students) are as much a source of our learning as I (the teacher)” (p. 337). Addressing the specific task of exams, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1052562912456296">Buskirk, Kruger, and Hazen (1995)</xref> asked students to articulate exam questions that have grown out of their connection to and natural curiosity about the material. This approach “recontextualizes content in terms of student interests that are broader and deeper than the need to survive a course” (p. 459). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1052562912456296">Buskirk (1991)</xref> also used student experience to build sensitivity to culture in organizations through effective interpretation of organizational symbols and their impact on students’ thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1052562912456296">Brown and Murti (2003)</xref> created student partners in their classes, who then have a voice in the design and construction of the course. This leveraged their experience as learners.</p>
<p>These articles begin to reveal the shared authority for the design and delivery of a course. They suggest that a partner model of learning may be more effective than the bank account model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1052562912456296">Freire, 1970</xref>) so broadly employed.</p>
<sec id="section6-1052562912456296">
<title>Service Learning</title>
<p>Service learning stands as a special case of SCL. In this environment, students have the opportunity to serve others, often through participating in nonprofit organizations that benefit the disenfranchised in some form. The September 2005 issue of <italic>AMLE</italic> was devoted to reviewing service learning from multiple viewpoints to broaden and deepen the perspectives of this experiential approach.

<p>Service learning provides a convenient and other-oriented segue between the classroom and life beyond the campus. This work helps bridge the university to the community and provides opportunities for students to begin to consider the real practicalities of life after graduation. Too great a focus on service learning, however, may lead to “service learning fatigue” as students may begin to feel overburdened with these responsibilities, which begin to feel like little more than free labor. In this sense, it is incumbent on teachers and administrators to be wise in their use of this approach to SCL such that the benefits do not become obscured by yet another “service learning opportunity” for students, thereby alienating them from the connection between higher education, industry, and the less fortunate.</p>
<p>Service learning aligns with the description of SCL offered above, even though the intended beneficiary of the student’s work is someone outside the university. The work that students participate in is often determined jointly by the staff at the service site and the student, thus leveraging the student’s responsibilities and what attracted the student and his or her curiosity.</p>

<title>Problem-Based Learning</title>
<p>PBL has its origins in science and medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1052562912456296">Carroll, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1052562912456296">Coombs &amp; Elden, 2004a</xref>) and has been heralded as the antidote to unmotivated students and silo approaches to education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1052562912456296">Duch, Groh, &amp; Allen, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-1052562912456296">Marincovich (2000)</xref> sums up nicely what is required of teachers who consider employing PBL:
<disp-quote>
<p>It is easy to overlook the many ways in which PBL goes against the grain of faculty and postsecondary educational life. While faculty are devoted to their discipline, eager to dispense knowledge, and content-oriented, PBL asks them to be student-centered, guiding rather than directive, and process-oriented. (p. 3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this way, it is reminiscent of the case method, which has its roots at Harvard. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1052562912456296">Duch et al. (2001)</xref> give credit for this movement to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1052562912456296">Dewey (1938)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr162-1052562912456296">Piaget (1972)</xref> and cover the topic from the administrative, faculty mentoring, and implementation perspectives. Gibson and Finnie (working paper, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1052562912456296">2011</xref>) claimed that PBL integrates past and current learning, connects practice and theory, and bridges the functions of business, thereby reducing the silo effect of organizations. Of particular significance were Gibson and Finnie’s claims that PBL aids in preparing students for the increasingly ambiguous nature of the work world, as compared with the relatively structured experience many have in higher education. Indeed, as educators, our efforts at helping students confront this difference may assist in addressing Freud’s idea that neurosis is the failure to deal with ambiguity.</p>
<p>PBL moves beyond disciplinary knowledge through engaging in learning from a problem focus. Students encounter multiple business disciplines in understanding the nature of the problem and the web of issues that inhere. The categorical lines of traditional business discipline–based learning are suddenly blurred as students meet the interconnected nature of business functioning. This confronts the usual distinctions among disciplines that are often delivered in traditional business education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1052562912456296">Bridges, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>PBL is an interactive process where instructors serve more as facilitators and coaches rather than in their traditional roles as all-knowing dispensers of wisdom. PBL is active and experientially based, with the learner located at the heart of the effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1052562912456296">Barrows, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1052562912456296">Boud &amp; Feletti, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr180-1052562912456296">Samford University, n.d</xref>.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr195-1052562912456296">University of Delaware, n.d</xref>.). The approach allows for some choice within a range of topics that students may pursue. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1052562912456296">Gilbert and Foster (1998)</xref> discussed various tasks that avail themselves of this approach, including the “problem explanation . . . study . . . discussion . . . and action tasks” (p. 245), and how these might be managed through in-class dialogue. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr188-1052562912456296">Stinson and Miltner (1996)</xref> offer specific guidelines for PBL cases.</p>
<p>A special edition of the <italic>JME</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1052562912456296">Coombs &amp; Elden, 2004b</xref>) was dedicated to PBL. Contributors reviewed numerous outlets for the use of PBL—including how it can address cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions of learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1052562912456296">Brownell &amp; Jameson, 2004</xref>); attention to the context where it is used and cases that illustrate that (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr183-1052562912456296">Sherwood, 2004</xref>); its relevance to students’ work, school, and personal lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr145-1052562912456296">Miller, 2004</xref>); extensions of PBL beyond the borders of the classroom in ways that are similar to service learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-1052562912456296">Kloppenborg &amp; Baucus, 2004</xref>); a critique of factors critical to successful PBL implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr161-1052562912456296">Peterson, 2004</xref>); and the use of PBL in unstructured problems, particularly as it applies to graduates’ use of such in industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1052562912456296">Bigelow, 2004</xref>) and understanding the response to the tsunami that struck the shores of Sri Lanka in 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1052562912456296">Jayawardana &amp; O’Donnell, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the unique dimensions of PBL is its interdisciplinary focus. Projects addressed in this way open the boundaries of what may be considered relevant. This necessarily increases the potential ambiguity and the data that students may need to consider in conceptualizing problems and generating solutions that would be viable beyond the contrived environment of the classroom. Here, the solutions need to be viable in ways that consider systemic elements of business, industry, government, and other stakeholders. Through this effective approach, solutions reflect the world students will soon join, where there often are fewer guidelines as to how to proceed. That it mirrors the real world increases its relevance in the classroom.</p>

<title>Classrooms as Organizations</title>
<p>Many authors have reinterpreted the classroom as an organization, complete with the time, resource, relationship, and role demands common to traditional organizational life. Indeed, the editor of <italic>AMLE</italic> called for more of this research as a legitimizing force in management education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1052562912456296">Arbaugh, 2008</xref>).

<title>What About Theory?</title>
<p>Comments at a meeting of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1052562912456296">Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (1999)</xref> suggested that business schools “be more proactive and partner with business leaders in their communities . . . and . . . to make their curricula more relevant” (p. 12).

<p>There are numerous authors who have implemented various approaches to the CAO model.

<p>State-of-the-art of online and blended learning was offered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1052562912456296">Arbaugh et al. (2009)</xref> and furthered in writing by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1052562912456296">Arbaugh, Desai, Rau, and Sridhar (2010)</xref>. Although there has been an increase in research on online and blended learning environments overall, these authors call for more discipline-based research that tests concepts and is published in nonpedagogical journals. These authors also suggest that more research with particular attention paid to differences between online and blended environments, characteristics of instructors, and research beyond the borders of the United States would advance our understanding of how this medium contributes to learning.</p>
<p>Particular emphasis on graduate business education was offered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1052562912456296">Arbaugh and Benbunan-Fich (2006)</xref>, who addressed the ever-growing presence of online MBA education through an analysis of objectivist versus constructivist, and individualist versus social lenses. Their work revealed that a combination of objective teaching techniques with collaborativist learning experiences where student groups worked with teacher-provided facts and concepts resulted in high student-perceived learning. Although this system may initially appear teacher centered, there is great freedom within student groups for social interaction and collective determination of their response. This approach maintains the student-centered element, where students are liberated to make sense of the facts collectively and yet are not given total control of the classroom. The teacher maintains the elements of structuring (also known as scaffolding: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1052562912456296">Hmelo-Silver, Duncan, &amp; Chinn, 2007</xref>) the class. This is consistent with all three approaches as many decisions on how to conduct the course and implement SCL, PBL, or CAO approaches are made prior to the beginning of the term or students entering the class, which necessarily puts the teacher in an authority position. Hence, the success of this form is contingent on how the online environment is managed and the presentation of self by the teacher. Research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr189-1052562912456296">Strang (2011)</xref> also supported a more structured approach to online MBA discussion boards, where Socratic questioning and conversation theory were applied to the test group versus the control group, who used traditional peer interaction. The test group earned higher grades, and their interactions were rated higher than the control group. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr192-1052562912456296">Thorpe and Edmunds (2011)</xref> and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-1052562912456296">McLaren, 2004</xref>) offered support for the use of technology and claimed that it enhanced learning and better served students as they moved among their activities. They claimed that the technology enhanced learning and helped build student skills, roles, and interactions as students transitioned between school and work.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1052562912456296">Arbaugh (2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1052562912456296">2005c</xref>) and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-1052562912456296">R. B. Marks, Sibley, &amp; Arbaugh, 2005</xref>) have provided an analysis of the critical elements of a successful online MBA course experience for students and faculty. In related writing, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1052562912456296">Arbaugh (2005b)</xref> reviewed work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1052562912456296">Duffy and Kirkley (2004)</xref> dedicated to learner-centered education practices. His review revealed support for an interactive online experience, as has research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1052562912456296">Brower (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr176-1052562912456296">Rollag (2010)</xref>. Further distinctions of the online experience particularly related to teacher behavior were examined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1052562912456296">Arbaugh (2010b)</xref>, who discovered that the frequency and duration of instructor login negatively predicted student learning. Furthermore, it was found that instructor presence (formal instructor activity) and immediacy (informal instructor behavior) accounted for little of the student’s learning, thereby relieving instructors’ angst about how they contribute to or detract from students’ attitudes toward online learning.</p>

<title>In Summary</title>
<p>It is not enough to expect that students will become enamored with the details of the discipline to which we, as professors, have dedicated our lives. Indeed, if we are to maintain any relevance in the larger project, it is incumbent on us to “meet the client where the client is.” Most students will not go on to pursue a PhD. Instead, they are interested in what they can learn that will serve them tomorrow and for the next 45 years of their career, not their 4 years of education as undergraduates. If we are so smart, it should not be that difficult to find the nexus between theory and application. What creative outlets might we discover where we can show students theory’s relevance and applicability? That is the challenge to the academy today, especially as it is coming under fire from so many fronts, as mentioned above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr146-1052562912456296">Mintzberg, 2004</xref>), to justify its existence as a requirement for career success.</p>
<p>Clearly, there are many ways to incorporate practical organizational elements into a class experience. The central theme amid all efforts is to more accurately create and model the increased immersion students will experience on graduation. Students experience increases in responsibility and involvement on their entrance into the workforce. Classes that attempt to initiate this form of involvement introduce students to their contribution to the creation of that experience. These forms of learning bridge the dependent roles reminiscent of students in traditional classrooms with the independent activity required of new employees.</p>
<p>SCL, PBL, and CAO offer avenues to create more meaningful learning experiences for students. Although similar in their emphasis on student involvement, they differ in significant ways. SCL is a teaching form that is driven by what the students are interested in, what excites them, what draws their curiosity, and an understanding of what they are doing and why they are doing it. It is incumbent on the teacher to ferret out these details from students and respond accordingly with opportunities for students to learn in environments and through activities that serve their intuitive curiosities. This approach differs from PBL, where the focus of the learning is on the constellation of problems and problem symptoms that may transcend the discipline in which the class is housed. In this way, the learning is situated within the larger context of the industry that may be segmented in higher education’s historical pursuit of discipline-specific knowledge. For instance, salespeople may have difficulty getting enough products for customers, which may be the result of manufacturing limitations. These limitations may be caught up in the details of accounting and the subtle balance that is often necessary between accounts payable and accounts receivable, which affects the ability of the purchasing department to acquire adequate raw materials as needed by the manufacturing department. Both SCL and PBL are further differentiated from CAO, which leverages the dynamics and processes of a classroom experience in ways that bridge it with similar dynamics in industry organizations. In other words, CAO interprets the classroom as another form of organization complete with the unique challenges and opportunities resident in organizational life. In some ways, CAO treats the classroom as a microcosm of industry, with all the attending strengths, weaknesses, threats, and opportunities of a going concern. Despite these differences, all three approaches provide a laboratory of sorts for students to actively participate in as a medium for their learning, and all transcend the simple and traditional sage-on-the-stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-1052562912456296">Markel, 1999</xref>) model. All three approaches call on us to engage differently and serve students in a facilitative role that may conflict with the training many of us received in our own education. It is this change in the nature of the role and relationship of student and teacher that is most meaningful and impactful for students as we now construct environments and atmospheres that feel different to students and undoubtedly also to us. This change in being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr167-1052562912456296">Ramsey &amp; Fitzgibbons, 2005</xref>) is the matter from which the AS classroom is created.</p>

<title>Autonomy-Supportive Classrooms</title>
<p>The literature on AS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr170-1052562912456296">Reeve et al., 1999</xref>) classrooms suggests that a teacher’s style, the way in which he or she interacts with students, and the relationships and atmosphere that develop affect students’ learning and development. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1052562912456296">Deci, Nezlek, and Sheinman (1981)</xref> studied the effects of fourth-grade teachers’ styles on their students. They identified a personality trait described as an “orientation toward control versus autonomy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1052562912456296">Deci, Schwartz, Sheinman, &amp; Ryan, 1981</xref>, p. 643). A general definition of control and autonomy is that “behavior is . . . controlled when it is regulated either by external contingencies or introjected demands, and it is autonomous when it is intrinsically motivated” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1052562912456296">Black &amp; Deci, 2000</xref>, p. 742). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1052562912456296">Deci, Nezlek, et al. (1981)</xref> concluded that teachers with an orientation toward autonomy enhanced their student’s intrinsic motivation and self-esteem. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1052562912456296">Deci, Schwartz, et al. (1981)</xref> constructed a survey to measure this orientation, which proved valid when students’ ratings of their teachers aligned with the results of the survey. The students who were taught by autonomy-oriented teachers were assessed as more intrinsically motivated with higher self-esteem. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr156-1052562912456296">Patrick, Skinner, and Connell (1993)</xref> offered a more detailed description:
<disp-quote>
<p>Autonomy refers to the connection between volition and action; it is the extent to which a person feels free to show the behaviors of his choice; nonautonomous behaviors include both compliance and defiance, which have in common that they are reactions to others’ agendas and not freely chosen. (p. 782)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>By comparison, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1052562912456296">Deci, Spiegel, Ryan, Koestner, and Kauffman (1982)</xref> explored the impact of controlling teachers on students’ intrinsic motivation and self-esteem. They discovered that the more controlling a teacher, the less motivation and self-esteem students experience. Similar results were discovered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1052562912456296">Flink, Boggiano, and Barrett (1990)</xref>.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1052562912456296">deCharms (1976)</xref> has shown that an AS style is teachable and has done so with inner-city schoolteachers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr169-1052562912456296">Reeve (1998)</xref> has also shown that an AS style is teachable and that those with a personal predisposition to be supportive assimilated the techniques of this approach more readily than did those with a control-oriented style. His research was predicated on work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1052562912456296">Deci and Ryan (1985)</xref> as well as others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr160-1052562912456296">Pelletier, Séguin-Lévesque, &amp; Legault, 2002</xref>), who showed that students benefited when teachers were supportive. It is important to note, however, that environmental variables can contribute to a controlling teaching style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1052562912456296">Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985</xref>). These variables may be some form of controlling event in the teacher’s environment, such as pressure to achieve a particular outcome.</p>
<p>Work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr172-1052562912456296">Reeve, Jang, Carrell, Jeon, and Barch (2004)</xref> connected AS teaching style with engagement, which has to do with behavioral and emotional intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1052562912456296">Connell, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1052562912456296">Connell &amp; Wellborn, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1052562912456296">Fiedler, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-1052562912456296">Koenigs, Fiedler, &amp; deCharms, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr203-1052562912456296">Wellborn, 1991</xref>). Engagement is a construct that is similar in its behavioral dynamics to autonomy in that it is characterized by a “person’s active involvement such as effort and positive emotion or through a person’s voice and initiative in trying to take personal responsibility for their behavior” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr172-1052562912456296">Reeve et al., 2004</xref>, p. 148). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1052562912456296">Black and Deci (2000)</xref> studied the performance of college students in an organic chemistry class and the effects of the teacher’s AS approach. Their work showed that students performed better in those classes where they engaged with teachers who reflected this approach, which resulted in the students behaving from an intrinsically motivated position. This was interpreted in terms of self-determination theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1052562912456296">Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr171-1052562912456296">Reeve and Jang (2006)</xref> further supported the contribution of an AS approach with preservice teachers who were randomly assigned to pairs in the role of either student or teacher. Instructional behaviors displayed by the teacher that were rated as AS were correlated to perceived autonomy by the students. These behaviors included (a) listening, (b) creating time for independent work, (c) giving the student opportunities to talk, (d) giving praise as feedback, (e) offering encouragement, (f) offering hints, (g) being responsive to questions and comments, and (h) acknowledging the student’s perspective and experiences. A finer cut of the dynamic was shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1052562912456296">Driscoll (2005)</xref>, who found that teachers who monitored their level of control and were able to moderate it based on student performance offered learners choice and the opportunity for self-appraisal. This attention to the teacher–student relationship was also supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr168-1052562912456296">Rasku-Puttonen, Eteläpelto, Arvaja, and Häkkinen (2003)</xref>, who showed that it enabled the teacher to move toward or away from highly structured activities in service of the student’s performance in teacher–student discussions.</p>
<p>AS research mirrors the approach described in the EBL and related literature above. In all cases of AS classrooms, a less controlling approach by the instructor contributed to greater engagement and intrinsic motivation by students. The work of these authors can be directly applied in understanding the nature of the learning environment described in the sections on SCL, PBL, and CAO above. The relevance of this section on AS is in providing a uniting interpretation of the fundamental dynamics of those approaches. In those three sections, I have discussed numerous philosophical foundations and the ensuing practical activities intended to manifest those philosophies in the classroom. The descriptions of AS classrooms capture the essence of what is attempted through those activities and philosophies and serve as an integrative and uniting device.</p>

<title>Millennial Students</title>
<p>Much has been written regarding the characteristics of the Millennial generation and how they differ from earlier generations of learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1052562912456296">Carlson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1052562912456296">Elam, Stratton, &amp; Gibson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-1052562912456296">McAlister, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr148-1052562912456296">Monaco &amp; Martin, 2009</xref>). Millennials are characterized as “special, sheltered, and team-oriented” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr157-1052562912456296">Pattengale, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr155-1052562912456296">Pardue and Morgan (2008)</xref> and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1052562912456296">Beard &amp; Dale, 2008</xref>) have described them as “technologically competent, optimistic and group oriented . . . [with a] propensity for multitasking, reliance on electronics, and need for immediate feedback” (p. 74). Given these adjectives, researchers have been drawn to investigate how Millennial students might learn differently than previous generations and how best to serve them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1052562912456296">Hershatter &amp; Epstein, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1052562912456296">Beyers (2009)</xref> has investigated and proposed differences between learners and teachers, where learners may be operating at a more sophisticated level of information management than their teachers, who may still be functioning in the “textbook” (p. 226) era. Research that compared learners across three decades was completed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr187-1052562912456296">Stewart (2009)</xref>, who, despite differences in styles, claimed that there is much to be said for maintaining academic standards even when there may be some loss of comfort for both teachers and students. Related work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1052562912456296">Dillon (2007)</xref> and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1052562912456296">Carlson, 2005</xref>) reflected on the needs of the techno-savvy, time-insensitive learners and their learning style, which led her to call for more simulation-type learning projects in place of traditional, text-based learning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-1052562912456296">Lee and Breitenberg (2010)</xref> encouraged educators to employ holistic thinking, active-learning methods, visual media, and problem-solving approaches to effectively address the needs of their students. In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1052562912456296">Considine, Horton, and Moorman (2009)</xref> have inquired into Millennials’ media literacy and its impact on this generation’s interest in subject matter and their ability to learn. Of particular interest is research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr164-1052562912456296">Proserpio and Gioia (2007)</xref>, who have addressed the virtual generation and their needs and propensities for learning. They offer concrete suggestions for how these can be addressed with virtual tools such as “hyperlink navigation . . . communication technologies . . . [and] simulations or games” (p. 75), thereby leveraging technologies that Millennial students have matured with and with which they are familiar. They advocate the use of online tools as media through which instructors can better meet the learning processes and practices of Millennials. These authors close with the statement that “interactivity and user involvement are the key elements in success” (p. 79). This aligns perfectly with the main theme of this article, which calls for greater integration of the student in the learning project so that it is more student and less instructor driven.</p>
<sec id="section19-1052562912456296">
<title>AS and Millennials</title>
<p>AS classrooms and the three approaches to EBL integrate well with the characteristics of Millennial students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr207-1052562912456296">Wilson (2004)</xref> has identified numerous recommendations, including enriched student–faculty contact since this population has enjoyed strong relationships with involved parents and teachers and does well when this relationship is nurtured. Working in groups and on teams is a common experience for this group of learners; hence, teachers who attend to the dynamics of reciprocity and cooperation in their classroom organization may better serve their learners. Wilson claimed that Millennials are active learners. In this sense, they benefit from discussion, group projects, and shared problem solving, which attend to their interest in group work and reflective activities. Frequent and constructive feedback, providing sufficient time on classroom and learning tasks, offering clear but challenging expectations for students that require critical thinking, and incorporating diverse learning approaches and ways of gaining knowledge were also encouraged. Additional suggestions from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1052562912456296">Junco and Mastrodicasa (2007)</xref> on how best to serve this population include the following:</p>
<list id="list1-1052562912456296" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Explain issues such as academic integrity, intellectual ownership, cheating;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Provide clear expectations, detailed instructions and explicit syllabi;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Provide time management, study skills and conflict resolution training;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Plan opportunities for parental involvement;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Provide internship opportunities;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Provide cutting-edge technology, interactive web services and an infrastructure for virtual communities; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Offer additional technological support for first-generation students. (p. 86)</p></list-item></list>
<p>These ideas are similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr207-1052562912456296">Wilson’s (2004)</xref> claim that students need something more and beyond simple lectures. They need to be involved in the learning process in ways that help make the learning relevant to their lives. When asked, “How do students learn best?” 42% responded with “active participation and group work” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr208-1052562912456296">Wisniewski, 2010</xref>, p. 60). This further cemented the differences and needs of the new generation, as did research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr159-1052562912456296">Payne and Holmes (1998)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1052562912456296">Buttner (2004)</xref> explored students’ sensitivity to teacher behaviors. Consistent with the above recommendations for inclusion, students preferred to have their perspectives heard and recognized.</p>
<p>By incorporating greater focus in the curriculum on participation, interaction, and the external world, we may stem the tide of what has recently been discovered as the narcissistic tendencies of business students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr205-1052562912456296">Westerman, Bergman, Bergman, &amp; Daly, 2012</xref>). These authors discovered significant increases in narcissism among business undergraduates compared with psychology undergraduates, which resulted in higher levels of problems for organizations. Given this phenomenon, business faculties have the opportunity to respond by modeling appropriate behavior. These authors suggested that we model “non-narcissistic professional behavior” (Westerman et al., p. 24) as that is what is most desirable in students’ future workplaces. The authors referenced earlier work by some of them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1052562912456296">Bergman, Westerman, &amp; Daly, 2010</xref>) that summarized recommendations for how we might respond, thereby mirroring in a subtle way the environments students will soon join. In general terms, they suggested increased interpersonal sensitivity and the ability to appreciate others’ perspectives as skills that can be developed and rewarded through the use of many of the experiential frames reviewed in this article. These include teamwork, multiple feedback sources, role-playing, speakers from industry, use of cases, and responses from faculty that focus on interpersonal relationships and communication.</p>
<p>The role of experience for the Millennial generation, and in light of the AS classroom dynamics, underscores the significance of SCL, PBL, and CAO as salient methods by which instructors might create more meaning, value, and learning in the business classroom. This is particularly important given the emerging nature of the current and future business environment as one characterized by “Uncertainty, Chaos, and Luck” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1052562912456296">Collins &amp; Hansen, 2011</xref>). Students’ preparation for success in that world can be catalyzed through cleaner distinctions and connections between higher education and the worlds they will enter on graduation. Business is routinely considered a place where the pace of change is rising at an ever-increasing rate. If business students are not exposed to change before they graduate, they will almost by definition enter it behind the curve. Teaching students in ways that leverage and integrate business and management experiences as vehicles of the learning process will help enable students to enter the flow of that raging stream, replete with its “constant whitewater” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr196-1052562912456296">Vaill, 1989</xref>), in ways that enable them to contribute from their first day on the job.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The dynamics of an AS classroom and teaching style relevant for Millennial students mirror those necessary to implement the three approaches to learning: SCL, PBL, and CAO. All require teachers to give up some control, thereby making room for the presence of AS dynamics. A fuller exploration of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr171-1052562912456296">Reeve and Jang’s (2006)</xref> instructional behaviors, given what has been covered in the three approaches, justifies further ink.</p>
<list id="list2-1052562912456296" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Listening</italic>: This act is diametrically opposed to what often transpires in the traditional classroom. Here, the teacher talks (lectures) less and listens to students more.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Creating time for independent work</italic>: Teachers will need to be less directive in their actions. This creates space for creativity (and error), which contributes to learning that is owned by the student instead of that which is delivered by the teacher.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Giving students opportunities to talk</italic>: Aligned with the listening theme above, this requires making time and space in the classroom to hear the thoughts, ideas, opinions, and, dare I suggest, feelings of our learners.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Giving praise as feedback</italic>: Aligned with appreciative inquiry notions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1052562912456296">Cooperrider, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1052562912456296">Cooperrider &amp; Srivastva, 1987</xref>), doing so will generate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1052562912456296">Bushe, 2007</xref>) more of what learners and teachers want.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Offering encouragement</italic>: Encouragement is different from giving the answer. Here, the teacher supports the learner in his or her quest for knowledge. The teacher maintains an open and quite possibly ambiguous stance regarding what she believes is important and relevant as students struggle with their questions. A noncondemning posture is critical here and echoes the praise element above.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Offering hints</italic>: Suggestions that guide rather than provide answers from the all-knowing sage is the theme here. Provocative questions that stimulate independent critical thinking are important as students claim their knowledge.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Being responsive to questions and comments</italic>: Being available to students’ concerns in a dialogic process is important so that students do not feel abandoned in their learning. Subtlety without offering up what may be believed to be Truth is helpful. Although students are unlikely to benefit from being set adrift on a rudderless ship, we can serve them by “remaining in place” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1052562912456296">Kegan, 1982</xref>) as teachers and remind them that we have not abandoned them.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Acknowledging the student’s perspective and experiences</italic>: SCL, PBL, and CAO require that teachers respect and acknowledge students’ ideas, thoughts, feelings, and relationships as they move through the uncharted waters of the experience that the teacher has opened up for them. Judgment of their ideas may well be taken as judgment of the self. Any wafting sensations of this experience can undo the very thing we are trying to stimulate.</p></list-item></list>
<p>These eight behaviors bridge the mechanics of the varied activities and exercises with our dispositions as instructors. What we do and who we are influence the potential creation of a synergistic learning environment and better outcomes for our students, which can only be achieved by yielding to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr173-1052562912456296">Rogers’s (1961)</xref> encouragement to trust our experience. The relationships among SCL, PBL, CAO, AS classrooms, and the needs of the Millennial generation become even clearer when we complete the circle of inquiry by reconnecting to the assumptions of andragogy that opened the article. They include the following:</p>
<list id="list3-1052562912456296" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Adults need to know why they need to learn something.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Adults need to learn experientially.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Adults approach learning as problem solving.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Adults learn best when the topic is of immediate value.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>As an adult’s self-concept becomes more oriented toward being an independent person, the person is more self-directed in his or her learning.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Engaging in student–teacher dialogue not characterized by omniscience but, instead, as a partner in inquiry, as included in the design of the three approaches, clearly changes the nature of the relationship between teacher and learner. In this sense, students are andragogically more likely to understand why they need to know something and about its relevance to their lives (Assumption 1). SCL, PBL, and CAO leverage experience as a central element in their effectiveness (Assumption 2). Problems are at the very heart of PBL and may be central players in the other domains (Assumption 3). The learning facilitated through SCL, PBL, and CAO provides immediate value for learners in understanding current issues in their work and lives (Assumption 4). All three treat the learner as an independent person free with the autonomy and responsibility to pursue that learning that is most meaningful for them (Assumption 5). In these ways, SCL, PBL, and CAO respond to the five assumptions of andragogy and help create AS learning environments that best serve today’s entering generation of students. The theory behind these approaches combines to reinforce a tried and true adage coined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-1052562912456296">Lewin (1951)</xref>: “There is nothing so practical as a good theory” (p. 169). As educators, we would be wise to take his advice in meeting students where they are with practical interpretations of theory that are meaningful in their experience and in our interactions with them.</p>

<title>Recommendations</title>
<p>Clearly, one’s teaching approach is not an either/or proposition. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-1052562912456296">Kirschner, Sweller, and Clark (2006)</xref> discuss, providing clear instructional guidance is an important element in teaching. This structure however, rarely reflects the world as we know it from having lived in it. Hence, combining structure with scaffolding, whereby teachers offer “coaching, task structuring, and hints, without explicitly giving students the final answers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1052562912456296">Hmelo-Silver et al., 2007</xref>, p. 100) in experiential settings can create some broad, open terrain where students can construct meaning by themselves and with others. Although the two positions of heavy structure and minimal guidance represent the polarities of the spectrum, some integration might be the most effective approach, as students need to have some “clay” (theory and instruction) from which they “throw their pot” (practical experience). Dictating the shape and contours of their pot, however, should be left to each particular student while immersed in the art studio (read management milieu), which falls short of the call by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr190-1052562912456296">Sweller, Kirschner, and Clark (2007)</xref>. These authors recommend that educators provide “learners with all information needed including a complete problem solution—either prior to a task or just-in-time during a task” (p. 117). We as teachers, luckily enough, have the opportunity to participate in both arenas. We have the knowledge and credentials to provide foundations in the theory and thinking of our disciplines. However, just because a finance professor can describe how to calculate the net present value or internal rate of return of a given business proposition does not mean that professor ought to dictate or provide a set of rules on how to consistently interpret the results of those calculations. That, even in the quantitative arena of finance, is where the art of teaching enters the equation, so to speak. It is in engaging the permeable boundaries between disciplines and the analysis, decision making, conversations, and hunches that the greatest learning can take place. “Dealing with a fuzzy chaotic world devoid of any sort of order” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1052562912456296">Armstrong &amp; Fukami, 2009</xref>, p. 9), normally furnished by the tidy dimensions of classroom life, is where we have the greatest opportunity to facilitate knowledge generation that transcends any linear, lecture-driven approach. Indeed, we as faculty may need to get out of our own way and quite possibly the students’. When are we adding value and when are we fostering false dependencies in students, thereby creating the illusion of the “one best (or only) way?” It would be handy if there were a rubric we might use to make these decisions, but then that would be falling prey to the very objectivist approaches that I am saying are a good start but not enough. The tools of the discipline are a good place to start but a poor place to stop in our teaching and learning. This is where teachers can enter the conversation with those very questions that facilitate the AS classroom. This is where the art of teaching emerges. Provoking students with reflective questions for which there are rarely neat and orderly answers is the true role of an educator. Asking students to explain the thinking that led to decisions contributes to their understanding and our knowledge of their facility with ideas and concepts. The value of the teacher can truly manifest in fostering the abilities of critical thought. This, by definition, extends beyond the limits of simply discussing what is contained in the text.</p>
<p>Finally, how might we muster the courage to stand close to the edge, an edge where even we may tremble at the prospect of not knowing what will be learned or how a class session or term will turn out? Giving over the control and unleashing the potential of the unknown may likely be met with similar levels of courage in our students. Maybe now is the time for “a little less talk and a lot more action” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1052562912456296">Hinton &amp; Stewart, 1993</xref>).</p>

<title>Implications and Future Research</title>
<p>Given what appears as a great opportunity, it makes sense to begin more fully integrating teaching and practice with research that advances all three. This introduces Lewin’s idea of theory and practice to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1052562912456296">Boyer’s (1990)</xref> four domains in the scholarship of teaching and learning—discovery, integration across disciplines, application to problems in the lived world, and teaching—where all four unite in serving future professionals. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1052562912456296">Armstrong and Fukami (2009)</xref> concurred in their reflections on our CAO, thereby echoing much of the central message of this article. In sum, the future of the field is contingent on our ability to construct a connection between what we do and how it mirrors the content of our discipline. We must reduce the silo nature of management education as that does not reflect the nature of the worlds students will join. We must integrate practical knowledge with theory to solve meaningful problems in the learning agenda, which then carry that meaning over to the offices students will soon occupy. Given that our work is in the field of management, we must engage reflexively with it. Hence, what we do and how we participate in it is the very thing itself: The what of our field is the how of our classrooms—we are what we do. These areas can be the future research agenda for many years to come as we break free from only content and add process issues to the rich dialogue of scholarship of teaching and learning.</p>
