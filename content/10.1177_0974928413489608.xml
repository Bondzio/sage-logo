<p>India has long been dubbed as a superpower in waiting. India’s celebrated writer, politician and diplomat Shashi Tharoor, former Under Secretary General of Communication and Public Information at the United Nations, currently a Member of Parliament charged with the responsibility of human resource development as a Minister of State, is out with his latest book <italic>Pax Indica: India and the World of the 21st Century</italic>. The book was launched in Delhi by the Vice President of India, Shri Mohammed Hamid Ansari, in the presence of many eminent politicians, cutting across all political parties. In Mumbai, the book was launched by the Bollywood celebrity Shah Rukh Khan.</p>
<p>The book <italic>Pax Indica</italic>, unlike Pax Romana, Pax Britannica or Pax Americana is not an evocation about India ruling the world but is about India contributing to a cooperative world order. It quintessentially offers a narrative of India’s international relations not just for scholars but is also an attempt to enable its crisp understanding for all those who are intrigued about India’s foreign policy. The book comes at an apt time when the assumed custodians of the global order (the US and Europe) are beset with several domestic and economic problems, and are constantly imploring ‘rising powers’ to assume greater responsibility in the world.</p>
<p><italic>Pax Indica</italic> is a fairly copious book having a multi-pronged orientation. First and foremost it talks about India’s national interests, and what any Indian at the grassroots expects out of India’s foreign policy. Additionally, <italic>Pax Indica</italic> stresses on the link between foreign policy and domestic needs of a nation. According to Tharoor, Indian foreign policy ought to serve the interests of domestic transformation, of challenges of fighting poverty, of underdevelopment and assuring every Indian a decent share of life. From this ambition flows the importance of India having relations with those countries which are sources of trade, investment, energy security, and more importantly with countries which are sources of India’s food security. Besides this, it is not just India’s needs and interests that Tharoor talks about, but also about India’s responsibilities towards the world as all countries of the world are closely knit together and since internationalism has been ingrained into India’s policies ever since it was first declared by Prime Minister Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru during the course of his ‘Tryst with Destiny’ speech.</p>
<p>India’s neighbourhood has been extensively dealt with in <italic>Pax Indica</italic> given the axiomatic position it occupies in determining India’s foreign policies. For the continuing distress in relations between India and Pakistan, Tharoor squarely blames the military in Pakistan. With the insight of a diplomat and a minister, and echoing the frustration of an average Indian, he articulates, possibly for audiences both in India and Pakistan, that
<disp-quote>
<p>New Delhi could make it plain to Islamabad that unless there is genuine and substantial cooperation on bringing the 26/11 plotters to book, we will not hesitate to use the international mechanisms available to us to ask Pakistan awkward questions, and to bring the weight of the international community to bear on the issue of Pakistan’s failure to meet its international obligations. (p. 55)</p>

<p>The Indian subcontinent which remains besieged by hostility for most part requires new mechanisms to reinforce cooperation and dynamism. A constructive proposal, floated by Tharoor in his latest book, is that of a ‘sub-regional water resources management project’ involving Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and India which would bind these nations into cooperative partnership that would mutually benefit them and could later grow to involve other nations of the region. Such projects will demand collaboration from the actors involved and which may segue into the formation of a region flourishing as an economic or a socio-cultural–intellectual hub, instead of the conflict-riddled area which it currently reflects.</p>
<p><italic>Pax Indica</italic> brings to the fore several illuminating measures with regard to bilateral relationships between India and other nations and regions, which Indian foreign policy-makers can contemplate. In a somewhat provocative tone, it suggests that as a response to China’s overtures on Arunachal Pradesh and Kashmir, India should focus on a regenerated India–Taiwan relationship especially on the economic front. It promotes the idea of the Indian North-east region as a gateway to East and South-east Asia and refreshingly suggests that a burgeoning India-EU relationship can be conceived of as a genuine alternative to the blandishments of the US and China.</p>
<p>When Tharoor outlines India’s relations South-east Asia, with the Arab world, with Europe, Africa and Latin America and with the US, he purports to underline the fact that though non-alignment lies at the basis of India’s foreign policy, India needs to think beyond non-alignment to the present era of the multi-alignment. Tharoor emphasises the need for India to play a constructive role in the international network of nations and strive for the creation of a multi-polar world.</p>
<p>In addition, the book covers general themes on India’s forthcoming role on deciding the faith of global commons, encompassing the issues of environment, human rights, refugees, peacekeeping, drug trafficking, cyber space and the United Nations. Tharoor insists that India has the capacity to make a valuable contribution in the governance of the global commons as it is currently in a position to set the rules in the international system, as against merely accepting the rules set by more powerful countries.</p>
<p>Tharoor writes at length on leveraging India’s enormous strengths in the arena of soft power (due credits given to Professor Joseph Nye). The book also talks about India’s Grand Strategy in the world. He candidly enunciates the weaknesses of Indian diplomacy (as a former diplomat once remarked that India’s diplomacy is like the love-making of an elephant, which is conducted at a very high level, accompanied by much bellowing, and the results are not known for two years) and the Ministry of External Affairs. Tharoor concedes that though Indian diplomacy has become more agile and more reflective in the current times, yet he makes a crusade on particularly the woefully inadequate size of the diplomats (900 as against 20,000 in the US. In fact, the US has more professional foreign policy employees in the embassy in New Delhi than India has worldwide!). The recruitment policy of India’s diplomats (through the one-size-fits-all examination conducted by the Union Public Service Commission, which selects police, district magistrates, customs officers and, of course, diplomats!) is thoroughly criticised. He advocates an exam which would identify young internationalist minded Indians who have the curiosity of the world, who have the aptitude of foreign languages and know how to talk to foreigners and that the examination must be conducted all over the world for NRIs who know how to deal with the world on its own terms. He also suggests hiring mid-career professionals in the field and if required from the private sector on a contractual basis, who could contribute through their expertise, who would otherwise not be able to.</p>
<p>The leitmotif in the book is possibly the incessant reiteration of India’s non-revisionist stance in the world. Burdened with the ‘rising power’ title, India has to live up to the expectations which come along with this coveted caption. India’s domestic shortcomings must be addressed before India can successfully share the mantle along with the great powers. A nation-state bearing the label of a ‘rising power’ carries the onus of justifying this gratuitous title, along with the additional burden of overcoming abundant domestic problems which it faces on the way to great power status. The task on the shoulders of a ‘rising nation’ increases when it has to simultaneously allay the fears of both its neighbours and existing great powers about the benign nature of its rise. Given India’s rising power status, it becomes necessary to enunciate the non-threatening nature of India’s emergence in order to ensure that countries concerned are unflustered about the emergence of a new power. In a manner akin to Zheng Bijian’s ‘Peaceful Rise’ hypothesis about China, presented in the <italic>Foreign Affairs</italic> journal in 2005, Tharoor has attempted to portray India as a status quo power which has
<disp-quote>
<p>…no desire to challenge the international system as did other rising powers like Germany and Japan in the 19th and 29th centuries, but wish to be given a place at the global high table. Without that they would be unlikely to volunteer to share the primary burden for dealing with such issues as terrorism, climate change, proliferation and energy security, which concern all of us. (Tharoor 2012, 23)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Evidently, Tharoor’s experiences during his long stint as an international civil servant and those of his short but chock-a-blocked tenure as an Indian Member of Parliament have been harnessed to piece together <italic>Pax Indica</italic>. The author acknowledges and accepts the daunting challenges which India faces with regard to its neighbours and the world. Nonetheless, the running thread in the volume is that of hope; Tharoor remains hopeful of India accomplishing its goals and ideals in the world by overcoming the multitude of problems which currently beleaguer it. There are several novel ideas brought out in the book which could help to find a more enabling environment for India. However, like any other non-theoretical volume on foreign policy, its shelf-life will undeniably be short, given the dynamic nature of international relations. The book is found to be lacking in both economic and strategic assessment of India. Its greatest contribution, perhaps, will remain the attempt to enunciate the role foreign policy plays in the fulfilment of domestic requirements of a nation. The attempt to assuage great powers and apprehensive neighbours about rising India’s status quo orientation can be comprehended as another significant message intended by Tharoor in his latest literary outing.</p>
