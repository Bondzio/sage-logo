<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>I read with some disquiet Dr Philip Anderson’s commentary on galactogogues in the February 2013 edition of <italic>JHL</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334413483006">1</xref></sup> I agree with Dr Anderson’s comment that mothers and babies should be given every help to improve the breastfeeding and that domperidone (we never use metoclopramide) be used only as an ancillary measure. But there is no reason to do “everything” before recommending domperidone. Sometimes it is important to increase the milk supply, as for example, when the baby is refusing to latch on; more milk means more rapid flow and more rapid milk flow means the baby will more likely take the breast.</p>
<p>Dr Anderson glosses over the weaknesses of the studies that were used in the Health Canada-endorsed warning of 2012 and I don’t believe these weaknesses should be ignored. To begin with, the warning was from a company that makes domperidone and was endorsed by Health Canada.</p>
<p>In fact, there were not “differences between the ages of nursing mothers and the patients”; the ages were completely different, not overlapping by a long shot. The average age of the patients in the studies was 72.5 years in one<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0890334413483006">2</xref></sup> and 79.4 years in the other.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334413483006">3</xref></sup> Furthermore, many of the patients in the studies had pre-existing health problems such as high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure.</p>
<p>In one study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334413483006">3</xref></sup> the authors concluded that the <italic>risk of a cardiac problem related to taking domperidone in younger patients</italic> was much <italic>lower</italic> than in older patients. In fact, the risk quoted in younger patients was almost the same as that outcome occurring by chance alone (OR of 1.1 in those younger than age 60 compared with an OR of 1.64 in those older than age 60). That study also specifies that the <italic>risk in females was significantly lower than in males</italic> (OR of 1.25 in females compared with an OR of 2.23 in males).</p>
<p>The warning regarding the use of domperidone in higher doses (&gt; 30 mg per day) was based on only <italic>one</italic> of the two studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0890334413483006">2</xref></sup> the other study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334413483006">3</xref></sup> not mentioning any information about dosing. In the one study where dosing information was included, out of the 1304 deaths that were studied, only 10 patients were taking domperidone at the time of death. Of those 10 taking domperidone, only FOUR patients were documented to be taking higher doses of domperidone (&gt; 30 mg per day). <italic>Thus, this Health Canada-endorsed dose-related warning came from dosing data compiled from a total of FOUR patients.</italic></p>
<p>I have used domperidone for thousands of mothers having difficulty with breastfeeding over 25 years. Side effects reported to us have been few and very rarely significant, weight gain by the mother being the most distressful for the mothers.</p>
<p>Despite the studies quoted by Dr Anderson, we find that domperidone works well and not usually only temporarily for the vast majority of mothers, though the <italic>occasional</italic> mother does get only temporary increases in milk supply. We know things are better because we can see, by observation of the baby at the breast, that the baby is getting more milk.</p>
<p>With all due respect, I think one must stop depending only on studies done by those who do not work <italic>hands on</italic> with mothers and babies who are having difficulty with breastfeeding.</p>
