<abstract>
<p>Students cheat. For the field of public relations, which continually struggles for credibility, the issue of student cheating should be paramount, as the unethical students of today become tomorrow’s practitioners. Through a survey of 170 public relations majors, this study examined the importance students place on the Public Relations Society of America Code of Ethics, the extent to which they cheat, and the types of cheating behaviors in which they participate. Results of the study indicated cause for concern as close to 80 percent of students admitted to cheating. Moreover, the extent to which students cheated was significantly related to the number of their friends and close acquaintances whom they perceived as engaging in such behaviors.</p>

<p>Students cheat.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077695813476953">1</xref></sup> It would stand to reason then that students of public relations are not immune from such practice. For a field such as public relations that persists in a continual struggle for credibility, the issue of student cheating should be paramount, for the unethical students of today may become tomorrow’s practitioners. As Sims noted, those who engaged in many types and instances of academic dishonesty later engaged in many types of dishonesty in the workplace.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077695813476953">2</xref></sup> Moreover, the advent of online technology, from the basics of email and texting to the microblogging site Twitter and social networking site Facebook, has expanded the potential for students to share information both ethically and unethically.</p>
<p>Drawing from the fields of business ethics, education, and public relations, this study considered the relationship between students’ values, their cheating behavior, and the importance they placed on the Public Relations Society of America (PRSA) Code of Ethics as well as the influence of their peers. As educators struggle to instill the principles of the PRSA Code of Ethics into their students with varying emphasis from designated public relations ethics courses to introductory and senior-level courses, it would be helpful to understand the types of academic dishonesty engaged in by these students. Given that little research has been published on the use of online technology in cheating, the researcher felt that a background study based on the potentially outdated measurement scales used in major multicampus studies of undergraduate cheating behaviors in the 1970s and 1990s would provide a benchmark from which future study could be developed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077695813476953">3</xref></sup> The purpose of this exploratory study, therefore, was to examine the motivation of students as exemplified by the relationship between their values and behavior, the extent to which public relations majors cheat, the types of academically dishonest behaviors in which they participated, and the influence of their peers.</p>
<sec id="section1-1077695813476953">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>The two major multicampus studies of undergraduate cheating behaviors have indicated a majority of students engage in dishonest academic practices. Bowers implemented the first of these studies in 1963 on ninety-nine campuses within the United States and found that 75 percent of students admitted to at least one act of academic dishonesty.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1077695813476953">4</xref></sup> Three decades later a similar study on thirty-one campuses within the United States found that approximately two out of three (66 percent) of students admitted to at least one instance of cheating.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1077695813476953">5</xref></sup> Though the studies used different numbers of scale questions, ten questions from the first were duplicated in the second and both studies incorporated explicit types of cheating such as copying from another student on a test or turning in work done by someone else, as well as behaviors that could be considered less serious breaches of conduct such as padding references or unauthorized collaboration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1077695813476953">6</xref></sup></p>

</list>
<sec id="section2-1077695813476953">
<title>The Importance of Honor Codes</title>
<p>Additional studies have investigated the factors that hinder or encourage academic dishonesty among which were the importance of academic honor codes<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1077695813476953">7</xref></sup> and the significance of one’s peers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1077695813476953">8</xref></sup> It has been argued that “such codes place significant responsibility on students to maintain an environment of academic integrity, and evidence suggests they can be quite successful.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1077695813476953">9</xref></sup> Studies have also shown, however, that institutions with no honor codes may report low levels of academic dishonesty and institutions with honor codes may report high levels of academic dishonesty.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1077695813476953">10</xref></sup> As such, the authors suggest that honor codes need not only to exist, but that the culture of honesty be actively promoted for “[a] strong culture of academic integrity can exist at an institution that has no formal code but communicates the importance the community places on integrity in other ways.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1077695813476953">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The subject university follows an academic honor code. Enacted in 1995, the honor pledge is either required or implied for all student work submitted for credit. It asks students to pledge on their honor that they neither gave nor received unauthorized help in doing assignments. It explains that the pursuit of knowledge is diminished by cheating, plagiarism, and other forms of academic dishonesty and requires students to report to the instructor or other authorities any conditions that facilitate such behavior.</p>
<p>As such it can be expected that academic dishonesty will be lower than that reported in the earlier studies, which reported 75 percent and 66 percent of students cheated, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1077695813476953">12</xref></sup> Accordingly, the following hypothesis is offered:</p>
<list id="list2-1077695813476953" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>H1</italic>: Fewer than three-quarters (75 percent) of students will admit to violating the academic honor code at least once.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1077695813476953">
<title>Academic Dishonesty and Professional Behavior</title>
<p>Studies have linked academic dishonesty to employee dishonesty. For example, Sims found that “subjects who admitted to having engaged in a wide range of academic dishonesty also admitted to a wide range of work-related dishonesty.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1077695813476953">13</xref></sup> Additional studies have shown that student perceptions of business ethics are closely tied to their propensity to cheat in school.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1077695813476953">14</xref></sup> Thus, academic dishonesty not only serves to devalue, for example, the quality of academic grades but also may provide negative business impacts in the workplace. As a result, the importance of understanding and addressing this behavior seems clear.</p>
<p>Educators and practitioners alike have expressed concern about the credibility of public relations. Such concern is not new. Research from the late 1980s found that when practitioners were asked to estimate public perceptions of the ethical standards of various fields, they placed public relations third from the bottom, just above advertising and used car salespeople.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1077695813476953">15</xref></sup> In that same decade, Hamilton noted,
<disp-quote>
<p>More and more public relations people are concerned not only about the occasional dramatic case but also about finding a way to arrest the long, subtle drift into increasingly reprehensible behavior when an individual or organization loses credibility and honor and in the process prejudices the whole profession.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1077695813476953">16</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In an attempt to ease misconceptions of public relations and to create an ethical standard, organizations such as PRSA and the International Public Relations Society have developed professional codes of ethics that members agree to abide by in practice. Such codes may place the burden of ethical behavior squarely on the individual rather than on any formal enforcement practice. For example, from 1959 to 2000 the PRSA Code of Ethics included specifications for enforcement of ethical infractions under the jurisdiction of first a judicial panel and later a Grievance Board (renamed the Board of Ethics and Professional Standards, BEPS, in 1983). However, in 2000, the code was rewritten to no longer provide for enforcement of ethics, other than the ability to revoke membership for those who are found guilty of misconduct in a court of law.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1077695813476953">17</xref></sup> In a 2002 article in <italic>PR Tactics</italic>, Fitzpatrick discussed the challenges and opportunities presented by revisions to the PRSA code that removed provision for the enforcement of ethics:
<disp-quote>
<p>[T]he Code raises the professional bar for today’s PR professionals and puts them in charge of their individual and collective ethical destiny. Without a formal enforcement program in place, it will be up to each member to keep that bar high.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1077695813476953">18</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Even before the new code, practitioners advised caution when considering the value of professional codes, suggesting “that ethical codes are not a panacea, even when they can be enforced.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1077695813476953">19</xref></sup> Such codes, however, may nonetheless “help clarify ethical thinking and encourage ethical behavior.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1077695813476953">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>One could argue that the challenges faced by PRSA in the development of the new code are similar to those faced by institutes of higher education that implement honor codes. Both professional codes and honor codes serve to educate their target populations in standards of ethics and behavior, and both face the challenges of enforcement and sanction. Based on these limitations, the codes, though an important start, may need more depth before they can prove significant either as a deterrent or an inspiration. Despite the challenges, and based on the educational aspects of such codes and the existence of an academic honor code at the subject university, the following hypotheses are offered:</p>
<list id="list3-1077695813476953" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>H2</italic>: The importance of PRSA code values is positively related to student behavior.</p></list-item>

<title>Teaching Ethics to Students</title>
<p>Decades later the struggle for credibility lingers and within institutions of higher education, professors and administrators continue to struggle with the subject of how to address student cheating. Foremost among the recommendations made by members of the PRSA in the early 1990s as part of a survey that asked what improvements could be made to increase the ethical standing of their field was the need for ethics education at both the high school and college or university level.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1077695813476953">21</xref></sup> A later study also recommended advancing public relations education with more attention to studies of ethics, multiculturalism, international issues and to the use of technology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1077695813476953">22</xref></sup> Yet sixteen years after these recommendations were made, Cabot found that the public relations majors revealed low levels of moral reasoning despite the fact that prior studies had indicated a college experience led to higher levels of moral reasoning.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1077695813476953">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>More recently, a report from the Commission for Public Relations Education’s 2006 study noted that the recommended core courses or content areas had not significantly changed, except for the addition of two content areas in ethics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1077695813476953">24</xref></sup> The areas indicated were transparency and corporate social responsibility. Similarly, Gower and Reber noted that students felt less prepared for dealing with ethical issues than they should be based on the perceived importance they placed on that subject area.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1077695813476953">25</xref></sup> Given that the literature suggests ethical practice should be integrated into public relations curricula, the following question is posed:</p>

<sec id="section5-1077695813476953">
<title>Peer Influence and Academic Dishonesty</title>
<p>Research has shown that among the contextual variables that affect cheating, peer influence is most influential.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1077695813476953">26</xref></sup> Studies suggest not only that students may learn cheating behaviors from their peers, but also that such behaviors may provide “a kind of normative support for cheating.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1077695813476953">27</xref></sup> In other words, the researchers suggest that cheating “may come to be viewed as an acceptable way of getting and staying ahead.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1077695813476953">28</xref></sup> More seriously, research has also determined that overall, “the social multiplier for academic cheating is approximately three.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1077695813476953">29</xref></sup> In other words, for every person who cheated, three more were likely to cheat. As McCabe and Trevino noted,
<disp-quote>
<p>The strong influence of peers’ behavior may suggest that academic dishonesty not only is learned from observing the behavior of their peers, but that the peers’ behavior provides a kind of normative support for cheating. . . . [C]heating may come to be viewed as an acceptable way of getting and staying ahead.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1077695813476953">30</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>As such, the following hypothesis is proposed:</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Data were collected from 170 undergraduate students at a large southeastern university, who were declared public relations majors. Prior to beginning the surveys, students were given a blank sheet to place on top of their survey sheets so that their peers could not see their responses. During the informed consent process, they were also reassured that no identifying information would be collected and responses were completely anonymous. Using paper surveys, and with the permission of instructors, students from a large introductory course of about 100 students in an auditorium setting were asked to complete the survey, as were students from several higher level public relations courses of approximately 20 students each held in traditional classroom settings with seats placed in rows. Some instructors offered extra credit for participation. Students were eligible for participation regardless of major course of study, but for the purposes of this study, which sought information from public relations majors, responses from nonmajors were omitted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1077695813476953">
<title>Instrument</title>
<p>Initial demographic questions requested age and gender. The remainder of the survey instrument used in the study was composed of three parts. Part 1 of the survey was constructed on a 9-point scale with 1 = <italic>important to me</italic> and 9 = <italic>very important to me</italic>. Six questions were included in this section, to provide a scale of the PRSA’s Code of Ethics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1077695813476953">31</xref></sup> Students were asked to indicate how important they believed each item would be when they entered professional life. Specifically, students were told, “Within the next year or so you will be graduating and entering the professional world. The following is a list of things that some people look for or want out of professional life. Sometimes you find you have to give up a little of something important because something else is most important to you.”</p>
<p>The first item corresponded to the PRSA code provision for “accuracy” and asked students to rank the importance of “investigating the truthfulness and accuracy of information released on behalf of those represented,” while the second referred to “expertise” and asked about the importance of “building mutual understanding, credibility, and relationships among a wide array of institutions and audiences.” The third question corresponded to “loyalty” and asked about the importance of “being faithful to those you represent, while honoring your obligation to serve the public interest.” The fourth PRSA code item referred to “independence” and asked the importance of “encouraging clients and customers to determine if a conflict exists after notifying all affected parties.” The final two questions referred to PRSA code provisions of “honesty,” which asked about “being honest and accurate in all communications,” and a second item for “expertise,” which considered the importance of “preserving intellectual property rights in the marketplace.”</p>
<p>The second section of the survey was designed to measure student ethical behavior and their perception of the behaviors of their peers. Using the twelve-item scale of cheating behaviors developed by McCabe and Trevino,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1077695813476953">32</xref></sup> students were asked to identify the number of times they had engaged in specific types of violations of the academic honor code. Though this generation of students might not necessarily perceive some of these behaviors as cheating, the wording for this section of the survey defined the behaviors as such: “The following is a list of specific violations of the academic honor code. Please indicate approximately how many times you have done each of the following.” These twelve behaviors ranged from helping other students to cheat on a test, cheating themselves, omitting citations, submitting someone else’s work as their own, and collaborating when such collaboration was forbidden by the instructor. Additional types of cheating included use of crib notes on a test, using unfair methods to learn what was on a test before it was given, fabricating or falsifying a bibliography, and copying material and turning it in as your own work. Description of the cheating behaviors was purposely vague to allow students to interpret the statements within their own experience and to also retain the integrity of the original scale questions. Students were they were then asked to indicate the number of their friends or close acquaintances that they believed had engaged in any of the listed types of academic dishonesty.</p>
<p>The final section of the survey asked students to indicate which of seven undergraduate public relations courses and one mass communication course that is required for public relations majors they had taken or were currently taking. Such courses included public relations writing, public relations research, public relations ethics, and public relations campaigns. Further courses included visual communication, writing for mass communication, public relations strategy, and public relations issues.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1077695813476953" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 241 students responded to the survey, of which 76 were discarded because the respondents did not identify themselves as public relations majors. The majority of those responding were female (93 percent), with males representing less than 10 percent of the sample. The youngest respondent was 19 years old and the oldest was 28 years old, with a sample mean of 20.46 years.</p>
<sec id="section9-1077695813476953">
<title>Adherence to Honor Codes</title>
<p>The subject university adheres to an honor code; therefore hypothesis 1 posited that the incidence of cheating would be lower than that found in earlier studies, which respectively found 75 percent and 66 percent of students had cheated at least once.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1077695813476953">33</xref></sup> The results of this study found 77 percent of participants admitted to violating the honor code at least once. As a result, we must reject hypothesis 1—more of the students surveyed cheated than that found by either of the earlier studies. Furthermore, of those who cheated, approximately 25 percent cheated between two and four times, and an additional 25 percent cheated between five and eleven times. Just 5.3 percent admitted cheating once, while greater than 9 percent indicated they cheated more than twenty-six times.</p>

<sec id="section10-1077695813476953">
<title>Professional Codes of Ethics</title>
<p>Scale reliability for PRSA Code of Ethics items achieved a Cronbach’s alpha of .857.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 2 proposed that the importance placed on PRSA code values would be positively related to student behavior as exemplified through adherence to the academic honor code. Testing of hypothesis 2 through one-way ANOVA found lack of significant effect for the average importance students placed on the PRSA code items and the extent to which they engaged in academic dishonesty, <italic>F</italic>(26, 162) = 1.13, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05.</p>
<p>Use of one-way ANOVA identified relationships between individual PRSA code items and individual honor code items. Differences were found for the extent of importance placed on “accuracy” and the cheating behaviors of “copying material and turning it in as your own work,” <italic>F</italic>(7, 164) = 2.48, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, and “collaborating on an assignment when the instructor asked for individual work,” <italic>F</italic>(7, 164) = 2.10, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Item 3, which referred to the PRSA code provision for “loyalty,” produced differences in means for the extent to which students engaged in “cheating on a test in any other way,” <italic>F</italic>(6, 164) = 2.646, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, while item 4, tied to the concept of “independence,” produced differences in the extent to which students fabricated or falsified a bibliography, <italic>F</italic>(7, 164) = 2.42, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05.</p>
<p>Items 2 and 6 related to the PRSA code item for “expertise” and produced differences in the extent to which students “copied from other students during a test,” <italic>F</italic>(7, 164) = 5.128, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .00, “used unfair methods to learn what was on a test before it was given,” <italic>F</italic>(7, 164) = 2.29, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, “copied from another student during a test without their knowledge,” <italic>F</italic>(7, 164) = 3.63, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .00, and “helped someone else to cheat on a test,” <italic>F</italic>(7, 164) = 2.25, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. The final item corresponded to the PRSA code item for “honesty” and produced differences in the greatest number of cheating behaviors: “used crib notes on a test,” <italic>F</italic>(5, 164) = 4.30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .00, “copied from another student during a test,” <italic>F</italic>(5, 164) = 7.97, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .00, “used unfair methods to learn what was on a test before it was given,” <italic>F</italic>(5, 164) = 3.20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, “copied from another student during a test without his/her knowledge,” <italic>F</italic>(5, 164) = 5.01, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .00, “helped someone else to cheat on a test,” <italic>F</italic>(5, 164) = 3.07, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, “cheated on a test in any other way,” <italic>F</italic>(5, 164) = 2.40, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, and finally, “copied material and turned it in as your own work,” <italic>F</italic>(5, 164) = 3.49, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05.</p>

<sec id="section11-1077695813476953">
<title>Peer Influence</title>
<p>Hypothesis 3 suggested there would be a positive relationship between the frequency of self-reported cheating behaviors and the perceived number of students’ friends who engaged in academic dishonesty. Testing of hypothesis 3 through one-way ANOVA found significant differences in the reported frequency of cheating based on the number of their peers students perceived as cheating, <italic>F</italic>(16, 158) = 8.85, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, η<sup>2</sup> = .50. Moreover, using cross-tabulation, detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077695813476953">Table 1</xref>, as the self-reported frequency of cheating incidents increased, the perceived number of peers who cheated also increased from a low of just fourteen students who reported no cheating behaviors and no friends who cheated (8.4 percent) to a high of sixteen students who reported cheating twenty or more times and reported ten or more friends or close acquaintances had engaged in violations of the academic honor code. Overall, just fewer than 20 percent of participants indicated that none of their friends and close acquaintances had engaged in academic dishonesty (18.2 percent), while more than 26 percent of students indicated that ten or more of their friends or acquaintances had cheated.</p>

<title>Types of Cheating</title>
<p>Research question 1 asked, “To what extent and in which forms of cheating do public relations majors engage?” Results of this study found close to 80 percent of the students who participated in the study self-reported cheating behavior of some type. Just 20.6 percent reported no cheating behavior. Of those who cheated, about one quarter (24 percent) reported cheating between two and four times, while a further 27 percent reported cheating between five and eleven times. Almost twice as many students reported cheating twenty-six or more times (8.4 percent) as those who reported cheating just once (4.8 percent).</p>
<p>Of those who reported participating in a particular cheating behavior, the average number of times they reported engaging in that behavior ranged from 1.9 percent to 3.5 percent. Of the twelve types of cheating, unethical collaboration was cited most frequently, with 59 percent of students admitting to engaging in this activity at least once. The next two most frequent types of cheating relate to test taking, either copying someone else’s answers on a test (36 percent) or helping someone else cheat on a test (32 percent). The least reported types of cheating were the use of crib notes (10 percent) and turning in work done by someone else (10 percent). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077695813476953">Table 2</xref> identifies cheating behaviors, the number of students who acknowledged participating in each behavior, the percentage of these students based on the whole (<italic>N</italic> = 165), and the average number of times students engaged in each behavior.</p>

<title>Effect of Number of Courses Taken on Cheating</title>
<p>Research question 2 examined the relationship between the levels and types of academic dishonesty among public relations majors based on the number of public relations courses they had taken. One-way ANOVA of the frequency of cheating and the number and types of public relations courses each participant had taken resulted in no statistical significance, <italic>F</italic>(8,162) = 1.24, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05. The average number of classes taken by participants was approximately four (<italic>M</italic> = 4.1, <italic>SE</italic> = 2.2). Approximately 17 percent of students had taken seven to nine classes and 13 percent had taken just one class. Of those participating in the study, most had taken or were taking the introductory public relations course (98 percent) and 79 percent had taken or were taking writing for mass communication.</p>
<p>Moreover, 51 percent of students reported having taken public relations research and/or public relations writing. Just more than 15 percent of students reported attending the public relations ethics course. Results of one-way ANOVA found differences for those who had taken the public relations ethics course and just one cheating behavior, that of “copying a few sentences of material from a published source without citing or footnoting,” <italic>F</italic>(1, 164) = 7.14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .00. No effects were found between those who had taken the ethics class and any of the PRSA Code of Ethics provisions.</p>

<title>Discussion and Directions for Future Research</title>
<sec id="section15-1077695813476953">
<title>The Millennial Generation</title>
<p>Students have been self-reporting cheating behaviors for decades, and the students in postsecondary education today, known as millennials, not only are cheating, but are cheating a great deal. Yet, according to Wilson, students from the millennial generation “are described as special, sheltered, confident, team-oriented, conventional, pressured, achieving, optimistic and upbeat, accepting of authority, rule followers, and structured.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1077695813476953">34</xref></sup> Results of this study indicate that whereas millennials may be described as rule followers, they are not following the rules of the academic honor code at the studied university. Just fewer than 80 percent of the students surveyed self-reported engaging in at least one type of cheating behavior. This number is lower than the 91 percent reported by Sims,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1077695813476953">35</xref></sup> but higher than that reported by McCabe and Trevino,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1077695813476953">36</xref></sup> in which they found two out of three students admitted to cheating at institutions with academic honor codes.</p>
<p>Some of this cheating behavior may be explained by the technological environment in which these students have been raised and educated prior to entering college. As Wilson explained, this generation is technologically savvy and will use the Internet as a central academic resource, a resource they may use unethically.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1077695813476953">37</xref></sup> Furthermore, whereas they may understand that it is wrong to purchase a report online, the ease of downloading information may have blurred understanding that copying paragraphs and changing a few words is also wrong. She noted, “Perhaps related to real and perceived pressure to excel, some students are willing to cheat to succeed. Although most students know that quoting sources word-for-word requires a citation, some believe that paraphrasing does not.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1077695813476953">38</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1077695813476953">
<title>Mild Cheating versus Serious Cheating</title>
<p>Research has suggested that cheating may be less the result of lack of instruction or the situation, but more the result of students’ “general attitude about dishonesty.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1077695813476953">39</xref></sup> In a study that included rating of cheating behaviors from mild to very severe, researchers found that “over 30% of the behaviors admitted to were rated only as mildly dishonest by the raters.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1077695813476953">40</xref></sup> Considering the extent of student cheating, it would be interesting to conduct similar research on the degree of severity attributed by students to each type of cheating behavior. Future research might find that the most prolific cheating behaviors are those students perceive as only mildly dishonest. Given that the predominant form of cheating reported in this study was unethical collaboration, and given that this generation of students has been taught to collaborate and are team players,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1077695813476953">41</xref></sup> it seems likely that results would support Sims’s assertion that people engage in what they perceived as only mild cheating behaviors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1077695813476953">42</xref></sup> Because they have been taught to collaborate throughout their schooling, it may be that today’s students see unethical collaboration as a milder form of dishonesty, whereas they are likely to understand that turning in work by someone else is a severe form of dishonesty. Results of this study would support this notion, as one of the least reported cheating behaviors was turning in work done by someone else, a behavior most would understand as highly unethical.</p>
<p>Conversely, questions from students during the administration of the survey indicated a lack of understanding of the concept of crib notes, thus few students admitted to having engaged in this form of cheating. Today’s students do not appear to know what crib notes are, and therefore crib notes may now be known by another name, or they may have become obsolete. Focus group and individual interviews to determine both the rating and meaning of cheating behaviors to this generation of students would be helpful in identifying this shift.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1077695813476953">
<title>Peer Influence and What to Do?</title>
<p>The results of cross-tabulation of the number of reported cheating activities and the perceived number of friends and close acquaintances who cheat are clear and concerning. Yet the results are unsurprising given that peer groups are an important part of students’ social environments and that results from an earlier study found the “perception of peers’ behavior was the most influential contextual variable”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1077695813476953">43</xref></sup> related to academic dishonesty. But what can be done about it?</p>
<p>Perhaps education and clear explanation, with examples of cheating, could help to dissuade some students from unethical conduct. For example, Sims suggested that education was the key and that the mildly dishonest behaviors are the easiest to change. He noted,
<disp-quote>
<p>Most of the subjects who engaged in a very few dishonest behaviors only engaged in those that were considered slightly dishonest by the raters. These people considered themselves basically honest and would no longer engage in these behaviors if they knew that they were considered dishonest by their superiors (instructors, managers).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1077695813476953">44</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Similarly, Wilson argued that rules and expectations must be clearly laid out for the millennial generation. She argued, “If it is true that Millennial students are rule followers, they must first know the rules if they are to follow them.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-1077695813476953">45</xref></sup> Thus, further investigation into the definitions students place on cheating behaviors, discovery of new forms of cheating behaviors, and the rating students place on these behaviors is warranted. Until greater understanding of these issues is gained, it will be difficult for educators and employers to clearly set out expectations and explanations regarding all types of cheating from the mildly dishonest to the severely dishonest.</p>

<sec id="section18-1077695813476953">
<title>Tomorrow’s Practitioners</title>
<p>Today’s students are tomorrow’s public relations practitioners. Increased demands for transparency and accountability in practice provided relevance for this study that explored the correlations between the importance students place on professional ethics and their behaviors as indicators of how they are likely to perform as practitioners. Results of this study found little correlation between students’ professional values and their behavior; however, a strong correlation was found between student behavior and the perceived behavior of their peers. The dichotomy is troubling. Students place importance on professional codes of ethics, yet their behavior is unethical. So what is guiding their behavior?</p>
<p>Not only are students unethical, but they also perceive their peers as similarly or more unethical than themselves. It is disconcerting to find that more than three-quarters of the public relations majors in this university have violated the honor code. It is also disconcerting to discover how many students believe their peers cheat and the volume of that cheating. This and prior studies have indicated the influence of peers on behavior. Further research into student values and motivation seems warranted.</p>
<p>Social psychologists have posited that values provide guidance for behavior, depending on the individual’s goal in a given circumstance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-1077695813476953">46</xref></sup> A qualitative study of student goals and their rationale for cheating could help to further understanding. Such information could be profitable for those developing methods of education of ethical standards, prevention, and sanction.</p>
<p>Purcell argued that ethical codes can “help clarify ethical thinking and encourage ethical behavior.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-1077695813476953">47</xref></sup> This study indicates that students are aware of their academic honor codes and clear in their understanding of the standards espoused by the PRSA code, yet it has not altered their behavior. Will it alter their behavior when they graduate and become professionals? Will students who cheated in college change their ways once they are independent adults in a professional role? Possibly, but as prior research has found,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-1077695813476953">48</xref></sup> it is more likely that those who have behaved dishonestly as students will behave dishonestly as practitioners. As such, it would behoove both advocates of public relations in academic settings as well as professional practice to actively promote, exhibit, and educate others in behaviors that exemplify the best of public relations ethical standards.</p>

<sec id="section19-1077695813476953">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study is limited by the narrowness of the population studied. Students from just one university were analyzed, and a larger and more diverse population drawn from multiple universities could have added depth to the study. Furthermore, the students surveyed attend a large southeastern public university; as such, they are likely to be residents of the state in which it is located. Data from other states and regions could have added depth and breadth to the research. Moreover, inclusion of non–public relations students could balance the study.</p>
<p>While the study could have been improved through inclusion of the non–public relations majors’ surveys, the surveys were discarded early in the process and could not be retrieved. Future study should certainly include comparative information.</p>
<p>Most important, the study is limited by the nature of survey method. Qualitative in-depth interviews or focus groups could help gain understanding from students not only of why they cheat but also of how they define the categories used in the survey. It may be, for example, that collaboration means different things to different people, or that changing social norms have created a situation where students do not perceive certain behaviors as cheating or as unethical, while their elders do.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Public relations students cheat. Close to 80 percent of the 172 students surveyed admitted to engaging in at least one form of academic dishonesty. Moreover, the amount students cheated was highly correlated to the perceived number of friends and close acquaintances they believed also cheated. Yet this study used measures of cheating developed in the 1960s, which may not be completely relevant or accurate measures for today’s students. Qualitative study regarding students’ cheating behaviors and the reasons for this behavior is warranted. For example, do student cheat to keep up with their peers or to get ahead of their peers? Furthermore, and more important, there is a need for researchers to address the cheating behaviors engendered by texting, social networking, and microblogging sites and the challenges to addressing these behaviors. Evaluation of the levels of severity attributed to various cheating behaviors, including those engendered by new technology, could shed important light on the subject, providing educators with the ability to implement clearer rules, expectations, and explanations of these behaviors.</p>
