<abstract>
<p>Eliza Haywood’s narrators often display what could be termed ‘uncooperative narration’ in that they defy the smooth course that fictional narration is supposed to take, and claim to be unable to narrate strongly emotional states (in <italic>Love in Excess</italic>, 2000; first published 1719) or precipitate readers’ reactions to future events (in <italic>The History of Miss Betsy Thoughtless</italic>, 1998; first published 1751). Haywood’s strategies of uncooperative narration are based on rhetorical figures which flout the cooperative principle underlying human communication according to Grice: the denial of narration, adynaton, flouts the maxim of quantity; the time-based playing with readers’ meaning-making, prolepsis, flouts the maxim of manner. This article will develop an account of uncooperative narration on the basis of Gricean pragmatics (Grice, 1989) and Tomasello’s work on communication and cooperation in human evolution (Tomasello, 2008), which extends the traditional narratological focus on unreliable narration. Uncooperative narration challenges readers to find the communicative purpose behind flouting figures like adynaton and prolepsis, contributes to the characterisation of the narrator and, in Eliza Haywood’s fiction, often holds up a mirror to readers themselves.</p>

<title>1 Introduction</title>
<p>Narrators can take different stances: they might present their storytelling as a shared communicative endeavour or they might taunt and mislead their readers. The present article discusses how Eliza Haywood’s narrators use rhetorical figures to flout the Cooperative Principle behind Grice’s maxims and, as they challenge readers to recover their communicative purpose, develop productive strategies of uncooperative narration.</p>

<title>2 The Invisible Spy</title>
<p>In the beginning of Eliza Haywood’s <italic>The Invisible Spy</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963947013489238">1759</xref>; first published 1754), the narrator goes through a ‘Cabinet of Curiosities’. Allowed to choose a boon from any of the magical items on offer, the decision is difficult: there is ‘illusive powder’, which ‘raises splendid visions in the people’s eyes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963947013489238">Haywood, 1759</xref>: I, 4); a ‘sympathetic bell’, as well as telescopes and microscopes bringing matters into closer and more detailed view. The narrator, who is called Explorabilis, walks through the armoury of the novelist, inspecting and contemplating different rhetorical tools. The identity of the narrator is never revealed, and in ‘the introduction to the public’, Explorabilis delights in playing through different personalities. ‘[B]ut whether I am any one of these, or whether I am even a man or a woman, [readers] will find it, after all their conjectures, as difficult to discover as the longitude’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963947013489238">Haywood, 1759</xref>: I, 2), she concludes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0963947013489238">1</xref></sup> I am using the feminine pronoun for Explorabilis here, because this seems to be an instance in which the author Eliza Haywood reflects on the varied roles that were ascribed to her in the course of her career, even though <italic>The Invisible Spy</italic> was published under the pseudonym of the narrator. Rather little is known about Haywood’s actual life (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963947013489238">King, 2012</xref> for a recent biography), yet she had a distinct public persona, variously as a prolix and promiscuous hack (in Alexander Pope’s <italic>Dunciad</italic> and Richard Savage’s <italic>Author to be Lett</italic>), as Mrs Novel, the epitome of the popular genre (in Henry Fielding’s <italic>The Author’s Farce</italic>), and as a philosopher in matters of the heart (in James Sterling’s poem ‘To Mrs. Eliza Haywood on Her Writings’). In her novels, Haywood sometimes draws on this public image of herself as the career author ‘Haywood’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963947013489238">Ballaster, 1992</xref>: 169–173; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963947013489238">Warner, 1998</xref>: 278).</p>
<p>In the introduction to <italic>The Invisible Spy</italic>, Haywood explicitly outlines the conditions of the cooperation which her narrator offers to her readers. The narrator seems to disavow the need for conjuring up fictional worlds and for pulling readers’ heartstrings in this allegorical story, professing a commitment to the truthful reporting of a story. Or, perhaps, she slyly implies that she has mastered these rhetorical tools already and has no need to equip herself with them. In either case, a relationship between the narrator and readers is established and a more or less duplicitous promise of cooperation is extended.</p>
<p>My reading of Explorabilis’ entry as a narrator brings together two different approaches to narrative as speech act: rhetoric and Gricean pragmatics. Rhetorical narratology, in the tradition established by Wayne Booth with <italic>The Rhetoric of Fiction</italic>, investigates the ways in which narratives engage readers. Mary Louise Pratt in <italic>Towards a Speech Act Theory of Literary Discourse</italic>, bases fictional communication on Grice’s Cooperative Principle: readers assume that authors will tell them a story that is worth their interest and that they abide by Grice’s maxims of quality, quantity, relevance and manner. In the beginning of Haywood’s text, Explorabilis makes this pledge to her readers, and she maps out her narrative as intimate and unadulterated. Explorabilis is, by and large, cooperative in her narration. She tells not too little and not too much (maxim of quantity); within the parameters of the storyworld, she tells the truth (quality); the narrative information she gives is to the point (relevance), clear, well ordered and concise (manner). Later on in the collection, Explorabilis however delays the closing of a narrative to indulge herself in following the adventures of a character further (thus violating the maxim of quantity) and, because readers will already have bought the book by now, she shrugs off the cooperative contract with them: ‘I am pretty confident, neither my reputation, nor the profits of my publisher, will suffer by [the readers’] ill-nature at this point’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963947013489238">Haywood, 1759</xref> I: 159).</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963947013489238">Pratt (1977</xref>: 159) remarks, narrators can violate, present clashes between, opt out from or flout any of the maxims.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0963947013489238">2</xref></sup> These are instances which I term ‘uncooperative narration’. In cases of uncooperative narration, readers assume that the author (unlike the narrator) keeps the Cooperative Principle and represents the narrator’s violations for a rhetorical purpose. Indeed, Grice himself resorts to rhetorical figures to describe particular strategies of flouting the maxims, such as metaphor, meiosis and hyperbole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963947013489238">1989</xref>: 34). In what follows, I will outline a general account of uncooperative narration in connection with unreliable narration and investigate the rhetorical uses of two figures which flout communicative maxims: adynaton and prolepsis. These figures allow the narrator to refrain from unfolding narration completely (adynaton) or in its proper course (prolepsis). Thereby, they violate the maxims of quantity and of manner (which includes ‘order’). Such instances of uncooperative narration, if used systematically, can alert readers to the personality of the narrator, and contribute to the build-up of narrative suspense as well as to the emotional involvement of readers, as they explore the tension between the basic assumption of cooperation in storytelling and its seeming violation.</p>
<p>My case studies for the use of these figures of uncooperative narration are <italic>Love in Excess</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963947013489238">Haywood, 2000</xref>; first published 1719) and <italic>The History of Miss Betsy Thoughtless</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963947013489238">Haywood, 1998</xref>; first published 1751). As a prolific bestselling author of the 18th century, Eliza Haywood develops her narrative strategies across a broad array of genres and contributes considerably to the shaping of the formal features of the novel. As we have seen with <italic>The Invisible Spy</italic>, Haywood is keenly aware of the rhetorical strategies of her novels, and she frequently creates a distinct narrator figure, who flouts maxims of conversation.</p>

<title>3 Flouting the maxims as rhetorical strategy: Unreliable and uncooperative narration</title>
<p>Like Explorabilis, most narrators suggest to readers that they comply with the Cooperative Principle. They establish a rapport with readers, promising to tell an entertaining and potentially moving story which is worth their time and attention. Consider the beginning of Eliza Haywood’s <italic>Love in Excess</italic>. We read:<disp-quote>
<p>In the late war between the French and the confederate armies, there were two brothers, who had acquired a more than ordinary reputation under the command of the great and intrepid Luxembourgh. But the conclusion of the peace taking away any further occasions of shewing their valour, the eldest of ‘em, whose name was Count D’elmont, returned to Paris, from whence he had been absent two years, leaving his brother at St Omer’s, ‘till the cure of some slight wounds were perfected.</p>
<p>The fame of the Count’s brave actions arrived before him, and he had the satisfaction of being received by the King and Court, after a manner that might gratifie the ambition of the proudest. The beauty of his person, the gaiety of his air, and the unequalled charms of his conversation, made him the admiration of both sexes; and whilst those of his own strove which should gain the largest share of his friendship; the other, vented fruitless wishes, and in secret, cursed that custom which forbids women to make a declaration of their thoughts. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963947013489238">Haywood, 2000</xref>: 37; the modern edition keeps Haywood’s original spelling)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These two paragraphs are full of narrative features which give readers to understand that this is the beginning of a narrative: they establish the storyworld in terms of time (after the end of the War of Spanish Succession in 1713) and place (Paris), introduce the main protagonist (Count D’elmont) and foreshadow the main conflict of the novel (the young ladies making ‘a declaration of their thoughts’). Because of the Cooperative Principle, readers read even passages which are much less to the point and succinct than Haywood’s (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963947013489238">Pratt, 1977</xref>: 51–56) in terms of ‘orientation’ (the exposition of a story in Labov’s sequence of ‘natural narrative’; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963947013489238">Labov, 1972</xref>: 369). The Cooperative Principle determines readers’ understanding of the author’s ‘implicatures’, that is, it cues readers to make allowances and calculations in meaning-making on the assumption that the author observes the Cooperative Principle (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963947013489238">Pratt, 1977</xref>: 154). Even if a narrative seemingly violates one of the maxims, the Cooperative Principle ensures that readers adapt their meaning-making accordingly. D’elmont’s brother, for example, who stays behind in St Omer, drops out of view completely as the novel continues. On the face of it, this seems a violation of the maxim of relevance. Haywood’s narrator, however, did not introduce him in vain: the brother will reappear in a surprise encounter later on in the novel. Such small-scale, temporary violations of the maxims run through any narrative, and readers fall back on the Cooperative Principle to account for them.</p>
<p>For narration to be perceived as ‘uncooperative’, it needs to violate the maxims of communication in a more explicit manner and/or on a more concerted scale. The most avidly discussed example of uncooperative narration is unreliable narration, which violates the maxim of quality in that it is not truthful and evidenced. Because of the attention it has received in narratology, I will use unreliable narration as my guiding example to work out specific features of more general uncooperative narration. Wayne Booth’s classic definition establishes unreliable narration as follows, ‘I have called a narrator <italic>reliable</italic> when he speaks for or acts in accordance with the norms of the work (which is to say, the implied author’s norms), <italic>unreliable</italic> when he does not’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963947013489238">Booth, 1968</xref>: 158–159). James Phelan specifies Booth’s rather amorphous ‘norms’ in terms of factual knowledge, moral stance and perceptual knowledge, which might diverge between narrator and implied author (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963947013489238">Phelan and Martin, 1999</xref>). Grice’s conversational model covers mainly communicating information, and Phelan’s dimensions of factual and perceptual knowledge are therefore much more easily mapped onto Grice’s maxim (namely, that of quality) than the dimension of moral stance. Later on, I will suggest expanding Grice’s communicational model through insights in the development of social cognition, which will allow us to go beyond Grice’s brief and address the moral stance of the narrator in a joint communicational endeavour.</p>
<p>Unreliable narration flouts the maxim of quality as established for the storyworld. Fiction, of course, is by definition rarely truthful in the everyday sense. The unreliable narrator works against what is fictionally true, that is, what is the case in the storyworld. Grice’s maxim of quality, ‘Do not say what you <italic>believe</italic> to be false’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963947013489238">Grice, 1989</xref>: 27; italics are mine) has to be extended from the epistemological into the ideological. In the latter case, unreliable narrators do not say what they believe to be false but their beliefs about the storyworld and its norms are at odds with those the (implied) author projects. A further distinction, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963947013489238">Greta Olson (2003)</xref> stresses, has to be made between narrators who are ‘fallible’, because they do not know any better, and narrators who are ‘untrustworthy’ because they lie to readers. Each of these relates to the ‘quality’ of narration, but considering the different judgements of readers they are liable to elicit, the rhetorical perspective complicates Grice’s maxim considerably.</p>
<p>Booth sees unreliable narration as an instance of irony, in which the (implied) author and the reader communicate behind the narrator’s back. Following Booth, various degrees of distance between the unreliable narrator and the implied author have been established, which contribute to the characterisation of the narrator, because they draw attention to the way in which a story is told (the discourse level) and establishes a particular personality for the speaker (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963947013489238">Nünning, 2004</xref> for an overview). In a similar fashion, violations of other maxims arguably serve the function of characterising the narrator by highlighting the discourse level.</p>
<p>In her pragmatic account of unreliable narration, which similarly draws on Grice and Pratt, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963947013489238">Heyd (2011</xref>: 6) defines the phenomenon as a violation of the maxims of quality and quantity. These, however, seem to constitute two different kinds of uncooperative narration: in one case, the narrator tells something which is not true; in the other case, the narrator evokes a misleading impression through underreporting (or overreporting, and thereby obfuscating relevant facts). This distinction is captured in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963947013489238">Phelan and Martin’s (1999)</xref> taxonomy of misreporting, misregarding, misreading, underreporting, underregarding and underreading in unreliable narration. Yet, as Phelan and Martin suggest, ‘[n]ot all underreporting … constitutes unreliability’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963947013489238">1999</xref>: 95). Of course, in so far as ‘underreporting’ leaves out information necessary to establish the fictional truth, it is unreliable, but it is not necessarily so. Not all kinds of uncooperative narrators are unreliable. Narrators might violate maxims other than that of quality, like for example Sterne’s Tristram Shandy who regularly flouts the maxims of quantity, relevance and manner but not that of quality (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963947013489238">Pratt, 1977</xref>: 176; Pratt discusses Sterne’s narrator in detail in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963947013489238">1977</xref>: 163–178). Tristram Shandy would therefore be uncooperative, but is not unreliable in the strict sense.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0963947013489238">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Uncooperative narration can be seen as a mimetic representation of someone breaking the maxims of communication and “jeopardizing the CP” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963947013489238">Pratt 1977</xref>: 217). As a mimetic representation in literary narrative, breaking the maxims contributes to the characterisation of the narrator, while the actual Cooperative Principle between the reader and the author remains intact. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963947013489238">Pratt (1977</xref>: 215) assumes that the actual Cooperative Principle is ‘<italic>hyperprotected</italic>’ because of the selectiveness of the publishing market and the careful attention to detail in the editing process and that, for this reason, readers assume that everything they read has been written with an eye on tellability and cooperation; even Explorabilis’ snubbing of her readers. Readers derive the author’s implicatures accordingly, rationalising uncooperative narration as a feature which characterises the narrator rather than breaks the cooperative contract with the (implied) author.</p>
<p>Uncooperative narration challenges readers’ skills in deriving the author’s implicatures, that is, in figuring out the hidden purpose of why one of the maxims would be violated, flouted or opted out from. Gricean pragmatics can be fruitfully connected to the notion of social cognition (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963947013489238">Heyd, 2011</xref>) and ‘human cooperative communication’ in the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963947013489238">Michael Tomasello (2008)</xref> here, because both approaches assume that processes of shared intentionality underlie linguistic communication. According to Tomasello, human communication is fundamentally cooperative, based on our cognitive skills in creating joint attention and intention, and our social motivations to help each other and to share our emotional states. Tomasello’s account gives a scientific basis to Grice’s assumptions that humans, first and foremost, want to cooperate in communication. It includes the ethical dimension of communication, in the obligations and moral judgements involved in the social motivation of communication, which is important to rhetorical narratology, and addresses the issue of sharing and expressing emotions (as a strategy for ‘identifying with a community of like-minded people’), which covers a significant blind spot in Gricean pragmatics.</p>
<p>Because human social intelligence casts others as ‘cooperative agents’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963947013489238">Tomasello, 2008</xref>: 73) and because therefore Grice’s maxims are so deeply engrained in our cooperative meaning-making processes, these maxims can be violated, opted out from or flouted in complex fashions in literature. In fact, more than anything else, an uncooperative narrator seems to challenge our social cognition to recuperate him as an instance of cooperation after all. This creates a dynamic system of meaning-making in which flouting the maxims turns into a rhetorical strategy and a distinct personality emerges for the uncooperative narrator.</p>
<p>Haywood tends to reflect the levels of discourse and story in various ways for her novels, often reduplicating the fate of the heroine in the experience of the reader (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963947013489238">Black, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963947013489238">Lubey, 2006</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963947013489238">Tierney-Hynes, 2010</xref> for discussions of how Haywood merges the subject positions of author, reader and character from a non-narratological point of view). In <italic>Adventures of Eovaai</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963947013489238">Haywood, 1999</xref>; first published 1736), for example, Haywood creates an unreliable narrator (or cabal of translators, rather) who is discovered in the footnotes by the English translator. As the heroine finds out about the tricks and deceptions of the villain in the story, so do readers find out about the unreliability of the narrator in the discourse (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963947013489238">Ballaster, 2000</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0963947013489238">Wilputte, 1999</xref> for readings of the novel in this vein). As Haywood’s readers recuperate the cooperative author behind the uncooperative narrator, they understand the narrator as a character and learn to evaluate her rhetorical strategies. In her use of figures of uncooperative narration in <italic>Love in Excess</italic> and <italic>Betsy Thoughtless</italic>, Haywood puts this technique to striking effect.</p>

<title>4 Adynaton: Flouting the maxim of quantity</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I must leave it to your lordship’s imagination to conceive the wild tumultuous hurry of disordered joy which filled my ravished soul at this condescention; for I am now as unable to discribe it, as I was then to thank the dear, the tender author of it, but what <italic>words</italic> had not power to do, <italic>looks</italic> and <italic>actions</italic> testifyed. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963947013489238">Haywood, 2000</xref>: 196)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Monsieur Frankville is in love with Camilla, but his narrative discourse presents him as being incapable of expressing his emotions, both to Camilla (the ‘dear’ in the quotation) and to Count D’elmont to whom he tells the story. In addition, he also claims that he cannot narrate his emotional state to readers. The rhetorical effect concerns all levels of the narratological taxonomy, from character to embedded narrator and main narrator.</p>
<p>This rhetorical strategy is an instance of the figure of adynaton; Greek for ‘unable’ or ‘impossible’. Adynata usually take the shape of exaggerated comparison which expresses an impossibility, such as ‘if pigs could fly’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0963947013489238">4</xref></sup> Sometimes, they can also rest on the very mentioning of such impossibility, as is the case in Frankville’s narrative. In the shape of expressing impossibility, the figure of adynaton works as uncooperative narration. Of course, the very fact that the narration is interrupted tells readers something else: the narrator is so overwhelmed by the enormousness of the fact he was about to relate that he has to stop speaking. Adynaton is a figure of pathos, of the emotional involvement of listeners, not of logos (the rationality of the argument) or ethos (the moral stature of the speaker). It reveals the intense emotions of the narrator, which exceed the bounds of what can be expressed in words. When Frankville relates the events to Count D’elmont, he asks him to imagine his emotional state rather than describe it to him. Indeed, as Frankville asks D’elmont, the narrator of <italic>Love in Excess</italic> also expresses her own inability to her readers and asks them to imagine the emotions.</p>
<p>The intensity of the passions and the speechlessness of Haywood’s heroines have been understood in terms of hysteria, debilitating and disempowering the heroine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963947013489238">Ballaster, 1992</xref>). For some of the instances in which Haywood’s heroines are overwhelmed by their emotions, this is certainly the appropriate pathology. For the cases I discuss here, however, I would suggest rather that Haywood draws on the history of adynaton in love poetry when she expresses the narrator’s and the characters’ inability to speak. The adynaton is a key figure of Petrachan love poetry, and its continuation in the English and French sonnet tradition, relating the cruelty of the mistress or the eternal love of the speaker through long lists of impossibilia (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963947013489238">Fucilla, 1936</xref>). Haywood seems to have taken up the figure and developed it into a full-blown narrative strategy in her amatory fiction.</p>
<p>With Haywood, readers are not left entirely to their own devices in imagining the emotions, however. ‘The wild tumultuous hurry of disordered joy’, which Frankville experiences, does describe to D’elmont (and readers) his feelings rather precisely. It relates the kinesis of the bodily experience of the emotion (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963947013489238">Bolens, 2012</xref>). Frankville’s ‘joy’ is described in terms of a ‘wild tumultuous hurry’, presenting the emotion as a fast and uncontrollable bodily movement that seems to carry him along. Research in various domains of embodied cognition, from neuroscience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963947013489238">Gallese, 2011</xref>) to discourse psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0963947013489238">Zwaan, 2009</xref>), suggests that readers experience a bodily echo of performing such actions (and feeling connected emotional states). Reading, it seems, is something we do with our entire bodies, not just with our eyes and brains. Frankville can leave imagining his emotional state safely in the hands of D’elmont (and the reader) because he gives descriptions of the somatic state of his experience that evoke what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0963947013489238">Zwaan (2009)</xref> calls ‘motor resonance’ in readers’ bodies.</p>
<p>The very act of adynaton, stopping one’s narrative discourse to reflect on the inability to go on, arguably evokes a similar effect. Situations in which words fail us are usually of high emotional tension, and re-enacting this failure in adynaton communicates exactly this emotional state. The narrative discourse goes on, but instead of what the characters express verbally, it focuses on presenting ‘looks and actions’ which give an embodied description of the event. After the adynaton, Frankville describes indeed what he did: ‘I threw my self at her feet, embraced her knees, and kissed the hand she raised me with, with such fervor, as no false love could feign’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963947013489238">Haywood, 2000</xref>: 196). The seemingly thoughtless, automatic bodily actions of Frankville, represented in a series of unadorned subordinate clauses, go so deeply in his bodily substance that they allow for no artifice. Here, the figure of adynaton is extended into the speechless bodily actions that follow the moment of incapacity to speak.</p>
<p>Throughout her work in the 1720s and 1730s, Eliza Haywood employs adynata of this kind in her narrative discourse.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0963947013489238">5</xref></sup> In <italic>Love in Excess</italic>, they take the shape of rhetorical questions ‘what words can sufficiently express [Melliora’s] agonies?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963947013489238">Haywood, 2000</xref>: 158), exclamations or narratorial statements of defeat such as ‘‘‘Tis impossible for me to express’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963947013489238">Haywood, 2000</xref>: 253). On the face of it, these adynata are uncooperative narration, because they disrupt the flow of narration and flout the maxim of quantity, but foregrounding their embodied dimension shows that they work as a strongly immersive rhetorical strategy.</p>
<p>Thinking of adynaton as an embodied strategy of communication blurs the boundaries between readers, characters and narrators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963947013489238">Bolens, 2012</xref>: 7 observes a similar collapse of narratological taxonomy). Such embodied simulation is perhaps less problematic for characters (who are thought to experience the storyworld) than for narrators (who, strictly speaking, should only report it).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0963947013489238">6</xref></sup> This has two consequences: firstly, narrators are fleshed out as character-like instances with their own experiences and intentionalities as they elicit embodied simulations in readers. Secondly, in Tomasello’s model of ‘human cooperative communication’, this sharing of emotional states serves to establish ‘a specific community of like-minded people’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963947013489238">Tomasello, 2008</xref>: 87). In Haywood’s case, this ‘community’ stretches from characters to narrators and readers and shares the same philosophy of love and the passions.</p>
<p>Speechlessness becomes a telltale sign of a character and a reader feeling passion as Haywood’s narrator evaluates the adynata.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>There is nothing more certain than that love … which those untouched by passion, are not capable of conceiving, yet it entirely takes away the power of utterance, and the deeper impression it had made on the soul, the less we are able to express it … and only fancy! a lovers fancy! can reach the exalted soaring of a lovers meaning! (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963947013489238">Haywood, 2000</xref>: 121)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Haywood’s narrators develop here, and across many other instances in her early fiction, an account of true love as physically overpowering through the uncooperative strategy of adynaton. This philosophy of love and embodiment would earn Haywood herself the honorific ‘Great arbitress of passion’ in James Sterling’s poem ‘To Mrs Eliza Haywood on Her Writings’. In fact, the line following ‘Great arbitress of passion’ reads: ‘As the despotick will the limbs, thou mov’st the heart’ (qtd. in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963947013489238">Haywood, 2000</xref>: 278). Supplying the feelings underlying speechlessness requires ‘a lovers fancy’, the imagination of one who knows what love feels like. When Haywood invites her readers to imagine what happens in the minds and bodies of the lovers through embodied simulations, she implies that they (also) know what love feels like. Indeed, readers’ response to what they read determines whether they are true lovers. Haywood’s fiction, in those moments of adynaton, itself becomes a test of the emotional integrity of her readers. The rhetoric of the ‘arbitress of passion’ knows exactly where to pause, to ‘imperfectly attempt to speak’, in order to elicit such emotional responses. When Haywood stresses that passion takes away speech, she establishes the adynaton as the tell-tale sign of true passion, which overwhelms her narrators, characters and readers. Haywood turns the figure of adynaton into a narrative strategy offering a particularly intense experientiality to her readers, demonstrating her privileged insights into love which shapes her public persona as an author, and establishing an emotional ‘community’ between reader, author and characters.</p>

<title>5 Prolepsis: Flouting the maxim of manner</title>
<p>In <italic>Betsy Thoughtless</italic>, Haywood explicitly thematises the cooperation between author and readers with regard to the order of narration. Like Henry Fielding in <italic>Joseph Andrews</italic> and <italic>Tom Jones</italic>, Haywood conceptualises the Cooperative Principle in terms of the companionship of narrator and reader along the path of the narrative. She stresses that she ‘will not anticipate that gratification, which ought to be the reward of a long curiosity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963947013489238">Haywood, 1998</xref>: 32).</p>
<p>Still, many of her chapters in <italic>Betsy Thoughtless</italic> work through proleptic narrative strategies and chapter headings which prefigure the reader’s response. Chapter 4 of <italic>Betsy Thoughtless</italic>, for example, ‘[v]erifies the old proverb, that one affliction treads upon the heels of another’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963947013489238">Haywood, 1998</xref>: 45), and indeed, in the chapter itself, Betsy’s unhappy dealings with Mr Gayland are soon followed by the end of her relationship to her other suitor Mr Saving. The trite proverb in the chapter heading and the suitor’s predictable actions reflect the conventionality of the language and postures of love which is topical throughout the novel. Within chapter 4, Haywood for example refers to Mr Gayland’s compliments as rehearsed in terms of ‘all the fine things his common-place book was well stored with’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963947013489238">1998</xref>: 45). Haywood addresses the tension between standardised expectations and individual experience throughout <italic>Betsy Thoughtless</italic>, and in particular the proleptic statements of her narrator highlight such problems with foregone conclusions.</p>
<p>While Haywood’s earlier fiction features no chapter partitions at all, her later novels make use of the Cervantine tradition of circumstantial chapter headings, which Fielding employs as well. As Birke puts it in her analysis of Cervantine chapter headings, ‘some [intertitles] do seem calculated to convey an adequate idea of a chapter’s contents, others appear as ironical, superfluous, mysterious, or self-contradictory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963947013489238">Birke, 2012</xref>: 211). In other words, they tend to challenge the Cooperative Principle, not only because they prefigure events in the story, but also because they violate various other maxims. Most of Haywood’s chapter headings are ironic in tone (Chapter 1: ‘Gives the reader room to guess at what is to ensue, tho’ ten to one but he finds himself deceived’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963947013489238">Haywood, 1998</xref>: 27); Chapter 19: ‘Will make the reader little the wiser’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963947013489238">Haywood, 1998</xref>: 149); III Chapter 4: ‘If it were not for some few particulars, might as well be passed over as read’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963947013489238">Haywood, 1998</xref>: 349)) and general in purpose (II Chapter 1: ‘Will satisfy the reader’s curiosity in some points, and increase it in others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963947013489238">Haywood, 1998</xref>: 181)).</p>
<p>The common features of Haywood’s chapter headings are that they ‘negotiate issues of authorial control’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963947013489238">Birke, 2012</xref>: 218) and that they do what III: Chapter 21 promises in general terms: ‘Presents the reader with some prognostics on events <italic>in futuro</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963947013489238">Haywood, 1998</xref>: 461). They serve as proleptic tools, giving readers a glimpse of what is to come in a narrative.</p>
<p>In the figure of prolepsis, the speaker presents the future as if it is already taking place (‘I am a dead man’) or precludes possible objections and refutes them (‘you will say … but actually …’). In <italic>Discours du récit</italic>, Gérard Genette amplifies this rhetorical figure of prolepsis into a larger narrative strategy. In the dynamics between story time and discourse time, that is, the time over which the story actually takes place and the time in which it is recounted, two mismatches can take place, one leading to analepsis, or flashback, and one leading to prolepsis, or flashforward. In prolepsis, the story jumps forward in story time to recount something that happens after the point in the story where we are now. This flouts the maxim of manner in the point ‘be orderly’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963947013489238">Grice, 1989</xref>: 27). Of course, most narratives are shot through with small-scale instances of this kind. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963947013489238">Bridgeman (2005</xref>: 131), in her cognitive account of Genette’s notion of prolepsis, suggests that readers generally anticipate future story events as they read along but that prolepsis is a special case of such anticipation because it is cued in a particular fashion. Haywood engages with the anticipations of her readers through her prolepses quite explicitly; so explicitly, in fact, that most of them are located on the third of three levels of ‘annonce’ (announcement) which Bridgeman distinguishes: (1) time-space of the narrator; (2) fictional world; (3) time-space of readers. Haywood almost consistently prefigures her readers’ responses and stresses the predictability of events, but she rarely gives away any particular events which the narrator will encounter or which will occur in the storyworld. The announcement in Haywood, the remark on future developments, is closely entwined with the anticipation of readers.</p>
<p>Even though Haywood’s chapter headings are strictly speaking part of the paratext, the epiphenomena of a narrative text like blurbs, titles and so on, in these particular chapter headings, the voice of the narrator is clearly heard, making them part of the narrative discourse. Haywood includes proleptical statements in her narrative discourse proper as well. Throughout, we read comments like ‘of this the reader will be able to judge on proceeding farther in this history’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963947013489238">Haywood, 1998</xref>: 142) and ‘The reader will probably think as Miss Betsy did, but the falsity of this conjecture, and the cruel return the good-nature of that young lady met with, will in due time and place appear’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963947013489238">Haywood, 1998</xref>: 186). Quite often, as prefigured by the first chapter heading I discussed in this section, the likely events that are set up in one chapter, and the expectations that have arisen in readers, are prefigured as liable to disappointment. This, of course, serves to keep readers on their toes and to encourage suspense. It also establishes a particular character for the narrator.</p>
<p>The prolepses serve as pointers that the narrator will inevitably disappoint and force readers to reconfigure their expectations. In this respect, Haywood’s narrator is quite similar to her heroine Betsy, a coquette who plays with the hearts of her suitors. Her contrivances, white lies and billets-doux orchestrate the affections and mutual apprehensions of her numerous suitors, stringing them along until she loses interest in their attentions. Betsy indeed ‘manages’ her relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963947013489238">Haywood, 1998</xref>: 137), just as Haywood’s narrator manages her encounter with the reader, prefiguring inferences, disappointing and gratifying them.</p>
<p>According to Spencer, the (reformed) coquette is a key character type in the 18th-century novel, and she gives Haywood’s <italic>Betsy Thoughtless</italic> as one of her examples of the type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963947013489238">Spencer, 1986</xref>: 140–144). As we see from the discussions of prolepsis in the novel, not only Haywood’s heroine, but also her narrator is a coquette, well aware of the basic tenet of the type: ‘[W]hen one parts with one’s cruelty, one parts with one’s power’ (from William Congreve’s play <italic>The Way of the World</italic>, qtd. in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963947013489238">Spencer, 1986</xref>: 145). Haywood makes this parallel between heroine and narrator quite explicit, for example, when she writes that Betsy said she ‘must use all her artifice in order to keep him in suspence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963947013489238">Haywood, 1998</xref>: 131). The ‘him’ can refer to both the suitor of Betsy and the reader of the novel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0963947013489238">7</xref></sup> Haywood’s prolepses do not have the ‘load of “predestination”’ which Genette observes for his examples, in particular <italic>Manon Lescault</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963947013489238">Genette, 1980</xref>: 67). Rather, they constitute a rhetorical strategy of toying with readers and their attempt to make sense of the story.</p>
<p>As the novel progresses, and the coquette reforms, Haywood makes readers experience this educational development, as her uncooperative narration, proleptically predicting and toying with convention, develops into cooperative, orderly narration. At the end of the novel, neither Betsy nor the narrator show themselves uncooperative, but disclose Betsy’s affection for Mr Trueworth as soon as he declares himself. There certainly is an air of irony and contrivance in the convenient deaths of the lovers’ respective spouses at the conclusion of the plot, but this new situation offers them the opportunity to approach each other without pretences (in the case of Betsy) and without easy accusations (in the case of Mr Trueworth). As she predicted in the beginning of the novel, Haywood instructs readers in overcoming the flaw of ‘want of a due consideration’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963947013489238">1998</xref>: 27), which both the coquette (in her indiscretion), and her critics (in turning the indiscretion into scandal) share.</p>

<sec id="section6-0963947013489238" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>6 Conclusion</title>
<p>There is a debate (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963947013489238">Backscheider, 1998</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963947013489238">Tierney-Hynes, 2010</xref> for opposing positions) as to whether Haywood in her career as an author consciously turns from risqué amatory fiction (such as <italic>Love in Excess</italic>) to moralistic prose (such as <italic>Betsy Thoughtless</italic>). Haywood’s most consistent feature, arguably, lies in her pioneering use of flouting figures to engender narrative strategies in her carefully crafted novels. Like Fielding, she creates distinct uncooperative narrators and reflects the experiences of characters, readers and narrators onto each other. Yet she also lets readers uncover the Cooperative Principle underlying her narration (be it through embodied resonances, be it through revisiting foregone conclusions) and thereby makes a larger point about the tension between emotional experience and social construction in the shared communicative endeavour.</p>
<p>Haywood’s fiction serves as an instructive case study for the tension between the cooperative thrust of human communication and its challenge through particular rhetorical strategies, which, on the face of it, seem uncooperative. If we understand the figures of rhetoric as formalisations of such uncooperative strategies, it becomes obvious that these features are not limited to localised, contained instances, but instead run through the entirety of a narrative. It also becomes clear that the use of these figures in literary narrative serves to create a narrator-figure through the tension between their flouting of the maxims and readers’ efforts to recover a cooperative communicator who aims to share their emotional experience (adynaton) or to manage readers’ attention successfully (prolepsis).</p>
<p>Grice’s model of communication represents an early attempt to describe human communication, and it has been developed through approaches like Relevance Theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963947013489238">Sperber and Wilson, 1995</xref>) and other pragmatic endeavours. Recent cognitive and evolutionary models of social cognition, such as Tomasello’s, reassert the pride of place which Grice gives to the notion of cooperation in communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963947013489238">Tomasello, 2008</xref>: xi). Considering figures as rhetorical strategies in an environment of cooperative communication could provide a useful approach for figural narratology, because it releases the figures of speech from their imprisonment in the canon of style.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0963947013489238">8</xref></sup> Just like Haywood’s ‘illusive powder’ and ‘sympathetic bell’ in <italic>The Invisible Spy</italic>, so do figures and the ways in which they engage with the tension between cooperation and flouting the maxims cut across the concerns of the individual canons and equip a narrator to flesh out her own narratorial stance.</p>

<p>In the 16th century, Ramist rhetoric began to favour style (which includes figures of speech and figures of thought) and to neglect the other four canons of invention, arrangement, memory and delivery. Considering figures in the context of cooperative communication reconnects them with the larger rhetorical strategies which shape the other four canons. This separation of the canons seems to be reproduced in the different contemporary traditions of rhetorical narratology: Genette, while aware of this division, focuses on figures of style, whereas rhetorical narratology in the tradition of Booth, rather seems to address the other four canons.</p>
