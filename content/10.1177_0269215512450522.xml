<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Urinary tract infection is the most common comorbidity found in patients with spinal cord injury due to structural and physiological factors such as neurogenic bladder, the vesico-ureteral reflux, high residual volume after bladder emptying and urinary tract calculi.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215512450522">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The prevention and treatment of cases of symptomatic and asymptomatic urinary infection are difficult, as reported by many studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215512450522">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215512450522"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215512450522"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215512450522"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215512450522">5</xref></sup> Authors have reported drug treatment with reasonable results, but drug-less therapies are badly needed to preclude and prevent side-effects such as microorganism resistance. In 1999, the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality (AHRQ, Rockville, USA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215512450522">6</xref></sup> published a review to analyse the evidence on prevention and treatment of urinary tract infections in people with paralysis. The conclusions were that the regular administration of prophylactic antibiotics for urinary tract infections, as used in many patients with spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis, was not based on good evidence. They suggested that in the future, researchers should focus on prospective studies to evaluate short- and long-term laboratory findings and signs and symptoms. Multicentre trials to evaluate the risk factors and the effectiveness of treatment and profile of urinary tract infections were also recommended by the Agency.</p>
<p>Many studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215512450522">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215512450522">8</xref></sup> performed in the field of neurology have demonstrated immunosuppression and other reported effects of acute exercise with high intensity on the immunologic parameters of athletes and sedentary people. Some studies have also demonstrated a beneficial effect of regular physical training with moderate intensity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215512450522">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512450522">10</xref></sup> There is still a lack of studies in the literature demonstrating the improvement of functional activities and their correlation with immune aspects of patients with spinal cord injury. No randomized controlled trials with these goals were found in the major databases such as Cochrane, Medline, Embase and Web of Science. Thus, the objective of this study was to compare the levels of negative urinary culture with and without aerobic physical training in patients with spinal cord injury.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0269215512450522" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Subjects with spinal cord injury between C5 and L2 segments according to the classification of American Spinal Injury Association participated in this single-blind randomized controlled trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215512450522">11</xref></sup> Subjects who take part in regular physical activity, subjects considered community ambulators, subjects unable to cycle in the cyclo ergometer with upper limbs or subjects who refused informed consent were excluded from the study. All participants signed informed consent and the study was approved by the local Ethics Committee (no. 027/01). The study took place at the physiotherapy clinic of a university hospital from 2004 to 2010.</p>
<p>The estimated sample was 18 patients in the intervention and control groups considering alpha = 0.05 and 90% of power to detect a reduction of 50% in recurrence or eradication of chronic asymptomatic bacteriuria.</p>
<p>After the consideration of including and excluding criteria, and signing the informed consent term, each subject was submitted to an assessment by a cardiologist; an X-ray of the thorax, resting ECG and physical exam were carried out, according to American Heart Association guidelines. This evaluation was performed as a screening for authorization to practise physical activity regularly. After the cardiac evaluation, patients were randomized into one of the groups (intervention or control). Randomization was performed independently by an administrator, not otherwise involved in the study. The numbers were generated using computer-generated randomization and an opaque, sealed envelope was attributed to each individual, containing the group to which he or she belonged. Following the randomization, each subject performed the stress test, the urine analysis and the urine culture at the beginning of the study (pre-training tests) and repeated them after 16 weeks. The assessor was blind to the type of intervention. The physiotherapy sessions were conducted in two groups composed of passive mobilizations, stretching and functional activity training.</p>
<p>In addition to the physiotherapy sessions, the intervention training group consisted of a 16-week programme of aerobic physical training, with activities for one hour, twice or three times a week. It included cycloergometer of upper limbs (Cybex), performed distance with a wheelchair, and general exercises to gain muscle power with progressive loading of residual muscle and muscle stretching. The intensity of training was determinate by maximum heart rate, reaching a goal of between 70% and 80% of this rate or estimated peak oxygen consumption. The subjects in the training group were continuously monitored with heart rate registered with Polar equipment. The control group were instructed to maintain their current activities of daily life.</p>
<p>A positive outcome was considered to be eradication of previous positive asymptomatic bacteriuria or continued negative urine culture. A need for antibiotics (with or without the presence the bacteriuria) during the period of training was characterized as a negative outcome. Patients were instructed not to use any drugs without communication with the healthcare clinic group. Patients were asked about use of antibiotics weekly. The assessor was blind to the type of intervention.</p>
<p>Urine samples were sent to the laboratory with the request for urine analysis and urine culture only, without describing any medical history. The urine analysis and urine culture were assessed using calibrated loops.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215512450522">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215512450522">13</xref></sup> The collection of urine was performed by catheterization or collection from the urinary jet. The criteria used were from the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research, which defines a diagnosis of significant bacteriuria as a count of &gt;10<sup>2</sup> colony-forming units per millilitre (cfu/mL) in subjects with intermittent catheterization and &gt;10<sup>4</sup> cfu/mL in subjects without catheterization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215512450522">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215512450522"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512450522">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The protocol used in the ergometry was progressive loading with an increase of 150 kg in each 3 minutes of cycling followed by 1 minute of rest in the final of each stage. During each rest phase the heart rate and blood pressure were measured. For security reasons, there was the option to work with a heart rate of 85–90% of the maximum, accompanied by the perceived exertion scale. The computed value to be analysed was the estimated peak oxygen consumption. A Polar sensor monitored the heart rate and the blood pressure was measured with sphygmomanometers and stethoscope (Tycos). To obtain values of estimated peak oxygen consumption, the equation of the American College of Sports Medicine was used:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215512450522">17</xref></sup></p>

<p>The stress tests were accomplished to verify if there was a significant increase of oxygen consumption in these patients to demonstrate the effectiveness of a physical training programme.</p>
<p>The descriptive analysis expressed the values of mean and standard deviation or median and interquartile range of each study group. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to determinate the normality of distribution. The variables normally distributed were compared by Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test. For comparison of estimated peak oxygen consumption between pre- and post-training period the Wilcoxon test was used. For the categorical outcome the exact Fisher test was used, then the relative risk was calculated. In order to determine whether there was a difference in reducing the risk of developing chronic asymptomatic bacteriuria between the groups, the absolute risk reduction and its magnitude was calculated by the number needed to treat with 95% confidence interval. Significance (<italic>P</italic>) was set at 5% and statistical software SPSS version 15.0 was used (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). All analysis was intention-to-treat.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The period of physical training in this study showed a significant increase in the estimated peak oxygen consumption in the intervention group and a significant reduction of the proportion of positive urinary cultures in patients with spinal cord injury doing the aerobic physical training, which did not occur in the control group. Moreover, the relative risk of protection was considered to be 0.20, which means that 80% of the patients who did aerobic training had less risk of developing chronic asymptomatic bacteriuria. In this study, the number needed to treat was 2; 1 out of every 2 patients who underwent this type of training did not have bacteriuria. The number needed to treat shows the magnitude of absolute risk reduction (57.1%) and allows us to weigh the benefits of prevention of an event in one patient against the costs and risks of a particular treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215512450522">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>These results can be explained by the following: (1) the effectiveness of the physical training programme was shown by the test of oxygen consumption before and after the training period; (2) the study design – a randomized controlled trial; (3) the lab exams of urine culture were done by a blind observer; (4) and the adhesion to treatment was high.</p>
<p>Some studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215512450522">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215512450522"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215512450522"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215512450522">22</xref></sup> reported the beneficial effects of the physical training of upper limbs in the cardiopulmonary system of subjects with disabilities of lower limbs. In a narrative review<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215512450522">20</xref></sup> of the effects of physical training of upper limbs, the authors also reported the benefits of exercise in the cardiopulmonary and metabolic systems.</p>
<p>The increase of oxygen consumption results in an increase of minute cardiac volume and of capacity of the muscle that uses the oxygen. A number of skeletal muscle adaptations originate from aerobic exercise, including an increase in mitochondrial density and enzymatic oxidative activity, changes in <sc>l</sc>-lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase, increase of capillary density, increase of sensitivity to insulin and transporter of glucose (GLUT-4), resulting in an increase in the oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215512450522">23</xref></sup> This indicates that skeletal muscle has a great capacity to respond to regular aerobic exercise, and this was what occurred with the group taking part in physical conditioning in the present study.</p>
<p>It is recognized that spinal cord injury, depending on the region of the lesion, results in loss of inspiratory and expiratory capacity because of partial or total loss of respiratory muscle, which leads to a reduction in the availability of oxygen for muscle consumption and a reduction in maximum oxygen consumption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215512450522">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215512450522">25</xref></sup> The results obtained in the present study suggest that such alterations do not interfere negatively in the intervention group.</p>
<p>The control group did not show changes in oxygen consumption. This steady state could be due to a reduction or no alteration of maximum systolic cardiac volume, as a result of maintaining or reducing the contractility and maximum heart rate, and a reduction of muscle mass and the oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215512450522">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a study involving 72 subjects with spinal cord injury who performed stress tests to measure oxygen consumption, the patients were divided into three groups according to the values obtained in the tests. After the data analysis, the authors found the rates of urinary tract infections and osteoporosis in the leg bones were significantly reduced with increasing oxygen uptake.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215512450522">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>The reduction of asymptomatic bacteriuria found in this study may be attributed to the regular practice of physical activity in moderate intensity, which affects the chronic release of catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine), hydrocortisone (immunosuppression mediator) and beta-endorphin, possibly increases neutrophils, eosinophil and basophils as well as natural killer cell activity and modulates macrophage function and T and B cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215512450522">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215512450522">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215512450522">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Interpretation of the correlation between exercise and immunity may include the distribution and redistribution of sequestrated leukocytes, involving organs such as the spleen and the lymph nodes during physical exercise or the reduction of cell adhesion, especially the distribution of supplementary CD8 cells and T cells by vascular endothelium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269215512450522">29</xref></sup> Many benefits have been associated with the regular practice of physical activity with moderate intensity, including higher resistance to high respiratory infections,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269215512450522">30</xref></sup> prevention of immunology and neuroendocrine deficits of stress effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269215512450522">31</xref></sup> and improved capacity in the immune system response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215512450522">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512450522">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269215512450522">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269215512450522"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269215512450522">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, the regular practice of physical activity in moderate intensity by patients with spinal cord injury may be an effective and safe method for the treatment of chronic asymptomatic bacteriuria. It is still important to emphasize that although this study has the statistical power to detect the differences between the two groups, it would be useful to perform new trials with a larger number of participants to confirm these findings and to carry out a future meta-analysis of a systematic review. A limitation of this study was that we did not assess the intake of fluids by the participants that could be made by urodynamic study.</p>
<p>This study demonstrated the need to implement controlled programmes of physical training inside rehabilitation units not only in order to improve the functional activities of subjects with spinal cord injury but also to prevent related morbidities.</p>
<p>There is a need for studies with methodological quality to demonstrate the acute and chronic effects of physical exercise on the immunology of subjects with or without physical impairments. The application of physical activity in patients with repeated urinary infections who have normal motor activity and diseases such as multiple sclerosis with bladder dysfunction is also necessary, as well as study of the urodynamics and urinary ion concentrations in patients with spinal cord injury submitted to physical conditioning.</p>
