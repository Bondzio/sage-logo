<title>Background:</title>
<p>Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSC) may have a potential dual role in soft tissue augmentation by suppressing inflammation and promoting regeneration. Due to these properties, there is increasing interest in their potential use in autologous fat grafting, particularly to the breast.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1090820X13496115">
<title>Objectives:</title>
<p>The authors isolate and compare ADSC derived from abdominal and breast tissues with a hypothesis that different adipose tissue sources may demonstrate different functional characteristics affecting outcomes in autologous cell transplantation in reconstructive and aesthetic surgery.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1090820X13496115">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells from abdominal and breast tissues were isolated and compared in terms of surface marker expression, differentiation capabilities, and both fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and receptor expression. Immunophenotype of macrophages was also investigated using cell surface markers following a 7-day co-culture period with ADSC.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1090820X13496115">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Results showed similar cell surface phenotype and multilineage differentiation capabilities of ADSC derived from abdominal and breast tissues. Variations of FGF expression were demonstrated on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, with a significantly higher expression of FGF2 seen in breast ADSC. Following the 7-day co-culture period, increased expression of the anti-inflammatory surface marker CD206 was identified, with decreased CD16 and human leukocyte antigen–DR on macrophages co-cultured with ADSC compared with controls.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1090820X13496115">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>The data indicate similarities between ADSC derived from abdominal and breast tissues. Significant differences were seen, however, in the expression of FGF2, which is important in angiogenesis and wound healing. The results support the utility of ADSC in cell-based therapies such as autologous fat grafting.</p>

<body>
<p>Fat grafting for breast augmentation or reconstruction has received much attention over the past few decades, but the safety and efficacy of autologous fat transfer continue to be debated. Among the concerns are the inflammatory response that may lead to fat necrosis, microcalcifications, and cyst formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X13496115">1</xref></sup> Additionally, transferred tissue is susceptible to mechanical damage during harvest, limited revascularization, and donor site morbidity. While the fate of the grafted fat has not been fully elucidated, its clinical utility has expanded over the past several years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X13496115">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X13496115">3</xref></sup> Of recent interest is the addition of undifferentiated adipose tissue–derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSC) to improve graft survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X13496115">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Originally isolated from the bone marrow stroma, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) provide structural and physiological support for bone marrow hematopoietic cells and, furthermore, are capable of differentiating into fat, bone, and cartilage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X13496115">5</xref></sup> Although first isolated around the same time as bone marrow MSC, adipose-derived progenitor cells derived from the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) were not identified as MSC until years later.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X13496115">6</xref></sup> It is now assumed that MSC in general provide microenvironmental stromal support for their tissue of residence, and in fat tissue, it is also assumed that MSC are progenitors of adipocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090820X13496115">7</xref></sup> Thus, ADSC could play a significant role in plastic surgery and tissue engineering by providing a novel source of self-renewing cells for soft tissue reconstruction or augmentation, in addition to their many other favorable regenerative roles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090820X13496115">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090820X13496115">9</xref></sup> Adipose-derived MSC are easily harvested, mechanically stable, readily expanded in cell culture, and used in clinical applications similar to their bone marrow–derived counterpart.</p>
<p>There is mounting evidence that in addition to transdifferentiation, MSC have unique immunomodulatory properties as well. A variety of in vitro studies with bone marrow–derived MSC have shown that they possess the ability to suppress activation and proliferation of immune cells such as T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and dendritic cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090820X13496115">10</xref></sup> Our interest is in the effect of MSC on macrophages, given their role in tissue healing and inflammation. Classically activated macrophages are associated with proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–α, interleukin (IL)–1β, and interferon (IFN)–γ, all of which recruit additional inflammatory cells to the site of tissue injury. Alternatively activated macrophages characteristically demonstrate IL-10, which has been shown to downregulate inflammation and, in some autoimmune disorders, is a marker of resolution of pathology. Recent evidence indicates that there is a spectrum of macrophage activation with variations in surface marker expression, cytokine production, and downstream effect on inflammation, which could serve as a therapeutic target in many applications in reconstructive surgery.</p>
<p>We have recently shown that co-culture of human bone marrow–derived MSC with peripheral blood monocytes results in a phenotypically anti-inflammatory macrophage with unique functional characteristics. These MSC-educated macrophages (MEM) demonstrate higher expression of CD206 and IL-10 with decreased TNF-α, as well as increased phagocytic activity, compared with macrophages cultured in isolation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090820X13496115">11</xref></sup> Taken together, this combination indicates a distinct alternative activation. The goal of this study was 2-fold. The first step was to characterize MSC isolated from both abdominal and breast adipose tissues given their utility in reconstruction and fat grafting. In addition to markers used to define MSC, we examined expression of fibroblast growth factors (FGF). Second, we wanted to explore the interaction between breast and abdominal AMSC when co-cultured with differentiating macrophages. We hypothesized that MSC isolated from different adipose tissue sources—breast and abdominal tissues—may demonstrate different functional characteristics in vitro, both in isolation and when co-cultured with allogeneic monocyte-derived macrophages. To our knowledge, there are no studies investigating the specific interaction between adipose tissue–derived MSC and macrophages, particularly those comparing abdominal fat with breast fat. We propose that these differences could contribute to the inflammation or fibrosis that may be seen following implantation of autologous fat grafts into breast tissue, and furthermore, the differences may have implications in tissue engineering strategies.</p>

<title>Derivation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Macrophages</title>
<p>All protocols to collect tissue samples were approved by the University of Wisconsin Institutional Review Board. Adipose tissue was harvested from normal healthy patients undergoing elective cosmetic surgery, either abdominoplasty (abdominal MSC) or reduction mammaplasty (breast MSC). Mesenchymal stem cells were isolated as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090820X13496115">12</xref></sup> Briefly, the excised adipose tissue was rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), minced, and digested with collagenase/PBS (Sigma, St Louis, Missouri) at 37°C for 45 minutes. The sample was neutralized with an equal volume of media and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 minutes. Red blood cells (RBC) were lysed with 3-minute incubations in RBC lysis buffer, and mononuclear cells were suspended in supplemented alpha minimum essential media (α-MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone, Logan, Utah), 1× nonessential amino acids (NEAA; Sigma), 4 mM L-glutamine (Sigma), and 100 U/mL penicillin, 0.01 mg/mL streptomycin sulfate (Sigma). After adherence of stromal cells to plastic plates, the culture media were changed to remove nonadherent cells. The cells were cultured in a 37°C incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>/95% humidified atmosphere. Media were changed every 3 days, and the cells were expanded until passages 4 to 6, at which time they were used for flow cytometry, differentiation experiments, and co-culture studies.</p>
<p>Macrophages from different donors were derived from peripheral blood monocytes of unrelated donors as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090820X13496115">11</xref></sup> and used in co-culture experiments. Buffy coat samples were obtained from normal healthy donors (Interstate Blood Bank, Memphis, Tennessee) and mononuclear cells isolated by density grade centrifugation. Mononuclear cells were then incubated with anti–human CD14 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, California) for 15 minutes at 4°C and washed to remove unbound antibody. A pure population of CD14+ cells was collected using an AutoMACS Pro Separator (Miltenyi Biotech) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The markers used to distinguish macrophages and dendritic cells are controversial, and there may be overlap; however, CD14 and CD163 are used to identify activated macrophages, with CD209 being characteristic of dendritic cells. This method has been shown to yield &gt;95% CD14+ with uniformly CD209–cell purity via flow cytometry in our laboratory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090820X13496115">11</xref></sup></p>

<title>Fluorescent-Activated Cell Sorting Analysis</title>
<p>Following culture expansion to P4, cells were removed from the tissue culture polystyrene flasks via trypsinization (TrypLE; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California). Resulting cell suspensions were incubated with 10 µL of Fc Receptor Blocking Agent (Miltenyi Biotech) in the dark for 15 minutes at 4°C. Surface antibodies were then added and incubated for 30 minutes at 4°C in the dark. Antibodies used were monoclonal mouse fluorescently labeled, specific to human, as follows: anti-CD14 allophycocyanin (APC), anti-CD31 APC, anti-CD45 phycoerythrin (PE), anti-CD90 peridinin chlorophyll protein (PerCP-Cy5.5), anti-CD105 APC (all eBioscience, San Diego, California), anti-CD14 fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), anti-CD29 PE, anti-CD34 FITC, anti-CD44 PE, anti-CD73 PE, and anti-CD90 APC (all BD Pharmingen, San Diego, California). The cells were washed with autoMACS separation buffer (PBS), 2 mM EDTA, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.2 (Miltenyi Biotech), and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS until ready for analysis within 24 hours. Control staining with directly labeled, isotype-matched monoclonal antibodies was included in all fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) experiments. Data were acquired by using an Accuri C6 flow cytometer (Accuri, Ann Arbor, Michigan) and analyzed by using CFlow software (Accuri).</p>

<title>Differentiation of Cells Toward Osteogenic, Adipogenic, or Chondrogenic Lineages</title>
<p>Cell differentiation into osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic lineages and subsequent detection were performed using established methodologies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090820X13496115">12</xref></sup> Briefly, MSC were treated with osteogenic, adipogenic, or chondrogenic medium (Miltenyi Biotech) for up to 21 days, with media changes every 3 to 4 days. Cultures were assayed for mineral content by Alizarin red S staining (Acros Organics, Newark, New Jersey) and for lipid accumulation by Oil Red O staining (Sigma). Controls included cells treated with standard culture media and stained per protocol.</p>

<sec id="section10-1090820X13496115">
<title>Co-culture</title>
<p>Once MSC were expanded to passage 4, they were plated in 6-well polystyrene plates at a concentration of 200 000 cells/well. Within 2 hours of plating the MSC, isolated CD14+ cells (1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells) were thawed, washed with PBS, and added to the surface of the plates. Cells were cultured in phenol red free RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% sodium pyruvate, and 1% NEAA for 7 days. The plates were kept in a 37°C incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>/95% humidified atmosphere for a total of 7 days. Following a 7-day culture, media (including nonadherent cells) were aspirated from each well. The adherent macrophages and MSC were harvested from the polystyrene surface using a cell scraper. The resulting macrophage suspensions were used for FACS analysis immediately.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Autologous fat grafting has been used for more than a century in reconstructing soft tissue defects, since it was first described by Nueber in 1893.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X13496115">3</xref></sup> The popularity of fat grafting has waxed and waned over the past few decades. With advances in surgical techniques to harvest and process the tissue to be grafted, autologous fat transfer has again gained interest, particularly to address breast reconstruction, asymmetry, and augmentation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090820X13496115">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090820X13496115"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090820X13496115">15</xref></sup> The physiological environment of breast adipose tissue is unlike any other subcutaneous or white fat in the body, such as the abdomen, given the close proximity to the mammary epithelial tissue. Here, adipocytes actively participate in the development of the mammary gland. For instance, lactation is characterized by rapid lipolysis and decreased adipocyte volume, while involution allows for lipid filling and expansion, largely due to bidirectional interaction between epithelial cells and adipocytes in the adjacent SVF. Likewise, it is thought that MSC may be functionally different based on their tissue origin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090820X13496115">16</xref></sup> While this difference may not be clinically relevant for some disorders, both the direct contact and paracrine effects of ADSC transferred from one tissue source to another, as in reconstructive surgery, warrant further investigation. To this end, we identified and compared AMSC from abdominal and breast tissue, looking at defining criteria as well as early markers of inflammation and healing.</p>
<p>Whether a simple wound or complex tissue transfer, inflammation and regeneration are highly integrated processes coordinated by a variety of cells, cytokines, and growth factors, with the end result often being fibrosis or scar. Fibroblast growth factors are key mediators in wound healing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090820X13496115">17</xref></sup> In general, this family of proteins is associated with endothelial cell and fibroblast migration and proliferation. They are thought to be responsible, in part, for angiogenesis associated with wound healing as well as granulation tissue formation. In vivo models of FGF application to wounded tissue demonstrate enhanced vascularization and re-epithelialization. Each member of the FGF family has a slightly different functional role; these proteins are often expressed differentially in most tissues, and their timing and patterns are variable. Interestingly, we found variations in expression of FGF between ADSC from abdominal and breast tissue with no differences in receptor expression. In particular, we demonstrated increased expression in FGF2 and FGF9 in ADSC derived from breast tissue and increased expression of FGF3 and FGF6 in AMSC derived from abdominal tissue. FGF3 is commonly associated with embryonic development and bone growth, and it is expressed at low levels in adult tissues, while FGF6 has been associated with higher expression in myogenic lineages. These findings may indicate a role for abdominal ADSC in skeletal muscle or bone regeneration in tissue engineering applications, in addition to soft tissue applications.</p>
<p>Breast ADSC showed higher expression of FGF2 compared with abdominal ADSC. FGF2 is highly involved in angiogenesis and collagen deposition and remodeling. Animal studies have demonstrated an increase in type I collagen stability associated with FGF2, while in the absence of FGF, the normal phenotypic expression of collagen is altered, with a loss of polarity and growth pattern.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090820X13496115">18</xref></sup> It is unknown how the differences observed in this in vitro model will translate clinically, specifically in autologous fat grafting. Augmented fibroblast proliferation and collagen deposition may lead to late fibrosis or thickening of the tissue disrupted by fat graft deposition. Alternatively, angiogenesis and neovascularization seen in wound healing models may lead to new vessel ingrowth to the transferred fat and reduce tissue ischemia or improve graft take. The exact fate of locally or systemically delivered ADSC has not been clearly established,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090820X13496115">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1090820X13496115">20</xref></sup> and it is easy to imagine ADSC-augmented tissue can be subject to either scenario. Additionally, the functional aspects of breast-derived ADSC are not as well studied as their abdominal or bone marrow counterparts. The question of which cell source will be more favorable in clinical use is important since cell-based therapies are rapidly expanding. For this reason, ADSC from abdominal tissues, harvested through lipoaspirate or excision, will be more likely to be clinically useful.</p>
<p>Our group has previously shown differential expression of pro- or anti-inflammatory markers of macrophage activation following culture with bone marrow–derived MSC, indicating an anti-inflammatory effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090820X13496115">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090820X13496115">21</xref></sup> In this study, we demonstrated a similar effect when co-cultured with ADSC, with no statistical difference between abdominal and breast adipose tissues. Clinically, both CD16 and HLA-DR are measures of acute inflammation, particularly in systemic disease and trauma; reduction in these markers on circulating macrophages may be an indication in the resolution of inflammation. There may also be an association with other acute phase proteins such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IFN-γ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090820X13496115">11</xref></sup> It has yet to be determined how data such as this, which demonstrate immunomodulatory and regenerative properties of ADSC, will translate clinically. Additionally, the engraftment or “take” of AMSC has been shown to be variable, potentially limiting the anti-inflammatory or regenerative effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1090820X13496115">22</xref></sup> However, as these cells are rapidly expanding to clinical trials and are also of interest in fat grafting, in vitro studies, like the current work, offer a controlled environment to explore cellular and molecular interactions and warrant further investigation.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>These data, taken together with the ease of isolation and culture expansion of ADSC, further support a role of abdominal adipose tissue derived in cell-based therapies and tissue engineering for their multipotent, immunoregulatory, and regenerative properties.</p>
<p>The results of this study demonstrate similarities in ADSC derived from adipose tissues of the breast and abdomen. These cells reliably express surface markers and multipotency characteristics of typical MSC. When co-cultured with macrophages, these cells do not promote an inflammatory phenotype; instead, we offer evidence of an alternative or MSC-educated macrophage phenotype, consistent with our work previously shown in bone marrow–derived MSC. Furthermore, the expression of several fibroblast growth factors and FGF receptors is similar between AMSC from breast and abdominal tissues. Emerging translational and clinical data on the addition of autologous progenitor cells to adipose tissue show promise for improved results, although long-term studies are necessary.</p>
