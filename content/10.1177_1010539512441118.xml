<p>Public health evolved out of the efforts of health professionals to combat infectious diseases. Despite the advances in public health and in clinical therapeutics, infections remain a challenge for the 21st century. As a reminder of these challenges, the World Health Organization has designated 24 March as World Tuberculosis Day. On this day in 1882, Dr Robert Koch described the studies that he had done to understand the cause of tuberculosis (TB) to a scientific meeting in Berlin. It is now 130 years since Robert Koch detected the cause of TB. Yet today the tubercle bacillus still poses great challenges to health workers, particularly in developing rapid and accurate diagnosis of clinical infections and characterizing public health risk. Once the diagnosis has been made there are problems with treatment, with the emergence of resistant bacteria and the difficulties of delivering reliable long-term treatment at low cost and often in remote areas.</p>
<p>In the 21st century, TB has taken on a new dimension as it is reactivated and invigorated in patients with immunosuppressive disorders, including HIV infection. In our region, undernutrition is diminishing, but the well-know synergy between TB and undernutrition, overcrowding, and poverty is a classic public health issue. Despite 130 years of public health effort since Koch’s Nobel Prize–winning discovery, today one third of the world’s population is currently infected with TB. World TB Day raises awareness of the global epidemic of TB and efforts to eliminate the disease. “The Stop TB Partnership,” a network of organizations and countries fighting TB, organizes the World TB Day to highlight the scope of the disease and how to prevent and cure it. The World Health Organization is working hard with member countries and nongovernmental organizations to cut TB prevalence rates and deaths by half by 2015.</p>
<p>Koch’s work on TB, the main reason he was awarded the Nobel Prize, was performed over a period of about 20 years. After his discovery that pulmonary TB is caused by an infection with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosae</italic> in 1882, he isolated tuberculin in 1890 and demonstrated the difference between human and bovine TB in 1901. Robert Koch also visited our region, and when he visited New Guinea at the beginning of the 20th century, he made important contributions to our knowledge of tropical diseases. There he found that patients with malaria have parasites in their red cells and that leprosy and bubonic plague are bacterial infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539512441118">1</xref></sup> Koch’s postulates are still learned by all public health students and are still widely applied. But as one commentator has lamented, no one has yet been able to step into the great man’s shoes and devise the “equivalent of Koch’s Postulates in sociobiology to explain and possibly avert large self-destructive behaviors” that are so important in chronic disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539512441118">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>This month we also congratulate one of the world’s great medical journals, the <italic>New England Journal of Medicine</italic>, on achieving 200 years of publication. Any visitor to the Harvard School of Public Health can go down into the basement of the Countway library and actually turn the pages of the full 200 years of copies that are kept there and discover a remarkable history of medicine and public health. Those with the right Internet subscription can sit at home and browse the same 200 years of history, including an article in the first issue on “Diseases that Resemble Syphilis,” written of course before the spirochaete had been discovered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539512441118">3</xref></sup> Interestingly, the editors have commissioned an anniversary article on infectious disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539512441118">4</xref></sup> Among the many challenges to health, infectious diseases stand out for their ability to have a profound impact on human health.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>Great pandemics and local epidemics alike have influenced the course of wars, determined the fates of nations and empires, and affected the progress of civilization, making infections compelling actors in the drama of human history. For 200 years, the Journal has captured the backdrop to this human drama in thousands of articles about infectious diseases and about biomedical research and public health efforts to understand, treat, control, and prevent them.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539512441118">4</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Infectious disease epidemiology is the “bread and butter of public health,” and the <italic>New England Journal of Medicine</italic> reminds us that even in the 21st century infectious diseases still have the potential for catastrophic and explosive epidemics. “Their unpredictability is exemplified by the bubonic–pneumonic plague pandemic in the 14th century, the 1918 influenza pandemic and the current pandemic of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and AIDS.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539512441118">4</xref></sup> TB remains fourth on the list of the world’s major infectious killers (after respiratory diseases, diarrheal disease, and HIV) with 1.3 million deaths in 2011.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539512441118">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Even in one of the world’s most advanced economies, TB was ranked in the highest priority group. To establish strategic priorities for the German National Public Health Institute, infectious pathogens were prioritized in accordance with their importance for national surveillance and epidemiological research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539512441118">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>All antibiotic and antiviral drugs have an inherent weakness that makes continued research into optimal treatment protocols and the development of new drugs. Almost all organisms that infect humans are able to evolve mechanisms of resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539512441118">4</xref></sup> This creates a continuing challenge for public health in minimizing resistance by optimizing treatment regimes and promoting the development of new drugs.</p>
<p>The theme anthem for public health, infectious diseases and in particular tuberculosis, should be one of the best known operatic arias, especially since it was popularized at the 1990 World Cup in Italy by Luciano Pavarotti, <italic>Nesum Dorma</italic> (none shall sleep). If we want to defeat TB, and other challenging infections, we must always be on the alert. It will need to be our theme as all public health and health care workers must constantly pay attention to the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of TB, and there is no time for sleeping. We need a new Robert (or Roberta) Koch for the Asia Pacific Region, perhaps one who can sing and raise the necessary funding!</p>
<p>While the members of APACPH and contributors to the <italic>APJPH</italic> may not be singers in the class of Pavarotti, we all work to promote health in our region and maintain the fight against infections. In this issue of the <italic>APJPH</italic>, infectious diseases make up a third of the articles, reflecting their continued importance in our region. We also include work on chronic disease, and the article on domestic violence highlights a public health issue that is all too common in our region. We hope these articles will stimulate thought, correspondence, and, most of all, continuing public health action in our region. Perhaps, we could hold auditions for a public health Pavarotti at the next APAPCH Conference in Sri Lanka in October 2012 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.APACPH2012.org">www.APACPH2012.org</ext-link>).</p>
