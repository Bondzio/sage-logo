<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The purpose of this review is to describe the prevalence of psychological distress in parents of children with type 1 diabetes (T1DM), the relationship between parental psychological distress and health outcomes, and parents’ psychological experience of having a child with T1DM. Clinical and research implications are presented.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0145721712445216">
<title>Method</title>
<p>A systematic mixed-studies review was undertaken to review the quantitative and qualitative research on the parental experience of having a child with T1DM. A total of 34 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0145721712445216">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The prevalence of parental psychological distress across all studies ranged from 10% to 74%, with an average of 33.5% of parents reporting distress at diagnosis and 19% of parents reporting distress 1 to 4 years after diagnosis. Parental psychological distress in parents of children with T1DM, regardless of how it was defined, was associated with higher child self-report of stress and depressive symptoms, more problematic child behavior, and lower child self-report of quality of life. Parental psychological distress also had negative effects on diabetes management. Themes of the qualitative synthesis indicated that parents perceived T1DM as a difficult diagnosis that contributed to significant family disruption. Adjustment occurred over time; however, ongoing stress was experienced.</p>

<body>
<p>In children with type 1 diabetes (T1DM), parents are ultimately responsible for daily management of T1DM, which has a significant impact on family life. Daily management of T1DM is time-consuming and requires a change to many well-established family routines. Although technological advances have greatly enhanced the ability of parents to monitor and manage T1DM in youth,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721712445216">1</xref></sup> the responsibility of T1DM management can contribute to parental stress, distress, and diminished quality of life. Understanding the experience of parenting a child with T1DM can provide insight into the challenges and needs of parents, thus informing the development of parental and/or family interventions. Considerable research has been undertaken to examine aspects of the parenting experience; however, there is a need to synthesize this literature to inform future research and clinical work.</p>
<p>Caring for a child with T1DM has been described as an overwhelming experience, requiring constant vigilance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721712445216">2</xref></sup> Parents must come to terms with having a child with a life-threatening illness and carrying out a labor-intensive and complicated daily regimen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721712445216">3</xref></sup> Parents live with constant worry about hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, heightened feelings of responsibility for their child’s health, and the desire to promote optimal growth and development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721712445216">4</xref></sup> At different developmental phases, new issues arise that require a complete reevaluation of previously established and effective management strategies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721712445216">5</xref></sup> The ongoing stress and worry manifest in elevated rates of parents’ perception of stress and increased risk for depression and anxiety.</p>
<p>There is considerable research on the prevalence of parental psychological distress and the impact of such distress on child and family outcomes. Although the majority of parents of children with T1DM adjust well, approximately 20% to 30% of parents report clinically significant distress, which has been defined as stress (life stress or parenting stress) and symptoms of anxiety, depression, and/or posttraumatic stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712445216">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721712445216"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721712445216">8</xref></sup> Parental psychological distress at the time of diagnosis has been found to predict later parental distress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721712445216">9</xref></sup> In addition, parental psychological distress has health implications for the parent, the child with T1DM, and the overall functioning of the family.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712445216">10</xref></sup> In parents of children with T1DM, psychological distress has been shown to affect family communication,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721712445216">11</xref></sup> increase family conflict,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721712445216">12</xref></sup> decrease the ability to parent effectively,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721712445216">13</xref></sup> negatively affect child psychological adjustment,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721712445216">9</xref></sup> and contribute to poor parental mental and physical health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721712445216">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Greater understanding of the relationship of parental psychological responses to having a child with T1DM is needed to guide clinical practice and future research. Thus, the purpose of this systematic mixed-studies review is to synthesize the research on the parental experience of having a child with T1DM, focusing on parental psychological adjustment. The aims are to describe the prevalence of psychological distress in parents of children with T1DM, the relationship between parental psychological distress and health outcomes, and the parental experience of having a child with T1DM. Clinical and research implications will also be presented.</p>

<title>Design</title>
<p>This systematic mixed-studies review was designed to identify and synthesize research pertaining to the parental psychological adjustment of having a child with T1DM. Although family conflict and communication around diabetes self-management may influence parental adjustment, the focus of this review was specifically on research examining parents’ psychological adjustment. Given the complexities of psychological adjustment and the broad array of data sources that inform this body of research, a systematic mixed-studies review was considered most appropriate to synthesize this literature and adheres to the reporting guidelines for systematic mixed-studies reviews.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721712445216">15</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section7-0145721712445216">
<title>Search Methods</title>
<p>A systematic search was conducted using the search terms <italic>parent, children, adolescents, type 1 diabetes</italic>, and <italic>adjustment, stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms</italic>, and <italic>depression</italic>. Databases included Pubmed, Scopus, CINAHL, and PsychInfo from 1994 to May, 2011, examining the literature post-Diabetes Control and Complications Trial until the present. Reference lists of publications were also reviewed. Inclusion criteria were (a) quantitative or qualitative research on parents of children with T1DM and (b) studies published in an English-language journal. Studies were excluded if the focus was on the child or family adjustment and did not include parental psychological outcomes or the parental perspective. Data were extracted from articles by category (qualitative and quantitative). Data display matrices were developed to compare and contrast research results by category. Content analysis was used to synthesize the qualitative research by coding significant statements, grouping codes into categories, and collapsing categories into final themes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721712445216">16</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section8-0145721712445216">
<title>Quality Assessment</title>
<p>A reviewer assessed each article for quality using a scoring system appropriate for mixed-studies reviews.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721712445216">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721712445216">17</xref></sup> Two reviewers are doctoral students and 1 reviewer is a nurse-scientist. The challenges of evaluating and comparing disparate methods based on distinct ontological, epistemological, and methodological traditions precluded use of a single quality appraisal instrument. Therefore, 2 different quality instruments were used, 1 for quantitative studies and 1 for qualitative studies (available upon request). The methodological quality of each study was calculated by totaling all items on the instrument whereby a score of 0 indicated a study with low quality and a score of 100 indicated a study with high quality. The means of the quantitative and qualitative quality assessment scores were then calculated. Each article was then compared with the mean of the respective type of article. Quality assessment scores were used to analyze results; however, no articles were excluded based on quality, as results of low-quality studies were consistent with results of high-quality studies. A dialectical and complimentary stance was used to synthesize results from quantitative and qualitative studies: quantitative studies were used to describe the prevalence and relationships between parental psychological distress and health outcomes, whereas qualitative studies were used to describe the parental experience of having a child with T1DM.</p>

<sec id="section9-0145721712445216" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The initial search yielded 168 articles. All abstracts were reviewed for eligibility. A total of 34 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review (14 qualitative and 20 quantitative). Reasons for elimination included focus on children, family functioning (without parental psychological assessment), and intervention evaluation. The overall quality of articles was moderate to high. The mean quality score of quantitative studies was 77.8 and ranged from 55 to 95. The mean quality score of qualitative studies was 77.5 and ranged from 45 to 90. Results of studies were consistent regardless of quality score.</p>

<title>Psychological Distress in Parents of Children With T1DM</title>
<p>The description of quantitative studies is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145721712445216">Table 1</xref>. Of the 20 quantitative studies, the prevalence of psychological distress in parents of children with T1DM was reported in 9 studies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145721712445216">Table 1</xref>). There were 4 studies that evaluated mothers and fathers separately, 3 studies that evaluated parents and did not distinguish between mothers and fathers, and 2 that evaluated mothers only. The mean age of children in these studies ranged from 4.4 to 14.4 years, and duration of diabetes ranged from a new diagnosis to a mean of 4.4 years. The authors used various definitions of parental psychological distress including measures of stress (life and parenting stress), distress (problems in diabetes), and symptoms of anxiety, depression, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The prevalence of parental psychological distress across all studies ranged from 10% to 74%, with an average of 33.5% of parents reporting distress at diagnosis and 19% of parents reporting distress 1 to 4 years after diagnosis. Longitudinal studies demonstrated a slight decrease in distress over time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721712445216">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721712445216"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721712445216">20</xref></sup> The prevalence of anxiety symptoms ranged from 21% to 59%, depressive symptoms from 10% to 74%, psychological distress from 29% to 33%, and symptoms of PTSD from 19% to 24% in parents of children with T1DM. In the majority of studies, the prevalence of parental psychological distress ranged from 20% to 30%; there was 1 study of parents of children with newly diagnosed T1DM (mean age, 9.7 years) with much higher rates of anxiety and depressive symptoms than the other studies (59%-74%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721712445216">21</xref></sup> Where assessed, mothers had higher rates of psychological distress compared with fathers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721712445216">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721712445216">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721712445216">20</xref></sup></p>

<p>Parents of children with T1DM were compared with matched controls in 3 studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721712445216">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721712445216">23</xref></sup> Higher parenting stress and lower parenting competence, self-efficacy, and parenting satisfaction were demonstrated in parents of children with T1DM in 2 of the 3 studies. Another comparative study indicated that parents of young children reported significantly more distress than parents of older children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145721712445216">24</xref></sup> Thus, in the majority of studies, parents of children with T1DM experienced greater distress and problems with parenting than other parents, which may negatively affect their children.</p>
<p>Parental psychological distress in parents of children with T1DM, regardless of how it was defined, was associated with higher child self-report of stress and depressive symptoms,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721712445216">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721712445216">18</xref></sup> more problematic child behavior,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712445216">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721712445216">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145721712445216">25</xref></sup> and lower child self-report of quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721712445216">12</xref></sup> The effects of parental distress on parenting and family life differed depending on whether the parent had increased depressive or anxiety symptoms. Parental depressive symptoms were associated with inconsistent discipline, lower parental involvement and warmth, lower family adaptability and cohesion, and higher family conflict.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721712445216">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721712445216"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721712445216">13</xref></sup> In contrast, higher parental anxiety was associated with higher maternal control and overprotectiveness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145721712445216">26</xref></sup> Thus, parental psychological distress appears to have a consistent, negative impact on parenting and family life.</p>
<p>Parental psychological distress also had negative effects on diabetes management. Higher reports of parental depressive symptoms were associated with lower parental monitoring of diabetes management,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721712445216">13</xref></sup> which plays an important role in guiding the daily decision making of T1DM management. However, higher parental anxiety was associated with greater parental involvement in diabetes management and less shared management, suggesting that anxious parents desired more control over daily T1DM tasks. Higher parental anxiety was also associated with decreased ability of parents to learn diabetes management and lower parental self-efficacy for diabetes management,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721712445216">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145721712445216">26</xref></sup> both of which could contribute to suboptimal T1DM management.</p>
<p>The relationship of parental psychological distress and metabolic control is still unclear and may be influenced by child age and how distress is defined. In 2 studies—both of which had samples of children younger than 5 years of age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712445216">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145721712445216">25</xref></sup>—no association between parental anxiety or parenting stress and metabolic control was found. In studies of parents with older children (mean age, 10.6 years), significant associations between increased life stress and poorer metabolic control were reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0145721712445216">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0145721712445216">28</xref></sup> In contrast, 1 study with parents of children younger than 9 years of age found that increased parenting stress was associated with better metabolic control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145721712445216">24</xref></sup> Taken together, these findings suggest that life stress is associated with poorer metabolic control but the relationship between parental stress or anxiety and metabolic control may be influenced by other factors.</p>
<p>Factors associated with parental psychological distress were also explored in several studies. Younger child age and longer diabetes duration were associated with higher parental distress and parenting stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145721712445216">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0145721712445216">29</xref></sup> Nighttime blood glucose monitoring and meal times have also been associated with higher parental stress and anxiety, particularly in parents of young children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721712445216">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145721712445216">30</xref></sup> Parents report considerable concern over hypoglycemia occurring during the night when children are sleeping and during meals if a child does not eat an adequate amount of carbohydrates. Across multiple studies, high levels of parental stress were consistently predictive of symptoms of anxiety and depression in parents regardless of child age and duration of T1DM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712445216">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712445216">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721712445216">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721712445216">21</xref></sup></p>

<title>Parental Experience</title>
<p>Synthesis of the qualitative research on the parental experience of caring for a child with T1DM provides additional insight into factors contributing to parental stress and distress. Fifteen qualitative studies on the topic were identified (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0145721712445216">Table 2</xref>). Various qualitative methods were used, including qualitative description (n = 10), phenomenology (n = 3), and case study method (n = 1). The majority of studies were conducted in the United States (53%). Two longitudinal studies involved interviewing parents over 1 year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145721712445216">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0145721712445216">32</xref></sup> Both mothers and fathers were included in the majority of studies (n = 12), whereas 2 studies included primarily mothers, 1 study included only mothers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721712445216">2</xref></sup> 1 study included only fathers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0145721712445216">33</xref></sup> and 1 study did not specify parental gender.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0145721712445216">34</xref></sup> Only 3 studies included single parents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721712445216">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145721712445216">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0145721712445216">34</xref></sup> The age of children with T1DM ranged from 1.5 to 17.3 years, age of parents ranged from 36 to 43 years, and duration of T1DM ranged from newly diagnosed to 8 years.</p>

<title>Difficult diagnosis</title>
<p>The experience of having a child diagnosed with T1DM was described as traumatic and devastating to parents. Parents described feelings of fear, anger, guilt, frustration, helplessness, hopelessness, sorrow, despair, and profound grief. As one parent stated, she felt “emotionally drained, exhausted, and wrapped up in grief” after learning about the diagnosis and treatment for her child with T1DM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0145721712445216">32</xref></sup> Parents felt ill-prepared to deal with the situation and were overwhelmed with the responsibility of caring for a child with T1DM. Although they described feeling motivated to learn diabetes management, the amount and complexity of information provided was difficult to grasp. One parent stated, “It was like being handed a big city phone book and you have to learn all the names before you go home.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0145721712445216">33</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0145721712445216">
<title>Family disruption</title>
<p>The initial management of T1DM contributed to a dramatic disruption in family patterns and routines. Family life revolved around diabetes, with a constant focus on meals, blood glucose levels, and insulin administration. Parents expressed the need for “constant vigilance” to determine the meaning of child behavior that could be indicative of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721712445216">2</xref></sup> They worried constantly about their capabilities in implementing the daily diabetes tasks and the effect on their child. Parents also expressed feelings of loss of spontaneity and freedom. They were initially reluctant to leave the house and expressed feelings of social isolation. They reported that alternate caregivers for their child were difficult to find due to the responsibility required for diabetes oversight. One parent stated that she felt “riveted to an inflexible regimen that left her drained and exhausted.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0145721712445216">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>Mothers were the primary caregivers in most families, and many had to rearrange work schedules or leave work in order to care for their child full-time. Parenting roles also changed dramatically. Parents noted that they experienced a disruption in the established parent–child relationship due to the need for them to control and supervise the child in new ways. One parent stated that he felt like the “food and time police.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0145721712445216">33</xref></sup> Parents reported challenges to regaining their sense of competence as parents and allowing their child developmentally appropriate levels of autonomy. They also reported that they needed to make a concerted effort to spend time with other children and as a family.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0145721712445216">
<title>Adjustment</title>
<p>Over time, parents began to adjust to daily diabetes management tasks, developed a routine, and became more confident in their ability to care for their child. They worked hard to establish diabetes tasks as part of their everyday life and to ensure that their child had “as normal a life as possible.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721712445216">4</xref></sup> Some parents felt that their family had grown more cohesive as a result of going through such a challenging experience together.</p>
<p>Parents identified both professional (health care professionals) and personal (spouse, friends, family, other parents with children with T1DM) sources of support. Easy and constant accessibility to health professionals was reported to be critical to parents’ ability to learn and carry out the daily diabetes care required for the health of their child.</p>
<p>Parents reported that shared responsibility with their spouse was also a significant source of support, particularly for the daily problem solving and decision making required to optimally manage diabetes. Single parents who had sole responsibility for their child reported more difficulties with T1DM management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0145721712445216">34</xref></sup> Although many parents reported that friends and family did not provide support initially due to their own fears and emotional responses, over time, friends and family often became sources of support for parents. Support groups were reported to be helpful to some parents. However, some low-income African American and Hispanic parents were unable to identify any form or support, personal or professional,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0145721712445216">34</xref></sup> and several studies indicated that health professionals did not provide adequate emotional support to parents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0145721712445216">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0145721712445216">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>Parents identified effective coping strategies in some studies. These included the importance of developing a routine and making a conscious effort to “not let diabetes consume your life.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0145721712445216">37</xref></sup> Normalization, open communication, patience, persistence, flexibility, and creativity were reported as helpful for parents. Maintaining a positive attitude, being hopeful, and using humor were also expressed as effective coping strategies for some parents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0145721712445216">
<title>Ongoing Stress</title>
<p>Stress was reported to be an ongoing and pervasive aspect of caring for these children. Parents experienced stress due to the complex and time-consuming nature of the diabetes management tasks. Parents reported “a narrow road between high and low blood glucose” that was difficult to maintain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0145721712445216">38</xref></sup> Children’s blood glucose levels could be inexplicably high or low, and parents felt like a failure if their child’s blood glucose was not in the target range. Regularly inflicting pain on their child for blood glucose monitoring or insulin administration was a constant source of stress. Parents reported that their child would plead with them, “Mommy, please don’t hurt me anymore,”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0145721712445216">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0145721712445216">39</xref></sup> leaving parents feeling conflicted about their parental role to prevent harm and distress to their child.</p>
<p>The magnitude of responsibility for their child’s life was another source of stress for parents. Parents experienced feelings of stress as a result of the need to constantly monitor their child day and night, often to reassure themselves about their child’s safety. Furthermore, parents expressed daily worry about the child’s current health, concern whether they were adequately providing diabetes care, and concerns about long-term complications and the future health of their child. One parent reported that she “never stopped worrying.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0145721712445216">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>Episodic stress occurred with developmental or lifestyle transitions that altered effective diabetes management routines. Transitions to childcare, school, and adolescence were identified as being particularly stressful. The tension between encouraging experiences for their children to promote normal development and safety was always present. In addition, enduring sadness or “chronic sorrow” was expressed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0145721712445216">35</xref></sup> Feelings of loss—of a healthy child, control, freedom, and their ability to protect their child from harm—were still present for many parents 1 year after diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0145721712445216">35</xref></sup> For some families, the financial burden of caring for a child with T1DM was identified was a significant source of stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0145721712445216">34</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discussion and Implications for Diabetes Educators</title>
<p>Our review suggests that a significant number of parents experience profound psychological consequences including increased stress and symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD that have implications for parents, children, and families. This review provides insight into the range of psychological distress and the factors identified by parents of children with T1DM as stressful. Therefore, it is important for providers to consider assessing parents for sources of stress, symptoms of depression, and anxiety, all of which have implications for diabetes management, children’s and parents’ adjustment, and family functioning. Cameron and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0145721712445216">40</xref></sup> have advocated for screening parents of children with T1DM for psychological distress.</p>
<sec id="section17-0145721712445216">
<title>Assessment and Screening</title>
<p>Addressing parental stress appears to be particularly important, as higher parental stress was consistently associated with greater symptoms of anxiety and depression in parents. Assessment of parental stress is complicated in that stress can be defined as life stress (eg, financial), parenting stress, or stress unique to parenting a child with T1DM. In addition, a certain amount of stress may be beneficial to motivate for diabetes management,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145721712445216">24</xref></sup> but too much stress may be overwhelming, resulting in a lack of motivation and feelings of helplessness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0145721712445216">40</xref></sup> A brief and private (without child present) assessment of parental perceived stress during clinic appointments is warranted.

</table-wrap>
<p>Parents—and particularly mothers—of children with T1DM are at increased risk for depression, which was associated with negative effects on parenting, the child’s quality of life, and the child’s psychosocial adjustment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712445216">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721712445216">9</xref></sup> Results of this review also indicated that depression in parents of children with T1DM contributes to inconsistent discipline, lower parental involvement in diabetes tasks, less adaptability, higher family conflict, and lower monitoring of diabetes management. Research in the general population has established that maternal depression is a risk factor for child psychopathological abnormalities, especially depression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0145721712445216">41</xref></sup> Previous research supports the feasibility of having pediatricians screen mothers for symptoms of depression and stress at well-child visits to identify mothers with high levels and providing referrals to parents’ primary care providers, mental health providers, or community resources.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0145721712445216">42</xref></sup> In this study, it took providers less than 5 minutes to screen and provide appropriate recommendations for 95% of mothers (3% took 5-10 minutes and 2% took &gt;10 minutes) using a 2-item screening tool.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0145721712445216">42</xref></sup> Other commonly used depression questionnaires are identified in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0145721712445216">Table 4</xref>. The American Diabetes Association recommends screening of children with diabetes age 8 or older for depressive symptoms. Perhaps parental screening could be incorporated at the same time.</p>
<p>Assessing for anxiety in addition to depression in parents may also be indicated. Parental anxiety and depression have differential effects on family communication, conflict, adaptability, and parental involvement, all of which are critical to optimal management of diabetes and family functioning. Results of this review indicated that anxiety in parents contributed to increased maternal control, overprotectiveness, greater parental involvement in diabetes tasks, and lower self-efficacy. A review of observational studies with anxious parents and their children indicated that anxious mothers are more likely to be controlling or intrusive and less warm during interactions with their children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0145721712445216">43</xref></sup> It is possible that maternal anxiety leads mothers to take on responsibility for the majority of their children’s treatment management, which conflicts with developing needs for autonomy and independence in youth, resulting in either withdrawn or defiant behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145721712445216">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0145721712445216">44</xref></sup> The State Trait Anxiety Inventory could be used as a brief screening tool for parental anxiety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0145721712445216">45</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0145721712445216">Table 4</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0145721712445216">
<title>Screening and Intervening in Practice</title>
<p>It is well-recognized that there are numerous barriers to providing psychosocial care for parents in primary and specialty care, particularly with respect to the care of children with T1DM. Constraints on clinical time lead to shorter appointments in the clinic, with the primary focus on practical aspects of diabetes management and improvement of metabolic control. Since parents are not seen separately from children, parents may be reticent to discuss their emotional concerns in front of their child. If a child’s blood glucose is in target range, underlying emotional problems may be missed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0145721712445216">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>This review indicates that it would be ideal to screen parents for psychological distress at the time of the child’s diagnosis, during the first year of diagnosis, annually, and/or during child developmental transitions. High-risk parents, such as single parents or those from minority groups, should be assessed more frequently. Once sources of parental stress and symptoms of depression or anxiety have been determined, a protocol could be developed to delineate appropriate treatment options (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0145721712445216">Table 4</xref> for clinical recommendations). In several studies, parents indicated that they did not receive adequate psychosocial support from diabetes providers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0145721712445216">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0145721712445216">35</xref></sup>; therefore, providers may want to consider efficient mechanisms to address this. At minimum, providers should tell parents that stress and distress are common and should discuss the potential negative impact on the child and the possible benefits of supportive services. Parents may also need encouragement to seek support from partners, family, peers, and professionals.</p>

Successful interventions for parents may build on the strategies parents identified as being most helpful, including developing routines, finding and activating sources of support, and identifying effective coping strategies. The outcomes of screening and referral of parents to mental health services should be evaluated. Preventive interventions may be beneficial and may have greatest effects with young children and/or early in diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0145721712445216">40</xref></sup></p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There are several limitations of this review. We included only included published reports and did not attempt to find dissertations or unpublished research. Given the heterogeneity of the samples (eg, child age range, time since diagnosis), measures of parental distress, and overall diversity of studies included, it was challenging to make comparisons across studies. Finally, many of the studies had limited diversity in race, ethnicity, or family composition (ie, single parents) and included small samples.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Parents of children with T1DM experience considerable stress related to the trauma of diagnosis and the demands of treatment management. Although many parents find ways to effectively manage this stress, such as developing routines and finding sources of support, others experience clinically significant levels of psychological distress, including symptoms of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress. These symptoms have been shown to have negative effects on parenting, child quality of life, and child’s metabolic control. A better understanding of the experience of parenting a child with T1DM may help providers to identify parents at highest risk. Screening and preventive interventions are needed.</p>
