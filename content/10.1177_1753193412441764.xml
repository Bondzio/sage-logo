<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Coalition of the carpal bones can occur in various configurations with numerous reports highlighting different combinations. Carpal coalition is usually asymptomatic and is often an incidental finding observed on radiographs obtained for various reasons. We report an unusual case of bilateral carpal coalition.</p>
<p>A 31-year-old healthy Afro-Caribbean man presented to the hand clinic with symptoms of palmar hyperhidrosis. Examination revealed full pain free wrist movement bilaterally. Radiographs of his wrist revealed bilateral coalition of the capitate with the hamate and the lunate with the triquetrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412441764">Figure 1</xref>). A CT scan was performed to assess the extent and type of the coalition and to evaluate whether the coalition was contributing towards his symptoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412441764">Figure 2</xref>). No cause was identified and his symptoms resolved spontaneously.</p>

<p>Carpal coalition develops from failure of differentiation of the cartilaginous carpus during the fourth to eighth weeks of intrauterine life and is usually discovered incidentally on radiographs obtained for other reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412441764">Taleisnik, 1985</xref>). It is often asymptomatic but is recognized as a possible cause of wrist pain through associated arthritis, occult fracture or nerve compression. The most common coalition is between the lunate and triquetrum (os lunato–triquetrum). Delaney and Eswar described a series of 36 carpal coalitions in 24 patients. They found the condition to be far more common in the Afro-Caribbean population and in males with a 5:1 male to female ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412441764">Delaney and Eswar, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Minnaar studied luno–triquetral coalitions in 12 Afro-Caribbean patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412441764">Minnaar, 1952</xref>). He described fusion occurring in four types. Type 1, an incomplete fusion resembling pseudoarthrosis; type 2, fusion with a dividing notch at varying depths at the site of the usual division between the bones; type 3, complete fusion of the lunate and triquetrum alone; and type 4, representing complete fusion with other carpal anomalies. According to Minaar’s classification, our reported case is classified as type 4.</p>
