<p>This article presents a framework for developing and carrying out an implementation monitoring plan of a complex structural intervention in an organizational setting and describes seven steps for analyzing and reporting results for fidelity and completeness of implementation. This process is illustrated using the Environmental Interventions in Children’s Homes (ENRICH) Wellness Project. ENRICH aimed to promote physical activity and healthful nutrition behaviors among children residing in children’s group homes by working collaboratively with organizational staff. A comprehensive implementation monitoring plan was developed based on the particulars of the setting, context, and the program framework and used multiple data sources, criteria for evidence of implementation, and data triangulation to examine evidence for organizational implementation. Eleven of 17 organizations (65%) met the criteria for nutrition implementation whereas 9 of 17 (53%) met the criteria for physical activity implementation. Implementation data can be used descriptively, as described here, and may also be used in future outcome analyses to better understand project outcomes. The framework and evaluation approach are applicable to complex interventions in other organizational settings.</p>

<p>The purposes of this article are to present a framework for developing and carrying out an implementation monitoring plan for a complex structural intervention in an organizational setting, and to describe the steps for analyzing and reporting results for implementation fidelity and completeness. This process will be illustrated using the Environmental Interventions in Children’s Homes (ENRICH) Wellness Project, which was designed to promote physical activity and healthful nutrition behaviors (i.e., eating fruits and vegetables) among children and adolescents residing in 29 children’s group homes in North Carolina and South Carolina. ENRICH aimed to generate changes in the social and physical environments over 3 years by working collaboratively with organizational staff using a standardized process to create or enhance health promoting group home environments. This structural approach has the potential to improve the health of the vulnerable populations of children that reside in group homes over time. The comprehensive implementation monitoring approach presented here is specific to group homes; however, the framework and evaluation approach are applicable to complex structural interventions in other organizational settings.</p>
<sec id="section1-1524839912454286">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Structural interventions focus on changing factors within physical and social environments that are beyond an individual’s control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839912454286">Blankenship, Friedman, Dworkin, &amp; Mantell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839912454286">Cohen, Scribner, &amp; Farley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524839912454286">Matson-Koffman, Brownstein, Neiner, &amp; Greaney, 2005</xref>) and have the potential to positively influence population health, including obesity prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839912454286">Cohen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524839912454286">Institute of Medicine, 2005</xref>). Structural interventions face implementation and evaluation challenges because of their situation in “real-world” settings and focus on change in higher order units (e.g., organization or community vs. individual) that have inherent variability. Embracing the natural variations that exist in the implementation setting is a necessity when addressing physical, organizational, and social change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1524839912454286">Poland, Krupa, &amp; McCall, 2009</xref>). Additional challenges include contextual influences (e.g., staff turnover) and the need for extensive involvement of and cooperation from stakeholders for implementation as well as for longer time frames to institute change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839912454286">Chen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1524839912454286">Shadish, Cook, &amp; Campbell, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Structural interventions exemplify “complex” interventions, defined as interventions that interact with the setting during implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839912454286">Chen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839912454286">Cohen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839912454286">Foster-Fishman, Nowell, &amp; Yang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524839912454286">Hawe, Shiell, &amp; Riley, 2004</xref>). That is, the intervention is defined in interaction with the setting or context rather than as a standard set of components. In complex interventions implementation fidelity may be conceptualized best functionally rather than compositionally, as a standardized process aiming to achieve the same goals across varied settings rather than a standard set of activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524839912454286">Hawe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524839912454286">Hawe, Shiell, &amp; Riley, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, complex structural interventions pose evaluation design and execution challenges, which necessitate a comprehensive approach to program evaluation and implementation monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839912454286">Durlak &amp; DuPre, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839912454286">Medical Research Council, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Planning for Implementation Monitoring</title>
<p>ENRICH program and evaluation planning processes were guided by a series of seven steps, based on guidelines for developing a program implementation monitoring plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524839912454286">Saunders, Evans, &amp; Joshi, 2005</xref>) and methods for assessing organizational level implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524839912454286">Saunders, Ward, Felton, Dowda, &amp; Pate, 2006</xref>), derived from the frameworks presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524839912454286">Linnan and Steckler (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839912454286">Baranowski and Stables (2000)</xref>. The steps include describing the setting, context, and program; describing “fidelity and dose” for the program; developing implementation monitoring methods; developing criteria for evidence of implementation; collecting and organizing data during program implementation; applying criteria for evidence of implementation; and using implementation data. The steps are illustrated using the ENRICH program and are presented in the Methods (Steps 1-5) and Results (Steps 6 and 7) sections.</p>

<title>Step 1: Describe the Setting, Context, and Program</title>
<sec id="section5-1524839912454286">
<title>Setting and context</title>
<p>The setting for ENRICH was children’s group homes, part of the U.S. foster care system. Foster care provides 24-hour substitute care for children placed away from their parents or guardians and includes placements in nonrelative and relative foster homes, institutions, emergency shelters, and group homes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1524839912454286">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010</xref>). Children often enter the foster care system because of abuse, neglect, behavioral acting out, status offenses, pregnancy, family crisis, and substance abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839912454286">Badeau &amp; Gesiriech, 2003</xref>). In 2009, 423,773 children were in the U.S. foster care system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1524839912454286">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010</xref>). Most children are placed in nonrelative and relative foster homes (72%) with a smaller percentage of children in group homes (6%), which are nonfamilial 24-hour care facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1524839912454286">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010</xref>). Therefore, group homes play the role of “family/home” for the children they serve. Group homes may be funded publicly or privately and may undergo accreditation processes at state and/or federal level and are eligible for federal funding for U.S. Department of Agriculture meal programs.</p>
<p>Group homes vary on several characteristics, including populations served (i.e., social service custody clients, juvenile justice clients, or psychiatric clients), the spectrum of services provided (e.g., level of care and services ranging from basic shelter and care to mental and psychiatric treatment; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839912454286">Curtis, Alexander, &amp; Lunghofer, 2001</xref>), and size of population served. Twenty-nine group homes participated in the ENRICH evaluation study; at baseline, 12 and 17 of the homes were located in urban and rural settings, respectively; and 10 and 19 were located in South Carolina and North Carolina, respectively. Eleven participated in the National School Breakfast and Lunch Program, 19 were accredited, and 17 reported on-site schools.</p>
<p>Children who live in group homes constitute a unique, vulnerable population that is at risk for numerous health issues, including obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1524839912454286">Steele &amp; Buchi, 2008</xref>). Children participating in the ENRICH nutrition and physical activity evaluation study at baseline have been described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839912454286">Dowda, Saunders, Hastings, Gay, &amp; Evans, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839912454286">Evans et al., 2009</xref>). Briefly, half of the children (51%) were male; 40% were between 11 and 14 years old and 60% were 15 to 18 years old; 69% had been in the group home 1 year or less; and 48%, 33%, and 18% were White, Black, or other, respectively. At baseline, 57.7% were classified as normal weight and 42.3% were overweight or obese based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839912454286">Evans et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section6-1524839912454286">
<title>ENRICH program</title>
<p>Four elements from the structural ecologic model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839912454286">Cohen et al., 2000</xref>) and one element adapted from the coordinated school health program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839912454286">Allensworth, Lawson, Nicholson, &amp; Wyche, 1997</xref>) provided the framework for the health-promoting environment in the group home setting. The structural ecologic model targets four aspects of the environment that influence the behavior of individuals in populations: (a) availability and accessibility of protective or harmful products and services, (b) physical structures or characteristics of products and services, (c) social structures and policies, and (d) media and cultural messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839912454286">Cohen et al., 2000</xref>). ENRICH added an organizational, coordinating component to the framework based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidance for organizational infrastructure development to support health-promoting activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839912454286">Allensworth et al., 1997</xref>). The specific elements of the ENRICH structural ecologic framework for the nutrition and physical activity environments have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839912454286">Evans et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524839912454286">Gay, Dowda, Saunders, &amp; Evans, 2011</xref>). In summary, the health-promoting environment entailed providing opportunities for fun physical activity and eating tasty fruits and vegetables; strengthening adult social support and modeling, as well as positive media messages, for physical activity and eating fruits and vegetables; developing, strengthening, and/or enforcing policies supporting physical activity and eating fruits and vegetables; and developing organizational structures (i.e., wellness teams) to coordinate and support these changes.</p>
<p>ENRICH employed a group randomized design to test intervention effectiveness in which homes were matched on organizational characteristics and randomly assigned to an early (active intervention 2004-2006, <italic>n</italic> = 17) or delayed intervention (control with active intervention 2006-2008, <italic>n</italic> = 12) condition. There were 713 children between the ages of 11 and 18 years residing in the homes at baseline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839912454286">Dowda et al., 2009</xref>). This article focuses on implementation monitoring in the early intervention group.</p>

<sec id="section7-1524839912454286">
<title>ENRICH implementation approach</title>
<p>The overall goal was to promote physical activity and healthful nutrition behavior in the population of children residing in the group homes. ENRICH worked closely with the group homes over a 2-year period with a third, less-intensive transition year to facilitate change in the social and physical environments by partnering with the group home staff and working with wellness teams (adult staff working in the group homes). The wellness teams served as organizational change agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839912454286">Commers, Gottlieb, &amp; Kok, 2007</xref>) and intervention implementers within their respective organizations.</p>
<p>Two key elements of the ENRICH implementation approach entailed working in partnership with the group homes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839912454286">Green, Daniel, &amp; Novick, 2001</xref>) and conceptualizing the intervention as a standardized process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524839912454286">Hawe et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524839912454286">2009</xref>) to facilitate environmental change. Two school-based projects, LEAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524839912454286">Pate et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524839912454286">Saunders et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1524839912454286">Ward et al., 2006</xref>) and Gatehouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839912454286">Bond, Glover, Godfrey, Butler, &amp; Patton, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524839912454286">Patton &amp; Bond, 2003</xref>) have used this approach. The standardized intervention process involved training, technical assistance, and support to develop change agent (wellness team) capacity to assess and create sustainable, health-promoting group home environments. The characteristics of the health-promoting group home environment (see Step 2 below) provided a common goal toward which ENRICH staff and group home wellness team members worked. Changes in the group home environments were expected to favorably influence physical activity and nutrition behavior, specifically eating fruits and vegetables, among the children residing in the homes.</p>
<p>The ENRICH logic model, developed at the beginning of the project, described how the ENRICH implementation process was expected to create health-promoting group home environments and facilitate behavior change among group home residents (row 1 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524839912454286">Table 1</xref>) and was also used to organize the evaluation and implementation monitoring plan (rows 2 and 3 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524839912454286">Table 1</xref>). The process evaluation was designed to answer the following broad questions: (a) Were all elements of the ENRICH intervention delivered by ENRICH staff (dose delivered)? (b) To what extent did the wellness teams form and function effectively to assess and enhance the group home environment to support physical activity and eating fruits and vegetables within the group home (dose received)? (c) To what extent did the wellness teams carry out plans to create group home environments that supported physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption (fidelity and completeness)? (d) How many wellness teams were involved throughout the project (reach)?</p>

<title>Step 2: Describe Desired “Fidelity and Dose” for the Program</title>
<p>The iterative process of defining, in detail, the healthful environment for the children’s group home as the environmental target for the intervention involved multiple team discussions, and resulted in a description of “fidelity and dose” for the ENRICH intervention. The ENRICH Essential Elements defined the health-promoting environment, specifically environmental features, policies, and organizational practices to increase opportunities for physical activity and fruits and vegetables, enhance the acceptability of those opportunities, create a supportive social and media environment, and create supportive organizational policies, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839912454286">Evans et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524839912454286">Gay et al., 2011</xref>). Essential element development required an in-depth understanding of the group home environments and day-to-day operations, as well as a detailed conceptualization of the health-promoting environment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1524839912454286">
<title>Step 3: Define Implementation Monitoring Methods</title>
<p>The iterative planning process of defining implementation monitoring methods involved considering three elements: (a) developing detailed process evaluation questions; (b) determining process evaluation data sources, instruments, and data collection procedures based on these questions; and (c) addressing the influence of program resources, characteristics, and context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524839912454286">Saunders et al., 2005</xref>). The planning process culminated in developing the final process evaluation plan. Accordingly, the development of the ENRICH implementation monitoring methods included considering evaluation questions, methods, and instruments in an iterative process that involved frequent reference to group home organizational issues and the conceptual framework.</p>
<p>ENRICH tapped multiple data sources and organizational levels (e.g., administration, mid-level staff involved in recreation and nutrition, direct care staff, and children), as recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839912454286">Bouffard, Taxman, &amp; Silverman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839912454286">Dusenbury, Brannigan, Falco, &amp; Hansen, 2003</xref>) using a variety of data collection tools (e.g., documentation, interviews, written surveys, checklists and rating scales) and data collection procedures (e.g., record review, environmental observations, phone and in-person interviews, e-mailed and mailed self-report surveys). This multilayered approach to evaluation enabled ENRICH to triangulate information from multiple levels and points of view for a more complete understanding of project activities in this complex setting. The final ENRICH process evaluation plan, organized by the logic model (rows 2 and 3 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524839912454286">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839912454286">Cooksy, Gill, &amp; Kelly, 2001</xref>), included dose delivered and received, fidelity and completeness, recruitment and reach, and context.</p>

<title>ENRICH implementation fidelity and completeness</title>
<p>This article focuses on the “fidelity and completeness” element of the ENRICH process evaluation plan for the early intervention group in the ENRICH evaluation study. ENRICH fidelity and completeness addressed the activities of the Wellness Team, which served as the organizational change agents within the group homes with a focus on developing and carrying out plans to create or enhance health-promoting environments within the homes.</p>
<p>Instruments used to assess fidelity and completeness included: media observation, checklist administered annually by the evaluator; dinner observation, checklist administered annually by the evaluator; recreation recall, interview administered annually to direct care staff by the evaluator; end-of-year survey, interview administered annually to wellness team contact by the evaluator; postvisit assessment, rating scale completed by the evaluator following each site visit (once per year); end-of-intervention assessment, rating scale completed by interventionist at the end of the 2-year intervention; and staff rating scale, rating scale completed by all ENRICH staff once per year (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1524839912454286">Table 2</xref> for more detail).</p>

<p>Nutrition and physical activity implementation at the organizational level were assessed separately. Nutrition implementation was assessed using nutrition-specific items and physical activity implementation used physical activity-specific items to assess wellness team plan implementation in these areas using information from five data sources. The instruments, data sources, numbers of items, variable descriptions, sample items, rating scales or coding, and implementation criteria variables are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1524839912454286">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Step 4: Develop Criteria for Evidence of Implementation</title>
<p>Criteria for evidence of implementation must first be set for each data collection tool and for each organization (group home) and for multiple data sources for nutrition and physical activity implementation. Criteria for evidence of implementation, presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1524839912454286">Table 2</xref>, are specific to each instrument and depend on the response scale and the range of responses. In general, the score for evidence of implementation is expected to be 70% or higher, though some scores reflect 66% because of the 3-point response scale. The criteria at the group home level considered multiple data sources and required agreement on the majority of data sources: at least 4 of 6 data sources for nutrition implementation and at least 3 of 5 data sources for physical activity implementation, as indicated in the “Implementation Criteria” column in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1524839912454286">Table 2</xref>. These criteria are consistent with results from a review of implementation work indicating that 60% implementation produces positive results and that implementation above 80% is rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839912454286">Durlak &amp; DuPre, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>For overall implementation of nutrition and physical activity at the organizational level, group homes were classified as “higher/complete implementers” if they met the criteria in both components and as “medium/partial implementers” if they met the criteria in one component.</p>

<sec id="section12-1524839912454286">
<title>Step 5: Collect and Organize Data</title>
<p>Data were collected by one data collector according to the schedule described in the Methods section (Step 2). Data were entered into spreadsheets and imported into SAS Version 9.2 to create scores based on variable definitions, and were then presented in table by organization (group home) reflecting data sources used to assess for nutrition and physical activity as shown in a table in the Results section.</p>

<title>Step 7: Use Implementation Data</title>
<p>Implementation data can be used descriptively, to characterize level of implementation by organization and for the overall sample as well as for each component and considering all components: 65% met implementation criteria for nutrition and 53% for physical activity; and 29% and 59% implemented at the high or medium levels, respectively, when considering multiple components. Data on implementation for each organization can be used as an adjustment in outcome analysis examining intervention effects after conducting an “intent-to-treat” analysis. These data can also be used to group organizations by level of implementation to examine the effects of implementation or to examine factors that influence level of implementation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study aimed to present a framework for developing and carrying out an implementation monitoring plan for a complex structural intervention in an organizational setting, and to illustrate methods for analyzing and reporting results for implementation fidelity and completeness using the ENRICH project. ENRICH was a complex structural intervention in an organizational setting that targeted changes in the social and physical environment in children’s group homes as a primary study outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839912454286">Blankenship et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839912454286">Cohen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524839912454286">Matson-Koffman et al., 2005</xref>). Intervention and evaluation planning, conducted concurrently, were guided by a conceptual framework that defined the environmental change target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839912454286">Cohen et al., 2000</xref>). ENRICH was conceptualized as a flexible, adaptive intervention carried out as a standardized process across varied and complex organizational settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524839912454286">Hawe et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524839912454286">2009</xref>). This approach acknowledges and plans for the inevitability of program adaptation during implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839912454286">Chen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839912454286">Durlak &amp; DuPre, 2008</xref>). The ENRICH intervention and evaluation were planned and carried out with extensive input from stakeholders with an emphasis on the role of context in intervention design and delivery, as well as for monitoring and evaluation methods.</p>
<p>The process of defining the health-promoting environment in some detail for the group home setting was time consuming; however, it resulted in a shared understanding of the project goal among project staff and investigators, and produced a preintervention model and a detailed guide for the development of process evaluation measures, impact/outcome measures, intervention design, and intervention materials. It also facilitated clear communication with stakeholders about the focus of the project and the environmental change target, which enabled all partners to agree on and to work toward the same goal. Efforts to better understand the setting and context began the process of developing effective relationships with stakeholders and resulted in developing an intervention and evaluation approach that was agreeable to stakeholders and compatible with the setting. It is essential to note the planning process involved in defining the health-promoting environment cannot take place independent of understanding the setting and context for the intervention.</p>
<p>Implementation monitoring revealed less-than- complete implementation in the 17 intervention group homes for nutrition and physical activity implementation, which is consistent with the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839912454286">Durlak &amp; DuPre, 2008</xref>). Variability in implementation likely relates in part to inherent variability in organizational characteristics, resources, and complexity (e.g., rural vs. urban setting, populations served, and services provided), as well as the need for more time for organizational uptake of new policies and practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839912454286">Blankenship et al., 2006</xref>). More organizations implemented nutrition compared with physical activity environment changes. Higher nutrition implementation seems plausible because of the longstanding existence of infrastructure (e.g., facilities, staff, and procedures) to provide meals and snacks for children. Additional research, now in progress, is examining organizational, contextual, and other factors that influence levels of implementation for nutrition and physical activity environmental change.</p>
<p>Implementation monitoring was essential in ENRICH given the intervention complexity and organizational variability and geographic spread of group homes over two states; however, it was not feasible to conduct extensive observation within the 29 organizations with limited resources. Frequent interviews or surveys with group home staff would have been unacceptably disruptive to the group homes’ primary mission of caring for vulnerable youth. Therefore, we opted to systematically collect data over time from multiple data sources (e.g., change agents, direct observation, and project staff) using a variety of methods.</p>
<p>Triangulating data from multiple data sources did not produce a detailed understanding of all activities taking place in the group home, which is not likely a feasible goal given the geographic spread, variability among organizational participants, and complexity of the environmental change goals. Rather, this approach results in identifying patterns of activity that provide evidence for implementation. This information can be used to describe project activities and to understand project outcomes based on level of implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524839912454286">Pate et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524839912454286">Saunders et al., 2006</xref>). Areas that require further work include assessing reliability and validity of implementation monitoring measures, developing guidelines for developing criteria for evidence of implementation, and examining approaches to data triangulation. The specific results reported here apply to group homes in two states; however, we believe that this approach has implications for developing and implementing structural interventions into broader organizational settings.</p>

<title>Conclusions and Implications for Practice</title>
<p>This article illustrates a seven-step process for planning and carrying out implementation monitoring of structural interventions that collect data from multiple sources using multiple data collection methods and that triangulate across data sources to examine evidence for implementation. The results of this study support the feasibility of this approach to use in field-based intervention settings for planning and conducting comprehensive implementation monitoring. It requires dedication of resources, including up-front planning to develop a comprehensive planning model, skilled evaluation staff, and project-wide commitment to the approach. Furthermore, this approach must be conducted proactively; understanding the environmental change target (i.e., “complete and acceptable delivery”) at the beginning of the project is required to develop quantitative monitoring tools.</p>
<p>The approach described in this article has implications for improving development and implementation of evidence-based interventions into organizational settings. The “research to practice gap” is well documented and there are informative articles addressing this issue (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839912454286">Dzewaltowski, Estabrooks, Klesges, Bull, &amp; Glasgow, 2004</xref>). This study suggests strategies such as working with community members to ensure fit of an intervention into diverse settings, are feasible for intervention development and for efficacy or effectiveness testing prior to dissemination. This approach is facilitated by conceptualizing interventions as standardized by function rather than form as recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524839912454286">Hawe et al. (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524839912454286">2009</xref>) and is consistent with the standardized process used reported in this study as well as several school-based studies: LEAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524839912454286">Saunders et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1524839912454286">Ward et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524839912454286">Pate et al., 2005</xref>) and Gatehouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524839912454286">Patton &amp; Bond, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839912454286">Bond et al., 2001</xref>). This approach is particularly applicable for complex interventions designed to change organizational policies, practices, procedures or environments to improve health services or outcomes in diverse settings.</p>
