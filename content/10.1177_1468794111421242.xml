<body>
<p><italic>Research Confidential</italic> is an edited volume whose subtitle is ‘Solutions to problems most social scientist pretend they never have’. In the introductory chapter Hargittai states that the aim of the book is to ‘explore the behind the scenes details of hands on empirical social scientific research’. The premise being, that these collected works will furnish readers with a unique opportunity to engage with a range of ‘warts and all’ accounts of social research conducted by novice researchers in a range of different settings.</p>
<p>However, for this book to suggest, as it does, that it is seeking to address a lacuna in the research methods literature is an act of hubris, which merely serves to highlight Hargittai’s lack of familiarity with this already well-established field. There are any number of excellent extant literatures, which provide reflexive accounts of the research process, often written with the aim of benefitting newcomers to the field (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468794111421242">Burgess, 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468794111421242">1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468794111421242">Ellis and Bochner, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468794111421242">Walford, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468794111421242">2002</xref>). Over the past 30 years confessional writing has become a conventional genre, with a heroic or at times anti-heroic casting for the researcher. Often fantasy is incorporated into the accounts as researchers consider their experiences in a variety of research settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468794111421242">Atkinson, 1996</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468794111421242">Delamont (2002)</xref> notes, these often somewhat allegorical stories enable their readers to appreciate the realities of the research process and the potential pitfalls that await the naive researcher. Yet the obvious lack of engagement with and, perhaps even more alarmingly, the apparent ignorance of this literature is a serious omission and is one that persists throughout this edited collection.</p>
<p>Each of the 12 chapters in the book was specially commissioned from young scholars and they provide an eclectic mix of studies. Topics range from an account of the issues raised by incorporating biomarkers into social science research (Adam et al.) and participant research with gospel singing communities in the southern states of the USA (Clawson), to Archival research (Gallo). A few chapters make for an interesting read, particularly those in which the researchers engage with newer technologies. Walejko’s work with academic bloggers, for example, and Williams and Xiong’s account of researching in virtual communities serve to demonstrate the organic nature of the research process and highlight the need for researchers to adapt tried and trusted methods and adopt different approaches to accessing participants and collecting data in novel settings. However, none add anything to what is already known about the potential pitfalls of the research process for the novice researcher. Indeed, given that the majority of the research cited in the book is located in the USA, readers from other countries may well struggle to engage with some of the ethnocentric references that permeate the texts. Exemplifying a journalistic exposé of medical research with reference to shows like ‘<italic>20/20’</italic> or ‘<italic>Inside Edition’</italic>, or basing the research on a study of ‘eighth graders’, with no attempt to explain these terms to a wider audience, may well prove less than helpful to readers in Johannesburg, Grimsby or Damascus.</p>
<p>Overall what this edited collection does is simply to re-rehearse some of the issues that are inherent in empirical social science and that may occur at various points during the research process. Four recurring messages interweave the account and. somewhat unremarkably, we are reminded of the benefits to be gained by the novice of having expert guidance throughout and the significance of keeping analytic memoranda. We are further informed that good research is time consuming and negotiating access and gaining consents may prove problematic. While each is important, none of these points is new or presented in a novel way and there is a wealth of other literature that considers each of these issues in a more accessible, comprehensive and scholarly manner. <italic>Research Confidential</italic> makes some grand claims of itself, but I’m afraid it failed to live up it to its own hype on all counts.</p>
