<title>More on Breast Cancer</title>
<p>Breast cancer kills 400 000 people annually worldwide, thus constituting a major health concern. Therefore, basic researchers and clinicians alike have united efforts to better understand the disease, in order to establish breast cancer screening and early detection tools as well as to develop new and more efficient therapeutic strategies.</p>
<p>Familial aggregation and twin studies have shown a substantial contribution of inherited susceptibility to develop breast cancer. Thus, in the last few years, genome wide association studies (GWAS) have become a key resource to identify candidate genes associated with a risk to develop breast cancer.</p>
<p>In order to identify additional breast cancer susceptibility loci, Ghoussaini et al attempted to replicate 72 promising associations from 2 independent GWAS in ∼70 000 cases and ∼68 000 controls from 41 case-control studies and 9 breast cancer GWAS. Their results have just been published in the journal <italic>Nature Genetics</italic> (<italic>Nat Genet.</italic> advance online publication, 2012).</p>
<p>Ghoussaini and colleagues identified 3 new breast cancer risk loci at 12p11 (rs10771399), 12q24 (rs1292011), and 21q21 (rs2823093). While rs10771399 was associated with similar relative risks of both estrogen receptor-negative and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, the other 2 loci were only associated with estrogen receptor-positive disease. Two strong candidate genes lie in 2 of the loci identified—PTHLH, at 12p11, has been shown before to have a crucial role in mammary gland development and the establishment of bone metastasis in breast cancer; NRIP1, at 21q21, encodes an estrogen receptor cofactor and also has a role in the regulation of breast cancer cell growth.</p>
<p>The 3 risk loci identified by Ghoussaini et al are relatively common and together can explain approximately 0.7% of the familial risk of breast cancer. They bring the total contribution of common low-penetrance breast cancer susceptibility loci to around 9%.</p>
<p>Importantly, the work presented by the authors highlights the importance of combining GWAS with large scale replication studies and with tumor subtyping in the identification and characterization of breast cancer susceptibility loci, as the genes in these regions will most likely indicate different mechanisms, all with relevance to the pathogenesis of the disease.</p>

<title>Exploring the Association Between Endometriosis and Ovarian Cancer</title>
<p>Evidence supports the notion that endometriosis is associated with and increased risk of ovarian cancer. The extent of this association has, however, not been clearly understood.</p>
<p>A recent international collaborative study by Pearce et al has further investigated the link between the 2 conditions to better understand the impact of endometriosis on the individual ovarian cancer histological subtypes. The study has recently been published by the journal <italic>Lancet Oncology</italic> (<italic>Lancet Oncol.</italic> Early Online Publication, 2012).</p>
<p>Data from ovarian cancer case-control studies, including over 23 000 women, with and without a history of endometriosis, of whom close to 8000 had invasive ovarian cancer were polled and submitted to logistic regression analyzes accounting for histological subtypes, grade and stage.</p>
<p>Results showed that endometriosis was associated with a significantly increased risk of clear-cell, low-grade serous and endometrioid invasive ovarian cancers. In fact, the risk of developing clear cell ovarian cancer tripled for the women with endometriosis when compared with the women with no history of endometriosis. In addition, endometriosis also more than doubled the risk of developing endometrioid and low-grade serous ovarian cancer. On the other hand, no association was noted between endometriosis and higher risk of developing neither the mucinous or high-grade serous invasive ovarian cancer nor the borderline tumors of either subtypes.</p>
<p>With ovarian cancer often being a silent disease with a high mortality rate, the awareness of the increased risk of specific subtypes of ovarian cancer in women with endometriosis raised by Pearce et al constitutes an useful diagnostic tool, as it provides an opportunity to alert for symptoms that may help identify patients with, or at risk of, ovarian cancer at an earlier stage.</p>
