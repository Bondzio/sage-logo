<abstract>
<p>Friedreich ataxia is a neurodegenerative disease with an average age of onset of 10 years. The authors sought to investigate the presence and functional consequences of auditory neuropathy in a group of affected children and to evaluate the ability of personal FM-listening systems to improve perception. Nineteen school-aged individuals with Friedreich ataxia and a cohort of matched control subjects underwent a battery of auditory function tests. Sound detection was relatively normal, but auditory temporal processing and speech understanding in noise were severely impaired, with children with Friedreich ataxia typically able to access less than 40% of the information available to controls. Use of FM-listening devices did, however, improve the speech perception performance of those with Friedreich ataxia to the level of their unaffected peers in conditions designed to replicate the listening environment of the average school classroom.</p>

<p>Friedreich ataxia is the most common of the inherited ataxias.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812448963">1</xref>
</sup> Clinical features of the disease include progressive limb and trunk ataxia, cardiomyopathy, scoliosis, and an increased rate of diabetes mellitus.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812448963">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812448963">3</xref>
</sup> The disease typically presents in childhood, with an average age of onset of 10 years.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812448963">4</xref>
</sup> Friedreich ataxia occurs as a result of mutations in the <italic>FXN</italic> gene.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812448963">5</xref>
</sup> In 98% of mutant alleles there is expansion of GAA trinucleotide repeats in intron 1 of the gene, which causes partial silencing of <italic>FXN</italic> and subsequent deficits in “frataxin,” the encoded protein.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812448963">3</xref>
</sup> The other 2% of allele abnormalities are the result of point mutations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812448963">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Hearing, as measured by the ability to detect sound, tends to be unimpaired in individuals with Friedreich ataxia, with most studies showing audiometric thresholds (averaged across the speech frequencies) within the normal range.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812448963">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812448963"/>

</sup> Although this finding suggests normal peripheral (cochlear) function, it does not guarantee normal perception, and most (adult) Friedreich ataxia listeners described in the literature have, in fact, shown evidence of auditory neuropathy, presenting with either absent or distorted electrophysiologic responses from the VIIIth nerve and auditory brainstem.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812448963">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073812448963">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073812448963">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Auditory neuropathy is known to affect the neural representation of complex acoustic signals.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073812448963">12</xref>
</sup> In particular, the resulting disruption of neural synchrony can impair temporal resolution—the ability to perceive rapid changes in auditory signals over time.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073812448963">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073812448963">14</xref>
</sup> Psychophysical studies exploring auditory temporal processing in listeners with auditory neuropathy as a result of Friedreich ataxia have consistently shown impaired detection of brief gaps (silent periods) and rapid envelope variations (sinusoidal amplitude modulation) in continuous stimuli.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812448963">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The primary functional consequence of auditory temporal processing deficit is disruption of speech understanding. Discrimination of phonemes (individual speech sounds) in running speech, or even in isolated words, requires that the listener perceive the characteristic spectral shapes of individual sounds and be able to efficiently update this perception to track changes occurring over the course of only 10s of milliseconds. Difficulties with speech understanding are common in adults with Friedreich ataxia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812448963">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812448963">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073812448963">15</xref>
</sup> Perceptual ability varies depending on the degree of temporal processing disorder,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812448963">9</xref>
</sup> but most affected adults report impaired communication in everyday listening circumstances<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073812448963">15</xref>
</sup> that worsens with progression of the disease. Furthermore, auditory perceptual deficits pose particular risks for young children, for whom impaired speech understanding can have significant detrimental effects on general communication, speech and language development, socialization ability, and educational progress.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073812448963">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073812448963">17</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Amelioration of the functional effects of auditory neuropathy-type hearing loss is challenging. Conventional hearing aids amplify sounds but are not designed to clarify temporally distorted signals and, as such, have been consistently unpopular in trials involving adults with neurodegenerative auditory neuropathy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883073812448963">18</xref>
</sup> An alternative approach involves the use of FM-listening devices.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883073812448963">19</xref>
</sup> These systems transmit speech signals (detected by a lapel-worn microphone) via radio waves to ear level receivers worn by the listener. Thus, the listener obtains a signal advantage from the proximity of the speaker’s mouth to the transmitter microphone.</p>
<p>The aims of this study were to investigate the presence and perceptual consequences of auditory neuropathy in a cohort of school-aged children with Friedreich ataxia and to examine the efficacy of FM-listening systems in this population.</p>

<title>Subjects</title>
<p>Through the Bruce Lefroy Centre for Genetic Health Research, 19 children (8 female, age range at assessment, 8 years to 19 years [15.0 ± 3.3 years]) confirmed by genetic testing as being homozygous for GAA expansions of intron 1 of the <italic>FXN</italic> gene were recruited for the study.

<p>Each subject underwent bilateral audiometric testing in which sound detection thresholds were established at octave frequencies from 250 Hz to 8 kHz. The ear with better hearing thresholds then underwent a battery of auditory assessments, including auditory brainstem response evaluation, auditory temporal processing, and open-set speech perception.</p>
<p>Data from 20 age- and gender-matched children were also obtained. Each control child was matched to within 12 months of their counterpart with Friedreich ataxia at assessment (mean age 14.8 ± 3.6 years).</p>

<title>Tests of Auditory Function</title>
<p>We completed auditory brainstem response testing using the procedure described in Rance and colleagues.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812448963">8</xref>
</sup> If the auditory brainstem response was absent to rarefaction-polarity clicks at maximum presentation levels (90 dB nHL to 100 dB nHL), testing with compression-polarity stimuli was undertaken to confirm the presence of the cochlear microphonic. (The cochlear microphonic can be differentiated from the neural response when it changes phase with alteration in stimulus polarity.) Each of the children with Friedreich ataxia showed evidence of abnormal auditory-neural function. In 11 of 19 cases, the auditory brainstem response was absent despite normal preneural potentials and normal or near-normal sound detection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073812448963">Table 1</xref>). In 8 subjects, repeatable but low-amplitude auditory brainstem responses were obtained.</p>
<p>We assessed auditory temporal resolution using a task that sought the minimum detectable depth for sinusoidal amplitude modulation at low (10 Hz) and high (150 Hz) modulation rates. The psychophysical test procedure was as described in Rance and colleagues.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073812448963">13</xref>
</sup> The modulated (target) stimuli were generated by multiplying a 500 milliseconds noise burst with a dc-shifted sine wave. Depth of modulation (defined as 20 logM) was varied in 3 dB steps, from 0 to –30 dB.</p>
<p>We carried out open-set speech perception testing using recorded consonant-nucleus-consonant words presented at 65 dB SPL(root mean square) or at a comfortable listening level in those ears with impaired sound detection. Subjects were presented with 2 word lists each consisting of 50 stimuli. In one, the words were presented alone (quiet condition). In the other, a competing signal (4-talker babble) was mixed with the speech at a 0 dB signal-to-noise ratio (ie, the speech and noise were at the same level). Subjects were required to imitate the target words, and their responses were phonetically transcribed to produce a “percentage phonemes correct” score for each listening condition. Because speech production difficulties (such as dysarthria) have been observed in individuals with Friedreich ataxia,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0883073812448963">21</xref>
</sup> a phonetic profile was obtained for each child using the Articulation Survey.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812448963">8</xref>
</sup> None of the subjects showed significant production difficulties, and as such, any errors made on the speech perception test were assumed to reflect an inability to hear, rather than reproduce, the stimulus words.</p>
<p>We investigated everyday listening and general communication ability using a hearing disability questionnaire (Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit). This 24-question metric explores 4 aspects of auditory function: (1) communication difficulty, (2) the effect of background noise, (3) the effect of reverberation, and (4) aversion to loud sounds.</p>

<title>Assisted-Listening Device Trial</title>
<p>Of the 19 FRDA subjects (and their matched controls), 9 underwent an FM-listening device trial. Each subject was provided with a Phonak Inspiro FM transmitter paired with bilateral iSense ear-level receivers (Murten, Switzerland). We then conducted speech perception testing (consonant-nucleus-consonant words) in the free field with the subject seated between 2 loudspeakers. Perceptual ability was assessed in both unaided and aided (FM) conditions as per the technique described in Rance and colleagues.<sup>

Mean thresholds for subjects with Friedreich ataxia and for control subjects are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073812448963">Figure 1</xref>. Sound detection at 250 Hz was significantly poorer for those in the Friedreich ataxia cohort (T = 4.36, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01 [7.12, 21.97]) (values in square brackets represent the 95% confidence interval for the mean difference), but thresholds at each of the higher test frequencies were equivalent (500 Hz: T = 0.80, <italic>P </italic>&gt; .05 [–1.61, 3.43]; 1 kHz: T = 0.36, <italic>P</italic> &gt; .05 [–2.34, 3.25]; 2 kHz: T = 2.19, <italic>P</italic> &gt; .05 [–0.04, 4.58]; 4 kHz: T = 1.00, <italic>P</italic> &gt; .05 [–1.12, 2.93]).</p>

<p>Four-frequency average hearing levels (based on detection threshold at the 500 Hz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, and 4 kHz test frequencies) were calculated for each ear to determine overall access to sound in the speech frequency range. Each of the children with Friedreich ataxia showed average hearing at normal or near normal levels in the better hearing ear (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073812448963">Table 1</xref>), although mean 4-frequency hearing levels were poorer for those in the Friedreich ataxia group than for matched controls; Friedreich ataxia, 14.9 ± 7.1; control, 9.5 ± 7.2 (T = 3.35, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01 [2.02, 8.77]).</p>
<p>Correlation analyses (Pearson <italic>r</italic>) showed no relation between 4-frequency hearing level and age at assessment, age at disease onset, disease duration, or GAA1 repeat length for those in the Friedreich ataxia cohort (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05).

<p>Detection of rapid sinusoidal amplitude modulation was poorer for children with Friedreich ataxia than for matched controls.

Mean detection threshold for those in the Friedreich ataxia group in this case was –9.2 ± 6.4 dB (34.7% modulation depth), compared with –18.7 ± 2.4 dB (11.6% modulation depth) for the matched controls (T = 6.40, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001 [6.42, 12.65]).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Each of the children with Friedreich ataxia who participated in this study showed normal or near-normal sound detection. Mean hearing threshold levels were significantly poorer (than matched controls) for low frequency (250 Hz) tones but were within the normal range for frequencies containing most of the spectral energy required for functional hearing (500 Hz to 8 kHz). As such, their audiometric findings resemble those previously reported for adult subjects with Friedreich ataxia<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812448963">6</xref>

</sup> and suggest that sound detection was unlikely to have affected their auditory processing ability.</p>
<p>All of the participants with Friedreich ataxia did, however, show evidence of auditory neuropathy presenting with normal cochlear responses (cochlear microphonics), but either absent or low-amplitude auditory evoked potentials. This pattern is indicative of auditory nerve axonopathy and is consistent with histological evidence that has shown preserved cochlear structures (organ of corti and hair cells) and selective VIIIth nerve damage in the temporal bones of adults who have Friedreich ataxia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0883073812448963">23</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Basic auditory processing was disrupted in the children with Friedreich ataxia. While amplitude modulation detection for a low modulation rate (10 Hz) stimulus was normal (suggesting normal sensitivity to amplitude [level] changes), they showed an impaired capacity to detect modulation occurring at a rapid rate (150 Hz). That is, the auditory pathways in these children were less able to encode signal changes occurring over a brief (6 ms to 7 ms) time course. The precise mechanisms underlying this temporal processing deficit are not fully understood, but axonopathy may produce neural desynchrony where inconsistent conduction velocities result from partially damaged (but still functioning) fibers, secondary demyelination, and/or conduction block.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0883073812448963">24</xref>
</sup> Desynchrony in the central auditory pathway could, in turn, produce a time-smeared neural representation of acoustic stimuli.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073812448963">14</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Speech perception deficits were observed in all listening conditions but were particularly pronounced when speech was presented in the presence of a competing signal. Mean consonant-nucleus-consonant phoneme score in the 0 dB signal-to-noise ratio condition for the Friedreich ataxia cohort was only 22%, indicating that, on average, the children could correctly imitate less than one speech sound per word. In contrast, their normal peers could identify more than half of the phonemes—a level that would allow the listener to use contextual cues and word knowledge to aid understanding in a conversational situation. Reduced ability to cope with background noise is a commonly reported consequence of impaired temporal resolution and is thought to reflect increased masking effects and/or reduced ability to use brief silent periods in a fluctuating noise to access the speech signal.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812448963">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073812448963">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073812448963">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0883073812448963">22</xref>
</sup> Whatever the mechanism(s), the performance levels observed in this study indicate that a high proportion of children with Friedreich ataxia will likely face significant communication and educational challenges, as the listening conditions in a typical school classroom (0 dB to 3 dB signal-to-noise ratio) are similar to that used in the perceptual testing.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0883073812448963">25</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Deficits on formal speech testing were also reflected in the subjects’ self-reported hearing disability ratings. Children with Friedreich ataxia considered their listening and general communication to be hampered in more than 30% of everyday circumstances, whereas their matched controls reported difficulties in &lt; 10% of situations. It is not surprising that participants with Friedreich ataxia found noisy and reverberant (echoic) conditions to be a particular problem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0883073812448963">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
<p>Speech perception was made significantly easier when wearing the personal FM system. These devices improve listening in noise by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio. That is, the speech is relatively louder than the noise because it is picked up (by the transmitter microphone) in close proximity to the source. The signal-to-noise ratio advantage afforded by the device is the same for all users (≈6 dB at a typical conversational distance) and hence everyone will enjoy a listening benefit. Significantly, this 6 dB improvement resulted in a bigger perceptual advantage for the children with Friedreich ataxia in this study (24% average FM-aided improvement compared with 10% for the controls), reflecting their specific listening in noise problem. As such, while not allowing perfect perception in noise, the provision of FM-devices did increase the mean speech score for those in the Friedreich ataxia cohort to the unaided level of the control children. This finding suggests intervention strategies that improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the classroom and other challenging communication situations allow the possibility of relatively normal functional hearing.</p>

<title>Summary and Recommendations</title>
<p>The results of this study suggest that auditory processing abnormality is an early-presenting and pervasive consequence of Friedreich ataxia. All of the school-aged children in our Friedreich ataxia cohort showed at least some functional hearing deficit, and those with greater degrees of overall disability were most affected. Performance on each of the auditory measures (particularly temporal processing and speech perception in noise) were correlated with Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale score, suggesting that auditory function may provide a reliable measure of the natural progression of the disease and may serve as a biomarker for pharmaceutical interventions.</p>
<p>The findings indicate that regular auditory evaluation should form part of the management regimen for all children (and adults) with Friedreich ataxia. This assessment may include audiometric evaluation (as sound detection is a prerequisite for useful hearing) but, more important, should involve some measure of functional hearing capacity, such as open-set speech perception, which can quantify the degree of processing abnormality and provide a basis for intervention.</p>
<p>Management of auditory neuropathy is not straightforward.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883073812448963">18</xref>
</sup> Conventional hearing aids tend not to be useful for listeners with Friedreich ataxia, as they simply make sounds louder (which is typically not required for this population) and do not overcome the neural distortion problem. FM-listening devices do appear to be effective in providing improved speech understanding (at least in structured listening situations). Further evaluation is required to determine, first, whether affected children will tolerate the systems over an extended period and, second, whether they can positively influence long-term speech and language development, socialization, and educational outcomes.</p>
