<abstract>
<p>A nationally representative sample of high school students is used to examine where students go for college information and how those information sources affect the number of schools to which students apply. Results show that Latino/a students are least likely to access college sources and have applied to the fewest number of schools. Among Latino/a students college resources are also one of biggest predictors of number of schools to which Latino/a students have applied.</p>

<p>Although research on the Latino/a college experience is growing, much of it has highlighted overall college enrollment trends and overlooked the college choice going processes. Among high school graduates, Latinos/as actually have higher postsecondary participation rates (10%) when compared with all high school graduates (7%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538192711435560">Fry, 2002</xref>). However, Latinos/as have fewer college degrees compared with every other group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538192711435560">Fry, 2002</xref>). Latinos/as are said to have lower rates of postsecondary degree attainment as a result of their concentration in 2-year programs, high rates of part-time enrollment, older age during enrollment, and tendency to attend Hispanic-Serving Institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538192711435560">Fry, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1538192711435560">Pew Hispanic Center, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538192711435560">Santiago &amp; Brown, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538192711435560">Schneider, Martinez, &amp; Owens, 2006</xref>). For example, in 2001, the Latino/a college attainment rate for ages between 25 and 29 years, including only those who had graduated from high school, was 10.3% for associates degrees and 16.4% for bachelor degrees; by contrast, Whites had rates of 10.5% and 36.5%, respectively, and Blacks had rates of 10% and 20.6%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538192711435560">Fry, 2002</xref>). Hence, although Latinos/as’ trends in completing associates degrees are similar to that of their peers, a significant disparity becomes apparent when considering bachelor degree completions. Many Latinos/as who start at 2-year institutions for example, experience difficulties transferring to 4-year institutions and thus fail to ever obtain a 4-year degree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538192711435560">Schneider et al., 2006</xref>). As Latinos/as’ enrollment trends are associated with lower degree attainment, it becomes imperative for policy makers and educators to better understand the college choice process for Latinos/as.</p>
<p>Guided by status attainment theories, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538192711435560">Hossler-Gallagher Model (1987)</xref> represents the most commonly used theoretical framework by which to understand the college-going process. In three distinct phases, the model describes the development of student college choice as follows: predisposition, search, and choice. The first stage explains a student’s decision to continue formal education after high school. In the second stage, students who have decided to pursue a college education collect information about potential institutions. Finally, in the third stage, students evaluate available information and make a decision about where they will attend college (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538192711435560">Hossler &amp; Gallagher, 1987</xref>). Although Latinos/as have comparable educational aspirations with other racial/ethnic groups, in fulfilling these aspirations, Latinos/as are less successful than their counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538192711435560">Schneider et al., 2006</xref>). Understanding Latinos/as’ search processes could help to explain some of these inconsistencies.</p>
<p>Research has indicated that when students with college aspirations perform thorough searches they are more successful in finding schools that match their needs and wants, are more satisfied with their enrollment decisions, and are more likely to persist to graduation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538192711435560">Hamrick &amp; Hossler, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538192711435560">Hossler &amp; Gallagher, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538192711435560">Hossler, Schmit, &amp; Vesper, 1999</xref>). However, of the three stages identified in the college choice process, research explaining how Latino/a students seek and gather college information in the search stage is least extensive. To this end, the following study uses a nationally representative sample of high school students with college aspirations to explore where students go for college entrance information and the outcomes associated with different search processes.</p>
<sec id="section1-1538192711435560">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>As with all three phases of college choice, status-attainment models help inform the college search process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538192711435560">Hossler &amp; Gallagher, 1987</xref>). In the late 1980s, James Coleman and Pierre Bourdieu developed the concept of social capital based on two different notions. Educational researchers most often use Coleman’s theory which emphasized the importance of social networks for educational attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538192711435560">Dika &amp; Singh, 2002</xref>). Coleman’s work called attention to the relationship between human capital and social capital, whereby human capital was transmitted through social capital, particularly in the family, but in other social organizations as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538192711435560">Coleman &amp; Hoffer, 1987</xref>). When necessary human capital is unavailable, knowledge cannot be transmitted among family members and/or communities. For Latinos/as, family structure, financial resources, and educational levels greatly affect the availability of essential resources for students at all educational levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538192711435560">Hurtado-Ortiz &amp; Gauvain, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538192711435560">Schneider et al., 2006</xref>). Although quantitative work in this area is largely missing, various qualitative studies on Latino/a high school students have examined the role that social networks play in the search process.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538192711435560">Post (1990)</xref> found that Latino/a students indeed lacked knowledge about postsecondary education, especially in the case of finances, concluding that many held “unfounded beliefs about the costs of college,” particularly those with Spanish-speaking parents (p. 185). This finding is consistent with other research showing that lower socioeconomic status (SES) students lack social networks that provide information about college because they are not as likely to have parents or other friends and family who have attended college (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538192711435560">Schneider et al., 2006</xref>). Other work has highlighted the importance of previously established social networks on Latino/a college enrollment trends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538192711435560">Pérez &amp; McDonough, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538192711435560">Person &amp; Rosenbaum, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1538192711435560">Valdez, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538192711435560">Person and Rosenbaum (2006)</xref> best developed this framework by applying the chain migration theory to Latino/a college enrollment patterns and found comparable results from the two processes. Chain Migration Theory looks at the importance of social networks on immigration patterns, whereby kinship and friendship ties result in concentrated migration patterns for the Latino/a population. Through an extensive qualitative study, these authors found that when applying this theory to college choice, Latinos/as almost exclusively relied on family and friends when making enrollment decisions.</p>
<p>Given the importance of parents in students’ search processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538192711435560">Hossler, Braxton, &amp; Coopersmith, 1989</xref>), it is concerning that research indicates that Latino/a parents frequently lack sufficient knowledge about the college-going process. Often Latino/a parents are only able to provide support through indirect channels, such as by supplying encouragement; however, these parents cannot offer assistance in the search process itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538192711435560">Ceja, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538192711435560">Gonzalez, Stoner, &amp; Jovel, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538192711435560">Pérez &amp; McDonough, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538192711435560">Pérez and McDonough (2008)</xref> found that while Latino/a students tended to speak about college often with their parents, it was usually the students trying to inform their parents about the process rather than vice versa. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538192711435560">Person and Rosenbaum (2006)</xref> concluded that Latino/a students were the least informed about college requirements of all racial/ethnic groups despite heavy reliance on social networks. Along the same line, in a study of 12 high-achieving rural Mexican immigrant high school students with college aspirations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1538192711435560">Valdez (2008)</xref> found that familial commitments heavily affected Latino/a students’ decision making processes, where students refused to give up familial responsibilities in pursuit of postsecondary education.</p>
<p>By showing the ways in which Latino/a students lack of necessary social networks handicaps them in the search process and ultimately affects their enrollment outcomes, the aforementioned studies are useful in helping to illuminate the intricacies of the search process for Latino/a youth. Nevertheless, most research has overlooked the explicit role that institutions play in the search process. The mobilization of institutional resources should be regarded as social capital in line with Bourdieu’s framework; yet, this second notion of social capital is less explored in the field of education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538192711435560">Dika &amp; Singh, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>To explore the various questions left unanswered, the following study uses a large sample of high school students to examine the role of social capital on students’ abilities to fulfill their educational aspirations. It assesses Latino/a students’ access to high school resources, library resources, family, friends, and college resources, all which should correctly be categorized as forms of social capital. More importantly, this study explores the impact of these sources by assessing their likelihood of influencing a student to apply to college.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>This study uses data from the first follow-up (conducted in 2004) of the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002), a nationally representative study conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), U.S. Department of Education. The study was designed to monitor the transitions of a national sample of 10th graders through high school and on to postsecondary education and/or the labor market. At the first follow-up, all of the students still enrolled in high school were seniors. Our sample started with 12,460 students, who identified as White, Asian, Black or African American, and Hispanic or Latino. Students who identified as Native American were excluded from our analyses because of the small sample sizes. In addition, students who identified as multiracial were excluded from the analysis because of the inability to make overall conclusions about this population. Our sample was then restricted to students who reported their postsecondary educational aspirations to be some college or higher. This resulted in the deletion of 532 cases leaving us with a sample of 11,930 students, 62% of whom identified as White, 10.7% as Asian, 13.2% as Black or African American, and 14.1% as Hispanic or Latino. As the selection of schools and students who participated in ELS:2002 and 2004 is not random, we used the appropriate weights to compensate for unequal probabilities of participation.</p>

<sec id="section4-1538192711435560">
<title>Variables</title>
<p>Educational aspirations are a single measure from the ELS student questionnaire. Students were also asked to respond to a question about the type of school they would most likely attend after high school. The possible responses included, 4-year college or university, 2-year community college, or vocation, technical, or trade school. Overall, close to 72% of our sample with postsecondary aspirations anticipated attending a 4-year institution and about 22% a 2-year institution (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1538192711435560">Table 1</xref>). Latinos/as, however, are the least likely to report anticipations to attend a 4-year institution. While 70% to 80% of all other racial/ethnic groups anticipate attending a 4-year institution, only about 57% of Latinos/as do so. Conversely, Latino/a students are more likely to anticipate attending a 2-year institution (34% versus about 17% to 22% for other racial/ethnic groups).</p>

<p>Information sources are a single measure from the ELS student questionnaire. Students were asked to respond to the following question: “Where have you gone for information about the entrance requirements of various colleges?” The response list included fourteen choices, such as teachers, parents, college websites, or school library, allowing students to mark all that applied. We recoded this variable into five composite measures: school agents, family members, friend, college resources, and library resources. For instance, the composite measure titled, “school agents” refers to the extent to which students asked a guidance counselor, teacher, or coach for college entrance information. Hence, a student with a score of “1” has gone to one of these school representatives for information about college, whereas a student with a score of “3” has gone to all three informational sources. Similarly, the composite measure titled, “college resources” refers to the extent to which students referred to a college representative, a college’s publication or website, or college search guides, publications, or websites. The composite measures allow us to get a sense of the rate at which students access various sources of information. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1538192711435560">Table 1</xref> summarizes the average rate at which each racial/ethnic group accesses those information sources. Differences between racial/ethnic groups were statistically significant for all five composite measures of college information sources.</p>
<p>The number of postsecondary institutions a student has applied to was also measured by a single question: “To how many schools have you applied?” Students were asked to mark one of the following responses: none, 1 school, 2-4 schools, and 5 or more schools. On average, students reported applying to more than one school but not quite two to four schools. Asian students report applying to close to 2-4 schools, the most of any racial/ethnic group. White and Black students report applying close to the group average and Latino/a students reported applying less than the group average (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1538192711435560">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the main variables of interest described above, our multivariate models include a series of control variables. Gender is dichotomous (1 = <italic>female</italic>); about 52% of the sample was female. For race/ethnicity, we constructed four dichotomous categories: Asian and Asian American, African American, Hispanic or Latino, and White. Those students that identified as White were used as the reference group in the regression models. Along with gender and race/ethnicity, we controlled for total family income, parent education, family structure, school classification, and school size.</p>
<p>Family income is total family income measured categorically from 1 (<italic>none</italic>) to 13 (<italic>US$200,001 or more</italic>). The average income for the entire sample was 9.28, somewhat above the US$35,001-US$50,000 category. The average total family income for Latino/a students is somewhat above the US$25,001-US$35,000 category. Total family income is the lowest for Black students, at about the US$25,001-US$35,000 category. Parent education is a single categorical measure from the survey. It reflects a parent’s highest level of education. The average level of parental education for the sample was between graduating with a 2-year college degree and attending some college, but not completing a 4-year college degree. Parents of both Asian and White students have slightly higher levels of education than the average, while parents of Latino/a and Black students have lower levels of education than average. Family structure was recoded into a dichotomous variable (1 = <italic>dual, biological parents</italic>; 0 = <italic>other</italic>). Slightly more than three quarters of the sample reported living with both biological parents. There are racial/ethnic differences with respect to family structure. Only about 54% of Black students live with both biological parents. About three quarters of Latino/a students do so. Also about 84% of both Asian and White students live with both biological parents. Racial/ethnic differences in family background characteristics were all statistically significant.</p>
<p>School classification refers to whether the students attended a public versus private institution (1 = <italic>public</italic>). About 67% of the students reported attending a public school. School size was taken from a single measure in the ELS and collapsed into a categorical variable ranging from 1 to 9 (1 = <italic>1-399</italic>, 2 = <italic>400-599</italic>, 3 = <italic>600-799</italic>, 4 = <italic>800-999</italic>, 5 = <italic>1,000-1,199</italic>, 6 = <italic>1,200-1,599</italic>, 7 = <italic>1,600-1,999</italic>, 8 = <italic>2,000-2,499</italic>, 9 = <italic>2,500 or more</italic>). The average school size for all students was 4.6, so somewhere between 800-999 students and 1,000-1,199 students.</p>

<p>We began our descriptive analyses by examining where students with college aspirations go to get their information about college and universities (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1538192711435560">Table 2</xref>). Overall, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1538192711435560">Table 2</xref> shows that there are racial/ethnic differences in the frequency with which students access school agents, family members, college resources, library resources, and friends for information about college. Some of the most pronounced differences however, are seen with reference to family members, college resources, and friends as sources of information. Some of the literature suggests that Latino/a students primarily access family and friends for information about colleges and universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538192711435560">Ceja, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538192711435560">Pérez &amp; McDonough, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1538192711435560">Valdez, 2008</xref>). Although this literature has not always explored racial/ethnic differences in accessing family and friends, our results show that Latino/a students are not going to friends and family for college entrance information more so than students of other racial/ethnic groups. Results show that 36.2% of Latino/a students say they have not gone to a family member for information about colleges or universities. This is close to 10% higher than any other racial/ ethnic group. In addition, about 7% of Latino/a students have gone to three family members (parent, sibling, and other relative) for information about college, whereas close to 14% of black students have gone to three family members. With regards to going to a friend for information, Latino/a, Black, and White students display similar patterns. About 53% of these students have gone to a friend for information; in contrast, close to 72% of Asian students have turned to a friend for information about college.</p>

<p>Troubling is the rate at which Latino/a students are accessing college resources (i.e., college representative, college publication or website, and college search guides). A little more than 20% of Latino/a students have not accessed these resources for information about college, the highest percentage of any racial/ethnic group. In addition, a look at the highest rate at which students access college resources, at least three times, a smaller percentage of Latino/a students (26%) do so. This is between 7 and 12 percentage points lower than students from other racial/ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Further descriptive analyses into how students go about fulfilling their educational aspirations shows that a significant percentage of Latino/a students with aspirations to attend a 4-year institution had not yet applied to any institution at the time they were surveyed, which was spring semester of 2004 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1538192711435560">Table 3</xref>). Close to 20% of Latino/a students with aspirations to further their education at a 4-year institution had not yet applied to any school. In contrast, only 6% of Asian students and 10.6 of White students with aspirations to attend a 4-year institution had not yet applied. Meanwhile, 38.5% of Asian students had applied to five or more schools, the highest percentage of any racial/ethnic group. A similar pattern holds true even when examining students with aspirations to attend 2-year institutions and vocational schools. Once again, larger percentages of Latino/a students with aspirations to attend these types of postsecondary institutions have not yet applied to any schools in comparison to the other racial/ethnic groups.</p>

<p>Lastly, a series of ordered probit models across racial/ethnic groups predicting the number of schools to which students have applied allowed us to explore the effects of various information sources on the number of schools to which students have applied (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1538192711435560">Table 4</xref>). Ordered probit models were conducted because our dependent variable violates several conditions necessary to run ordinary least squares regression models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1538192711435560">Yang &amp; Raehsler, 2007</xref>). Looking at the population of White students, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1538192711435560">Table 4</xref> (first column) shows that after controlling for a series of family and high school characteristics, school agents (counselor, teacher, or coach) and college resources (college representative, college publication or website, or a college search guide) are positively associated with number of schools to which students have applied. In other words, the more school agents and college resources that White students have accessed for information about colleges and universities, the greater the probability that White students have applied to more postsecondary institutions. These patterns are similar to those for Latino/a students. Among Latino/a students, turning to college resources and school agents are also positively associated with number of schools to which students have applied. In contrast, among Asian students, college resources is the only information resource that is statistically significant and positive in predicting number of postsecondary schools to which Asian students have applied after controlling for family and school characteristics. Among Black students, both school agents and college resources have positive and statistically significant effects on the number of schools to which students have applied, much like White and Latino/a students. Interestingly, once we control for family and high school characteristics, friends as a source of college information, have a negative effect on the number of schools to which Black students have applied (coefficient = −0.31, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). In other words, when Black students seek a friend out for information about college, they are less likely to apply to a greater number of postsecondary institutions.</p>

<p>To better understand the results described above, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1538192711435560">Table 5</xref> summarizes the marginal effects or the probabilities that a student has applied to 5 or more postsecondary institutions. Marginal effects are calculated at the mean values of the explanatory variables. In other words, the probability that a student has applied to 5 or more postsecondary institutions is calculated by considering the mean values for the personal, family, and school characteristic variables included in the model. The probabilities summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1538192711435560">Table 5</xref> show that for each additional school agent the average White student accesses, the chances of them applying to 5 or more schools increases by 3.0 percentage points. And for each college resource the average White student accesses, the chances of them applying to 5 or more schools increases by 5.5 percentage points. For the average Latino/a student, accessing an additional school agent increases their chances of applying to 5 or more schools by 2.0 percentage points. Accessing an additional college resource, increases their chances of applying to 5 or more schools by 4.8 percentage points. In contrast, notice that the probability of applying to 5 or more schools increases by 12.1 percentage points for each college resource accessed by the average Asian student. For Black students, the probability of applying to 5 or more schools increases by 4.1 and 5.4 percentage points for each school agent and college resource (respectively) accessed. Also, when a Black student accesses a friend for information, the probability of applying to 5 or more schools decreases by 6.0 percentage points.</p>

<p>Some interesting patterns also emerge with respect to our other explanatory variables. Gender for example, appears to play a role among the White and Asian student populations. The probability of a White female student applying to 5 or more schools is 2.9 percentage points higher than for White male students. And the chances of an Asian female student applying to 5 or more schools are 12.0 percentage points higher than for an Asian male student. These gender differences are not so surprising because we are seeing female enrollment in postsecondary institutions increasing more rapidly than male enrollment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538192711435560">NCES, 2011</xref>). In addition, family background characteristics such as income and parent education also affect the probabilities of applying to 5 or more schools for certain population groups. Additional total family income for example, increases the probabilities that both White and Asian students will apply to 5 or more schools. In addition, higher parent educational levels increases the probabilities that both White and Black students will apply to 5 or more schools by 1.5 and 1.6 percentage points. The only variable to negatively affect the probabilities of applying to 5 or more schools is whether students attend a public school. This pattern however, only holds true for White and Black students. The probability of a Black student who attends a public high school applying to 5 or more schools is 6.5 percentage points lower than one attending a nonpublic school.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our analysis into how Latino/a students go about fulfilling their aspirations of going to a postsecondary institution revealed that they are not accessing college representatives and materials published by colleges and universities to the same extent as other groups. In addition, contrary to some literature, they are also not accessing family members for information about colleges either. Furthermore, a larger percentage of Latino/a students with desires to attend a 4-year institution have not yet applied to any postsecondary institutions by the spring semester of their senior years. This is in stark contrast to Asian students, who are the most likely to have applied to five or more schools. Finally, our ordered probit models showed that for Latino/a students, and among the five information sources examined, college resources and school agents are positive and statistically significant predictors of the number of schools to which students have applied. It is not so surprising to find that among Latino/a students, family members do not affect the number of postsecondary schools to which students have applied. Research has found that Latino/a parents often have little information about the college going process, but do provide a lot of encouragement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538192711435560">Pérez &amp; McDonough, 2008</xref>). In short, if college resources are one of the strongest predictors of number of schools applied to among Latino/a students, it is troubling to see that fewer of them are doing so compared with other racial/ethnic groups.</p>
<p>For White and Black students, college resources and school agents also have positive and significant associations to the number of postsecondary schools to which students have applied much like Latino/a students. Their probabilities of applying to the most schools (5 or more) are higher for each college resource and school agent accessed in comparison to Latino/a students. In short, it appears that White and Black students may be able to tap into various forms of social capital more effectively to help them fulfill their aspirations of applying and presumably attending a postsecondary institution. It is interesting to see though that for Black students, information from friends has a negative impact on the number of schools to which Black students have applied. Perhaps, as the oppositional culture hypothesis suggests, Black students are more likely to critique their peers’ decisions to pursue higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538192711435560">Farkas, Lleras, &amp; Maczuga, 2002</xref>). Oppositional culture hypothesis explains that given students’ awareness of structural barriers that limit opportunities for minority groups (e.g. employment discrimination), academic success may become less meaningful in the minds of youth. It is also possible that Black students’ peers are simply trying to encourage enrollment in specific institutions to better allow for continued interaction and communication after high school graduation. Our limited ability to explain this phenomenon highlights the need for more research exploring this finding.</p>
<p>It is important to consider that data limitations further affect our ability to make such specific conclusions. One limitation of our data is that we are unable to determine how many parents (i.e., both mom and dad versus just mom) or how many relatives (i.e., grandma, aunt, cousin, etc.) students have turned to for information. Another limitation is that we are unable to measure the quality of interactions with various resources. Nevertheless, our study shows that despite aspirations to attend some type of postsecondary institution, Latino/a students continue to struggle with fulfilling those aspirations.</p>
<p>Helping Latino/a youth with college aspirations access college resources during their search process is of upmost importance. Moreover, although high school agents, family, library resources and friends are not found to have significant impact on outcomes, it would be erroneous to conclude that these information sources are not vital to the college choice process. It is important to note that this study did not help explain why these other information resources did not influence students to apply to college. It is very possible the quality of the interactions with these resources is not helpful enough to persuade students to apply to colleges. This explanation would be consistent with the aforementioned literature discussing the lack of Latino/a parental knowledge about college. It follows that our recommendations for practice echo the growing call for a P-16 pipeline helping connect high schools, communities, and postsecondary institutions for the success of this population.</p>
<p>There are numerous ways high schools can function to encourage, support, and aid Latino/a students interested in pursuing higher education. Counselors can meet with these students regularly, helping them in the search process by helping them navigate their online searches (i.e., looking at college websites), setting up college visits, inviting college representatives for talks, and providing pamphlets and other printed materials. High school teachers can also play an important role. For example, teachers can encourage students to research college websites for class, perhaps as part of an assignment or project.</p>
<p>High schools and colleges can help to educate community members and families by holding informational sessions geared at Latinos/as. These sessions can both inform families about the college going process and alleviate any concerns they may have, for example, concerns over college costs (which is particularly challenging for low SES students). For low-SES students, concerns over financial aid dominate information collection activities and these concerns should be addressed with the help and guidance of qualified educators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538192711435560">Cabrera &amp; La Nasa, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>These recommendations require cooperation and partnerships among community leaders, parents, high school staff, nearby postsecondary institutions. Given the importance of college resources to Latino/a students’ decisions to apply to college, each of these sectors has an important role to play in providing such resources and helping students understand and digest available information.</p>
