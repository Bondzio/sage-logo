<sec id="sec1-1755738013481347"><title>Website of the month</title>
<p>In 2010, about 22 000 people in the UK were living with undiagnosed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). <italic>Halve It</italic> is ‘a coalition of national experts determined to tackle the continued public health challenges posed by HIV’. The campaign, launched in 2010, aims by 2015 to halve the proportion of people diagnosed late with HIV and those living with undiagnosed HIV. By encouraging early diagnosis, the aims are to achieve better individual health and reduce new infection rates. The website offers a plethora of information relevant to general practice.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1755738013481347"><title>Supporting carers in general practice</title>
<p>A total of 12% of patients who visit their GPs are carers. A training resource for GPs has been developed to improve the quality of care for these carers, because being a carer comes at a cost. Up to 40% experience psychological distress or depression, one in five gives up work to care and more than half fall into debt as a result of caring.</p>
<p>As part of this programme, an in-house training DVD has been designed for GPs and practice staff, which counts towards continuing professional development. These can be obtained by emailing supportingcarers@rcgp.org.uk. Further information is available on the RCGP dedicated page, including a link to ‘Supporting carers: an action guide for general practitioners’ and an online e-learning programme.</p>
<p>There are likely to be performance-related pay incentives for improved identification of and assessment of carers within primary care.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1755738013481347"><title>GP Workload Survey 2013</title>
<p>The Southwest United Kingdom Local Medical Committees released an interesting survey on workload. Over 2700 GPs out of about 6000 responded to the survey. The findings highlight a major concern regarding the viability and safety of working in the face of longer hours and heavier, more complex workloads, coupled with underfunding.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1755738013481347"><title>Critical reading for primary care</title>
<p>The British Journal of General Practice has created a free on-line resource on reading and appraising the quality of research articles. The resource is divided into seven main chapters looking at different research methods as exemplified by a set of articles published in the BJGP over 2011.</p>

<p>The <italic>British Journal of General Practice</italic> is publishing summaries of Cochrane reviews; Practical Evidence About Real Life Situations or PEARLS. This is part of an attempt to make Cochrane more relevant to primary care and the organisation is looking for expressions of interest from anyone involved in primary care.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1755738013481347"><title>Health care for migrants</title>
<p>Reflecting on my patient satisfaction questionnaire responses made me wonder which patient groups do not complete questionnaires. In London we have groups of patients who struggle to access care. One of these groups is asylum-seekers.</p>
<p>In primary care there are NO regulations about charging or eligibility for care. All GPs can choose which patients to accept; but we must not discriminate. We have a professional obligation to refer to secondary care when we deem clinically appropriate. Eligibility for free care varies around the United Kingdom but there are categories of illness, e.g. infectious diseases, and categories of patient, e.g. victims of human trafficking that are exempt from charges.</p>
<p>How does your practice deal with people trying to register? Are they all treated in the same way?</p>

<sec id="sec7-1755738013481347"><title>British National Formulary</title>
<p>Health professionals have free access to the BNF and can sign up for monthly email updates. January’s update included information about the reorganised palliative care section. I think the tables of opioid dose conversions, including equivalent doses for transdermal delivery are useful. When I did a radiotherapy post I could do the conversions without looking them up, but I now find our Macmillan nurses invaluable as a source of advice for analgesia and symptom control and advice about what can be mixed in a syringe driver.</p>

<sec id="sec8-1755738013481347"><title>Insomnia and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics</title>
<p>A meta-analysis of randomised-controlled trials of the ‘Z' drugs eszopiclone, zaleplon and zolpidem was performed to investigate their effectiveness and placebo effects. Thirteen studies with 4378 participants were analysed. Results showed that Z drugs decreased polysomnographic sleep latency by 22 minutes compared with placebo and by 7 minutes for subjective sleep latency. The authors comment that both results are small, non-clinically significant effects. They conclude the placebo response is the major contributor to the effectiveness of Z drugs, which should be balanced against harms. They suggest that psychological interventions should be given more emphasis in insomnia management.</p>
<p>In January 2013, the RCGP and the Royal College of Psychiatrists released a consensus statement aimed at reducing patient addiction to medicines such as tranquillisers.</p>

<sec id="sec10-1755738013481347"><title>Controversy about the Liverpool Care Pathway</title>
<p>I think it is very sad that publicity about poorly handled patient care has frightened patients and their relatives about the Liverpool Care Pathway. The original aim was to provide the best possible care for people in the last few days and hours of life. The Marie Curie Palliative Care Institute has produced 10 key messages to try to dispel some of the myths and restore faith in the process:
<list id="list1-1755738013481347" list-type="order">

<sec id="sec11-1755738013481347"><title>Breast cancer resource packs</title>
<p>Breast Cancer Care has just updated its secondary breast cancer resource pack (there are other resource packs including primary breast cancer and ‘worried about breast cancer’). This is a long document with advice about diagnosis, treatment, both conventional and complementary, support and palliative care. The document may be too long for some patients but downloading parts at a time might be helpful. The documents are available free of charge as a downloadable.pdf file or as hard copy.</p>

<sec id="sec12-1755738013481347"><title>Controversy over breast screening</title>
<p>There has been another article in the <italic>British Medical Journal</italic> where Professor Michael Baum queries the value of the NHS breast screening programme.</p>
<p>I wonder if you feel able to have conversations with patients where you discuss the risks and benefits of the various cancer screening programmes. In revising for the Clinical Skills Assessment it might be worth practising how you discuss risks and benefits with patients.</p>
