<abstract>
<p>Vietnam is an evolving political economy and marketing system. Since the implementation of <italic>Doi Moi</italic>, the 1986 policy to invoke a shift from central economic planning to a more market-oriented system, the country has made extraordinary progress on several socioeconomic indicators. Some observers contend Vietnam is a development model; others suggest the country still has numerous challenges to overcome before it can reach its development goals. This article provides an overview of Vietnam’s socioeconomic development; it introduces eight refereed articles and four commentaries that comprise the scholarly contributions to the first special issue of the <italic>Journal of Macromarketing</italic> to feature research on a single country. Vietnam is that country. Contributors provide detailed research, analysis, and reflection on the interplay of markets, marketing, and society. Topics studied include system complexity and entrepreneurship, retailing evolution, consumption dynamics and societal wellness, family policy and consumption, education and human resource development, living standards and quality of life, ethical/unethical foreign direct investment, ritualistic consumption, and marketing, trade and protectionism, land policy and environmental sustainability, and implications for Vietnam’s economic and geopolitical future.</p>

<body>
<p>This issue features scholarship on Vietnam. It is the first issue of the <italic>Journal of Macromarketing</italic>, now in its fourth decade of publication, to focus on a political economy and marketing system in which the aggregation is a single country. Readers might ask, “Why Vietnam?” Some realities make a compelling case: more than 90 million consumers in an exceptional geography and ecosystem that greatly affect marketing and consumption; one of the world’s leading producers and exporters of agricultural products, seafood, and minerals; a favored destination for foreign direct investment (FDI), with practically every multinational company having some manufacturing, distribution or brand presence in country; a name sometimes associated with tragic geopolitics, perhaps still indelibly etched in the consciousness of some readers; an economy evincing a unique and evolving market-socialism rapidly moving toward industrialized-nation status; an integral member of larger political and marketing systems, including Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and World Trade Organization (WTO); a strategic position in one of the world’s most dynamic regions, with important implications for global well-being; development and wellness measures that have led many observers to conclude Vietnam may be a model for developing countries the world over (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0276146711428323">Asian Development Bank 2011</xref>). More specifically to the matter of socioeconomic development,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>… Vietnam has stood as an example of a development model that has lifted millions of people out of poverty while ensuring the benefits of its vibrant market economy are fairly evenly distributed across society. The country has rapidly created private sector jobs, has almost eliminated the difference in school enrollment rates between girls and boys, and is well positioned to achieve all the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0276146711428323">World Bank 2011a</xref>).</p>
</disp-quote>Furthermore, “Vietnam’s poverty reduction and economic growth achievements in the last 15 years are one of the most spectacular success stories in economic development” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0276146711428323">World Bank 2011b</xref>).</p>
<p>For all Vietnam’s successes and growing prominence, however, at the time of this writing its Human Development Index (HDI) value was .572, positioning the country at 113 or 115 out of 169 countries for which data were reported and depending on the source (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0276146711428323">United Nations Development Programme 2010a</xref>, b). This measure places Vietnam just ahead of Morroco and just behind Tajikistan. Vietnam also is well behind China, which ranks 89 (.662), and behind fellow ASEAN member, Thailand, which is numbered 92 (.654; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0276146711428323">United Nations Development Programme 2010a</xref>). Vietnam struggles with several challenges—corruption, suboptimal resource management, and environmental degradation, for example—which adversely affect many stakeholders within and outside its borders, and which could derail improvements to measures such as HDI and the country’s long-term welfare. The HDI and other measures intimate that Vietnam is in many respects an evolving but fragile political economy comprising several systems—economic, social, ecological, and political—affected by internal and external policies, markets and consumption, and nature. It is a living laboratory for the study of a transitioning, developing, globalizing marketing system, 4,000 years in the making, yet still a work in progress. Vietnam therefore is or should be inherently interesting to macromarketing scholars.</p>

<title>Organization, Structure, and Foci</title>
<p>An objective of this issue was to assemble articles and essays on Vietnam, which connect to various macromarketing themes. I also was interested to include scholarship that complements the trailblazing spirit of macromarketing founders and many of their disciples who have made enormous contributions to the discipline. The inspirational field studies by Wroe Alderson in the former Soviet Union (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0276146711428323">Tadajewski 2009</xref>) and Charles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0276146711428323">Slater (1968</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0276146711428323">Nason 2010</xref>) in Latin America immediately come to mind as examples, as do several studies on the systemic character of socioeconomic development (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0276146711428323">Layton 2009</xref>). Ideas in those works and many other articles published in the <italic>Journal of Macromarketing</italic> gave some guidance on topics and foci that should be included.</p>
<p>Models sensitive to Southeast Asian contexts and systems provided some insights regarding forces that should be addressed collectively in the articles and commentaries, if not necessarily in each individual contribution. They include various aspects of nature, such as topography, weather, water, flora, and fauna; culture, society, and historical events; the political apparatus and governmental institutions; macroeconomics; assorted marketing forces—for example, marketing education system, an institutionalized marketing knowledge base, skilled marketing practitioners, managers, and executives—all of which affect consumer and societal well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0276146711428323">Shultz and Pecotich 1997</xref>, p. 57; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0276146711428323">Pecotich and Shultz 2006</xref>, p. 8).</p>
<p>Upon reflection, the previously introduced forces could/should be expanded. One certainly could make a case for the inclusion of catalytic technology (e.g., cell phones and the Internet), which is a factor that has radically influenced development (cf., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0276146711428323">Hill and Dhanda 2004</xref>). Profit and ancillary financial institutions and markets dedicated to wealth creation and allocation also are powerful agents that affect change. Other influences likely will emerge over time and as systems evolve (cf., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0276146711428323">Layton 2009</xref>). With new experiences, empirical evidence, and deeper understanding, we can envision a conceptual model that more comprehensively illustrates the forces that elicit the dynamism of marketing systems in transitioning economies such as Vietnam. Longitudinal study perhaps does beget some wisdom.</p>
<p>All the articles and essays are directly or indirectly relevant to one or more of the aforementioned forces. <italic>Doi Moi</italic>, the 1986 policy shift from central economic planning to market mechanisms, which both integrates and transcends politics, culture, economics, marketing, and wellness, is explicitly mentioned in every article and essay. That every author felt it necessary to address <italic>Doi Moi</italic> indicates how important the policy was to the country’s renaissance. Some readers might find numerous introductions to and discussions of <italic>Doi Moi</italic> to be redundant. However, many readers today download only a single digital article rather than peruse all articles in a physical copy of the <italic>Journal</italic>. Thus, I thought the upsides of context and clarity outweighed the potential downside of redundancy. This decision also seemed most fair to authors who toiled to write their articles or commentaries and worked hard to revise them in response to many specific comments by reviewers and me. We wanted as much of their work to be published as was reasonable and space permitted. Authors however were discouraged from including long historical preambles, unless the text was directly relevant to the theme of the article, even though those preambles very well may have enhanced individual contributions.</p>
<p>The lack of detailed context in each article or essay possibly could be problematic for readers who may be unfamiliar with the land, people, and history of Vietnam. These readers in turn may not have an appreciation for historical and/or natural forces that have shaped the current Vietnamese marketing system. What follows is a <italic>very brief</italic> attempt to redress this concern. The content is by no means an exhaustive overview. Readers interested in Vietnam’s long and complex history—the interplay of land, people, culture, feudalism, empire, war, colonialism, nationalism, independence, and rebirth—are encouraged to read other sources (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0276146711428323">FitzGerald 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0276146711428323">Hoang 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0276146711428323">Hoang and Bui 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0276146711428323">Jamieson 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0276146711428323">Karnow 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0276146711428323">Taylor 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0276146711428323">Tran and Reid 2006</xref>).</p>

<p>Vietnam is a political economy and marketing system literally rooted in the land. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0276146711428323">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the country’s political and physical boundaries. China is to the north; Laos and Cambodia to the west. The map clearly denotes the “South China Sea” to Vietnam’s east. To be politically correct, Vietnamese prefer the name “East Sea” or “Eastern Sea,”<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0276146711428323">2</xref> for reasons that will become apparent below. The coastline is approximately 3,400 kilometers long, about the distance between Seattle and San Diego; the narrowest part of the country is only about 50 kilometers wide. The total land area is about the size of California. Eighty percent of the countryside is hilly or mountainous. The climate is tropical and monsoonal, though the mountainous region of the far north and northwest can be cooler. There are two seasons—rainy and dry—but precisely when those seasons occur and the impact they have is somewhat regionally dependent; coastal Vietnam occasionally is subjected to typhoons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0276146711428323">Central Intelligence Agency 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0276146711428323">Le 1997</xref>).</p>

<p>Topography, climate, and natural resources greatly predict whether people will settle in any given place, and what customs and practices—including marketing systems—will emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0276146711428323">Shultz and Pecotich 1997</xref>). This certainly is true for Vietnam. Most Vietnamese live in the northern and southern watersheds of the Red River and Mekong River, respectively. Agriculture has been the dominant source of livelihood for millennia, though Vietnam is transitioning to an industrial economy. Urbanization and commercial activity have been stimulated by lowland and midland fertile planes, watersheds, ports, and access to trade routes. People living on the coast traditionally organize their lives and commerce around fishing, shipping, and tourism. More generally, Vietnam tends to be viewed as three regions: North, Central, and South. Each tends to have distinct attributes; residents have somewhat distinct affinities and habits. Vietnam is administered with these regional distinctions in mind. The remote mountainous areas create unique administrative challenges as well as opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0276146711428323">Hoang 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Vietnam would be covered by rainforest were it not inhabited by humans. Resource exploitation and urbanization have taken their toll. Dense vegetation however still covers much of the country. Recent conversations with local authorities and scholars, coupled with my own field observations indicate Vietnam actually may be adding acreage to its forests (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0276146711428323">FAO 2010</xref>, table 3). On the other hand, reforestation in Vietnam may be the result of trade agreements or clandestine activities that may be accelerating deforestation in neighboring Laos. Such activities remind us that Vietnam’s marketing system is tied to the marketing systems of its neighbors as well as other countries and global institutions. About three-quarters of Vietnamese still live in rural areas, though the allure of urban centers has resulted in marked population increases to urban hubs, with concomitant economic growth and environmental challenges (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0276146711428323">World Bank 2011c</xref>).</p>
<p>Hanoi, Haiphong, Ho Chi Minh City, Danang, and Can Tho are principal administrative and commercial centers. Hanoi is the political capital. It is located on the Red River and has a population of approximately 3 million people, though note that population measures for Vietnamese cities are generally regarded to underestimate the actual number of people living in them; this is certainly the case when one considers metropolitan areas. Hanoi and adjacent provinces also are growing targets for FDI. Haiphong is a port and industrial city of about 2 million people. It is the other dominant commercial center in northern Vietnam. Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon and located in southern Vietnam on the Saigon River, is the country’s largest city, officially home to about 6 million people, but as suggested above by most accounts it is much larger. Ho Chi Minh City is the commercial capital; it is generally considered to be Vietnam’s most cosmopolitan city and has greatly influenced the socioeconomic development of bordering provinces such as Binh Duong, Dong Nai, and beyond. Can Tho is an agribusiness and aquaculture center—Vietnam’s “rice bowl”—on the Mekong. Vung Tau and Danang are major coastal ports located on Vietnam’s south and central coast, respectively. The central highlands include Da Lat, a holiday destination and refuge from tropical heat, and Buon Ma Thuot, Vietnam’s coffee-growing capital; they are tourism and agribusiness centers. Hue, located on the central coast just north of Danang, is the former capital of Imperial Vietnam. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has designated it a World Heritage Site. Ha Long Bay (an archipelago of 3,000 islands and limestone monoliths); My Son (site of Cham-civilization ruins), Hoi An (an ancient trading town), and Phong Nha (caves) also have been designated World Heritage Sites (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0276146711428323">Central Intelligence Agency 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0276146711428323">Embassy of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, Vietnam’s topography and physical assets reveal a varied, primarily tropical landscape being rapidly developed for economic gain, with both social benefits and costs. It is strategically located and blessed with abundant fisheries, mineral reserves, and fertile soil. It is inhabited by nearly 100 million, highly literate, and industrious people keen to develop these assets. It is a geopolitical entity linked to other countries and institutions regionally and around the world. Vietnam, despite a modest per capita Gross National Income (GNI) of about $1200 (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0276146711428323">Asian Development Bank 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0276146711428323">World Bank 2011c</xref>), is a marketing system nicely positioned to expand its regional and global marketing activities to the benefit of domestic, regional, and global stakeholders, <italic>if</italic> this inherently complex system is well managed. Insights into how assets might be managed in the future may be gleaned from a brief review of social and administrative tendencies that have emerged from Vietnam’s long history.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0276146711428323">
<title>The Rise of Vietnamese Civilization</title>
<p>Archaeological findings suggest the first Vietnamese were a homogeneous linguistic group that first inhabited the Red River valley, establishing a wet-rice culture perhaps as far back as 4,000 years ago (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0276146711428323">Hoang and Bui 1979</xref>). Given the natural wealth of the land—and neighbors with their own interests—Vietnam has engaged in a seemingly continuous battle for sovereignty over the millennia. National character, cultural institutions, and present borders arose from persistence and conflict (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0276146711428323">Karnow 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0276146711428323">McAlister and Mus 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0276146711428323">Taylor 1983</xref>). Wars were both devastating and a source of wealth and cultural infusion. China’s influence is most notable; other major influences include Cham and Khmer kingdoms, the Mongols, France, the United States, and, most recently, regional and European Union (EU) investors. All shaped and continue to shape Vietnamese culture. A visit to Vietnam today likely would lead one to conclude that among the primary cultural influences are trade organizations, aid groups, global media, and brand kings. Today, the Vietnamese psyche evinces national pride, determined independence, respect for long-standing traditions, some wariness toward outsiders, and a growing embrace of popular culture and an expanding marketing system that facilitates its consumption. Indeed, the global consumer—and that which enables him or her—has arrived in Vietnam.</p>
<p>China’s historical relationship and current tensions with Vietnam warrant further discussion. China ruled Vietnam for nearly a thousand years, until 939 AD. Towns and cities across Vietnam have landmarks adorned with the names Hai Ba Trung, Le Loi, Nguyen Hue, and others who led uprisings or vanquished Chinese invaders and overlords. Despite antipathies, Chinese occupation inevitably led to a loose adaptation of Taoism, Confucianism, and a mandarin system of administration that Vietnamese feudal rulers used to expand southward from the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries. This march included the conquest of the Chams and Khmers. A melding of Confucian and Buddhist values evident in Vietnamese culture emerged from this southern expansion.</p>
<p>Vietnam had well-established culture and language, and effective political and economic systems, by the seventeenth century; its political apparatus and even its marketing system—perhaps best illustrated by the trading city of Hoi An—were at a level of sophistication and effectiveness not typically seen elsewhere in Southeast Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0276146711428323">Williams 1992</xref>). Chinese settlers, traders, and emissaries made contributions to this system. In time, much of their activity was concentrated in the Chinese community of Cho Lon, which initially was adjacent to Saigon but essentially was absorbed into Saigon as the city grew. That community was ostracized in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as Indochina remained a focal point of global and regional politics. The Vietnam–China border war of 1979 resulted in many ethnic Chinese departing Vietnam, often as “boat people.”</p>
<p>Today, Chinese investment in and trade agreements with Vietnam bode well for a new era of cooperation. Vietnam, however, keeps a wary eye on its large and powerful rival to the north (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0276146711428323">Chen 1987</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0276146711428323">Shultz and Ardrey 1995</xref>). Ongoing and escalating tensions over islands and oil rights in the “East Sea” grow increasingly worrisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0276146711428323">BBC News 2011</xref>). China’s renewed influence on Vietnam’s affairs has rankled Vietnamese intellectuals and civic leaders, some of whom took the remarkable action of openly questioning Vietnamese policy vis-à-vis China, in a collectively written document submitted to the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) and the National Assembly and then widely distributed on the Internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0276146711428323">VietnamNet 2011</xref>). While most observers are optimistic, diplomacy will reduce tensions and produce mutually agreed upon solutions, when one considers that China and Vietnam have waged war nineteen times in their long, shared histories—and most recently in the aforementioned 1979 war—further military hostilities are not inconceivable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0276146711428323">
<title>Vietnamese Culture: Foundations and Evolution</title>
<p>As suggested above, Vietnamese culture is a blend of early animistic beliefs, Taoism, Mahayana Buddhism, and Confucianism; it has a world view—Yin and Yang—not unlike what one finds in some other East and Southeast Asian countries. This underlying precept is the foundation for a core set of traditional Vietnamese values, such as <italic>Ly Do</italic> (reason or the nature of things), <italic>Hieu</italic> (filial piety), <italic>On</italic> (moral debt), <italic>De</italic> (proper relationships), <italic>Nghia</italic> (the righteous path and duty), <italic>Tinh</italic> (emotionalism, spontaneity or love), <italic>Nhan</italic> (Compassion), <italic>Dieu</italic> (relative versus absolute harmony), and <italic>Chan Ly</italic> (an absolute standard). These and other values affect relations, roles, obligations, participation, honor, contribution, face, and status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0276146711428323">Jamieson 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>The family and the village are primary units for social organization. Roles, events, and behaviors are reinforced by ancestral worship—a fundamental element of natural order and hence a powerful force in societal organization—and marketing and consumption dynamics from birth, to marriage, to death, and even post-death via rituals to honor the deceased. <italic>Tet</italic>, an annual festival that coincides with the lunar New Year, is the “family ritual of renewal.” It requires atonement, forgiveness, and philanthropy and is integral to Vietnamese culture. <italic>Tet</italic> is a bedrock of Vietnamese society, certainly for the <italic>Kinh</italic> or <italic>Viet</italic>; that is, the ethnic group that comprises approximately 80 percent of the current population. Fifty-three other ethnic groups also are recognized as part of Vietnam. They typically have unique languages and cultures. The <italic>Tay</italic>, <italic>Thai</italic>, <italic>Muong</italic>, <italic>Hoa</italic> or ethnic Chinese, <italic>Khmer</italic>, and <italic>Nung</italic> have the largest minority populations; ethnic groups with smaller populations (sometimes numbering only in the hundreds) are the <italic>Brau</italic>, <italic>Romam</italic>, and <italic>Odu</italic> (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0276146711428323">Hoang 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0276146711428323">Jamieson 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Vietnam’s distinct culture also has been shaped by western influences, which began in earnest with visits from European maritime powers in the early sixteenth century. The cultural impact of French colonial rule was especially substantial, shaping many Vietnamese institutions. Most obvious among them were architecture and urban planning, education, religion, the arts, administration, and of course marketing and commerce. Vestiges remain in the forms of buildings, cuisine, the Latin alphabet (i.e., <italic>quoc ngu</italic>), Roman Catholicism (practiced by about 10 percent of the population), and Caodaism (a religion unique to Vietnam). The French, similarly to the Chinese, eventually abandoned colonial ambitions in Vietnam. Following a sustained insurgency led by the <italic>Viet Minh</italic> (i.e., League for the Independence of Vietnam), the French were finally expelled from Vietnam following their defeat at a northern hill station, Dien Bien Phu, in 1954. A brokered, multilateral agreement subsequently resulted in the North–South/Communist–Capitalist division of the country. This accord sparked a large migration of Vietnamese; the direction they traveled across the seventeenth parallel depended upon family ties and political, economic, and/or religious sympathies (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0276146711428323">Karnow 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The Viet Minh, a precursor to the CPV were initially organized in China, in 1941, under the charismatic leadership of Ho Chi Minh, among others. Given historical antipathies, it is somewhat ironic that Vietnamese revolutionaries used China as a safe haven and ally in their struggle for independence. Potential problems with this arrangement and simultaneous French occupation were discussed by Viet Minh leaders. Ho Chi Minh famously captured the prevailing Vietnamese sentiment:<disp-quote>
<p>The last time the Chinese came, they stayed a thousand years. The French are foreigners. They are weak. Colonialism is dying. The white man is finished in Asia. But if the Chinese stay now, they will never go. As for me, I prefer to sniff French (excrement) for five years than to eat Chinese (excrement) for the rest of my life. (Ho Chi Minh, in, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0276146711428323">Forbes 2007</xref>)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0276146711428323">3</xref>
</p>
</disp-quote>Though pertaining to a specific historical context, the quote reveals a tendency among Vietnamese leaders to be pragmatic and to see the larger picture of national interests. This also was evident when Ho Chi Minh cooperated with US intelligence sources to drive Imperial Japan from Indochina and later sought Chinese and Soviet assistance in the war with the United States. More recently, it has been evident in the implementation of <italic>Doi Moi</italic>, new trade agreements, and deeper integration into the global marketing system.</p>
<p>Tragedy, mistake, and misunderstanding often best capture the prevailing themes of US-Vietnam relations from the 1950s to the 1990s. After cooperating during World War II, relations turned sour when Truman rebuffed Ho Chi Minh’s requests for assistance to gain independence from France. The establishment and ascent of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (i.e., North Vietnam) was interpreted by Washington as a threatening global expansion of communism. The United States engaged militarily; by the late 1960s, hundreds of thousands of American (and Australian, South Korean, and other allied troops) were stationed in the Republic of Vietnam, more commonly referred to as South Vietnam. The scale, scope, and ferocity of the hostilities and ensuing devastation profoundly scarred the Vietnamese countryside and psyche; it also profoundly shaped Americans’ view of the world and themselves. Southern, urban Vietnam had become a marketing system greatly catering to the war effort. America’s departure fractured that system, creating severe economic, social, and psychological difficulties, particularly in Saigon.</p>
<p>The southern regime capitulated to advancing North Vietnamese forces in 1975. The country was soon thereafter politically and administratively united. The Socialist Republic of Vietnam was born. War devastation, unification, and reconstruction caused immense problems for peacetime government. Marxist–Leninist plans and neo-Stalinist social policies resulted in a truly nonmarketing system incapable of remedying myriad problems. Compounding the many difficulties, the costly border conflict with China and Vietnam’s military expansion into Cambodia further undermined recovery; a disintegrating Soviet Union was set to end its aid, which in the early 1980s amounted to about a billion US dollars, annually. By the mid-1980s, Vietnam had become one of the poorest countries in the world and again was thrust into crisis.</p>

<title>A Marketing System Emerges</title>
<p>Vietnam’s command economy simply could not meet the needs of the people. Inflation and food shortages were rampant; many Vietnamese risked their lives by fleeing in barely seaworthy boats. Rumors of widespread famine and even insurrection circulated; a tipping point had been reached. The response was <italic>Doi Moi</italic>, the now rather famous, far-reaching set of reform policies enacted in 1986 at the sixth CPV Congress. First steps included de-collectivizing agriculture, moving toward market prices, and bringing inflation under control.</p>
<p>A nascent marketing system was established, which in turn led to more reforms and a foundation for a period of rapid economic growth. Various sectors quickly and impressively responded to opportunities created by reductions in central economic planning and related controls. Despite declining Soviet aid, almost no western aid, and little FDI outside the oil sector, Vietnam managed to begin a period of rapid growth marked by progress in exports, agriculture, and industry (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0276146711428323">Cima 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0276146711428323">Dapice and Vallely 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0276146711428323">Do 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>It would not be an exaggeration to state that the shift to the market saved Vietnam; again, the articles and commentaries in this issue not surprisingly address various impacts of <italic>Doi Moi</italic> on marketing and consumption that have emerged subsequent to it. Even the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s had little effect on the country, as economic growth hovered near double digits and wellness indicators for most Vietnamese improved. By the new millennium, Vietnam was in a good position. Further reforms introduced at the ninth CPV Congress in 2001 were enacted to facilitate property rights, entrepreneurship, FDI, and trade and to ensure that Vietnam was squarely on the path toward becoming a modern economy; by 2006 and the conclusion of the tenth Congress, party members were (officially) allowed to participate in capitalist activities (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0276146711428323">Mydans 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The global economic trauma of the last few years has created some new challenges. Issues such as improvements to the legal system, reforming the banking and financial system, process transparency, and improving the efficiency of public investment still must be addressed. Corruption, bad debt, and unsustainable resource management must be reigned in. Rhetoric will not solve these problems. The many challenges however also create new opportunities (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0276146711428323">Dapice et al. 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Vietnam, a member of the WTO since 2007, continues to move toward full implementation of macroeconomic fundamentals. Competitive pressure from its neighbors and other countries likely will force Vietnamese leaders to conclude this course, though difficult, is necessary. Again, with proper management, a further period of rapid and poverty-reducing growth should be possible and is expected. The World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and Asian Development Bank are in general agreement that the Vietnamese government’s Resolution 11/CP has helped to control inflation, to stabilize the economy, and to ensure social welfare; these are remarkable outcomes in the context of ongoing global economic difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0276146711428323">Vietnam News Agency 2011</xref>). Readers will see that matters of sustainability and wellness also increasingly dominate the consciousness of Vietnam’s citizens and leaders. So, Vietnam is likely to continue the development of its marketing system and “to catch up with the rest of the world”—still a stated objective of many Vietnamese—and to become an industrialized country by the year 2020, the stated objective of the government (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0276146711428323">
<italic>Nhan Dan</italic> 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Readers heretofore unfamiliar with Vietnam’s long and rich history may now have a broader perspective of the country, its people, and its evolving marketing system. Consider furthermore that 70 percent of Vietnamese were born after the end of the “Vietnam War” (or the “American War” as Vietnamese refer to it). From farmers and politicians to the rapidly growing middle and upper classes, Vietnamese look to the future. They aspire to have or to consume many of the same products, services, brands, comforts, opportunities, protections, and securities provided by marketing systems in Europe, the United States, Australia, and developed Asia. Closer to home (literally, my home), <italic>Millenials</italic>, some of whom join me on immersion courses and research projects in Vietnam, describe Vietnam as “fun,” “cool,” “exciting,” “a happy place,” and “a country of tremendous opportunity.” The vast majority of people I have met in Vietnam over the last twenty years share similar descriptions of the United States. We have come far. Fresh perspectives and further understanding of the interplay of markets, marketing, and society in Vietnam—and ways in which other countries, people, and companies interact with this country and its people—are imperative. It is hoped that the following articles and commentaries make contributions toward those outcomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0276146711428323">
<title>Introduction to Articles and Commentaries</title>
<p>Eight refereed articles and four invited essays are featured in this special issue. Themes familiar to macromarketing scholars are woven throughout them: systems, competition and markets, quality of life, environmental sustainability, ethics and distributive justice, globalization, socioeconomic development, and history.</p>
<p>The essays bring perspectives from contributors who are not members of the marketing academy, including a lawyer, economists, and a diplomat. Each essayist has particular expertise and/or noteworthy experience in Vietnam; each examines issues of vital interest to Vietnam and stakeholders of its marketing system. So, while the <italic>Journal</italic>’s organizational structure requires essays to follow articles, the intellectual contributions and keen observations by the essayists should not be viewed as less substantive than those made by authors of articles.</p>
<p>Spelling and language idiosyncrasies also should be noted<italic>. Doi Moi</italic>, for example, can be spelled several ways, including doi moi, Doi Moi, đổi mới, Đổi Mới. Vietnamese moreover is a monosyllabic language, written with a Latin alphabet that often includes diacritics indicating differences in tone and meaning. Authors were encouraged to use “American” spelling, for example, Vietnam versus Việt Nam, Hanoi versus Hà Nội, though some scholarly license was given to authors. Vietnamese names are traditionally written with the family name appearing before the given name/names; some Vietnamese authors exercised their prerogative to use western order for their names. Nguyen Dinh Tho, for example, appears in the table of contents and on his coauthored article as Tho Nguyen. Nguyen Thi Tuyet Mai chose to use the traditional Vietnamese order of names.</p>
<sec id="section7-0276146711428323">
<title>Refereed Articles</title>
<p>Readers will have discerned by this juncture that <italic>Doi Moi</italic> initiated deep structural changes to the economic and social fabric of Vietnam. Among the most impactful of the changes were the liberation of entrepreneurship and the emergence of private enterprise, first in agriculture and then other sectors. The first article accordingly features this vital aspect of Vietnam’s policy change and transition. More specifically, in “Vietnam and Private Enterprises—A Macromarketing Perspective,” Audhesh K. Paswan and Trang Phuc Tran examine the growth of private enterprises—which frequently are entrepreneurial, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)—and their macromarketing implications for Vietnam. Relying on the theoretical framework of complex adaptive systems, the authors suggest that private enterprises, particularly SMEs, play a crucial role in the economic well-being of Vietnamese citizens. Secondary data analyzed by Paswan and Tran indicate that the growth in the private sector is influenced by nonroutine actions by key stakeholders—government, the education sector, and investors, for example—which provide an environment, capital, and the skilled human resources required for enterprises to thrive and thus to make a number of important contributions to society; explicitly, market-driven endeavors, human resources development, economic growth, job creation, and wealth creation; and implicitly competition, transparency, and pressures for more efficient and equitable allocation of resources.</p>
<p>A country’s retail landscape is a touchstone for development: limited purchasing power means few markets and only rudimentary retail establishments from which to purchase a small selection of inexpensive goods and services. Over the last 25 years, Vietnam’s retail sector has transitioned from venues dominated by dreary markets and simple kiosks to modern malls, hypermarkets, shops, and restaurants that often meet the highest standards for quality. In “Modern Retailers in a Transition Economy: The Case of Vietnam,” Masayoshi Maruyama and Le Trung report findings from a study of Vietnam’s emergent modern retailers. Using site observations and in-depth interviews with CEOs and government officials, the authors surveyed firms that control most of the modern retail formats in Vietnam. Maruyama and Le discuss operations and renovations of retailers, the structure and the background of competitors, the challenges confronting retailers, and prospects for future development. What emerges is a comprehensive picture of modern retailers in Vietnam, with implications for consumers, policy makers, and local and foreign retailers.</p>
<p>Transition to the market includes new trade agreements, more open markets, and greater purchasing power resulting in greater assortment, more consumer choices, and varied consumption experiences. While this trend is generally considered to be positive, it can be associated with negative outcomes as well. In “The Impact of Status Orientations on Purchase Preference for Foreign Products in Vietnam, and Implications for Policy and Society,” Nguyen Thi Tuyet Mai and Kirk Smith examine the impact of status orientations on consumer purchase preferences for foreign products, which is an emerging disposition in Vietnam. The authors used in-depth interviews, focus groups, and surveys to assess attitudes and behaviors among urban Vietnamese consumers. Results provide empirical evidence for the positive influence of modern status orientation on willingness to buy imported products. Traditional status orientation was found not to be a predictor of willingness to buy. Furthermore, and consistent with the findings in previously published literature, consumer ethnocentrism was negatively related to willingness to buy imported products. The growing penchant for status-seeking foreign products and the social motives underlying this phenomenon have implications for consumers, marketers, and policy makers, and ultimately societal wellness. The authors conclude with discussion of these implications. In so doing, they address multiple perspectives and offer brief suggestions for future research.</p>
<p>Rapid socioeconomic change affects a number of social roles; family and sex roles possibly are among them. Vietnamese policy moreover often has been designed to shape household consumption through various initiatives, including gender equality programs, and thus in some circumstances may have affected or will affect sex role specialization. In “Sex Role Specialization in a Transforming Market: Empirical Evidence from Vietnamese Middle-class Households,” Elfriede Penz and Erich Kirchler investigate Vietnamese middle-class families’ decision making. That is, they analyze decision making made in Hanoi households, which have undergone a modification of the traditional view of the family from autonomous unit to object of state policy. The authors’ research helps us to better understand Vietnamese households’ consumption decisions and spouses’ current influence patterns. Among some of their interesting findings, we see that decisions on traditionally female-dominated items (e.g., cooking utensils) are associated with the highest role specialization; decisions on traditionally male-dominated products (e.g., computers and automobiles) showed a somewhat different pattern. Overall, Penz and Kirchler observed no significant sex role changes and, moreover, it seems that, to date, traditional Vietnamese sex role specialization does not differ among age groups. Instead, traditional sex role segmentation remains predominant across all investigated age groups. While economic and consumption habits change rapidly, middle-class families in Hanoi appear to preserve their traditional influence patterns in purchase decisions. Particularly interesting, and counter to popular assumptions, young Vietnamese middle-class couples do not display different sex role specialization and influence, compared to older Vietnamese. Whether these findings by Penz and Kirchler hold for other regions of Vietnam beyond the capital city, or will stand the test of time and growing influences from globalization, remains to be discovered in future studies.</p>
<p>Transitions to the market and subsequent socioeconomic development clearly have produced some positive wellness indicators in Vietnam. Some aspects of development however have come at some costs to the environment. In “The Dark Side of Development in Vietnam—Lessons from the Killing of the Thi Vai River,” Nguyen Hieu and Pham Huyen examine the negative aspects of FDI in Vietnam by studying a high-profile scandal involving Vedan, a Taiwanese company that manufactures monosodium glutamate, starch products, and specialty chemicals. Vedan was found to be poisoning the Thi Vai River and its broader ecosystem. Evidence suggests pollution generated by Vedan has driven perhaps tens of thousands of downstream farmers into destitution as their principle livelihood, fishing, was devastated. The authors explore the contexts in which marketing practices generate a tipping point to affect appropriate regulation of those practices. This exploration includes a literature review on the importance of FDI for economic growth and its impact on developing countries; an examination of media coverage and discussion forums; site visits and interviews, and survey research. Nguyen and Pham synthesize information from various perspectives and discuss the importance of stakeholders vis-à-vis companies’ operations and sustainable growth, while bringing into focus Vietnam and the Vedan case. They conclude with considerations for policy making and provide directions for future research.</p>
<p>Human resources development and quality university education are vital to Vietnam’s ongoing transition, and the life quality of people integral to that process. In “Psychological Capital, Quality of Work Life and Quality of Life of Marketers: Evidence from Vietnam,” Tho Nguyen and Trang Nguyen examine (1) the roles of psychological capital—an individual’s psychological state of development—in job performance and quality of work life among marketers in Vietnam; (2) the impacts of marketers’ quality of work life on job performance and quality of life, more generally. After developing a conceptual model and testable hypotheses, the research was administered in two phases, a pilot and a main survey. Data were collected in Ho Chi Minh City, the principal business center of Vietnam. Findings reveal that psychological capital has positive impacts on job performance and quality of work life. Furthermore, quality of work life underlies both job performance and broad aspects of life quality. These findings confirm the importance of psychological capital in marketers’ work and lives; they also suggest more broadly that the study of various interacting forces—education, professional growth and impact, and well-being of catalytic professionals such as marketers, for example—is important if we are to gain better understanding of the complexities of development and ultimately one of its most important measures: quality of life.</p>
<p>We revisit the importance of education and skilled labor to economic growth and enhanced subjective quality of life in the article by Daniel Westbrook and Hoang Van Kinh, “Labor Market Transition and the Impact of Education on Real Per-Capita Household Consumption Expenditure in Viet Nam: 1993–2004.” Examining data from the Vietnam Household Living Standard Surveys, Westbrook and Hoang estimate a model of real per-capita consumption expenditure determination at the household level for Vietnam during its early to middle transition period. The contribution of the paper lies in the key explanatory variables used: schooling attainment of the most educated person in the household, an index of labor market activity in the household’s commune, and the interaction between those two variables. Analysis and findings suggest the impact of schooling on real household per-capita consumption expenditure is economically substantial, increases over time, and is powerfully enhanced by increasing labor market activity. Moreover, the effect of the best educated household member being male was statistically insignificant until 2004, at which point it became statistically significant and negative but not very large. In addition, the penalty associated with minority status diminished sharply between 1993 and 2004. Finally, findings by Westbrook and Hoang indicate households in which the best educated household members work in household-based nonagricultural activities fare better than those in which the best educated members work in agriculture or outside of the household.</p>
<p>Analysis of a society’s most meaningful rituals can facilitate deep understanding of that society. In “Vietnamese Weddings from Marx to Market,” Nguyen Thuc-Doan and Russell Belk explore the interplay between public interventions and marketing systems in Vietnam, including the extent to which wedding ritual consumption marketing creates desirable and undesirable outcomes for society; government responses to those outcomes; intended and unintended results of these responses; and reactions of wedding ritual marketers, which may initiate another loop of government actions and reactions from marketing systems. Sharing thick descriptions from their ethnographic research, the authors present text that is a conduit to the humanity of Vietnam’s transition, by introducing readers to an intensely emotional and personal ritual steeped in centuries long traditions, but markedly altered by socialist transformation, and then markedly altered again by market reforms and globalization. Findings suggest that Vietnamese weddings are rituals that both predict and result from socioeconomic changes; Vietnam’s collective perception and imagination of its condition are relative to “modernity”; China may be viewed by Vietnamese as a threatening “other”—a political and marketing force potentially impeding Vietnam’s progress toward “modernization.”</p>

<title>Commentaries</title>
<p>Economic liberalization has made Vietnam a major trading nation. The US has become one of Vietnam’s largest trade partners. While that trade relationship has greatly benefited a number of stakeholders in both countries, a celebrated case—the “catfish wars”—continues to draw attention, generate debate, and spur litigation. In “Fishing for NTBs: the Catfish Wars as a Rent Seeking Problem,” William Schubert views this case through the lenses of trade law. Schubert reminds us that over the past decade, US catfish producers have collectively engaged in protectionist rent seeking. This strategy pits the domestic industry against not only Vietnam (as well as other countries) but also US catfish consumers and even US exporters in unrelated product markets. The strategy has resulted in the creation of multiple nontariff barriers (NTBs) against catfish imports. Viewing the so-called Catfish Wars as a rent-seeking scenario, Schubert addresses the collective action problem, the potential for disguised protectionism to occur, and how exporters doing business in the United States may be able to counter these problems (or at least mitigate their effects) by coordinating with the US consumers, who have closely aligned interests.</p>
<p>Land management is crucial to Vietnam’s socioeconomic development. As such, it was among the first considerations for policy change when CPV leaders shifted toward the market. In “Land Policy in Vietnam: Challenges and Prospects for Constructive Change,” Malcolm McPherson addresses the importance of land management and land use in Vietnam, while also pointing out that land reform often is shortsighted and conjures images of the commons dilemma, resulting in inequities. McPherson reviews evolving land policy, highlighting inconsistencies and shortcomings, and shares recommendations to improve policy and the long-term well-being of Vietnam and its people. He suggests that several events must occur for Vietnam to achieve the middle-income status by 2020, which we have seen is a goal of the Vietnamese Government. Those events should continue to facilitate rapid industrialization and modernization. Specific suggestions include the conversion of some inefficient agricultural land to industrial parks, residential areas, and infrastructure. More generally, all land should be used in ways that yield the highest social returns. McPherson contends (1) public investment should help to boost agricultural and land productivity; (2) environmental protection initiatives (including land management) should ensure that the institutions and incentives support environmental sustainability.</p>
<p>Nowhere in Vietnam is the need for appropriate resource management more apparent than in the country’s agricultural heart, the Mekong Delta. This watershed is home to approximately 20 million Vietnamese. The Delta’s contributions to the country—and to other consumers and regions of the world dependent upon its bounty—are huge. In “The Mekong Delta: Rural Development Meets the Environment—Systemic Challenges and Possible Solutions,” David Dapice and Vo Xuan Tong report on this rich but delicate ecosystem, which is distressed by domestic and regional management/mismanagement. Several forces affect the Delta’s well-being. Within Vietnam, poorly conceived or administered rural development policies and unsustainable exploitation contribute to degradation. Similar problems also exist upstream, beyond Vietnam’s borders. Upstream damming, climate change, and failure to implement policies to link several systems all compound problems emerging in Vietnam’s Mekong Delta. Dapice and Vo examine these trends and forces; they offer reasonable adjustments to policy and practice with hopes to enhance the welfare of the Mekong and the people dependent upon it. The authors contend that solutions must be systemic and should include economies of scale; higher value crops and product branding; improvements and efficiencies to integrated components of marketing channels; technologies to improve data collection and analysis, crop planting and yields, better communication among the Delta’s stakeholders; more prudent foreign and domestic investment; and integrative policies to sustain the marketing system embodied by Vietnam’s southern Delta and the entire Mekong Basin.</p>
<p>The final essay of this special issue is “The U. S. and Vietnam: Old Enemies Become Friends, and Implications for the Future.” In this reflection Raymond Burghardt sheds light on Vietnam’s emerging presence in geopolitics, assesses the evolving positive relations between Vietnam and the United States, and introduces some implications for the future. Burghardt, who served as US Ambassador to Vietnam, suggests that relations have progressed remarkably since 1995 restoration of diplomatic ties. Trends indicate the United States and Vietnam will continue to cooperate closely and pragmatically on several matters of mutual interest. Among those mutual interests are trade and FDI, education, public health and well-being, and strategic interests, including military cooperation. These trends are viewed as beneficial to both countries, they also are considered important to the regional balance of power, as China continues to expand its influence in Southeast Asia and beyond.</p>
<p>As we go to press, we are in the silver anniversary year of <italic>Doi Moi</italic>, an appropriate time for a special issue on Vietnam. The authors and I anticipate readers will find the twelve contributions to be thought provoking and useful. Finally, thanks to Editor Terrence Witkowski, who supported this initial country-specific special issue and has been immensely patient in the process; thanks to the authors for their good scholarship; thanks to the reviewers for their many helpful comments on the formative stages of the many manuscripts submitted.</p>
