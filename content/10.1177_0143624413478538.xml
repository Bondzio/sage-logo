<p>Future-proofed energy design for dwellings: Case studies from England and application to the Code for Sustainable Homes</p>
<p><italic>MC Georgiadou, T Hacking and P Guthrie</italic></p>
<p>Future-proofed construction is promoted implicitly within the increasingly stringent building regulations; however, there is no comprehensive method to readily incorporate futures thinking into the energy design of buildings. This study has a three-fold objective of relevance to the building industry:
<list id="list1-0143624413478538" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Illuminating the two key categories of long-term impacts in buildings, which are often erroneously treated interchangeably:
<list id="list2-0143624413478538" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>– The environmental impact <italic>of</italic> buildings due to their long lifecycles.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>– The environment&amp;rsquo;s impacts <italic>on</italic> buildings due to risks and uncertainties affecting the energy consumption by at least 2050. This refers to social, technological, economic, environmental and regulatory (predictable or unknown) trends and drivers of change, such as climate uncertainty, home-working, technology readiness etc.</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Encouraging future-proofing from an early planning stage to reduce the likelihood of a prematurely obsolete building design.</p></list-item>

<p>Symbolic modelling and predictive assessment of air source heat pumps <italic>G Murphy, J Counsell, E Baster, J Allison and S Counsell</italic></p>
<p>ASHPs are still a relatively novel technology in the UK, yet it has been suggested they could play a significant role in efforts to de-carbonise the heating sector. However field trials have found performance varies widely from installation to installation. Whilst some of this variation is due to user behaviour, ASHP systems are also very sensitive to design and commissioning. Fundamental methodologies which can provide detailed analysis of ASHP performance, such as that presented in this article, could contribute to improving system design standards. This would ensure more installations achieve a good level of performance, boosting confidence in the technology.</p>
<p>Assessing energy performance benchmarks for performing arts buildings using a new dataset</p>
<p><italic>H Heathfield and C Bottrill</italic></p>
<p>Performing arts venues provide a challenge to the modern professional in the building industry. Running on the tightest budget and rarely employing staff with formal building management training, these buildings face significant technical and financial trials in order to operate in a cost- and carbon-efficient manner. Energy benchmarks can be applied in new and existing buildings, to test designs, motivate owner and occupant action and unlock funds for building energy performance improvement.</p>
<p>Comprehensiveness and usability of tools for assessment of energy saving measures in schools</p>
<p><italic>GC Smith, D Mumovic and L Curtis</italic></p>
<p>More than 70&amp;percnt; of approximately 25,000 maintained and independent primary and secondary schools in England and Wales were built before the introduction of thermal regulations in 1970s, offering a significant opportunity to reduce carbon emission of the school building stock. In terms of construction, they could be divided in two major categories: pre 1919 solid wall construction and post war masonry cavity school buildings. This paper reviews capabilities of the less-known Energy Concept Advisor which offers designers, architects and decision makers the opportunity of assessing the performance of a particular building and comparing possible retrofitting measures quickly.</p>
<p>Benchmarking small power energy consumption in office buildings in the United Kingdom: A review of data published in CIBSE Guide F</p>
<p><italic>AC Menezes, A Cripps, RA Buswell and D Bouchlaghem</italic></p>
<p>With the increasing demand for more realistic predictions of operational energy use in buildings, small power should not be disregarded since it typically accounts for more than 20&amp;percnt; of total energy used in offices. Furthermore, small power loads can have a significant impact on the cooling loads of a building. This paper reviews existing benchmarks, focusing on the new update to CIBSE Guide F, comparing available benchmarks against newly gathered monitored data. Detailed load profiles for individual office equipment are also provided, which can be used by designers to inform better predictions of small power consumption in office buildings.</p>
<p>Energy performance optimization for Army installations</p>
<p><italic>A Zhivov, RJ Liesen, S Richter, R Jank, DM Underwood, D Neth, A Woody and C Bj&amp;ouml;rk</italic></p>
<p>This article describes the Net Zero fossil fuel-based energy optimization process and illustrates it with an example based on the results of study conducted for a cluster of buildings at Fort Irwin, CA. Application of the energy optimization process to new construction and major retrofit project shows that use of high performance building envelope (improved insulation and air tightness), advanced lighting strategies, and efficient HVAC systems results in significant energy savings (site and source) in Army buildings in all climates. When buildings built or retrofitted with a high performance building envelope, using advanced lighting systems and highly efficient &amp;lsquo;low exergy&amp;rsquo; HVAC systems, reach a theoretical energy use minimum, the largest percentage of the remaining energy use in the building will be related to its &amp;lsquo;mission&amp;rsquo;: lighting, plug loads, and domestic hot water usage. Additional savings may be achieved with measures related to improved efficiency of power generation supplied to the building (co- and tri-generation) and use of energy supplied from renewable energy sources. The integrated energy solution recommended here demonstrates that vastly improved energy efficiency and GHG reduction are feasible in the context of a normal scale development using proven approaches from the USA and elsewhere. Moreover, the optimization process can be applied to new construction and major renovation of buildings and building clusters projects developed for low energy communities.</p>
<p>Data Centre Energy Efficiency Analysis to minimize total cost of ownership</p>
<p><italic>S Flucker and R Tozer</italic></p>
<p>The paper describes the challenges of reducing energy consumption and operating cost faced by those working in the data centre industry, along with tools and solutions. Details on where and how to achieve energy savings are presented, whilst maintaining the required availability for both new build and legacy facilities. Practical examples of how to put theory into practice are explained, including case studies where real clients have implemented improvements.</p></sec>
