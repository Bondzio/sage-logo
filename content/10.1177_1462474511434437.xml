<abstract>
<p>Conventional wisdom holds that white‐collar offenders operate with relative impunity because of widespread public and governmental apathy. The present study, however, examines whether public tolerance and governmental leniency toward white‐collar offenders have endured the series of national white‐collar crime scandals emerging in 2001–2002. This study analyzes sentencing guidelines data from Florida for the period 1994 to 2004, modeling legal and extra-legal factors related to the decision to incarcerate white‐collar and street property offenders. In/out incarceration sentences imposed upon white‐collar offenders are compared with those imposed upon burglars and thieves to determine whether 21st‐century white‐collar offenders are treated more leniently than street‐level property offenders. Additional analyses consider the roles of social status and of recent corporate scandals in influencing sentencing disparities. Findings indicate that, despite operating under sentencing guidelines designed to reduce disparities, white‐collar offenders are afforded greater leniency, though this relationship varies by the type of white‐collar crime considered, the offender's social status, and whether the sentencing occurred before or after the Enron scandal. Conclusions emphasize the salience of the definition of white‐collar crime when discussing punitiveness disparities and the relationship between white‐collar crime scandals and punishment.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1462474511434437" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>During the past few decades, scholars have begun to debate whether a ‘crackdown on white‐collar crime is underway’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1462474511434437">Calavita and Pontell, 1994</xref>: 298; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1462474511434437">Katz, 1980</xref>). Recent media coverage of white‐collar crime trials supporting this contention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1462474511434437">Krantaz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1462474511434437">O'Donnell and Willing, 2003</xref>) seems to contradict the prevailing wisdom throughout most of the 20th century that white‐collar offenders receive more lenient treatment than street offenders, regardless of – and oftentimes disproportionate to – the seriousness and consequences of their offenses. Given the dubious representativeness of white‐collar sentencing events that are highly publicized by the media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1462474511434437">Levi, 2006</xref>, 2009), the purpose of the present study is to update and expand upon the available empirical literature on the sentencing of white‐collar offenders.</p>
<p>In particular, the present study investigates whether white‐collar offenders in the 21st century are the recipients of sentencing leniency compared with nonviolent, street‐level property offenders. The use of an offense‐ rather than offender‐based definition of white‐collar crime, moreover, should reveal whether upper‐level white‐collar offenders receive more lenient treatment than lower‐level white‐collar offenders, whether sentencing differences emerge across difference categories of crime victims (consumers, businesses, and victims), and whether the highly publicized Enron scandal in the early part of the new millennium has influenced the punishment of white‐collar offenders in state courts. By addressing these research questions, this study advances the current knowledge on white‐collar criminals and their treatment in the criminal justice system, contributes to the theoretical work on the factors that influence their sentencing, and informs policy discussions about the putatively different sanctions received by white‐collar offenders.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1462474511434437">1</xref></sup></p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1462474511434437"><title>Twenty‐first‐century white‐collar offenders</title>
<p>Recent anecdotal evidence reflects the claims of a current white‐collar crime crackdown. For example, ‘Prison time gets harder for white‐collar crooks’ is the title of a 2003 <italic>USA Today</italic> account detailing the sentencing of a fraudulent currency trader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1462474511434437">O'Donnell and Willing, 2003</xref>). This story suggested that, because of the ‘Enron et al. cases’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1462474511434437">Friedrichs, 2004</xref>: 113) of 2001–2002, convicted white‐collar offenders are now serving longer sentences in tougher prisons. Instances of recent harsh white‐collar crime sanctioning by the federal courts, such as WorldCom's Bernard Ebbers’ 25‐year prison sentence for an $11 billion accounting fraud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1462474511434437">Johnson and Masters, 2006</xref>) and Jeff Skilling's 24‐year prison sentence for several counts of conspiracy, insider trading, and lying to auditors in the Enron scandal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1462474511434437">Pasha, 2006</xref>), are being supplemented by an apparent state‐level punitiveness toward white‐collar offenders as exemplified by the eight and one‐third to 25‐year prison sentence for Tyco's ex‐CEO Dennis Kozlowski and ex‐CFO Mark Swartz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1462474511434437">Wong, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Such a crackdown would represent a sharp break with the conventional wisdom that white‐collar offenders have traditionally received lenient treatment, especially when compared with traditional street offenders such as burglars (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1462474511434437">Clinard and Yeager, 1980</xref>). For more than a century, it has been asserted that white‐collar offenders are viewed in a different light by the public and are treated less punitively than street offenders by the criminal justice system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1462474511434437">Ross, 1907</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1462474511434437">Sutherland, 1949</xref>). Writing at the turn of the 20th century, EA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1462474511434437">Ross (1907: 48)</xref> lamented that such offenders:<disp-quote>
<p>are not culpable in the eyes of the public and in their own eyes, their spirit attitude is not that of a criminal. The lawmaker may make their misdeeds crimes, but, so long as morality stands stock-still in the old tracks, they escape both punishment and ignominy.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Writing several decades later, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1462474511434437">Sutherland (1949: 6)</xref> affirmed Ross's observation by stating, ‘Persons who violate laws regarding restraint of trade, advertising, pure food and drugs, and similar business practices are not arrested by uniformed policemen, are not tried in criminal courts, and are not committed to prisons.’</p>
<p>This cynicism that was echoed throughout much of the 20th century spawned substantial criminological attention, particularly in the aftermath of Watergate and other highly visible scandals, such as that which occurred in the savings and loan industry during the 1980s, the ‘Enron et al.’ cases of 2001–2002 and, as this article was being revised, the role of white‐collar criminality in the global economic crisis unfolding in 2008. In one of the most exhaustive studies on white‐collar crime since Sutherland's pioneering research, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1462474511434437">Clinard and Yeager (1980: 286)</xref> affirmed that ‘sentencing disparities between the white‐collar and blue‐collar offender are universally recognized’. Indeed, the relatively lengthy sentences for the more recent white‐collar crimes identified above represent remarkable contrasts to the earlier white‐collar crime sentences for such offenders as Michael Milken, ‘The Junk Bond King’ who was given a 10‐year sentence, and banker Charles Keating, who received a 12.5‐year sentence for his role in the savings and loan scandal; moreover, both of these offenders served only a minor portion of these sentences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1462474511434437">Wong, 2005</xref>). In line with this perspective, instances of unusually harsh sentences given to white‐collar offenders in the wake of national scandals and economic crises may better represent efforts by the State to ‘contain the damage in a fraud‐ridden and ailing industry’ than ‘an effort to control crime’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1462474511434437">Calavita and Pontell, 1994</xref>: 310). In effect, these recent instances of unusually harsh sanctioning of individuals could reflect attempts to treat economic scandals as problems caused by ‘rotten apples’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1462474511434437">Levi, 2006</xref>; or folk devils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1462474511434437">Levi, 2009</xref>)) rather than rotten barrels (or, worse, contaminated orchards in need of external scrutiny).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some scholars have adopted an alternative perspective and argue that, although white‐collar offenders may have enjoyed undue leniency in years past, this is no longer the case. Rather, these authors embrace the notion that a ‘social movement against white‐collar crime’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1462474511434437">Katz, 1980</xref>: 161) has ensued in recent decades, resulting in harsher sanctioning of convicted white‐collar offenders, as recent media accounts suggest. In response, the present study addresses whether individual white‐collar offenders are treated more leniently than economic street offenders at the sentencing stage of criminal justice system processing. Sentencing data from Florida throughout a 10‐year period are analyzed to test this longstanding assumption by comparing the sentencing outcomes of white‐collar offenders and street offenders in terms of the likelihood of incarceration, as well as the sentencing outcomes of various subtypes of white‐collar offenders. In addition, the present analysis considers differences in sentencing severity among relatively higher status Medicaid provider fraud offenders and lower status public assistance fraud offenders, and the influence of the Enron et al. cases that emerged in 2001–2002 on the sentencing of white-collar offenders.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-1462474511434437"><title>Perspectives on white‐collar crime sentencing</title>
<p>It has long been assumed that white‐collar offenders have a ‘status shield’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1462474511434437">Wiggins et al., 1965: 206</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1462474511434437">see also Giordano, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1462474511434437">Rosoff, 1989</xref>) that protects them from severe sanctions, such as those meted out to more traditional street offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1462474511434437">Ross, 1907</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1462474511434437">Sutherland, 1949</xref>). This first perspective presumes that white‐collar crime is ‘committed by a person of respectability and high social status in the course of his occupation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1462474511434437">Sutherland, 1949</xref>: 9), which is a more restrictive offender‐based definition than employed in the present study and, as a consequence, indicates that social status‐based explanations for sentencing leniency are not suited to the present investigation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1462474511434437">2</xref></sup> Various reasons have been offered to explain how this status shield operates; for example, interviews with judges in white‐collar crime cases revealed that they often identify with white‐collar defendants, who come from similar backgrounds, and that these judges are reluctant to send them to the same prisons in which ‘other felons’ are routinely sent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1462474511434437">Tillman and Pontell, 1992: 564–565</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1462474511434437">Wheeler et al., 1988</xref>). Also, the lack of a prior record, particularly when combined with status-related factors such as stable work, family and community background (which are more common among white‐collar than street offenders), often precludes judicial perceptions of blameworthiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1462474511434437">Wheeler et al., 1988</xref>). In sum, unlike the case of the typical street property offender, some judges appear to feel that ‘the process is the punishment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1462474511434437">Feeley, 1979</xref>) for white‐collar offenders and, consequently, imprisonment is unnecessary. Loss of professional license and other modes of status degradation are considerations that may feature prominently in judges’ sentencing decisions about white‐collar offenders (Schwartz and Skolnick, 1962–1963; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1462474511434437">Swigert and Farrell, 1977</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, the status shield may operate in a more instrumental manner. For example, it has been suggested that the political influence associated with white‐collar offenders makes them particularly immune to punishment, as prosecutors may feel too threatened or intimidated to prosecute them for fear of retaliation or other negative consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1462474511434437">Friedrichs, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1462474511434437">Jesilow et al., 1986</xref>). The investigation and prosecution of organizational figures, furthermore, could lead to the withdrawal of valuable goods and services for local communities. Likewise, the economic resources frequently available to white‐collar offenders may contribute to sentencing leniency, both in the sense that these offenders have more to spend on legal counsel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1462474511434437">Swigert and Farrell, 1977</xref>), and because their finances render them logical targets for fines, restitution, and other financial sanctions that may offset the need for (or make counterproductive) incarceration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1462474511434437">Schanzebach and Yaeger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1462474511434437">Waldfogel, 1995</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1462474511434437">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>A second perspective – one more in line with the present study's operational definition of white‐collar crime – suggests that characteristics of the offense rather than characteristics of the offender insulate those guilty of white‐collar crimes from effective criminal justice system sanctioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1462474511434437">Shapiro, 1990</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1462474511434437">Levi, 1987</xref>). Legalistic factors that operate in favor of white‐collar criminals include the greater complexity of the typical white‐collar crime case, the diffuse nature of the victims who are oftentimes unaware of their victimization and thus do not report it, the specialized knowledge required to investigate and prosecute many of these cases, jurisdictional issues stemming from the geographical distance between perpetrator and victim(s), and the reluctance of prosecutors to pursue such cases that tend to place an onerous burden on an already overwhelmed court docket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1462474511434437">Eitle, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1462474511434437">Friedrichs, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1462474511434437">Jesilow et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1462474511434437">Levi, 1987</xref>). Not only do such considerations tend to reduce the probability of indictment in the first place, but also they commonly result in plea bargains and reduced sentences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1462474511434437">Alvesalo, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1462474511434437">Levi, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>A third perspective draws upon a large body of public opinion literature and argues that, regardless of opinions of the offenders themselves and technical difficulties associated with prosecuting white‐collar crime cases, both the public and the criminal justice system view white‐collar crime to be less serious than street crime and, consequently, less deserving of harsh sanctioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1462474511434437">Blumstein and Cohen, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1462474511434437">Blum‐West, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1462474511434437">Gibbons, 1968–1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1462474511434437">Graber, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1462474511434437">Holtfreter et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1462474511434437">McCleary et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1462474511434437">Meier and Short, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1462474511434437">Rossi et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1462474511434437">Warr, 1989</xref>). However, this line of reasoning is complicated by more recent public opinion surveys indicating an increasing desire for harsher sanctioning of white-collar offenders that appears to be approaching, if not surpassing, wishes for the harsh sanctioning of street‐level offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1462474511434437">Kane and Wall, 2006</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1462474511434437">Cohen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1462474511434437">Rebovich and Kane, 2002</xref>). Importantly, Wheeler and associates’ (1988) study found that harm and seriousness variables, including presence or threat of physical violence, amount of monetary loss, duration of the offense, nature of the victim and violation of trust, were among the most important determinants used by judges in their sentencing decisions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1462474511434437">4</xref></sup> This suggests that if a crackdown on white‐collar crime is in fact underway, one potential explanation for it could be the increasing recognition of the seriousness of these acts and a growing intolerance of white‐collar crime in general.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1462474511434437">5</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1462474511434437">Clinard and Yeager (1980)</xref> documented such a transformation in the American consciousness regarding corporate crime, which has its roots in the 1970s. Developments, such as increased media attention on white‐collar crime, the consumer movement, environmental concerns and the equal rights movement, coalesced. They inspired some scholars and citizens to question why our prisons are overwhelmingly filled with poor minority street offenders despite the pervasive and immensely harmful acts of the more powerful and well‐connected members of society. This logic resonates with historical examinations of governmental responses to white‐collar crime. From this perspective, white‐collar crime occasionally has been placed near the top of crime‐fighting agencies’ agendas, only to fade to insignificance soon thereafter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1462474511434437">Szasz, 1986</xref>). To illustrate, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1462474511434437">Friedrichs (2007)</xref> identified three eras throughout the 20th century in which white‐collar crime control was a serious issue: the Progressive era (from 1900 to 1914), the New Deal era (the 1930s), and the Great Society era (the 1960s and early 1970s; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1462474511434437">Holtfreter et al., 2005</xref>). However, starting with the Reagan administration in 1980, the United States may have entered into yet another deregulatory era (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1462474511434437">Friedrichs, 2007)</xref>, which might have reached its end according to some recent media and academic accounts. Linking the notion of social movements against white‐collar (corporate) crime with the present study's operational definition of white‐collar crime have been federal law‐enforcement operations targeting identity theft and credit card fraud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1462474511434437">Levi, 2008</xref>, 2009), as well as the notion that public demands for aggressive law‐enforcement action against powerful economic offenders effectively translates into the harsher sanctioning of low‐ and middle‐level economic offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1462474511434437">Savelsberg, 1994</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1462474511434437">Pontell, 2010</xref>).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1462474511434437"><title>White‐collar crime sentencing research</title>
<p>Due to its reliance on federal sentencing data from the 1970s, much of the existing empirical research addressing sentencing disparities between individual white‐collar and street offenders is simply outdated. Of course, this fact does not cast doubt on the credibility of the findings, but it does provoke the need for more timely research that can determine whether undue leniency alleged decades ago still exists, or whether ‘Club Fed’‐style punishment practices for white‐collar criminals are a myth or at least obsolete. As a starting point, it is instructive to assess the prior literature, particularly to identify patterns and to generate research questions that may be subjected to more timely empirical assessments.</p>
<p>Two lines of research, both conducted prior to the introduction of sentencing guidelines, dominate this area of white‐collar crime scholarship: (1) the examination by Hagan and his colleagues of sentencing patterns for <italic>white‐collar and street offenders</italic> in 10 federal district courts from 1974 to 1977; and (2) the Yale studies that combine quantitative and qualitative research techniques to evaluate the assessments made by judges in federal <italic>white‐collar crime</italic> cases from 1976 to 1978. Beyond this research, scholars only sporadically have attempted to address sentencing disparities between white‐collar and street offenders.</p>
<p>Hagan and his colleagues found that, relative to street offenders, white‐collar offenders generally do <italic>not</italic> receive preferential treatment at the sentencing stage of the criminal justice process, either in terms of the in/out prison decisions or length of prison sentences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1462474511434437">Hagan, Nagel, and Albonetti, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1462474511434437">Nagel and Hagan, 1982</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1462474511434437">6</xref></sup> At the same time, however, the authors found that one of the 10 federal districts was known for its proactive prosecutorial approach to white‐collar crime control and consequent high volume of white‐collar prosecutions, and high‐status white‐collar offenders <italic>did</italic> receive preferential treatment in this district (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1462474511434437">Hagan and Nagel, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1462474511434437">Hagan et al., 1980</xref>, 1982; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1462474511434437">Nagel and Hagan, 1982</xref>). Based upon these findings, the researchers concluded,<disp-quote>
<p>The only evidence supporting the proposition of preferential sentencing of persons convicted of white-collar crimes appears in only one federal district, the same district that is distinguished by its proactive prosecutorial policy toward white-collar crime and its resultant greater number of white-collar convictions.

<p>This research also suggested that the specific type of white‐collar crime considered impacted sentencing outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1462474511434437">Hagan and Nagel, 1982</xref>), and that Watergate had no appreciable effect on sentencing disparities because the greater tendency to sentence white‐collar offenders to prison after Watergate was offset by their shorter sentences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1462474511434437">Hagan and Palloni, 1986</xref>). Drawing from this research, it appears that white‐collar offenders generally do not receive preferential treatment at the sentencing stage of the criminal justice system process compared to street‐level property offenders, and that the specific type of white‐collar crime and major scandals involving elites may influence white‐collar sanctioning severity, while jurisdictions emphasizing white‐collar crime prosecution may yield more lenient sentencing outcomes.</p>
<p>In the wake of Hagan and colleagues’ research, several researchers from Yale initiated a second series of analyses investigating white‐collar sentencing practices. Collectively, this series has become known as the Yale studies and suggests that higher‐class position among offenders leads to judicial assessments of greater blameworthiness under some conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1462474511434437">Weisburd et al., 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1462474511434437">1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1462474511434437">Wheeler et al., 1988</xref>). Similar to the earlier research, the type of white‐collar crime considered impacted sentencing severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1462474511434437">Weisburd et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1462474511434437">Wheeler et al., 1982</xref>), as did the federal jurisdiction in which the prosecution occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1462474511434437">Weisburd et al., 1991</xref>). Furthermore, this research found support for the ‘status liability’ proposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1462474511434437">Wiggins et al., 1965</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1462474511434437">Rosoff, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1462474511434437">Skolnick and Shaw, 1994</xref>) in that high‐status white‐collar offenders were found to receive significantly more severe treatment than did low‐status white‐collar offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1462474511434437">Weisburd et al., 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1462474511434437">1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1462474511434437">Wheeler et al., 1982</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1462474511434437">7</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1462474511434437">Benson and Walker's (1988)</xref> examination of the sentencing of white‐collar offenders in a single Midwestern federal district from 1970 to 1980 found that social status was unrelated to sentencing outcomes, but those offenders sentenced after Watergate were more likely to be incarcerated than those sentenced prior to the national scandal, though there was no difference in sentence length.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1462474511434437">8</xref></sup> Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1462474511434437">Tillman and Pontell (1992)</xref> compared the sentencing of Medicaid provider fraud offenders and grand theft offenders in California and found no evidence of a status effect on sentencing severity; in other words, social status itself was not correlated with the likelihood of incarceration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1462474511434437">9</xref></sup> On the other hand, white‐collar offenders as a whole were less likely to be sentenced to prison than were street offenders, but there was no difference in the length of sentences received by the two groups of offenders. On the contrary, once the decision to incarcerate was made, the dollar amount lost became the strongest predictor of sentence severity.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-1462474511434437"><title>The present study</title>
<p>The existing research can benefit from a more timely assessment of the issues discussed, particularly given the clash between the prevailing wisdom of the 20th century and more recent claims that punishment practices are changing. The research reported here therefore addresses the following four research questions: (1) Are white‐collar offenders sentenced more leniently than comparable street‐level property offenders; (2) Does the type of white‐collar crime committed impact the relative sentencing severity of judicial sanctions; (3) Are high‐status white‐collar offenders sentenced more leniently than low‐status white‐collar offenders; and (4) Are white‐collar offenders sentenced more harshly following Enron than similar white‐collar offenders sentenced before Enron?</p>
<p>The extant literature on white‐collar crime sentencing suggests that white‐collar offenders may receive more lenient treatment than street offenders <italic>under some conditions</italic> (e.g. in districts with heavier white‐collar crime caseloads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1462474511434437">Hagan and Nagel, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1462474511434437">Hagan et al., 1980</xref>, 1982; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1462474511434437">Nagel and Hagan, 1982</xref>)), but the applicability of this claim to white‐collar offenders <italic>in general</italic> is far from conclusive. Using an offense‐based definition of white‐collar crime and drawing from the various perspectives on leniency for white‐collar crime, we anticipated that white‐collar offenders would be incarcerated with less frequency than street‐level property offenders. Further, white‐collar crime sentencing outcomes also appear to vary across different types of white‐collar crimes. For instance, mail fraud, fraudulent claims against government entities and tax fraud were documented to receive more severe sanctions than other white‐collar crimes, particularly price‐fixing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1462474511434437">Hagan and Nagel, 1982</xref>). The authors explained this discrepancy by suggesting that violations of <italic>public</italic> trust may be punished more harshly than violations of <italic>private</italic> trust (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1462474511434437">Wheeler et al., 1982</xref>). Thus, we expected the relationship between white‐collar crime and sentencing outcomes will vary depending on the specific type of white‐collar crime considered.</p>
<p>Similarly, given the historical link between social status and white‐collar crime, as well as the conflicting research evidence on the role of social status on sentencing outcomes, the third research question is addressed by comparing the sentencing outcomes of those convicted of traditionally high‐status white‐collar offenses with those convicted of lower status white‐collar crimes. We anticipated a negative relationship between social status and sentencing severity based on the status‐shield concept, even though we examine a state rather than federal sample of offenders, because we still expect the <italic>relatively</italic> greater social status of Medicaid provider fraud offenders to shield them generally from the punitiveness experiences by most public assistance fraud offenders.</p>
<p>Finally, this study examines the role of national and highly publicized white‐collar crime scandals in shaping punishment policy. If a crackdown has arrived or is imminent, it might have been galvanized by increasing public recognition of the nature, pervasiveness, and consequences of white‐collar crimes, which, in turn, could be reflected in judicial policy regarding the sentencing of white‐collar offenders. Broadening the definition of white‐collar crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1462474511434437">Edelhertz, 1970</xref>) opened the possibility that alleged (or even honestly intended) crackdowns on ‘white‐collar crime’ actually entail the targeting and harsh sanctioning of mainly lower and middle‐class fraudsters, bribers, and embezzlers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1462474511434437">Savelsberg, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1462474511434437">Weisburd et al., 1991</xref>) – precisely the type of offender with which our offense‐based and state‐level sample is likely populated to a large degree.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1462474511434437">10</xref></sup> Although sentencing guidelines were implemented as a mechanism by which fluctuations in public sentiments and individual judges’ biases would be mediated, any detected disparities in the presence of the guidelines would call into question their efficacy in achieving equal justice for offenders convicted of equally harmful crimes. We asked whether state‐level white‐collar offenders sentenced after Enron were more likely to be incarcerated than their counterparts sentenced before Enron, and we expected that they would; moreover, we expected that a similar increase in punitiveness would not emerge for street‐level property offenders.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-1462474511434437"><title>Data and methods</title>
<p>In the current study, we examine the sentencing outcomes of 35,540 felony offenders sentenced in Florida between 1994 and 2004.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1462474511434437">11</xref></sup> The primary source of the data is the Florida Sentencing Guidelines database maintained by the Florida Department of Corrections (FDOC). Felony offenders are scored on a host of legal variables on guidelines scoresheets and these data are entered into the FDOC's Offender Based Information System (OBIS). Some variables used in our analysis are not included in the guidelines database, and were obtained from alternative sources in OBIS. These include the number of prior supervision violations and prior prison commitments; whether the offender had a prior conviction for a white‐collar crime; and whether the offender was ordered to pay restitution to the victim.</p>
<sec id="sec7-1462474511434437"><title>Crime operationalizations</title>
<p>Although more specific than the white‐collar crime definition used in the existing research literature on this issue, the definition employed in the present study yields white‐collar offense types that are largely consistent with past operationalizations of the concept.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1462474511434437">12</xref></sup> Nevertheless, an offense‐based definition coupled with the use of state‐level sentencing data inevitably produces a sample disproportionately composed of what has been termed ‘run‐of‐the‐mill lower white‐collar cases’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1462474511434437">Wheeler et al., 1982</xref>: 657). Given this situation, the majority of white‐collar offenders examined here did not have the advantages usually associated with white‐collar criminals, such as the ‘status shield’, including political influence and economic resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1462474511434437">Friedrichs, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1462474511434437">Jesilow et al., 1986</xref>). Moreover, prosecutors would be less discouraged to bring these sorts of white‐collar cases to court, thus requiring less evidence of wrongdoing and a diminished need for plea bargaining and reduced sentences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1462474511434437">Levi, 1987</xref>). In sum, the present white‐collar crime sample likely reflects the lower echelons of the white‐collar crime hierarchy more so than earlier samples of federal white‐collar offenders (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1462474511434437">Hagan et al., 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>Offenses meeting this description of white‐collar crime and having a sufficient number of cases for analysis are: fraud (further distinguished by whether it was credit card fraud, or was committed against a business, consumer, or the Government), bribery, and embezzlement. More specifically, the most common forms of fraud prosecuted in Florida include: false statement of representation to increase benefits; organized consumer fraud resulting in losses less than $20,000; family services fraud worth $200 or more; false information to a pawnbroker involving less than $300; credit card fraud involving at least $200; failure to redeliver rented vehicles; and boiler room sales resulting in losses exceeding $50,000. Some additional frauds that are regularly prosecuted include: selling goods with false or counterfeit labels; defrauding the Government out of $300 to $100,000; organized consumer fraud with losses ranging from $20,000 to $50,000; obtaining lodging with intent to defraud; defrauding a financial institution; Medicaid provider fraud; gross consumer fraud or cheat; credit card fraud involving over $300; and purchasing with a false credit card, with value of purchase exceeding $100. Embezzlement and bribery are prosecuted with much less frequency in Florida's state courts, but some of the more common forms include embezzlement of trade secrets and unlawful offer or receipt of compensation by a public servant in performance of duty (i.e. bribery).</p>
<p>To increase the comparability of the two general offense groups, street crimes are limited to two forms of nonviolent property offenses: theft and burglary (excluding armed burglary, burglary of an occupied dwelling, and stolen property offenses). Thus, the study examines only economic crimes. The identification of which cases in the sentencing guidelines database are white‐collar versus street‐level crimes was determined by the ‘primary offense’ at conviction for which the offender was sentenced. The ‘primary offense’ is the<disp-quote>
<p>offense at conviction pending before the court for sentencing for which the total sentence points recommended a sanction that is as severe as, or more severe than, the sanction recommended for any other offense committed by the offender and pending before the sentencing court. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1462474511434437">Florida Department of Corrections and Office of the State Courts Administrator, 2003</xref>: 8)</p></disp-quote></p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-1462474511434437"><title>Sample selection</title>
<p>Because the focus of the analysis is on the sentencing of white‐collar versus street crimes of similar seriousness, all offenders convicted of white‐collar crimes in Florida between 1994 and 2004 were identified, and then a random sample of street property offenders of equal size was selected.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1462474511434437">13</xref></sup> This process eliminated street crime cases that were significantly different from white‐collar cases in terms of the seriousness of the current conviction. The Florida Sentencing Guidelines group all criminal statutes into a severity ranking system containing 10 severity levels from 1 to 10, ranked from least to most serious. Guideline points are assigned to the primary offense, additional offense(s), and prior convictions based on the severity‐level ranking of each offense. For example, for crimes contained in level 7, a primary offense results in a score of 56, each additional offense receives a score of 28, and each prior offense is scored at 14 points.</p>
<p>All of the white‐collar crimes identified in the dataset were assigned to levels 1 through 7. Therefore, we identified the number of white‐collar cases within each of the seven different levels and then randomly selected the same number of street crime cases within each of the levels. This sampling method results in relatively equivalent white‐collar and street crime cases in terms of the severity of the primary offense, with each group comprised of 17,770 cases, resulting in a total sample of 35,540 sentencing events. This procedure does not, however, ensure that the white‐collar and street offender groups are similar in terms of other characteristics for which we do not have data (e.g. family role) or of specific components of the Florida guidelines seriousness scores for which the data do not contain the necessary level of detail (e.g. amount lost).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1462474511434437">14</xref></sup></p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-1462474511434437"><title>Dependent variable</title>
<p>Our dependent variable is whether offenders were incarcerated in state prisons or local jails (commonly referred to as the ‘in/out’ sentencing decision). This sentencing decision measure is commonly employed in sentencing research (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1462474511434437">Steffensmeier and Demuth, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1462474511434437">Steffensmeier et al., 1998</xref>). Overall, 28.2 percent of the sample was incarcerated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1462474511434437">15</xref></sup> Jail or prison cases were assigned the value of 1 while community supervision cases were assigned the value of 0.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec10-1462474511434437"><title>Independent variables</title>
<p>There are several independent variables included in the multivariate models to address the research questions specified previously. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1462474511434437">Table 1</xref> presents descriptive statistics for all independent variables, control variables, and the sentencing outcome measure for the total sample, the white‐collar crime subsample, and the street crime subsample. First, we identify whether the offender's most serious convicted offense was a white‐collar crime (yes = 1) versus a street crime. This allows a test of the present study's basic question: Do white‐collar offenders receive more lenient treatment than street offenders do? Second, to test the question of whether sentencing outcomes vary across different types of white‐collar crimes, six dichotomous variables were created indicating if the white‐collar crime involved fraud of a business, fraud of a consumer, fraud of the Government, credit card fraud, bribery, or embezzlement (yes = 1).

<p>Third, the variable ‘high‐status white‐collar crime’ reflects whether the offender was convicted of a relatively high‐status (1) or a lower status white‐collar crime (0) to test for evidence of a status‐shield effect. Unfortunately, the data set used in the current research does not contain any direct indicators of the offender's social status (e.g. income, education, occupational prestige scores). To overcome this obstacle, certain offenses were identified that are traditionally committed by either high‐ or low‐status members of society, and we used this classification scheme to test for any status effects. As suggested by the existing literature, Medicaid provider fraud is one of the ‘purest’ forms of white‐collar crime, as it is committed by a physician in the course of an occupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1462474511434437">Friedrichs, 2007</xref>: 94; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1462474511434437">Pontell et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1462474511434437">Tillman and Pontell, 1992</xref>); thus, it is the present study's operational measure of high‐status white‐collar crime. Public assistance fraud serves as the low‐status comparison group, as this offense involves fraudulently collecting welfare, food stamps, and the like.</p>
<p>Fourth, a variable termed the ‘Enron effect’ reflects whether the sentencing event occurred before or after the famous wave of corporate scandals that emerged in 2001–2002, which has been termed the ‘Enron et al. cases’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1462474511434437">Friedrichs, 2004</xref>: 113). The Enron case began to unfold in November of 2001 and was clearly a criminal justice system issue by 2002, and similar scandals (e.g. WorldCom, Adelphia, Tyco) soon followed. Therefore, offenders sentenced in 2000 and 2001 were defined as those in which the sentencing outcomes would not have had the possibility of being affected by the Enron case (0). Sentencing decisions for white‐collar criminals in 2003 and 2004 were considered as possibly being affected by the Enron case (1).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1462474511434437">16</xref></sup> Sentences for white‐collar criminals in 2002 were not included in either category to allow a transitional period in which the full effect of the Enron case on sentencing outcomes would likely not have been realized. This design is essentially consistent with previous approaches to modeling the scandal effect.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1462474511434437">17</xref></sup> Moreover, sentencing events prior to 2000 were excluded in this analysis because the Florida Sentencing Guidelines system was revised significantly for crimes committed on or after 1 October 1998 under the Criminal Punishment Code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1462474511434437">Florida Department of Corrections and Office of the State Courts Administrator, 2003</xref>). Therefore, inclusion of cases prior to this change could have resulted in outcomes that were influenced by differing sentencing structures.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec11-1462474511434437"><title>Control variables</title>
<p>The logistic models used to answer the research questions control for numerous legal and extra‐legal variables that have commonly been used in sentencing research to identify the unique effect of the independent variables of interest. Demographic variables are: age at sentencing (years), male (1), non‐Hispanic black (1), and Hispanic of any race (1). The age and male variables were derived from the Sentencing Guidelines data. Both the guidelines data and FDOC's OBIS database were used to determine if the offender was black or Hispanic. An additional method of identifying an offender as Hispanic involved comparing the surnames of offenders not designated as Hispanic from the guidelines or OBIS data with the US Census list of Hispanic surnames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1462474511434437">Word and Perkins, 1996</xref>): Anyone whose name matched to the list of surnames was identified as Hispanic (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1462474511434437">Bontrager et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1462474511434437">Chiricos et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Court‐ordered restitution was included as a control variable because its impact on the potential sentencing disparity appears to be that it offers the judge a valid reason – that is, to ‘make the victim whole’ – for imposing a more lenient sentence upon offenders who are capable of paying the victim; that is, wealthier offenders who are more likely to have committed white‐collar crimes. The available data precluded the addition of other sanctioning options in the analyses; specifically, the FDOC data set does not include fines, community service, and so on; similarly, the scoresheets also do not contain information on these possible (but unlikely) outcomes. The data, our interviews (Brian Futch, Bureau of Probation and Parole Field Services, Florida Department of Corrections, personal communication, 2008; David Lewis, Medicaid Fraud Control Division, Florida Office of the Attorney General, personal communication, 2008), and a review of FDOC monetary collection activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1462474511434437">Florida Department of Corrections, 2007</xref>), on the other hand, suggest that restitution plays the most prominent role among the available alternative sentences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1462474511434437">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several legal control variables are included in the models, including whether the offender was convicted at trial (1) versus through a guilty plea or plea of nolo contendere. The seriousness of the convicted offense(s) at the time of sentencing was measured through the sum of the sentencing guidelines scores assigned to the primary offense, additional offenses, extent of victim injury or sexual contact, legal status violations, community sanction violations, enhanced points for motor vehicle theft, and so on. The seriousness scores reflect the monetary loss to the victim in an ordinal fashion in that the statutes often distinguish between property crimes within broad ranges of monetary lost to the victim. For example, in the case of convictions for fraud against the Government or businesses, the seriousness points assigned to a primary offense involving the loss of $300 to $20,000 is 4 points, the loss of $20,000 to $100,000 is 22 points, and the loss of over $100,000 is 56 points. The values in our sample of the seriousness measure range from 4 to 687. This variable is highly skewed, and we therefore use its natural log in the analyses (for a similar treatment of seriousness measures in Florida, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1462474511434437">Bontrager et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Prior criminal record is a latent construct that emerged from principal component analysis that resulted in a factor score reflecting the overall seriousness of offenders’ prior criminal records. The three measures included in the factor score include, first, the number of prior record points assigned through the guidelines scoring system. Prior convictions for felonies and misdemeanors as an adult or juvenile are included in this measure and any state, federal, military, or foreign conviction is considered under the sentencing guidelines. Second is the number of prior supervision violations the offender had experienced and, third, is the number of prior Florida prison commitments. Since the focus of this article is on the sentencing of white‐collar criminals, a final legal variable included in the models was whether the offender had ever previously been convicted of a white‐collar crime (1 = yes).</p>
<p>Two additional types of variables were included in the models when possible (see notes at the bottom of the tables for explanations of why there were exceptions). The sentencing of felons occurs within 20 judicial circuits, or circuit courts, in Florida. These circuits encompass from one to six of the 67 counties within the state. To control for possible variations in sentencing across judicial circuits, 19 dummy variables were included in the models with circuit 13 excluded as the reference category. For the sake of space, the circuit dummy variables are not presented in the tables; however, the full models are available upon request from the authors. Second, with a dataset of sentencing from 1994 to 2004, the possibility existed of variations in sentencing over time due to policy changes or shifts in judicial punishment philosophies. Rather than using dummy variables for each year included in the dataset, the 1998 Criminal Punishment Code was controlled for.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1462474511434437">19</xref></sup> (Alternative analyses not presented in this manuscript using the year dummies did not produce noticeably different findings.)</p>
<p>Given the breadth of variables in the models, it was important to conduct diagnostics to determine if there were multicollinearity problems in the models that would result in unreliable and unstable coefficients. Using the Tolerance statistic and a threshold of below .40 as indicative of possible multicollinearity problems as recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1462474511434437">Allison (1999)</xref>, multicollinearity was not problematic in any of the multivariate models, with the lowest tolerance statistic reaching .43 and the vast majority of tolerance levels exceeding .60.</p></sec></sec>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1462474511434437">Table 1</xref> presents descriptive statistics of the dependent, independent and control variables described previously. Of the full sample of 35,540 cases, 27.9 percent were sentenced to prison or jail. The matching process to obtain comparability between the white‐collar and street crime cases based on the sentencing guidelines severity levels resulted in an even split of the sample across these two crime types. There were 4002 cases defined as either low‐status or high‐status white‐collar criminals, with 3.3 percent of these cases identified as high status. There were 6857 white‐collar criminals sentenced during the four‐year period identified as pre‐ and post‐Enron with 56.6 percent of them sentenced during the latter period from 2003 and 2004. A similar number of street criminals were sentenced during this same period (6537) and 48.8 percent of them were sentenced post‐Enron. The control variables indicate that the average age of the entire sample at sentencing was 33.4 years, the majority was male (59.7%), and 43.4 percent were black and 7.7 percent were Hispanic. The judge ordered restitution in 10.3 percent of the cases. Finally, 13.5 percent of the total sample had at least one prior conviction for a white‐collar crime, and 53.6 percent were sentenced under the 1998 Criminal Punishment Code.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1462474511434437">Table 2</xref> addresses the first research question of whether there are disparities in the sentencing outcomes for comparable offenders who are convicted of white‐collar crimes versus street crimes. This model is consistent with prior literature finding significant positive effects of legal variables, such as trial, crime seriousness, and prior criminal record on the likelihood of incarceration. Offenders who are required to pay restitution, moreover, are significantly less likely to be incarcerated, which is consistent with the results of our discussions with state officials. Even when considering legally relevant control variables, white‐collar offenders were found to receive more lenient sentences than street offenders. Specifically, the Logistic model of the likelihood of receiving an incarceration sentence shows that, despite being similarly situated in terms of the seriousness of their current offenses and prior record, whether they went to trial, and their demographic characteristics, white‐collar offenders were significantly less likely to be sentenced to prison or jail (beta =− 0.406, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The odds of an offender convicted of a white‐collar crime receiving an incarcerative sentence are 33.4 percent lower than for street criminals.

<p>The second research question of whether some types of white‐collar criminals are treated more leniently is addressed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1462474511434437">Table 3</xref>. While <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1462474511434437">Table 2</xref> demonstrated that white‐collar crimes as a whole were sentenced more leniently than street crimes, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1462474511434437">Table 3</xref> reveals considerable variability across specific types of white‐collar crimes. Relative to the reference category of consumer fraud, frauds against businesses (beta = 0.661, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), those involving credit card fraud (beta = 0.325, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and bribery (beta = 1.008, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) were significantly more likely to be incarcerated. Offenders convicted of defrauding the Government and embezzlers were no more or less likely to be incarcerated than consumer fraud offenders. This pattern of findings indicates that the phenomenon of white‐collar crime is not treated homogeneously by the criminal justice system. Again, legal variables such as restitution, crime seriousness, and prior criminal record exert strong effects in the anticipated directions.

The main finding is consistent with the status shield hypothesis. That is, offenders convicted of the more high‐status white‐collar crime were significantly less likely to be incarcerated (beta =− 4.319, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), with the odds of receiving a term of incarceration 98.7 percent lower than comparable offenders sentenced for a low‐status white‐collar crime.

<p>The fourth and final research question of whether the publicity and outcry surrounding the Enron and related white‐collar crime scandals that erupted in 2001 impacted sentencing practices toward more punitive sanctions is addressed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1462474511434437">Table 5</xref>. Whether there are significant differences in changes in sentencing policy before and after the outbreak of the Enron et al. cases are depicted by the <italic>z</italic>‐score differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1462474511434437">Paternoster et al., 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1462474511434437">Table 5</xref> shows there was a significant increase in the likelihood of white‐collar criminals receiving an incarceration sentence after Enron (beta = 0.267, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), while there was no significant change in the likelihood of incarceration for offenders convicted of street crimes. Specifically, the odds of white‐collar offenders receiving a prison or jail term sentenced after the Enron cases were 30.7 percent greater than those sentenced before Enron, while the street crime sentenced remained unchanged. The fact that the <italic>z</italic>‐score test for the Enron effect shows a significant difference (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) between the white‐collar and street crime cases further suggests that the Enron scandal moved judicial behavior in the direction of being more punitive toward white‐collar criminals specifically. It is interesting to note that the impact of restitution on white‐collar and street crime incarceration decisions was nearly identical, suggesting that financial alternative (or supplementary) sanctions operate in a similar fashion for the two groups of offenders, although <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1462474511434437">Table 1</xref> demonstrated that, restitution is used with more frequency for white‐collar offenders than street offenders.

<p>The present data indicate that white‐collar offenders do indeed receive treatment that is more lenient at the sentencing stage of criminal justice system processing. This evidence supports the conventional wisdom, initially suggested by EA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1462474511434437">Ross (1907)</xref> and later Edwin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1462474511434437">Sutherland (1949)</xref>, that these offenders are viewed differently and thus do not elicit the punitive criminal justice system's response to which street criminals are disproportionately subjected. Importantly, this pattern held when other important determinants of sentencing were held constant, such as the seriousness of the current offense and prior offending, whether victim restitution was ordered, whether the offender went to trial or had a history of white‐collar offending, and controlling for important demographic characteristics of the offender. It is instructive to note that, even with a broad offense‐based definition of white‐collar crime including predominantly frauds, white‐collar offenders were found to receive preferential treatment. Moreover, this disparity existed despite the presence of structured sentencing guidelines that were designed to prevent unequal sentencing outcomes for offenders convicted of comparably harmful offenses.</p>
<p>Second and consistent with prior research, substantial differences emerged between the treatments accorded to perpetrators of different types of white‐collar crime. Those who defrauded the Government and those who defrauded consumers experienced more lenient treatment than credit card fraud offenders did. In contrast, those who defrauded businesses, committed credit card fraud, and those who committed bribery received more punitive treatment than consumer fraud offenders, and there was no difference in punitiveness toward consumer fraud, government fraud, or embezzlement offenders. The small number of embezzlement cases might explain why there is no significant difference in punitiveness toward consumer fraudsters and embezzlers, but the overall pattern of findings is not easily interpreted and instead raises several questions. Harm to businesses is punished more punitively than harm to consumers, but harm to government interests is not. The similarity in punitiveness toward government and consumer fraud offenders eliminates visible victims as a viable explanation and is not easy to reconcile with interviews with federal white‐collar crime judges indicating that victims who actually incur losses and who are defenseless and have fewer resources with which to defend them evoke sympathy, increase the perceived seriousness of the offense, and, thereby, lead to harsher sentencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1462474511434437">Wheeler et al., 1988</xref>: 70–75). The visible victim perspective also seems inconsistent with the harsher punishment of bribery offenders than consumer fraud offenders.</p>
<p>Moreover, harm caused by credit card theft is punished more severely than harm caused by defrauding consumers. Credit card victims usually are not legally responsible for financial losses associated with a fraud victimization, but they are faced with the challenge of restoring their good credit and therefore suffer harms beyond direct financial losses that can last for years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1462474511434437">Sabol, 1999</xref>). Thus, punitiveness toward credit card offenders could reflect protection of the credit institutions that ultimately are responsible for credit card fraud losses, or it could reflect protection of individual victims whose credit reputations have been violated and damaged. Given the disparity in punitiveness toward consumer and business fraud offenders, the former explanation seems more probable.</p>
<p>An additional potential explanation for the greater odds of incarceration for bribery and credit card offenders compared with offenders convicted of other white‐collar crime types (e.g. consumer fraud) is the media (and government) ‘dramatiziation’ of these and other (e.g. identity theft) forms of economic crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1462474511434437">Levi, 2008</xref>, 2009). A notable pattern among the economic crimes selected for dramatization is that they typify lower‐level offenses included in offense‐based definitions of white‐collar crime (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1462474511434437">Edelhertz, 1970</xref>) but not classical offender‐based definitions stressing power and respectability (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1462474511434437">Sutherland, 1949</xref>). At the lower levels of the white‐collar hierarchy, moreover, white‐collar and organized crime become blurred, and thus punitiveness directed toward these forms of white‐collar crime might more accurately reflect concern over organized criminal enterprises than white‐collar or otherwise legitimate business crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1462474511434437">Levi, 2008</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1462474511434437">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Third, although bound by data restrictions prohibiting a direct analysis of the status effect on white‐collar sentencing, the present study reports results consistent with the status‐shield thesis. Offenders convicted of a crime traditionally committed by members of the upper class – Medicaid provider fraud – were less likely to be incarcerated than offenders convicted of crimes typically committed by lower class members of society – public assistance fraud. Social status might be only indirectly related to sentencing outcomes: higher social status is associated with other variables, many of which could not be controlled for in the present analyses, but which are known to lead to more lenient sanctioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1462474511434437">Wheeler et al., 1988</xref>). For example, judges consider the life history of offenders in determining appropriate sentences and upper‐class defendants are more likely to be employed, have no criminal record, have a stable home life, and be an asset to the community; in turn, these factors tend to operate against severe sanctioning. They are also more likely to be able to afford quality legal representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1462474511434437">Wheeler et al., 1982</xref>). Further, prior research has also suggested that some judges believe that higher status offenders, in general, have already suffered greatly by merely being prosecuted let alone harshly sentenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1462474511434437">Wheeler et al., 1988</xref>). Plainly put, the findings regarding social status suggest that some sort of ‘status shield’ is at work, but the present study cannot address the mechanisms through which higher status generates treatment that is more lenient.</p>
<p>Finally, the analyses detected a substantial Enron effect, such that state‐level white‐collar offenders sentenced after the outbreak of the ‘Enron et al. cases’ were significantly more likely to have been incarcerated than white‐collar offenders sentenced prior to this national wave of corporate scandals. This finding is in contrast to the likelihood of incarceration for comparable street‐level property offenders, which did not differ between the two time periods surrounding Enron. This pattern of findings supports the notion that well‐publicized white‐collar scandals generate a wave of concern about victimization and abuses of power and trust, resulting in more punitive attitudes and sentences for white‐collar offenders. Importantly, our findings imply that national scandals involving economic elites might influence the sanctioning of economic offenders in a more punitive direction, many of whom likely do not come from the ranks of society's economic or political elite.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec14-1462474511434437"><title>Implications</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to update the literature with an empirical investigation of white‐collar crime sentencing in the 21st century, and the reported results support the conventional wisdom of the 20th century that white‐collar offenders are treated less punitively than street offenders. Beyond that, the unique contribution this study offers to the literature is the finding of a significant Enron effect regarding the likelihood of incarceration for white‐collar offenders. This is consistent with previous research, which rejected the notion that, ‘as part of a broader social movement against white‐collar crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1462474511434437">Katz, 1980</xref>), judges select out elite offenders for especially severe sentences’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1462474511434437">Benson and Walker, 1988</xref>: 299) following national scandals. In effect, this logic implies that the increased use of incarceration for white‐collar offenders might be more symbolic than reactive to dramatic social events and public outcry. However, it should not be taken for granted that national scandals fail to evoke public outcry for more punitive treatment because the present study documented that state‐level white‐collar offenders were treated more harshly after Enron − while there was no similar increase in punitiveness toward street offenders.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1462474511434437">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Historically, white‐collar crime scandals have generated public outcry and legal action, but these responses have been characterized more in terms of reactionary control phases rather than a consistent if not accelerating movement against white‐collar crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1462474511434437">Friedrichs, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1462474511434437">Holtfreter et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1462474511434437">Szasz, 1986</xref>). Thus, there is little reason to expect a lasting Enron effect on white‐collar crime sentencing. While generally increasing public concern and government regulation of commerce and the environment seems likely (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1462474511434437">Clinard and Yeager, 1980</xref>), it is less clear that specific scandals play a distinctive role in generating <italic>and sustaining</italic> moral outrage or penal severity. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1462474511434437">Savelsberg (1994)</xref> noted the irony behind the sources of outrage (most commonly, seriously consequential crimes of the powerful) and the subsequent targets of severe sanctioning (typically lower‐status white‐collar offenders who differ only minimally from street offenders; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1462474511434437">Pontell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1462474511434437">Shover and Cullen, 2008</xref>). Notably for the present study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1462474511434437">Savelsberg (1994: 40)</xref> attributed some of this irony to offense‐based definitions of white‐collar crime, which allow government officials to pursue white‐collar crime publicly and aggressively without having to challenge elite white‐collar offenders:<disp-quote>
<p>in contrast to the high status of offenders in media stories, the power and class structure of sentenced ‘white‐collar’ offenders does not differ greatly from that of all offenders in the general criminal court statistics.</p></disp-quote>This notion is consistent with the present findings that pure white‐collar offenders receive more lenient treatment than do run‐of‐the‐mill white‐collar offenders, and that those who defraud individual consumers are less likely to be incarcerated than those who defraud businesses. Thus, this study concludes on the evocative note of having empirically observed Savelsberg's thesis.</p></sec>

<fn id="fn1-1462474511434437"><label>1</label><p>Although considerable debate surrounds the appropriate definition and forms of white‐collar crime, the present study adopts the offense‐based perspective as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1462474511434437">Shapiro (1990)</xref> and previous examinations of individual white‐collar sentencing (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1462474511434437">Wheeler et al., 1982</xref>). Specifically, in selecting white‐collar crimes for analysis, the following definition of white‐collar crime was employed: ‘an illegal act or series of acts committed by nonphysical means and by concealment or guile to obtain money or property, to avoid payment of money or property, or to obtain business or personal advantage’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1462474511434437">Edelhertz, 1970</xref>: 3). This and similar definitions frequently include the following categories of white‐collar crimes: corporate crime (e.g. corporate violence, theft, financial manipulation); occupational crime (e.g. retail crime, crimes of professionals, employee crime); governmental crime (i.e. state and political crime); state‐corporate crime, crimes of globalization, and finance crime (i.e. those involving combinations of white‐collar crimes and high‐level finance); and enterprise crime, contrepreneurial crime, technocrime, and avocational crime (e.g. syndicated crime involvement with legitimate businesses, swindles, frauds, cybercrime, tax evasion; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1462474511434437">Friedrichs, 2007</xref>: 7). Due to the wide variety of offenses that have come to be considered white‐collar crimes over the years, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1462474511434437">Felson (2002: 93)</xref> remarked, ‘“White‐collar” crime is an unfortunate expression that obscures the very offenses that it’s supposed to denote.’ Looking over Friedrichs’ typology of white‐collar crimes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1462474511434437">Felson (2002: 95)</xref> identified a single uniting theme: ‘Each one had specialized access to crime targets via a particular work role, profession, or organizational position… Perhaps, then, “white‐collar” offenses are best renamed <italic>crimes of specialized access</italic>’ (emphasis in original).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn2-1462474511434437"><label>2</label><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1462474511434437">Shapiro (1990: 346)</xref> argued for an offense‐ rather than offender‐based definition of white‐collar crime, thus ‘disentangling the identification of the perpetrators with their misdeeds’ and instead proposed that trust (not social status) is the defining characteristic of white‐collar crime.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn3-1462474511434437"><label>3</label><p>An interview with a white‐collar crime prosecutor in Florida (David Lewis, Medicaid Fraud Control Division, Florida Office of the Attorney General, personal communication, 2008) revealed that financial sanctions are most likely to occur in cases involving offenders with the means to pay restitution, and that prison may be considered an impediment to ‘making the victim whole’ if it interferes with the ability of the offender to pay restitution. On the other hand, if the offender has sufficient financial holdings at the time of indictment to repay the victim, a condition more frequent among white‐collar than street offenders, prison is not precluded. At the same time, however, restitution is not an available alternative sanction (or mechanism by which leniency may be achieved) when there is no victim, such as is the case with crimes against the Government and bribery.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn4-1462474511434437"><label>4</label><p>The judges weighed these variables against assessments of the blameworthiness and criminal responsibility of the offender (e.g. prior record, intent, degree of scheming), as well as the potential consequences of a prison sentence (deterrent effects and more personal effects on offender and those around them, such as age and health, compensation and reparation, and the value of their services to the community; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1462474511434437">Wheeler et al., 1988</xref>).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn5-1462474511434437"><label>5</label><p>There is considerable literature on social movements and social construction of white‐collar crime (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1462474511434437">Griffin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1462474511434437">Katz, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1462474511434437">Lee and Ermann, 1999</xref>), including various perspectives on how scandals might shape penal and regulatory policy (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1462474511434437">Calavita and Pontell, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1462474511434437">Cavender and Mulcahy, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1462474511434437">Grabosky and Shover, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1462474511434437">Szasz, 1986</xref>), but these issues extend beyond the scope of the present analysis. We do note, however, that economic crime scandals often are less amenable to the cultivation of ‘moral panics’ and associated criminal justice system crackdowns than street crimes. One reason for this pattern is the relatively greater ease with which street crimes are linked to racial and ethnic minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1462474511434437">Levi, 2009</xref>), and another is the capability of many white‐collar offenders to launch positive public image campaigns and submit alternative versions of what happened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1462474511434437">Levi, 2006</xref>, 2008).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn6-1462474511434437"><label>6</label><p>Generally, this body of research includes the following types of white‐collar crime: restraint of trade; bribery involving US officials; false claims to the IRS; bank embezzlements; false statements to a government agency; false entries on bank records; false statements for loans; mail frauds; tax evasions; failures to file; and IRS frauds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1462474511434437">Hagan and Palloni, 1986</xref>: 608). Securities and exchange offenses and embezzlement of public funds were also examined after the original <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1462474511434437">Hagan et al. (1980)</xref> study. Street crimes include auto theft, bank robbery, narcotics offenses, and interstate transport of stolen goods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1462474511434437">Hagan and Nagel, 1982</xref>: 267).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn7-1462474511434437"><label>7</label><p>Note that this series of white‐collar crime research does not compare white‐collar crime sentences to street crime sentences, but instead the sentences of high‐status and low‐status white‐collar offenders. The Yale research largely examined the same offenses as did Hagan and associates. Specifically, the following eight categories of white‐collar crimes are analyzed: antitrust offenses; securities and exchange fraud; postal and wire fraud; false claims and statements; credit and lending institution fraud; bank embezzlement; IRS fraud; and bribery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1462474511434437">Wheeler et al., 1982</xref>: 642).</p></fn>

Notably, they did not find that offense types included contributed to the difference in findings between their study and that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1462474511434437">Wheeler et al.

<fn id="fn9-1462474511434437"><label>9</label><p>Measured as ‘professional status’ of the offender, social status was unrelated to the in/out prison decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1462474511434437">Tillman and Pontell, 1992</xref>: 561–562).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn10-1462474511434437"><label>10</label><p>Having no measure of social status in our dataset, we are not able to investigate the social status of our overall white-collar crime sample, or the white‐collar crime subtype, pre‐Enron, post‐Enron, and so on, subsamples.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn11-1462474511434437"><label>11</label><p>There are 1,179,231 total records from 1994 to 2004. Only 542 (0.05%) have missing data on the offenders’ age; 15,485 (1.3%) have missing data on race (however, we also use Florida Department of Corrections data to supplement missing data such as race); and three (0.00%) have missing data on the primary offense at conviction. Therefore, the issue of missing data is not problematic in this research.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn12-1462474511434437"><label>12</label><p>The research literature examining white‐collar crime sentencing has commonly employed the following definition: ‘economic offenses through the use of indirection, fraud, or collusion’ (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1462474511434437">Wheeler et al., 1982</xref>). Recall that the definition used here is: ‘an illegal act or series of acts committed by nonphysical means and by concealment or guile to obtain money or property, to avoid payment of money or property, or to obtain business or personal advantage’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1462474511434437">Edelhertz, 1970</xref>: 3).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn13-1462474511434437"><label>13</label><p>There also were more street property crimes in the dataset than white‐collar crimes, so this procedure excluded some street crime sentencing events from the analyses but no white‐collar crimes.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn14-1462474511434437"><label>14</label><p>White‐collar crimes generally are expected to involve greater financial losses than street crimes (e.g. Friedrichs, 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1462474511434437">Sutherland, 1949</xref>). Unfortunately, such data were not available to consider in this analysis. The only indicator of the possible level of financial loss available exists in some statutes that specify a range of values, while others have only a minimum value or only a maximum value. There are seven street crimes and 21 white‐collar crimes included in our analysis that contain this information in the statutes, and they account for 49.0 percent of the street crime cases and 53.6 percent of the white‐collar cases. The ranges vary with a high of $20,000 to $100,000 for two types of white‐collar crimes and one type of street crime. The lowest minimal value is $100 for one street crime and $200 for one white‐collar crime. The highest maximum value is $100,000 for two street crimes and $100,000 and one white‐collar crime. Importantly, we are controlling for the seriousness of the convicted crime at sentencing, which should assist in equalizing the differences in financial loss across street and white‐collar offenders, even though we cannot more specifically identify the amount of financial losses associated with specific crime types or sentencing events.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn15-1462474511434437"><label>15</label><p>Due to the small number of offenders incarcerated and the lack of a valid instrumental variable to control for potential selection bias, sentence length models are not presented. Also, in a different version of this manuscript, jail was classified as part of the out decision, and the results have not changed substantively as a result of our reclassification of jail as part of the in decision.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn16-1462474511434437"><label>16</label><p>Sentencing in Florida state courts usually occurs within six months of the commission of the crime; therefore, combined with the use of a one‐year buffer, no cases in the post‐Enron category involved crimes committed prior to 2001. More specifically, the FDOC reported that the average length of time between the offense and sentencing is 5.6 (FDOC, 2000) to 5.7 months (FDOC, 2001), with violent crimes having a longer lag than property crimes and there being little variability in the time lags between burglary and other property crimes such as fraud (FDOC, 2000, 2001). We do not hypothesize that the Enron et al. cases influenced the arrest, investigation, or prosecution of white‐collar offenders, although this might be true. Instead, in line with earlier research measuring the effect of Watergate on white‐collar sentencing events, we hypothesize that the Enron et al. cases would affect the severity of the punishments given to white‐collar offenders.</p></fn>

<fn id="fn21-1462474511434437"><label>21</label><p>It is possible that the timing of Enron and other dramatic national events obscured the isolation of a true ‘Enron effect’. In particular, the terrorist attacks of 9/11 – the first foreign attack on American soil since Pearl Harbor more than a half‐century ago – occurred at a similar point in history and thus could have galvanized the punitive apparatus of the Government against terrorism. Martha Stewart’s widely publicized conviction, moreover, occurred during the post‐Enron study period. Clearly, more research is needed to identify the relationship between well‐publicized national scandals and sentencing practices, including the duration and nature of any scandal effect.</p></fn></fn-group></notes>
