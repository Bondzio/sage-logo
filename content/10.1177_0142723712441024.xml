<p><italic>Variation in the input</italic> opens with a useful editorial introduction. Six of the chapters were presented at a workshop at the GLOW conference in Tromsø in April 2007. There is one kind of variation that is difficult to handle when it comes to language acquisition: namely, the situation in which two variants are truly optional. The authors here show, as the editors write, that ‘there is in fact no or very little true optionality in the input’ (p. 6). All contributions further show that ‘the production of the children investigated in these studies is close to target-like’ (p. 12). Children seem to be able to acquire fine distinctions between linguistic forms with respect to their pragmatic functions from very early on without necessarily going through a target-deviant stage. It is therefore implausible to assume that they ‘learn the syntax of their particular language by setting major word order parameters’ (p. 12). Also, children’s behaviour does not seem to be compatible with the view that they select different grammars across trials according to the probability associated with each grammar. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142723712441024">Yang (2003)</xref> argues that children will select the target grammar due to punishment of non-target grammars which cannot parse the input. However, the elimination of non-target grammars should be time-consuming. The contributions to this collection present alternative views of how children proceed in the acquisition process.</p>
<p>Andrea Gualmini discusses recent psycholinguistic studies on adults’ and children’s resolution of scope ambiguities. The main focus is scopally ambiguous sentences containing negation, such as <italic>the detective didn’t find some guys</italic>. This sentence can have two meanings for children. It can mean that there are some guys that the detective didn’t find (some&gt;not), the inverse scope interpretation of the adult language with <italic>some</italic> as a positive polarity item, or that it is not the case that the detective found some guys (*not&gt;some), the non-adult-like surface scope interpretation. Do the two meanings stem from the random selection of different grammars or does their selection rather depend on different interpretive options from the same grammar? An analysis of the individual data elicited in experimental studies is necessary in order to answer this question. It is argued that the children’s variable behaviour in the comprehension of scopally ambiguous sentences is an ‘optional illusion’ since they rely on (their interpretation of) the context of the sentence in question when they select a specific reading for it. Therefore, optionality is deceptive to the extent that selection of a specific interpretation for a sentence is not random, but a process depending on the context. If adults are observed on the comprehension of scopally ambiguous sentences and contextual factors are controlled for, their behaviour is systematic; optionality is an illusion against the background of adult competence, too. Gualmini argues convincingly that the selection of the readings of scopally ambiguous sentences is not a random process. It remains to be analyzed how the child proceeds from the later stage of a non-target grammar, in which ambiguity is licensed and contextual information is used in order to select one out of many readings of an ambiguous sentence, to the adult grammar.</p>
<p>Variation at the language surface is not an illusion when it comes to the production of doubly-filled COMPs (Complementizers) in Swiss German (and many other) dialects. An example for a construction with a doubly-filled COMP is <italic>Ich wei nöd wie wiit dass si scho glueget hät</italic> ‘I know not how far that she already looked has’ (p. 42). Manuela Schönenberger studies doubly-filled COMPs in adult and child Lucernese. Before discussing the longitudinal data of two children, Moira and Eliza, and the elicited production data (sentence repetition) of one child (Moira), a very detailed analysis of the grammatical phenomenon is presented. There are conditions in the dialects that exclude doubly-filled COMPs, like verb movement, monosyllabic <italic>wh</italic>-phrases, the prosody of the constituent following the <italic>wh</italic>-phrase. In other words, there are contexts in which doubly-filled COMPs are impossible and others in which they are optional. The fine study of the acquisition data reveals that doubly-filled COMPs appear around the age of 5. Although Moira’s mother uses doubly-filled COMPs optionally (when optionality is allowed according to the dialect), Moira does not show evidence of this kind of optionality. Her data allow the conclusion that doubly-filled COMPs are obligatory in contexts in which the mother uses them optionally. Furthermore, Moira also uses them in contexts in which they are rare or ungrammatical in the adult data (but grammatical in another Swiss dialect, St. Galler German). In order to further elaborate the idea that children ignore variation, Schönenberger controlled for the child’s input. Moira’s mother ‘speaks a mixed dialect since she grew up in Zurich but moved to Lucerne as a young adult’ (p. 36). Schönenberger concedes that ‘the mother speaks a mixed dialect and that she also speaks particularly clearly when addressing the child, which may have subtly distorted the data’ (p. 63). Variation is thus an illusion if the child’s perspective is taken into account. Children simply seem to ignore it or, put differently, start from the assumption that surface variation is inexistent. This initial hypothesis may help the child to detect the prosodic, syntactic, semantic or pragmatic machinery behind surface variation. On top of what Schönenberger has illustrated, one could add that most children are confronted with the standard written language when adults read stories to them. Doubly-filled COMPs are indicative of spoken and dialectal variants, not of the standard written variety. If we take these observations into account, variation is real in the input in the sense that children might also be confronted with a grammar that disallows doubly-filled COMPs altogether and a grammar in which they are allowed, but (in some contexts) optional</p>
<p>Variation in the input is not an illusion either when we look more closely inside the Italian DP (Determiner Phrase). Adjectival ordering in Italian comes with a variety of positions, in relation to the head noun and in relation to other elements within the DP. As with embeddings (with doubly-filled COMPs), adjectives are optional by definition in the language and therefore are the least frequent of the lexical categories. Anna Cardinaletti and Giuliana Giusti analyze longitudinal data from three monolingual Italian children from 1;6 to 3 years. The DP displays elements that have invariable (like quantifiers and determiners) and variable order (possessive adjectives) belonging to different syntactic categories, and elements that have invariable (<italic>la scuola italiana</italic>/*<italic>la italiana scuola</italic>) and variable order belonging to different semantically defined classes (<italic>una simpatica ragazza</italic>/<italic>una ragazza simpatica</italic>). Word order variation is not necessarily related to differences in interpretation, an observation that worsens the situation of the child who has to acquire the adult-like ordering. The general result of the study is that children can deviate from the input as far as the lexicon is concerned. This means that some classes of adjectives are not observed in the very early productions of the children. With respect to word order in the DP, ‘Italian children master the complexities of adjectival placement in a target-like fashion’ (p. 92). As in the case of Schönenberger’s study, the Italian children under investigation seem to ‘regularize’ the input in the sense that postnominal order is overwhelmingly frequent with descriptive adjectives. In other words, if children have a choice with respect to the ordering of adjectives, they go for postnominal order. This finding is very important since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0142723712441024">Rizzi, Arnaus Gil, Repetto, Müller, and Müller (in press)</xref> observe that bilingual children who acquire two languages from birth, among them Italian, overuse prenominal orderings, independently of whether the second language only allows for prenominal placement of adjectives (German) or whether the language exhibits both pre- and postnominal orderings (French). The monolingual Italian children also use possessive adjectives correctly, whose pre- and postnominal position depends on pragmatic features in the adult system. Again, variation in the input does not seem to matter in first language acquisition.</p>
<p>Anja Kieburg and Petra Schulz analyze the parental input (5001 utterances) in relation to the acquisition of different verb types in German-speaking children. Different potentially influencing factors for the child’s acquisition of particle verbs, simplex verbs and verb particles are investigated: word frequency (types, tokens, type token ratio) and word order variability. It is the second factor that influences the children’s acquisition of different verb types. The generalization is that less syntactic variability in the parental input leads to early acquisition of verb particles (already present in the speech of 1-year-olds) in German speaking children. Syntactic variability is analyzed in terms of the surface positions the verb can appear in, irrespective of the underlying structure, and in relation to the two syntactic underlying positions verbal elements are located in, V2 and Vfinal. In other words, variability matters if one looks at the order of acquisition of different verbs and the composition of the early verb lexicon in 1- to 2-year-old children. This result is in line with the previously mentioned studies of child speech production. There, it was also found that variability leads to late acquisition (e.g. doubly-filled COMPs around or after the age of 5).</p>
<p>Chloe C. Gu investigates the development of the word order of dative constructions in a comparative framework. Longitudinal production data of English and Cantonese monolingual children and Cantonese-English bilingual children are studied between the ages of 1 year and 3 and a half years. Dative constructions are the focus of research, which exhibit a certain degree of variability in the English input (dative alternation: <italic>John gave Mary the book</italic>/<italic>John gave the book to Mary</italic>). Cantonese exhibits a third type of dative construction (translated into English as: *<italic>John gave the book Mary</italic>). In contrast to English, where all dative verbs with a Latinate origin can participate in the dative alternation, in Cantonese each dative verb can only appear in one type of dative construction. As for English monolingual children, the general result by other researchers is confirmed: namely that of the delay of prepositional datives. Cantonese monolingual children use the dative structure which is equivalent to the English prepositional dative much earlier than English monolingual children. Interestingly, the bilinguals show an overall slower development of the prepositional dative in relation to the double-object dative in English. Those children ‘who have a better mastery of different prepositional <italic>to</italic> make faster progress in the acquisition of <italic>to</italic>-datives’ (p. 131). It is argued that the ambiguity of English <italic>to</italic> (dative and directional reading taken by the same verb) and the non-transparent derivation of prepositional datives delay this construction. Two very interesting observations are discussed, both suggesting that mere input frequencies cannot explain children’s behaviour in the acquisition process. First, constructions that could be built on an ‘entrenched’ unit with a token frequency of 49% and those with a token frequency of only 5% emerge at the same time in Cantonese child speech. Second, although the study focuses on the order of emergence of particular constructions, it also shows for Cantonese monolingual and bilingual children, that they ‘naturally utilize a grammar that allows double object structure for dative verbs, even though no such input may be provided’ (p. 154). Again, children are ready to accept optionality, within certain limits.</p>
<p>Deborah Chen Pichler investigates the word order variability (canonical VO (Verb-Object) and non-canonical OV (Object-Verb)) in the speech of four deaf children between the ages of 20 and 30 months who are acquiring American Sign Language. Deaf children find variability in their input with respect to the position of objects in relation to the verb. This variation is due to topicalization and reordering morphology (aspectual, spatial and handling morphemes). Clearly, word order variation in deaf children has pragmatic and syntactic motivation. If variation is misleading or elusive, children are smart enough to detect that it is and simply acquire the necessary morphological and pragmatic features. Sometimes, the pragmatically motivated uses of linguistic forms are child-specific, but they still stem from ‘hints’ in the adult-systems and represent options of other Sign Language systems that were not present in the parental input.</p>
<p>Konstantia Kapetangianni studies the acquisition of subject-verb word order in three Greek-speaking children from age 2 to 3. Greek is a null-subject language and exhibits pre- and postverbal overt subjects, as compared to Spanish. Postverbal subjects encode new information, whereas a subject in preverbal position can be associated with a topic reading. The analyzed children set the null-subject parameter very early in development and they use overt subjects as in the adult-language. In other words, variation exists in the children’s input yet children do not make mistakes.</p>
<p>Roksolana Mykhaylyk and Heejeong Ko investigate object-scrambling in Ukrainian by 41 English-Ukrainian bilingual 6-year-olds using a combination of a truth judgement task and an elicited production task. Object-scrambling is optional with specific objects, but ungrammatical with non-specific objects. The children in the study scramble specific objects less frequently than adults do. However, they do not scramble non-specific objects, an observation that is expected from the adult’s perspective. The authors argue convincingly that a pragmatic deficit cannot lie at the heart of the under-use of scrambling of specific objects and develop an explanation for this under-use that assumes difficulties with the syntax-semantic mapping. Notice that there is real optionality in the adult grammar with respect to object-scrambling. The 51%-use of scrambling in adults might reflect chance behaviour, like its 45%-use in the children. Interestingly, it seems to matter a lot to adults, whether the DP is a pronoun or not. In adults, pronominal DPs strongly favour scrambling (81%). This is not the case for children. In children, the difference between pronominal and non-prononimal DPs with scrambling is very small. The presence (in adults) and absence (in children) of a triggering effect of pronouns in scrambling invites future research on the question of whether children this young are really able to take into account the hearer’s knowledge of the presupposition.</p>
<p>Merete Anderssen, Kristine Bentzen, Yulia Rodina and Marit Westergaard study the word order of object and subject shift constructions in the spontaneous speech of three Norwegian children from age 2 to 3. Experimental data from older children are also discussed, since target-like object shift is extremely rare in the spontaneous data of young children. True optionality can be observed for full DPs that can, but do not have to be moved. Two main results are presented: firstly, target-like word order in subject shift constructions is acquired earlier than in object shift constructions. The authors suggest that input frequency might play a role here. The potential contexts for subject shift are twice as high as for object shift in the adult data, and more importantly, most of the contexts for subject shift contain a pronominal DP, i.e. a DP that has to be shifted. This is so because DPs in subject position generally convey old information. The reverse is true for contexts for object shift. Here, the vast majority of objects are full (and unshifted) DPs. Secondly, the children produce target-deviant word orders, i.e. they fail to move the pronominal subject and object across sentence adverbs. Here, an analysis in terms of economy is favoured: namely, that children prefer the option that involves no movement, if they have the choice between a derivation involving no movement and one with movement. The study suggests that children need a certain amount of input in order to abandon target-deviant stages.</p>
<p>This book should be essential reading for researchers and students interested in language acquisition within the generative grammar framework. The variation-enterprise is not only a real success, but it is also fun to read.</p>
