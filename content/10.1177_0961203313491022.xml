<abstract>
<p>Hematogenous Salmonella osteomyelitis is uncommon in immunocompetent hosts, but occurs with some regularity in immunosuppressed patients affected by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Surgical debridement with resection of compromised tissue is central to the surgical management of osteomyelitis. Persistence of septic arthropathy may result from inadequate debridement, areas of osteonecrosis (ON), and an abnormal cellular and humoral dysregulation characteristic of SLE. We describe a 53-year-old Hispanic female with SLE on immunosuppressive therapy, who developed acute salmonella-induced septic arthritis and osteomyelitis of both knees associated with ON and recurrent SLE synovitis. She received prolonged antibiotic therapy and an extensive surgical debridement as part of a successful two-stage bilateral total knee replacement. This report illustrates the significance of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> infection in SLE patients, and the role of underlying bone and joint pathology such as bone infarcts, sub-acute osteomyelitis, and SLE synovitis.</p>

<p>Infection accounts for 25% of mortality in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), usually seen in the setting of active renal disease, leukopenia, lymphopenia, or hypocomplementemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203313491022">1</xref></sup> Pharmacologic therapies for SLE including glucocorticoids have immunosuppressive effects, which increase the risk of infection. <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> (including typhoidal and non-typhoidal strains) is an aerobic gram-negative bacillus, and has predilection for immunosuppressed patients. Most commonly, Salmonella is associated with gastrointestinal infection, but immunosuppression leads to an increased risk of bacteremia, endovascular infection, soft-tissue abscesses, and bone and joint involvement. Salmonella bacterial infection localized to joints can be prolonged, and result in chronic articular damage in SLE patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313491022">2</xref></sup> The presence of osteomyelitis, either as a primary focus or secondary extension from an intra-articular infection, complicates the prognosis.</p>
<sec id="sec2-0961203313491022" sec-type="cases"><title>Case report</title>
<p>A 53-year-old Hispanic female with SLE, characterized by malar rash, oral ulcers, photosensitivity, polyarthritis, diffuse (Class IV) glomerulonephritis, and pericardial effusion, presented with recurrent inflammatory arthritis of both knees. The patient had been admitted to an outside hospital eight months prior with fever and abdominal pain, and was diagnosed with <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> sepsis by positive blood and urine cultures. She was treated with two weeks of intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone. One month later, she developed acute bilateral knee pain; arthrocentesis revealed non-typhoidal <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> group D. She was re-treated with six weeks of IV antibiotic with transient improvement. She had recurrence of synovitis; arthrocentesis confirmed inflammatory synovitis with negative cultures. The patient underwent surgical debridement of both femora, intraosseous placement of antibiotic beads, and was placed on antibiotics for two months. Synovitis persisted although aspirations yielded negative cultures, and she was offered surgical amputation of both legs. The patient refused and was referred to the Combined Arthritis Program (CAP), a joint rheumatology and orthopedic service, at our hospital.</p>
<p>Daily medications included prednisone 5 mg, mycophenolate mofetil 2 g, hydroxychloroquine 400 mg, vancomycin 250 mg daily, extended-release morphine sulfate 50 mg twice daily, hydromorphone 4 mg every four hours as needed, metoprolol 50 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg, simvastatin 40 mg, and citalopram 10 mg. Examination was significant for cushingoid appearance, stable vital signs (temperature 36.3℃, blood pressure 110/82 mmHg, heart rate 82 beats per minute (bpm)), and marked swelling and tenderness of bilateral knees with 10 to 115 degrees of motion on the right and 10 to 120 on the left. The neurovascular system was normal.</p>
<p>Laboratory studies showed creatinine 0.8 mg/dl, hemoglobin 11.2 g/dl, white cell count 6.96 × 10<sup>3</sup>/µl, platelets 225 × 10<sup>3</sup>/µl, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 31 mm/hour (range 0–27), C-reactive protein 1.2 mg/dl (range 0–1). Renal function tests, electrolytes and liver enzymes were normal. Serum complement fractions were within normal limits, and double-stranded DNA was 2+. Urinalysis was unremarkable with stable proteinuria of 0.8 grams. Blood, urine, and stool cultures were negative. Magnetic resonance imaging of knees showed findings of inflammatory arthritis and osteomyelitis with intraosseous abscesses in bilateral femur and tibia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203313491022">Figure 1(a)</xref>). These changes are superimposed on extensive bone infarctions in the distal femur and proximal tibia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203313491022">Figure 1(b)</xref>).

<p>There is a complex joint effusion and synovitis demonstrating marked contrast rim enhancement, consistent with inflammatory arthritis.

<p>Our impression was that of osteomyelitis with extensive bone infarctions and subchondral fractures, and inflammatory synovitis due to the SLE. The possibility of persistent infection despite negative microbiology cultures on knee synovial aspirates was raised given a prolonged six-year course of steroids, mycophenolate mofetil, and recent antibiotics. Multidisciplinary collaborations among rheumatology, infectious disease, and orthopedic specialists concluded that combination therapy with open surgical debridement of necrotic zones, antibiotic-loaded spacers, and IV antibiotics would provide the optimal outcome. Decision to perform a two-stage operation for bilateral total knee replacement was made. Pre-operatively, the patient received hydrocortisone 100 mg IV, and she was placed on baseline prednisone 5 mg, mycophenolate mofetil 2 g, and hydroxychloroquine 200 mg post-operative day 1. In stage one, both joints were prepared for subsequent knee implants with resection of distal femoral condyles, proximal tibial plateau, and patellar bone shaving and extensive synovectomy. An articulating custom-made knee spacer coated with vancomycin and clindamycin was placed in each knee joint; IV ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and ampicillin were started. Cultures of synovial tissue samples remained negative after 10 days of incubation for aerobic and anaerobic organisms. The patient was discharged on IV ceftriaxone 2 grams daily for six weeks. She was monitored closely for eight months; surveillance aspirations of knees had negative microbiology cultures. Clinically, the patient had minimal pain and was able to ambulate with spacers in place. She had excellent range of motion of her knees; 0 to 120 degrees (left knee) and 0 to 115 degrees (right knee). Stage two of the knee replacement was performed sequentially. Removal of the spacers and total knee arthroplasties were performed at nine and 14 months after stage one, using Legion Revision System (Smith &amp; Nephew Inc, Memphis, TN, USA) with femoral and offset tibial stems and a constrained liner. Follow-up evaluation showed excellent progress with minimal pain and improved motion of bilateral knees of 0 to 120 degrees.</p>

<p>Knee specimens included the articular surfaces of distal femur and proximal tibia, patellar shavings, and the synovium. Subchondral fractures were observed in bilateral medial femoral and tibial condyle with erosion of the cartilage in medial compartments. The articular cartilage showed focal loss with presence of erosive inflammatory pannus. The adjacent cartilage was superficially eroded with focal presence of adherent synovial pannus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0961203313491022">Figure 2(a)</xref>). Necrosis of the subchondral bone and marrow was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0961203313491022">Figure 2(b)</xref>) with subchondral fracture and focal reparative callus. Subarticular chronic inflammation with lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate and deeply seated necrotizing microabscesses were also observed in the left knee (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0961203313491022">Figure 2(c)</xref>). The synovium showed papillary hypertrophy and perivascular, band-like chronic inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes and plasmacytic component with occasional binucleated elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0961203313491022">Figure 2(d)</xref>).

<p>Hematogenous <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> osteomyelitis is uncommon in immunocompetent hosts, but is a frequent pathogen in infection of bones and joints in SLE patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203313491022">3</xref></sup> Predisposing factors favoring septic arthritis include use of corticorticosteroids, active SLE including renal disease, or pre-existing osteonecrosis (ON) of bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203313491022">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The mainstay treatment of acute hematogenous bacterial osteomyelitis is IV antibiotics (six weeks). However, optimal treatment usually includes both surgical and pharmacologic therapy. Bacteria adhere to a biofilm in necrotic, avascular tissue, and are poorly sterilized by antibiotics alone, even at high concentrations. Surgical debridement with resection of compromised tissue is central to the surgical management of osteomyelitis. Two-stage reimplantation for an infected total knee arthroplasty and use of antibiotic-laden cement spacers or beads has an accepted role with improved eradication of infection in the acutely or chronically infected knee, avoiding amputation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203313491022">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203313491022">6</xref></sup> Antibiotic options in bone cement are limited; the antibiotic must elute in a predictable way (withstand high temperatures that develop during cement polymerization, be available as a powder, be unlikely to provoke allergy, and not alter the mechanical properties of the load-bearing cement). Gentamicin, tobramycin, and vancomycin are used most commonly. Aminoglycoside spacers have been successfully used for Salmonella infections in arthroplasty.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203313491022">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>In our case, the presence of femoral and tibial bone infarcts and corticosteroid exposure were risk factors for Salmonella infection. Avascular necrosis or ON, a common complication of SLE, most likely provided a favorable environment for persistent bone infection after the initial septic episode. Poorly vascularized bone becomes a local factor for harboring bacteria. Combination therapy with open debridement, antibiotic-loaded spacers, and IV antibiotics is unusual for native septic arthritis, and to our knowledge there are no comparative data guiding its use specifically for Salmonella or in patients with rheumatologic illnesses. In fact, little comparative data are available to guide diagnosis and therapy for native septic arthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203313491022">8</xref></sup> However, in cases (such as ours) of septic arthritis of weight-bearing joints requiring arthroplasty, this two-stage combination approach has been associated with good outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203313491022">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203313491022">10</xref></sup> Successful management requires close collaboration of rheumatologists, orthopedists, radiologists, pathologists, and infectious disease specialists in the assessment, planning, and treatment of these complex and challenging cases.</p>
