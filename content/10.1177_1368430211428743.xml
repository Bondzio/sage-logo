<abstract>
<p>We examined how group performance (success or failure) and intragroup interactions (minimal or favorable) affected responses to a social dilemma. We predicted that group failure would result in less overall cooperation, but that favorable intragroup interactions would buffer this adverse consequence. We further predicted that this buffering effect would be mediated by group identity, which would, in turn, operate through two processes, normative expectations and goal transformation. We experimentally manipulated the extent to which groups (<italic>N</italic> = 80 four-person groups) experienced minimal or favorable intragroup interactions and succeeded or failed on an intellective task before facing, as isolated individuals, a social dilemma. Our main hypotheses were supported, and structural equation modeling and analyses of moderated mediation were largely consistent with our theoretical model. The results support a social identity approach to social dilemmas and shed light on the processes involved in intragroup cooperation.</p>

<p>Group work is a common human endeavor that is associated with many positive as well as negative processes and outcomes. For many group endeavors, a conflict arises that pits the personal goals of individual members against the collective goal of the group. For example, consider an academic department working toward a collective goal, program review. Each member of the department must decide how much time to expend on the group goal versus time spent on more personal goals, such as research projects, writing grants, and performing consulting jobs. Of course, if most members of the department take the more selfish route, the program review would suffer and the department could lose out on valuable resources (e.g., lab space, secretarial positions, and faculty lines). Situations like these, that pit personal incentives against group incentives, are called <italic>social dilemmas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1368430211428743">Caporael, Dawes, Orbell, &amp; van de Kragt, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Specifically, a social dilemma exists when (a) each individual member of a group benefits more by pursuing a personal goal rather than a group goal, but (b) if each member makes this choice everyone in the group is worse off than if everyone would have pursued the group goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368430211428743">Dawes, 1980</xref>). Given the pervasiveness of social dilemma situations in daily life and the potential importance of their outcomes, scholars from a variety of disciplines have long studied the factors that influence cooperative and non-cooperative reactions (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1368430211428743">Foddy, Smithson, Schneider, &amp; Hogg, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1368430211428743">Komorita &amp; Parks, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1368430211428743">Suleiman, Budescu, Fischer, &amp; Messick, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Our study focuses on <italic>public goods</italic> social dilemmas, whereby the benefits of intragroup cooperation are shared by all members of the group, even those who defect or free-ride. Thus, if the department in our example were to gain an extra secretary and new classroom computers based on the program review, even the “defectors” who contributed little to the review would get to enjoy the perks.</p>
<p>From a traditional economic perspective, cooperation is an irrational response to a social dilemma because it entails greater potential costs and fewer potential gains than defection or noncooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1368430211428743">Green &amp; Sharpiro, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1368430211428743">Henrich et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1368430211428743">Rapoport, 1988</xref>). From this perspective, then, it is economically rational for the individual to defect—why give money to public radio when I can listen for free? Why give blood when it does not affect my access to the blood supply? While it is clear that people are strongly influenced by such ego-incentives, we also know from several decades of social psychological research that people are equally influenced by social identity motives. A host of experimental and correlational studies have found group identification and related constructs to reliably predict seemingly irrational cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1368430211428743">Brewer &amp; Kramer, 1986</xref>; DeCremer &amp; van Vugt, 1998; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1368430211428743">Jackson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1368430211428743">Utz, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Our experiment had three main goals. First, we wanted to examine if a group’s performance (collective success or failure) would influence how individual members of the group would respond to a subsequent social dilemma. Although performance outcomes are routine for many real-world groups, few studies have examined how such outcomes influence intragroup cooperation. Based on past research, reviewed below, we expected negative group performance to adversely affect cooperative responses to a social dilemma and for positive performance to boost such responses.</p>
<p>Second, we wanted to determine if favorable intragroup interactions would moderate this group performance effect. As detailed below, we expected positive intragroup interactions (friendly, informal conversation) to offset the adverse consequences of group failure, resulting in a group performance x intragroup interactions interaction effect.</p>
<p>Third, we wanted to examine the psychological mechanisms that might help explain why positive interactions have a buffering effect for groups that experience failure. Thus, we examined several potential mediators including group identity, mood, perceived group effort, normative expectations, and goal transformation. We discuss our rationale in detail next.</p>
<sec id="section1-1368430211428743">
<title>Group performance</title>
<p>The collective performance of small groups has shown to substantially affect the perceptions, motivations, and behaviors of their individual members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368430211428743">Conlon &amp; Barr, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1368430211428743">Nadler, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1368430211428743">O’Leary-Kelly, 1998</xref>). For example, groups that fail on a task tend to show a reduction in team morale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1368430211428743">Lott &amp; Lott, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1368430211428743">Taylor &amp; Tyler, 1986</xref>), group cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1368430211428743">Brawley, Carron, &amp; Widmeyer, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1368430211428743">Levine &amp; Moreland, 1990</xref>), collective efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1368430211428743">Iso-Ahola, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1368430211428743">Riggs &amp; Knight, 1994</xref>), interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1368430211428743">Cialdini &amp; Richardson, 1980</xref>), and subsequent levels of performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1368430211428743">Reisel &amp; Kopelman, 1995</xref>). In addition, the individual members of a group that has failed (e.g., lost the game) often deflect personal responsibility and, instead, blame teammates for the outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368430211428743">Burnette &amp; Forsyth, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1368430211428743">Iso-Ahola, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1368430211428743">Price &amp; Garland, 1978</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, members of successful groups tend to score higher on measures of group efficacy and interpersonal trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1368430211428743">Macy, 1995</xref>), factors that have been associated with cooperative responses to social dilemmas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1368430211428743">Smith, Jackson, &amp; Sparks, 2003</xref>). Studies have also demonstrated that groups with high morale, which is associated with group success, tend to be more equitable in distributing resources than groups low in morale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368430211428743">Elliott &amp; Meeker, 1986</xref>). Given such findings, we expected group members to be more self-serving in response to a social dilemma after group failure than after group success.</p>
<p>Obviously, group failure does not always splinter a group and cause its members to engage in self-serving attributions and selfish behaviors. Numerous person-variables and situational factors could potentially moderate how groups respond to failure. In this study we focus on intragroup interactions. In short, we expected friendly, interpersonal interactions to buffer the adverse consequences of group failure.</p>

<sec id="section2-1368430211428743">
<title>Intragroup interactions and cooperation</title>
<p>Favorable interpersonal interactions have been recognized as an important variable in several theoretical models. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1368430211428743">Allport’s (1954)</xref> contact theory is based on the premise that when members of different groups engage in friendly, interdependent, equal status contact, the result is often a reduction in prejudice. This theory has been refined over the years and has received strong empirical support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1368430211428743">Pettigrew &amp; Tropp, 2006</xref>). Recent studies suggest that contact works, in part, by reducing anxiety and fear, and increasing trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1368430211428743">Binder et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1368430211428743">Shelton &amp; Richeson, 2005</xref>), variables that have been systematically linked to cooperative responses to social dilemmas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1368430211428743">Bruins, Liebrand, &amp; Wilke, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1368430211428743">Tanghe, Wisse, &amp; van der Flier, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1368430211428743">Yamagishi &amp; Mifune, 2008</xref>). Although contact theory focuses on intergroup relations, it seems reasonable that favorable interactions would have similarly positive outcomes in an intragroup setting. Indeed, in their study of intergroup bias, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1368430211428743">Gaertner and Schopler (1998)</xref> found that intragroup interactions resulted in more resources being allocated to ingroup members.</p>
<p>Several models in organizational psychology include favorable interpersonal interactions as an important variable in the development of cooperative work relationships (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1368430211428743">Balkundi &amp; Harrison, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1368430211428743">Parise &amp; Rollag, 2010</xref>). In theory, such experiences are “… based on informal socializing, common personal interests, and frequent interactions that are not directly related to work responsibilities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1368430211428743">Parise &amp; Rollag, 2010</xref>), a definition that closely matches our experimental manipulation. Empirically, friendly interactions have been linked to measures of group cohesiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430211428743">Goodman &amp; Leyden, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1368430211428743">Pelled, Eisenhardt, &amp; Xin, 1999</xref>), empathy toward fellow group members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368430211428743">Camras &amp; Allison, 1985</xref>), and intragroup cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1368430211428743">Bonacich, 1972</xref>). In one study, having friendly relationships, rather than impersonal ones, helped to buffer against the negative effects of task conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1368430211428743">Shah &amp; Jehn, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the theoretical and empirical literature reviewed above, we reasoned that friendly social interactions would increase cooperative reactions to a social dilemma and, more importantly perhaps, significantly offset the adverse consequences of group failure. Hence, we predicted an interaction between group performance and intragroup interactions. Specifically, group failure was expected to reduce cooperation among groups that experience minimal interactions, but not among groups that experience favorable interactions. We also wanted to examine the possible mechanisms that could explain this buffering effect.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1368430211428743">
<title>Potential mediators</title>
<p>Our theoretical model suggests that favorable intragroup interactions help offset negative group experiences, such as group failure, because such interactions increase a sense of group identity, “… that part of the self-concept derived from an individual’s knowledge of his or her group membership together with the value and emotional significance attached to that membership” (Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1986, p. 41). Several studies have indeed found group identity to be associated with cooperative responses to a social dilemma. In one of the earliest studies conducted on this issue, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1368430211428743">Kramer and Brewer (1984)</xref> found that manipulating group identity resulted in a corresponding fluctuation in responses to a social dilemma. Other experiments have since confirmed this basic result. When group identity is strengthened, by emphasizing common fate for example, people tend to exhibit greater cooperation compared to a condition that emphasizes personal identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1368430211428743">Brewer &amp; Kramer 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368430211428743">De Cremer &amp; van Vugt, 1999</xref>; Wit &amp; Wilke, 1992).</p>
<p>Our study builds upon these previous findings in several ways. First, we examine if group identity mediates the relationship between intragroup interactions and cooperative responses. This prediction makes theoretical sense but has yet to be empirically established. Second, we examine if the group identity effect is strong enough to explain differential reactions to collective failure. Third, we examine several specific processes that could provide insights into <italic>how</italic> group identity influences cooperative responses. The processes we focus on are goal transformation and normative expectations.</p>
<p>In theory, if the group is incorporated as part of the self, then the egoistic desire to maximize personal outcomes should give way to the desire to make cooperative choices that benefit the collective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1368430211428743">Smith, Jackson, &amp; Sparks, 2003</xref>). As stated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1368430211428743">Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher and Wetherall. (1987)</xref>, “Cooperation will follow from the shared and mutual perception by ingroup members of their interests as interchangeable” (p. 65). De Cremer and colleagues have labeled this process—a shift from focusing on what is best for “me” to what is best for “we”—<italic>goal transformation</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1368430211428743">De Cremer &amp; Van Dijk, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1368430211428743">De Cremer, Van Knippenberg, Van Dijk, &amp; Van Leeuwen, 2008</xref>). Given this line of work, we predicted that group identity would lead to relatively greater concern for group outcomes than personal outcomes, and such concerns would, in turn, lead to greater levels of cooperation.</p>
<p>Group identity could also enhance cooperation by increasing the normative expectations, the belief that fellow ingroup members will, for the most part, be responding in a cooperative fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1368430211428743">Rusbult &amp; Van Lange, 2003</xref>). Groups, even short-lived ones like those used in our study, clearly do tend to establish norms that become internalized and influential even after the group has become dissolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1368430211428743">Sherif, 1935</xref>). Further, group norms typically dictate that intragroup cooperation is more appropriate than being selfish when the group faces a predicament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1368430211428743">Gouldner, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1368430211428743">Mulder, 2008</xref>). Several social dilemma studies have demonstrated that cooperative responses are more likely if cooperation by others is anticipated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1368430211428743">Jackson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1368430211428743">Tanghe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1368430211428743">Van Lange &amp; Liebrand, 1989</xref>). Interestingly, these studies show that the majority of participants cooperate when they think others are going to do so, even if they believe that their own contribution will be superfluous (i.e., that the public good would be obtained even without their contribution).</p>
<p>Instead of or in addition to group identity, the link between favorable interactions and cooperation could be explained by enhanced mood or affect. That is, friendly interactions might put people in a good mood, a state that has shown to increase helping behavior among strangers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1368430211428743">Isen &amp; Levin, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1368430211428743">Vrugt &amp; Vet, 2009</xref>). The social outlook hypothesis, for example, suggests that positive mood experiences directly stimulate positive perceptions of the social community, which “… heighten a person’s readiness to respond prosocially toward a stranger … ” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1368430211428743">Carlson, Charlin, &amp; Miller, 1988</xref>). We therefore assess the general positive and negative affect of our participants.</p>
<p>To summarize, we expected the relationship between group performance and cooperative responses to a social dilemma to be moderated by intragroup interactions. Group failure was expected to adversely affect cooperative responses for groups that had minimal interactions, but not among groups experiencing favorable interactions. Second, we expected this effect to be mediated by group identity, and for group identity to have its effect on cooperation via goal transformation and normative expectations.</p>

<p>Participants were 320 undergraduate students who participated for partial course credit (Gender: 104 males, 216 females; Age: median age = 19; Ethnicity: 265 Caucasian, 22 African American, 7 Asian American, 10 Hispanic, 16 Other).</p>

<title>Experimental design</title>
<p>We employed a 2 (<italic>Group performance</italic>: success or failure) x 2 (<italic>Intragroup interactions</italic>: Minimal or favorable) factorial. Eighty four-person groups were randomly assigned to conditions, resulting in an N of 20 groups per condition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1368430211428743">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Each experimental session consisted of a group of four students. They were told that the purpose of the study was to investigate how individuals and groups solve problems under different conditions. The four participants were randomly assigned seats at a round table, and told that they were “Group K.” They were then instructed to work on an intellective task for six minutes. Their task was to consider a list of ten causes of death in the USA and come to a unanimous decision regarding the correct ranking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1368430211428743">Kelly, Jackson, &amp; Hutson-Comeaux, 1997</xref>). One team member was randomly assigned to be the recorder of the group’s decision. It was mentioned that their group’s accuracy score would be compared to the score of other groups and that it was important to do well on the task. They were told that if they finished early, they were to review their rankings and discuss possible changes. The importance of a correct ranking was stressed.</p>
<p>As soon as the time was up, the researcher collected the recorder’s sheet and explained that she would return after calculating the group’s accuracy score. At this point, groups were randomly assigned to the minimal interactions condition or the favorable interactions condition.</p>
<p>Under the <italic>minimal interactions</italic> condition, the researcher returned in just one minute.</p>
<p>Under the <italic>favorable interactions</italic> condition, the researcher returned in 15 minutes, but before leaving, told the group, “… <italic>while you wait, we would like you to get to know each other a bit, talk about classes or whatever, just relax and chit chat while I calculate your score</italic> … .”</p>
<p>Upon returning to the group, the researcher explained that accuracy scores were calculated by summing the absolute differences between the group’s rankings and the actual rankings, such that the best possible score is zero (no differences between group’s rankings and actual rankings) and the worse score possible score is fifty. In actuality, the groups were randomly assigned to a “success” or a “failure” condition.</p>
<p>For the <italic>success condition</italic> the following was conveyed:
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>I have calculated your group</italic>’<italic>s score. Your total deviance score was …</italic> [consults clipboard] … <italic>10. This is one of the best scores we have obtained in this study. If we were assigning letter grades, your group would be given an</italic> “<italic>A</italic>.” <italic>So, your group did great on the task</italic>! <italic>You can get a copy of the correct rankings at the end of this session. Now, I need you to come with me so you can answer some questions on a computer</italic>.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For the <italic>failure condition</italic> the following was conveyed:
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>I have calculated your group</italic>’<italic>s score. Your total deviance score was</italic> … [consults clipboard] … <italic>40</italic> … <italic>This is one of the worse scores we have obtained in this study. If we were assigning letter grades, your group would be given an</italic> “<italic>F</italic>”. <italic>So your group did poorly on the task. You can get a copy of the correct rankings at the end of this session. Now, I need you to come with me so you can answer some questions on a computer</italic>.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The participants were then escorted to individual computer cubicles to complete measures of group identity, mood, perceived group effort on task, perceived length and friendliness of interactions, and perceived group performance. These measures were presented in random order for each participant, and the items within each measure were presented randomly.</p>
<p>Next, the participants were introduced to the social dilemma situation (see below), which required them to divvy up a set chips (having monetary value) to a group account and a personal account. Immediately before making their allocation decision, participants responded to a set of questions to assess normative expectations, and concern for the group versus the self (random order). After making their allocation decisions, the participants were asked to provide demographic information. Finally, they were fully debriefed and excused.</p>

<p><italic>Group identity</italic> was assessed using 18 items adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1368430211428743">Jackson (2002)</xref>. Consistent with past research, we identified an affective dimension (labeled group ties) and a cognitive dimension (labeled self-categorization). Group ties consisted of ten items, including, “I feel strong ties to the other members of Group K,” “I have a lot in common with the other members of Group K,” and “I found it difficult to form a bond with the other members of Group K” (reverse scored). Self-categorization consisted of eight items, including, “Being a member of Group K is an important reflection of who I am at this moment,” “The fact that I am a member of Group K has rarely entered my mind during this experiment” (reverse scored), and “During this study, I have been thinking about the fact that I am a member of Group K.” Participants responded to these items on a 7-point scale anchored with strongly disagree (1) and strongly agree (7) scale.</p>
<p><italic>Mood</italic> was assessed with the 20-item Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS-X; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1368430211428743">Watson &amp; Clark, 1994</xref>). Participants indicated their current affective state by responding on a 5-point scale (1 = very slightly or not at all to 5 = extremely). The positive subscale consisted of 10 items, such as interested, alert, and proud. The negative subscale consisted of such items as nervous, distressed, and upset.</p>
<p><italic>Perceived group effort</italic> was assessed with two items, each rated on a 5-point scale (1 = not at all to 5 = extremely): <italic>How much effort did the other group members put into the group task</italic>? <italic>To what extent would you say that your group was serious about doing a good job on the ranking task</italic>?</p>
<p><italic>Estimated personal effort</italic> was assessed with one item, rated on a 5-point scale (1 = not at all to 5 =extremely): <italic>How much effort did you personally put into the group task</italic>?</p>
<p><italic>Perceived friendliness</italic> of the group interaction was assessed with one item: <italic>To what extent did the members of your group interact in a friendly way</italic>? Responses were made on a 5-point scale (1 = not at all to 5 = extremely).</p>
<p><italic>Estimated time spent in free interaction</italic> was assessed with one item: <italic>After your group completed the ranking task, your group had time to freely interact while the researcher calculated your performance score. In your estimate, how many minutes of free time did your group have before the researcher returned</italic>?</p>
<p><italic>Group performance</italic> was assessed with a single item, <italic>How well did your group perform on the task</italic>? Responses were made on a 5-point scale ranging from very poor to very good.</p>
<p><italic>Amount contributed/cooperation</italic>. Each group member was given 100 chips in a personal account. Each chip was worth 5¢. Each participant had to decide how many of his or her personal chips to contribute to a group account. It was clearly explained that the sum of chips contributed to the group account would be doubled and redistributed equally among all group members, and that participants would receive what was left in their personal accounts plus their share of the group account. Decisions were private and irrevocable. Participants were quizzed to ensure their understanding. Cooperation was defined as the number of chips contributed to the group account. After this social dilemma situation was <italic>presented</italic>, participants responded to the items designed to assess normative expectations and concern for group goals versus personal goals. Then, after responding to those items, participants made their allocation decision (how many chips to contribute to the group account and how many to keep in their personal account).Given the flow of causality in our theoretical model is from normative expectations and group goals to cooperation, the fact that these social psychological constructs were assessed <italic>before</italic> cooperative (or non-cooperative) behaviors were emitted in our research paradigm is an important methodological point.</p>
<p><italic>Normative expectations</italic> was defined as the average of three items: <italic>Think about the person who was sitting to your RIGHT during the group task. How many chips do you think he or she will give to the group account</italic>? <italic>Think about the person who was sitting to your LEFT during the group task. How many chips do you think he or she will give to the group account</italic>? <italic>Think about the person who was sitting to ACROSS FROM YOU during the group task. How many chips do you think he or she will give to the group account</italic>? For each item, responses could range from 0 to 100.</p>
<p><italic>Group goals (versus self goals)</italic> was assessed with three items: <italic>When deciding how much to give, to what extent were you thinking about how the group as a whole would be affected</italic>? <italic>When deciding how much to give, to what extent were you thinking about how you personally would be affected</italic> (reverse scored)? <italic>When deciding how much to give, were you more interested in helping yourself or helping the group as a whole</italic>? Responses were made on a 5-point scale, with the first two items anchored with <italic>very slightly or not at all</italic> (1) and <italic>extremely</italic> (5), and the third item anchored with <italic>much more concerned about myself</italic> (1) and <italic>much more concerned about the group as a whole</italic> (5).</p>

<p>The intraclass correlation for our main dependent variable, amount contributed, was significant, <italic>r</italic> = .25, <italic>p</italic> &lt;; .01, verifying the non-independence of individual participants. Therefore, to analyze the data, we used a hierarchical nested ANOVA design with participants nested within groups and groups nested within conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1368430211428743">Kenny &amp; La Voie, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine if our group performance manipulation was effective, we asked participants to estimate their group’s performance on a 5-point scale (1 = very poor to 5 = very good). As expected, mean values were significantly higher under the success condition, <italic>M</italic> = 4.36 (<italic>SD</italic> = .68), than under the failure condition, <italic>M</italic> = 1.65 (<italic>SD</italic> = .49), <italic>F</italic> (1, 78) = 417.96, <italic>p</italic> &lt;; .001. The intragroup interaction manipulation had no effect on this measure, and the interaction effect was not significant.</p>
<p>To check the intragroup interaction manipulation, we asked participants to estimate how many minutes their group spent in informal, free interaction. Consistent with our manipulation, participants in the favorable interaction condition gave higher estimates (<italic>M</italic> = 6.81, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.89) than those in the minimal interaction condition (<italic>M</italic> = 2.45, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.31), <italic>F</italic> (1, 76) = 73.71, <italic>p</italic> &lt;; .001. Group performance did not affect this variable and the interaction term was also not significant.</p>
<p>To test our main hypothesis, we performed a 2-way ANOVA with group performance and intragroup interactions as independent variables and cooperation (amount contributed) as the dependent variable. As expected, there was a significant main effect for group performance, <italic>F</italic> (1, 76) = 4.85, <italic>p</italic> &lt;; .05, with more cooperation exhibited by groups that received success feedback (<italic>M</italic> = 69.78, <italic>SD</italic> = 15.35) than groups that received failure feedback (<italic>M</italic> = 62.43, <italic>SD</italic> = 19.23). Intragroup interactions also had a significant main effect on cooperation, <italic>F</italic> (1, 76) = 19.21, <italic>p</italic> = .001. There was more cooperation exhibited by participants in the favorable interactions condition (<italic>M</italic> = 73.41, <italic>SD</italic> = 14.23) than those in the minimal interactions condition (<italic>M</italic> = 58.79, <italic>SD</italic> = 18.13).</p>
<p>Finally, there was a significant group performance x intragroup interactions effect, <italic>F</italic> (1, 76) = 12.29, <italic>p &lt;;</italic> .01 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1368430211428743">Figure 1</xref>). Tests of simple effects determined that when groups interacted only minimally, group failure adversely affected cooperation, <italic>F</italic> (1, 38) = 14.98, <italic>p</italic> &lt;; 01. But, when groups had favorable interactions, group performance did not significantly affect cooperation. Thus, as predicted, favorable intragroup interactions buffered the adverse consequences of collective failure.</p>

<p>Next, we conducted structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses on the data (AMOS 19.0.0; maximum likelihood method of estimation). The paths were specified to correspond to our initial model. Specifically, we estimated paths from our manipulations of group performance (1 = failure, 2 = success) and intragroup interactions (1 = minimal, 2 = favorable) to group ties and cooperation; paths from group ties to group goals (over self-goals) and normative expectations; and paths from group goals and normative expectations to cooperation. The results determined that this model was a relatively poor fit to the data (&lt;7;<sup>2</sup> (7) = 75.99, <italic>p</italic> &lt;; .001, &lt;7;<sup>2</sup> /<italic>df</italic> = 10.85, RMR = 17.774, GFI = .933, AGFI = .799, NFI = .809, TLI = .613, CFI = .819, RMSEA = .176. We tested several alternative models and found that adding a path from normative expectations to group goals produced a very good fitting model, which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1368430211428743">Figure 2</xref> (&lt;7;<sup>2</sup> (6) = 4.71, <italic>p</italic> = .58, &lt;7;<sup>2</sup> /<italic>df</italic> = .786, RMR = 1.456, GFI = .995, AGFI = .983, NFI = .988, TLI = 1.008, CFI = 1.000, RMSEA = .000). Alternative models did not fit the data as well. For example, models that included direct paths from the exogenous variables (group performance and intragroup interactions) to group goals and normative expectations were poor fitting (all resulting in significant &lt;7;<sup>2</sup> values, NFI values &lt;; .960, and RMSEA values &gt; .070).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1368430211428743-fig2.tif"/></fig>
<p>To further examine our model, we performed tests of conditional indirect effects (moderated mediation) using procedures developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1368430211428743">Preacher, Rucker, and Hayes (2007</xref>, Model 2) and their MODMED SPSS macro (2.0). Following the propositions laid out in the introduction, we expected the indirect effect of intragroup interactions on cooperation through group ties to be moderated by group performance. Specifically, we expected a stronger indirect effect under group failure than under group success. For these analyses we generated bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the indirect effects using 5,000 bootstrap samples. The results revealed a significant interaction (B = -.23, SE = 5.58, <italic>p</italic> &lt;; .001), providing evidence of moderated mediation. The indirect effect of intragroup interactions on cooperation through group ties was significantly stronger after collective failure (95% CI: .178, 4.901 [note that since zero did not fall between the lower and upper CIs, the indirect effect is significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt;; .05]) than after collective success (95% CI: -2.216, 1.433, not significant).</p>
<p>We used the same bootstrapping procedure to examine if group goals and normative expectations mediated the relationship between group ties and cooperation. The indirect effect was significant for group goals (95% CI: .458, 2.136) and for normative expectations (95% CI: 1.172, 4.842), verifying multiple mediation between group ties and cooperation.</p>

<sec id="section10-1368430211428743" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our moderation hypothesis was confirmed. Group failure resulted in less cooperation relative to group success, but only among groups that had minimal interactions. When groups experienced prolonged, friendly interactions group failure did not adversely affect cooperation. Our mediation hypotheses were also confirmed. The positive effect that favorable intragroup interactions had on cooperation was mediated by group ties. Notably the effect was not due to fluctuations in mood (positive and negative affect) and not due to the cognitive dimension of group identity. Finally, the results were generally consistent with our prediction that group ties would operate through normative expectations and goal transformation processes. We elaborate on and discuss these findings below.</p>
<p>Given that group success, relative to group failure, did promote feelings of group identity and cooperative behaviors, our results provide some support for instrumental approaches to group identity, whereby people tend to identify with groups that are successful, have favorable status, and the like (e.g., the basking in reflected glory studies of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1368430211428743">Cialdini et al., 1976</xref>). However, our findings also suggest that group identities that are based solely on group status are more superficial or tentative than those based on friendly interpersonal experiences. Hence, it may be beneficial for a newly-formed group to experience success, but to maintain positive intragroup dynamics and effective outcomes over the long haul through the inevitable set-backs, it may be more critical to establish and maintain socioemotional ties. In fact, our results imply that when a group lacks affective ties and encounters failure, its respective members quickly become self-centered, suspicious of fellow group members, and ultimately uncooperative. On the other hand, when a group enjoys even a modest degree of socioemotional connection (group ties), the members are more likely to respond to collective failure by maintaining a focus on group goals, retaining positive expectations of fellow ingroup members, and engaging in cooperative intragroup behaviors.</p>
<p>Consistent with this theoretical position, we found evidence of moderated mediation. That is, the indirect effect of favorable intergroup interactions on cooperation through group ties was significantly stronger after group failure than after group success. Again, this suggests that it may be especially important for a group to have an established sense of affective identity after experiencing failure than after experiencing success, assuming the desired outcome is cooperative interactions in the pursuit of collective goals. As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1368430211428743">De Cremer and van Dijk (2002)</xref>, members of successful groups may simply operate according to a “win-stay” heuristic. On the other hand, members of unsuccessful groups may require some “social glue” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1368430211428743">Van Vugt &amp; Hart, 2004</xref>) to maintain supportive relations.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, our results are consistent with social identity theory (Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1986) and support recent efforts to apply that theory to social dilemmas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1368430211428743">De Cremer &amp; Van Dijk, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1368430211428743">Jackson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1368430211428743">Smith et al., 2003</xref>). More specifically, our findings are consistent with recent theoretical and empirical efforts that emphasize different dimensions of group identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1368430211428743">Amiot, &amp; Sansfaçon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1368430211428743">Bhowon &amp; Tseung-Wong, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1368430211428743">Cameron, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1368430211428743">Jackson &amp; Smith, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1368430211428743">Roccas, Sagiv, Schwartz, Halevy, &amp; Eidelson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1368430211428743">Taşdemir, 2011</xref>). We found that the affective dimension of group identity (i.e., “group ties”) was especially consequential in predicting cooperative reactions to a social dilemma. Other researchers have found the affective dimension to be an especially powerful predictor of other outcomes, including intragroup involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1368430211428743">Jackson, Miller, Frew, Gilbreath, &amp; Dillman, 2011</xref>), team effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1368430211428743">Tanghe et al., 2010</xref>) and intergroup differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1368430211428743">Ellemers et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1368430211428743">Hinkle, Taylor, Fox-Cardamone, &amp; Cook, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1368430211428743">Jackson, 2002</xref>). While there is now good evidence for multiple dimensions of group identity, much work remains regarding how the different dimensions are uniquely affected by situations, how they are related to each other, and how they affect differential outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1368430211428743">Bergami &amp; Bagozzi, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results suggest that group ties, the affective dimension of group identity, influence cooperative reactions through two interrelated processes. First, our analyses support the <italic>goal transformation hypothesis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1368430211428743">De Cremer &amp; Van Dijk, 2002</xref>) in that a sense of group ties enhanced our participant’s concern for group goals relative to purely personal outcomes. Second, our analyses suggest that strong group ties led our participants to believe that their fellow ingroup members were going to contribute generously. We refer to this process as <italic>normative expectations</italic>. Finally, having a focus on group goals (goal transformation) and having normative expectations both stimulated higher rates of cooperation. These findings are consistent with a similar study reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1368430211428743">Jackson (2011)</xref>. Interestingly, our SEM analyses suggest that having normative expectations was a strong predictor of group goals, and that including this pathway was critical to obtaining a good fit to the data. While this specific connection—from normative expectations to group goals—is not directly contrary to established theoretical positions, and a sensible argument promoting it could be developed, we feel that doing so without apriori prediction and replication would be premature at this time. Our position is that this relationship requires additional theoretical and empirical attention.</p>
<p>Although our focus is on social identity processes, our findings are compatible with other motivational models of social dilemmas. For example, two motives that have been shown to thwart cooperation in social dilemmas are <italic>greed</italic> and <italic>fear</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1368430211428743">Rapoport &amp; Eshed-Levy, 1989</xref>). The greed motive reflects a basic desire to obtain as many resources for the personal self as possible, whereas the <italic>fear</italic> motive reflects a basic desire to avoid being exploited by others. Logically, normative expectations of cooperation—believing that “everybody is doing it”—should reduce the fear motive. In other words, if a group member believes that everybody else in the group is working hard toward the group goal, then he or she should not have to worry about being exploited or taken for a “sucker.” Consistent with this idea, there is evidence that expecting cooperation from others is inversely related to anxiety and fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1368430211428743">Amanatullah, Morris, &amp; Curhan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1368430211428743">Nelissen, Dijker &amp; deVries, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1368430211428743">Van Hiel, Vanneste, &amp; de Cremer, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, if normative expectations of cooperation are high, then it would be rational, from a strictly personal economic position, to “free ride” on the contributions of others and not cooperate. This is where group concern or the goal-transformation motive may play a more critical role. Rather than affecting “fear” of exploitation, a heightened degree of group concern likely stimulates cooperation by lessening the greed motive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1368430211428743">Brewer &amp; Kramer, 1986</xref>). That is, working for the benefit of “we” becomes as important as working for the benefit of “me.”</p>
<p>There are several notable limitations to this study. First, our study did not include a no-feedback condition, which makes it difficult to determine the impact of group success versus group failure relative to a neutral baseline. Hence, from our data we cannot definitively conclude that group failure inhibited cooperation or that group success promoted cooperation. We suspect a little of each occurs and that a no-feedback condition would produce relatively moderate levels of cooperation (i.e., fall in between the rate s of cooperation exhibited by participants in a group success condition and those in a group failure condition). This, of course, is an empirical question that will require future research efforts. Similarly, it would be useful to employ an unfavorable intragroup interactions condition to compliment the favorable interactions condition we employed, given recent findings that unfavorable contact seems to be more detrimental than favorable contact is beneficial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1368430211428743">Paolini, Harwood, &amp; Rubin, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Secondly, there are undoubtedly other variables that could be potentially important in our model. For example, as mentioned in the introduction, attributions regarding responsibility for the group’s performance (success or failure) are likely critical to individual reactions. Our speculation is that favorable intergroup interactions would, while promoting group ties, also promote group-based attributions (“we were successful” or “we failed”) rather than personal attributes (“I was successful” or “He made us fail”). Thus, attributions might be an additional mediator of the relationship between group ties and cooperation. It would also be interesting to experimentally manipulate attributions for success and failure (e.g., due to luck, skill, a single individual in the group, the group as a whole) to observe interactions with other exogenous variables in our model. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1368430211428743">Smith, et al. (2003)</xref>, for example, found that personal affluence based on internal attributions (“I earned it”) resulted in more selfish thoughts and less intragroup cooperation compared to a condition in which personal affluence was based on random circumstances (“I got lucky”).</p>
<p>Mood is another variable that deserves greater attention. While our (lack of ) mood results are consistent with some studies that have reported null effects of mood on cooperative responses to social dilemma situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1368430211428743">Duell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1368430211428743">Hertel, Neuhof, Theuer, &amp; Kerr, 2000</xref>), other studies have found mood to significantly affect cooperative interactions in groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368430211428743">Bierhoff &amp; Müller, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1368430211428743">Bierhoff &amp; Müller, 2005</xref>). It is worth noting that mood was not the main focus of our study and we made no attempt to directly manipulate the construct. Given these limitations and the pervasiveness and importance of mood and emotions in the daily lives of humans and other animals, the effect of mood on cooperation deserves greater empirical scrutiny in future studies. It is very likely that mood does not have a direct main effect on cooperation at all, but rather interacts in complex ways with other variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1368430211428743">Hertel, 1999</xref>). Applying a mood-as-input model, this point has been recently elaborated on theoretically and tested empirically in a set of four studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1368430211428743">Sanna, Parks, and Chang (2003)</xref>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our results suggest that favorable interpersonal contact among group members fosters an emotional bond with the group, which, in turn, leads to (a) an expectation of mutual cooperation and support, and (b) a desire to promote the welfare of the group, even if it is to the detriment of personal welfare. Together, these factors lead to a high rate of intragroup cooperation which is maintained “through thick and thin,” that is, after group success or group failure. Continued efforts to identify the factors and processes that influence how people react to social dilemmas will help to reduce the adverse consequences of these real and ubiquitous situations.</p>
