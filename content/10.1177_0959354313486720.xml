<abstract>
<p>One of the traditional branches of Western practical philosophy, Marxist practical philosophy, is still the mainstream philosophy in contemporary China. It provides not only a new understanding of human nature, mind, behavior, and environment, but also an alternative perspective for the study of psychology. It is from this perspective that activity theory in the former Soviet Union and “practice” discussions in China try to integrate Marxist practical philosophy with psychology. Based on these attempts, we advocate the introduction of “practice” into psychology and the understanding of all psychological problems as starting from “practice.” First, “practice” is defined as people’s creative activity and a way of human existence. The structure of “practice” is then divided into three hierarchies: reflexive practice, cognitive practice, and social and cultural practice. Finally, two examples are chosen to explain how to research psychology from the viewpoint of Marxist practical philosophy.</p>

<p>The integration of Marxist philosophy with psychology has been a recurrent issue in the history of psychology which has greatly influenced psychology in certain countries such as the former Soviet Union and China. Today, however, our understandings of both Marxist philosophy and psychology have greatly changed. Marxist philosophy is shifting from dialectical materialism to practical philosophy. And at the same time, psychology has greatly advanced. Some schools of psychology have disappeared, others have developed, and new schools are springing up. Nevertheless, the integration of Marxist philosophy with psychology remains an important issue in theoretical psychology.</p>
<sec id="section1-0959354313486720">
<title>Marxist practical philosophy and its development in China</title>
<p>As an important philosophical term, “practice” has a long history in philosophy. In addition, “practice” is also used widely in our daily lives. Along with the different “practices,” there exist various kinds of “practical philosophy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959354313486720">Ding, 2012</xref>). It is necessary to mention that “practice” and “practical philosophy” in this paper are meant in particular ways. “Practice” does not mean “clinical practice” or “the application of psychology.” Also, “practical philosophy” is neither a division of philosophy opposed to “theoretical philosophy” (such as ethics, political philosophy, philosophy of law, or philosophy of religion, etc.) nor “philosophy of practice,” which is a discipline to explore how people can lead wiser, more reflective lives by using philosophical methods and insights (including reflective practice, personal philosophical thinking, and philosophical counseling, etc.).</p>
<p>Marxist practical philosophy is one of the traditional branches of Western philosophy. However, unlike other philosophers, Marx stresses especially the problem of “practice” as the starting point of all his philosophy, and he helped to bring about the so-called “practical turn” in the history of philosophy.</p>
<sec id="section2-0959354313486720">
<title>The basic view of Marxist practical philosophy</title>
<p>Marxist practical philosophy provides an alternative understanding of human nature, mind, behavior, circumstance (including nature and society), and their inter-relationships. In what follows, we will discuss this directly in relation to Marx and Engels’ classic works.</p>
<sec id="section3-0959354313486720">
<title>Human nature: Originated and evolved in practice</title>
<p>In his “Theses on Feuerbach,” Marx criticized previous philosophy, “The chief defect of all hitherto existing materialism—that of Feuerbach included—is that the thing, reality, sensuousness, is conceived only in the form of the object or of contemplation, but not as sensuous human activity, practice, not subjectively” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959354313486720">Marx &amp; Engels, 1995a</xref>, p. 54). Traditional materialists take the world as an automatic operating system isolated from human activity and reduce the human to the animal or machine that has no free will. Human nature is not so different from other natural objects, and it is strictly under the control of the objective world.</p>
<p>At the same time, “in contradistinction to materialism, the active side was developed abstractly by idealism—which, of course, does not know real, sensuous activity as such.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959354313486720">Marx &amp; Engels, 1995a</xref>, p. 54). Traditional idealists take humans to be the rulers of the world, regarding objects as the derivatives of consciousness (e.g., Kant says that mind is the lawgiver of nature, and Hegel claims that the whole world is subject to the special law of “absolute spirit”). Both traditional materialists and idealists believe they “know” human nature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959354313486720">Marx and Engels (1960)</xref> think both of them are partly right. The root cause of their conflict is their neglect of “practice.” In Marxist philosophy’s view, practice is the bridge between object and subject. “It distinguishes man from animals” (p. 24), and it is the “feature of species-being” (p. 96). On the one hand, practice is a physical process during which people utilize physical tools to change the physical world. Human being is controlled by the physical world and then becomes a part of it. On the other hand, practice is our purposive activity, which is restrained by the subjective mind. Traditional materialists and idealists both ignore the coexistence of the two aspects of practice, or only stress one aspect, and they cannot envisage the integration of the object and subject.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959354313486720">Marx and Engels (1979)</xref> said, “The animal is immediately one with its life activity” (p. 96). However, human is not animal, they proclaimed:
<disp-quote>
<p>Men can be distinguished from animals by consciousness, by religion or anything else you like. They themselves begin to distinguish themselves from animals as soon as they begin to produce their means of subsistence, a step which is conditioned by their physical organization. By producing their means of subsistence men are indirectly producing their actual material life. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959354313486720">Marx &amp; Engels, 1995a</xref>, p. 67)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>That is to say, practice is the most essential and the most important dividing line between human and animal. Human nature is not invariant, nor does it develop mechanically; instead, it originated and evolved in the process of practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0959354313486720">
<title>Consciousness: Evolving in and guiding practice</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959354313486720">Marx and Engels (1979)</xref> thought the method of exploring consciousness should start from “the real living individuals themselves, and consciousness is considered solely as their consciousness” (p. 96). Consciousness comes from human practice, rather than having any other mysterious origin. First, consciousness is formed in practice, and practice is the best way to obtain and comprehend consciousness. “The production of ideas, of conceptions, of consciousness, is at first directly interwoven with the material activity and the material intercourse of men, the language of real life” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959354313486720">Marx &amp; Engels, 1995a</xref>, p. 72). In practice, human beings have changed nature and their social relationships, and meanwhile have changed their own mind and consciousness. Second, practice is guided by consciousness. “Everything that motivates men’s behavior must go through their heads” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959354313486720">Marx &amp; Engels, 1995b</xref>, p. 245). Practice can not only reflect human beings’ purpose, but also lead to the physical changes of nature. That is to say, through practice, human beings can change the world according to their consciousness. Just as Marx said, “What distinguishes the worst architect from the best of bees is this, that the architect raises his structure in imagination before he erects it in reality” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959354313486720">Marx &amp; Engels, 1972</xref>, p. 202). Third, practice is the objective criterion used to test consciousness. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959354313486720">Marx and Engels (1995a)</xref> declared, “All social life is essentially practical. All mysteries which lead theory to mysticism find their rational solution in human practice and in the comprehension of this practice” (p. 73). Whether consciousness is true or false, and to what degree it is true, is not judged by an existing theory. We should put our consciousness into practice and then test and assess it in practice. Finally, there is rich psychological knowledge condensed in the products of human practice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959354313486720">Marx and Engels (1979)</xref> said, “We see how the history of industry and the established objective existence of industry are the open book of man’s essential powers, the perceptibly existing human psychology” (p. 127). We can understand and obtain consciousness through the products of practice, such as industry, history, culture, and so on.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0959354313486720">
<title>Circumstance: Condition and the object of practice</title>
<p>Circumstance in Marxist philosophy mainly refers to nature and society. Human beings are a product of circumstances, but we in turn modify those circumstances. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959354313486720">Marx and Engels (1960)</xref> once criticized “the materialist doctrine concerning the changing of circumstances and upbringing [for forgetting] that circumstances are changed by men and that it is essential to educate the educator himself” (p. 3). In practice, human beings obtain food and clothing from circumstance, and are constrained by circumstance. Meanwhile, people can change circumstances, make nature “humanized nature,” and shape different kinds of interpersonal relationships in society.</p>
<p>Nature is only one of the fundamental conditions for our existence. Just as Marx said, nature is the “inorganic realm of human spirit,” and the “inorganic body of man” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959354313486720">Marx &amp; Engels, 1995a</xref>, p. 45). Human beings are part of the nature. At the same time, nature is created and humanized by us: “[N]ature too, taken abstractly, for itself—nature fixed in isolation from man is nothing for man” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959354313486720">Marx &amp; Engels, 1979</xref>, p. 178). Therefore, “nature as it develops through industry, even though in an estranged form, is true anthropological nature” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959354313486720">Marx &amp; Engels, 1979</xref>, p. 128).</p>
<p>All human beings live in society: “[M]en’s social existence is their actual living process” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959354313486720">Marx &amp; Engels, 1960</xref>, p. 29). Society is our society, and is an indivisible part that makes a human being a human being. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959354313486720">Marx and Engels (1995a)</xref> pointed out that “man’s nature is no abstraction inherent in each single individual, in its reality it is the ensemble of social relations” (p. 60). Isolated from society, consciousness can’t exist. A “wolf child” is more animal than human, because it is separated from society. That’s why <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959354313486720">Marx and Engels (1995a)</xref> said, “Consciousness is, therefore, from the very beginning a social product and remains so as long as men exist at all” (p. 35).</p>
<p>Marxist practical philosophy divides the world into three parts: the objective world (nature and society), the subjective world (consciousness or mind), and human practices. Because of practice, objective circumstances and the subjective world are no longer isolated, static, separated, or opposed; human being, consciousness, and circumstance are closely connected with each other. In practice, human nature originated and evolved in the interaction between human and circumstance; consciousness comes from practice, guides practice, and realizes its purpose in the physical world; circumstance is the precondition of a human being’s existence, and a human being gets the means of livelihood from nature and forms social relations in society. In this way, the “self-existence world” becomes the “humanized world.” Interwoven relationships are formed among human beings, consciousness, and circumstance in the process of practice. Therefore, practice is the only key to untie all these various relations. All conflicts and contradictions in the human world are rooted in practice, but at the same time, they are all ultimately resolved on the basis of practice.</p>

<title>The advance of Marxist practical philosophy in contemporary China</title>
<p>After Marx’s death, especially after the publication of the <italic>Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts</italic> of 1844, heated discussions about the “young Marx” and “old Marx” took place. Since then, Marxist philosophy has been understood from different perspectives, which can be roughly divided into three groups. The first group is the former Soviet Union’s Marxist philosophy, such as Marxist-Leninism and Stalinism. The second group is Western Marxism, including humanist Marxism, structural Marxism, and ecological Marxism, and so on. The third group is Chinese Marxist philosophy, which we will discuss next.</p>
<p>Since the People’s Republic of China was founded in 1949, Marxist philosophy has been the mainstream of Chinese philosophy. Chinese philosophers have published a great many books and papers on Marxist philosophy. Since the beginning of the 21st century, Chinese philosophers have reread Marx and Engels’ classics based on Soviet, Western, and traditional Chinese philosophy. Their understanding of Marxist philosophy has gradually changed from dialectical materialism to practical philosophy. Some Chinese leading philosophical journals, like <italic>Seeking Truth</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959354313486720">Yi &amp; Ding, 2000</xref>), <italic>Philosophical Researches</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959354313486720">N. S. Wang, Yan, Ren, &amp; Cao, 2012</xref>), and <italic>Marxism &amp; Reality</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959354313486720">Ding, Xu, Feng, Ma, &amp; Gao, 2012</xref>), have published special sections discussing Marxist practical philosophy.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the discussion of Marxist practical philosophy in China has focused on two issues: “What is practice in philosophy?” and “How is the world to be interpreted and changed according to the practical view?”</p>
<sec id="section7-0959354313486720">
<title>What is practice in philosophy?</title>
<p>Different philosophers have different understandings about Marxist practical philosophy. There are at least six dimensions of these understandings in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959354313486720">Qiao, 2005</xref>).</p>
<list id="list1-0959354313486720" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>The epistemological dimension</italic>: This holds that practice is the resource and basis of knowledge, and also the objective criterion to test knowledge.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>The ontological dimension</italic>: This position insists that practice is superior to any other philosophical concept, and it can be the “Archimedian fulcrum” of the philosophical system. Practice is the basis of the interaction between subject and object.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>The existential dimension</italic>: These philosophers believe that practice is the way of human existence, and philosophy should object to metaphysics and return to the “lifeworld.”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>The holistic dimension</italic>: This position holds that practice is holistic, including not only the activities that produce material wealth, but also the mental activities to pursue happiness, love, and liberty, and so on.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>The intersubjective dimension</italic>: This position emphasizes the intersubjectivity of practice, regarding practice to be the medium of both subject–object and subject–subject relations.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>The technologist dimension</italic>: This position mainly regards practice as a kind of technical activity, believing that technology is a powerful motive to boost productivity and promote people’s overall development.</p></list-item>

<sec id="section8-0959354313486720">
<title>How is the world to be interpreted and changed according to the practical view?</title>
<p>Practice is the key to understanding Marxist philosophy, and it is the starting point for understanding human nature and the relationships among human beings, consciousness, and circumstance. In China, many philosophers think of Marxist practical philosophy as a worldview or a way of thinking by which we can interpret and change the world.</p>
<p>This view includes mainly two points. First, how are philosophical issues to be understood from a practical view? For example, from a practice perspective, how can we answer the following questions: What is the origin of the world? How do we understand the relations between body and mind? How do we understand human nature? Second, how is the world to be changed from a practical view? Marx said, “The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point is to change it” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959354313486720">Marx &amp; Engels, 1995a</xref>, p. 55). To change the world is part of the duty of Marxist practical philosophy.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>What it confronts is not abstract concept or logic, but conflicts and problems in real life. Marxist practical philosophy should provide the basic ideas, principles and theoretical strategies to solve these conflicts and problems, and realize its duty “to change the world.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959354313486720">Yan, 2012</xref>, p. 16)</p>

<title>A preliminary exploration for integrating psychology with Marxist practical philosophy</title>
<p>As is widely known, psychology is closely connected to philosophy. Influenced by philosophy consciously or unconsciously, different psychological theories and schools have different understandings of human nature, consciousness, behavior, and environment. “Behavior,” a concern for psychologists for the last 100 years, is actually human practice. However, Marxist practical philosophy, which starts from practice, has long been neglected by Western psychology. Fortunately, Soviet and Chinese psychology have tried to use Marxist philosophy as the basis of their studies. Following the above two topics of Marxist practical philosophy, we will take two steps to discuss its influence on psychology.</p>
<p>First, we should reflect on the concept “behavior” and introduce “practice” into psychology. According to the discussion of the definition of “practice” in Marxist philosophy, we should criticize and rethink the concept of behavior in psychology. Some Soviet Russian and Chinese psychologists think “behavior” is a term which has caused confusion in psychology, and they propose to replace it with “activity” or “practice.”</p>
<p>Second, “practice” can provide an alternative perspective for studying psychology. On this basis, we will be able to rebuild the system of psychology and study all psychological issues starting from “practice.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0959354313486720">
<title>Activity theory and its defects</title>
<p>Soviet psychology kept a watchful eye on behavior for a long time. Sechenov first used the concept “reflex” 50 years before Watson. Later, many related theories were developed, such as Pavlov’s conditioned reflex theory, Bekhterev’s association reflex theory, and Kornilov’s reactology. Soviet psychologists did not study “behavior.” Under the influence of Marxist philosophy, Vygotsky first founded activity theory, then Rubinstein developed it, and Leontiev completed it. This period is the first attempt to integrate psychology with Marxist practical philosophy.</p>
<p>Leontiev’s activity theory is mainly reflected in his book <italic>Activity, Consciousness, and Personality</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959354313486720">1978/1980</xref>). In this book, he claims that in traditional psychology “activity is interpreted either within the framework of idealistic concepts or along the lines of materialistic and natural science tendencies—as a response to external actions of a passive subject conditioned by his innate organization and training” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959354313486720">Leontiev, 1978/1980</xref>, p. 44).</p>
<p>The common defect of all traditional psychology is its ignorance of human activity. Its methodological point of view is “derived from a binomial plan of analysis: action on receptor systems of the <italic>subject → resulting response → phenomena (subjective and objective)</italic> evoked by the given action” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959354313486720">Leontiev, 1978/1980</xref>, p. 45).</p>
<p>Without considering human activity, psychology can do nothing to explain complex psychological phenomena, so it must turn to a “postulate of directness” which contains some mysterious power like apperception or intention (Tolman took it as “intervening variables,” and Rubinstein expressed it as “external motives act through internal conditions”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959354313486720">Leontiev, 1978/1980</xref>, p. 45). Leontiev thought that the intervening factors could not replace external stimuli, so he proposed adding a middle link to change the “binomial formula” into a “trinomial formula”; this middle link is “the activity of the subject and, correspondingly, conditions, goals, and means of that activity—a link that mediates the ties between them” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959354313486720">Leontiev, 1978/1980</xref>, p. 47).</p>
<p>The introduction of “activity” into psychology changed the conceptual system of psychology. Leontiev gave a detailed explanation. He holds that:
<disp-quote>
<p>Activity is a molar, not an additive unit of the life of the physical, material subject. In a narrower sense, that is, at the psychological level, it is a unit of life, mediated by psychic reflection, the real function of which is that it orients the subject in the objective world. In other words, activity is not a reaction and not a totality of reactions but a system that has structure, its own internal transitions and transformations, its own development. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959354313486720">1978/1980</xref>, p. 51)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>First, the most important characteristic of activity is its objectivity. The objectivity of activity is twofold: one is as substance; the other is as an image of the substance, and as a product of its property of psychological reflection.</p>
<p>Second, human activity is the research subject of psychology. Activity includes both internal activity and external activity, and the two cannot be separated from each other. Internal activity is generated and evolved in external activity, transforming the objective world into subjective knowledge, while external activity directly changes the objective world, putting subjective knowledge into objective products.</p>
<p>Third, activity has its own structure. Activity is realized by goal-directed action, subordinated to conscious purposes, and the realization of action is dependent on the concrete method, that is, operation. So,
<disp-quote>
<p>Analysis isolates separate (specific) activities in the first place according to the criterion of motives that elicit them. Then actions are isolated—processes that are subordinated to conscious goals, finally, operations that directly depend on the conditions of attaining concrete goals. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959354313486720">Leontiev, 1978/1980</xref>, pp. 73–74)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In a word, what constitute the “units” of the activity structure together are activity, action, operation, and its corresponding needs, including motive, purpose, and condition.</p>
<p>Fourth, activity theory provided a new perspective to solve some problems in traditional psychology. For example, consciousness is shaped in activity, and is constrained by the objective world and human society in the process of activity. Human personality is formed in activity, and then through activity it is interwoven between the objective world and human society.</p>
<p>Introducing the concept of “activity” into psychology, activity theory criticized both idealism’s consciousness psychology and mechanical materialism’s behavioral psychology. This was a significant exploration in solving the traditional crisis of Western psychology. Moreover, with the introduction of “activity,” psychology made progress in understanding human behavior by attaching great importance to its social, cultural, and historical attributes. However, in Chinese psychologists’ opinion, activity theory also had some marked defects.</p>
<p>First, activity did not attain the status it should have. It is still taken as a “middle link” of the trinomial formula, but is not regarded as a starting point for all psychological studies. Not really based on activity (practice), activity theory still cannot understand the human mind, behavior, and the relationships between human beings and the external objective world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959354313486720">W. D. Yang &amp; Ding, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, the connotation of activity is too broad. Activity theory broadens the connotation of activity to include not only human external behavior, but also internal mental activity. So activity theory actually has confused mind with behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959354313486720">H. C. Chen, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959354313486720">X. Li, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959354313486720">Y. Li, 1979</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, some specific theoretical problems still need to be further discussed. For example, in discussing activity’s “internalization” and “externalization,” activity theory seems to adopt Marxist materialism’s viewpoint, but actually it has made mechanist materialism’s mistakes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354313486720">Y. Li, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959354313486720">Zhang, 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959354313486720">1985</xref>)</p>
<p>Finally, there has not been much further research. After the death of the old psychologists, Soviet psychology turned to subject psychology, which concerns itself more with the integrated human being than human activity. Only some important principles of activity theory have permeated into later research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959354313486720">Nirilowa &amp; Li, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959354313486720">Shi, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959354313486720">Zhang, 1985</xref>).</p>

<title>Chinese psychology’s controversies of practice and its problems</title>
<p>In November 1980, while Chinese people were discussing the “criterion of practice,” Pan Shu organized a seminar in Chongqing for the Theoretical Psychology Division of the Chinese Psychological Society on the topic “The Relation between Psychology and Practice.” After the meeting, they started a journal named <italic>Psychological Exploration</italic> (still a very important theoretical psychology journal in China), published related articles, and evoked a warm discussion on “practice and psychology” in China. Many of the ideas in the discussion are still widely accepted today. Overall, the discussion focused mainly on the following two issues: (a) are there qualitative differences between practice and activity and (b) does the term “practice” need to be introduced into psychology? Of the two questions, scholars’ opinions are divided into two groups. One group holds the view that psychology mainly studies activity and it’s not necessary to borrow the term “practice” from philosophy. The other group claims that the term “practice” is more accurate than “activity,” so “practice” should be introduced into psychology as a core concept.</p>
<p>Scholars who insist on using the term “activity” point out that activity is a basic concept in psychology, and the introduction of “practice” seems to be gilding the lily. Some scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959354313486720">Shi, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959354313486720">Zhu, 1981</xref>) think that activity includes external activities (e.g., producing activity and reproducing activity) and internal activities (e.g., mental activity and physiological activity), but meanwhile the denotation of practice is too narrow; it is only one sort of activity. So, in their eyes, activity, including human external activities and physiological activity, is the basis of psychology. “Psychology should study how mind is formed on the basis of activity, how mind reacts on activity, and what is the relationship between mind and activity. Activity should be the starting point of psychology” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959354313486720">Zhu, 1981</xref>, p. 27).</p>
<p>Other scholars (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959354313486720">S. T. Li, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959354313486720">Z. Li, 1981a</xref>) say that activity is human purposeful behavior, which is little different from practice. The study of activity theory should be based on Marxist practical views and discuss the characteristics, motives, structure, and process of activity, so there is no need to use “practice” in psychology. Still other scholars (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959354313486720">P. Wang, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959354313486720">A. H. Yang, 1981</xref>) hold that these terms should be studied from an historical and developing perspective: we can situate practice and activity within the framework of “movement, activity, and practice.” Movement is a philosophical concept, and it is the way of existence for everything in the world. Activity is human behavior with mental factors, while practice is human purposeful behavior whose goal is to change the world. So psychology can’t only be “limited in practice, because animals also have mental activities, but they can never practice.” “Those phenomena that can only be called movement but not activity” are not research objects of psychology, but are the research objects of other disciplines (e.g., physics, astronomy). Psychology should study “mainly the activities with mental factors that humans and animals both have” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959354313486720">Q. Wang &amp; Shen, 1981</xref>, p. 26).</p>
<p>However, most Chinese scholars propose introducing “practice” into psychology. Some scholars hold that “activity is a neutral term; the biggest defect is that it can’t completely express the practical view of Marxist dialectical materialism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959354313486720">Pan, 1981b</xref>, p. 8); the denotation of “activity” is too broad, so it’s better to use the term “practice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959354313486720">Pan, 1981a</xref>). Some scholars hold that Soviet psychology’s activity lacks a clear definition—“it must cause confusion when it is in use”—so they propose, in the process of psychology’s research and application, that “we should get the right dialectical relation between mind and practice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959354313486720">S. T. Li, 1981</xref>, p. 12). Some scholars (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959354313486720">Hong, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959354313486720">J. H. Wang, Lin, Chen, &amp; Li, 1983</xref>) criticize activity theory and other scholars’ practice views, maintaining that practice includes social practice, individual practice, and objective practice. They hold that “practice” can emphasize the dialectical relationships between social practice and individual practice, showing the relationships much better than can be done using the term “activity.”</p>
<p>Second, scholars’ opinions differ on the psychological definition of “practice.” Even for scholars who insist on introducing practice into psychology, they differ greatly on such questions as “What is practice?” and “What is the relationship between practice and psychology?” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959354313486720">Pan (1981b)</xref> says that practice should have a broader denotation in psychology: practice is “life practice,” not just “producing practice” or “scientific experiments.” Eating and bathing are also practices; practice refers not only to “individual practice,” but also to “social practice.” Mind and practice are inseparable: mind is generated and developed in practice, and practice is also guided by mind. Some scholars (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354313486720">Y. Li, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959354313486720">Y. F. Li, 1990</xref>) hold that practice is a dialectical unity including social practice, individual external behavior, and individual mental activity: “[M]ind reflects the objective world in the process of practice, and meanwhile reflects its own objective existence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354313486720">Y. Li, 1998</xref>, p. 156). At the same time, mind can guide practice through “the externalization from mental activity to body activity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959354313486720">Su, 1981</xref>, p. 19). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959354313486720">Hong (1981)</xref> holds that so-called “life” and “practice” is “the concrete activity in a certain social and historical condition, it transforms subject’s mind to objective products,” so mind and practice is “a dialectical unity” (p. 18).</p>
<p>After this discussion, Chinese psychologists have reached some agreements on the relations between practice and psychology. They realize that there are some limitations to Soviet psychology’s activity theory, and believe that “practice is the only criterion of truth, and in the study of human psychology, objective practice must be of prime concern” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959354313486720">Yue, 1994</xref>). For psychology, “practice is not only related to psychology’s methodology, but also psychologists’ value; it influences the future of psychology” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959354313486720">Z. Li, 1981b</xref>, p. 10). But Chinese psychology also has some limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959354313486720">W. D. Yang &amp; Ding, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>First, there are too many different understandings of the definitions of “activity” and “practice.” Scholars try to define “practice” or “activity” in their own ways and then disagree with one another. They don’t discuss the same platform from its beginning, so they don’t achieve as much as they could.</p>
<p>Second, many scholars don’t realize that “practice” as a psychological concept differs from “practice” as a philosophical view of Marxism. Furthermore, they confuse “what is practice in psychology” with “how to study psychology from the practical view.”</p>
<p>Third, they passively accept Marxist classics’ practical view with little criticism. Scholars always quote philosophical classics to demonstrate their psychological point directly: for example, they repeatedly quote Marx’s “Theses on Feuerbach,” Mao Zedong’s “On Practice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959354313486720">Mao, 1951</xref>), and Lenin’s works (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959354313486720">Lenin, 1990</xref>). So, their discussions remain on the level of philosophy and contribute little to the advancement of psychology.</p>
<p>Fourth, a deeply rooted common view is lacking in the discussion. Scholars have come to realize the importance of practice in psychology, but they are not clear how important it is, how to make use of it, and how to carry out the practical view in psychology. After this discussion, along with the retirement or death of their older colleagues, Chinese psychologists have shifted their attention to Western psychology.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0959354313486720">
<title>Our view of “practice” in psychology</title>
<p>Marxist philosophy guided Soviet and Chinese psychology for a long time. However, because of the limitations of the zeitgeist, perhaps also because of some political pressure (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959354313486720">Petzold, 1994</xref>), people’s understanding of Marxist philosophy remained at the level of “dialectical materialism,” never reaching the level of “practical philosophy.” Next, we discuss the definition of “practice” and its structure in psychology from the perspective of Marxist practical philosophy.</p>
<sec id="section13-0959354313486720">
<title>The concept of practice</title>
<p>As noted above, the introduction of “practice” into psychology in China can only be traced back to the 1980s. Pan suggested adopting a broad definition of “practice,” holding that practice includes “not only the ‘three practices’ of Mao Zedong, but also all of people’s life practices, like eating and drinking” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959354313486720">Pan, 1987</xref>, p. 187).</p>
<p>This definition exceeded the well-known “three practices” (economic production, scientific experimentation, and class struggle), which has shown the originality of Chinese psychologists. However, there are still a considerable number of problems. The concept of practice in psychology is not clear enough, and it is necessary to redefine it.</p>
<p>We hold the view that practice in psychology refers to humans’ creative activities during their entire lives; it is the way of human existence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959354313486720">W. D. Yang &amp; Ding, 2009</xref>). For its denotation, practice includes all activities, such as talking, eating, sleeping, paring pears, counting money, and so on. Practice is first embodied in human behavior, but this “behavior” is not the same as that of past psychologists. Practice is the logical development of the old “behavior”; it is guided by mind, and forms mind in its process, but it does not include mind. Practice is constrained by environment, and at the same time, it changes the environment too. Practice, mind, and environment together have constituted the three basic key concepts in psychology. Thanks to practice, mind and environment can communicate and interact with each other, and practice becomes the starting point for building an image of human nature.</p>
<p>Practice is closely related to behavior, but they are not the same. Psychologists like Sechenov, Watson, Pavlov, and Bekhterev take behavior as “response” or “reflex,” which has ignored social and cultural constraints and the mind’s guidance to “response” and “reflex.” They believe that the environment plays a decisive role for behavior, taking behavior as the simple muscular movement or glandular secretion after the stimulus.</p>
<p>McDougall regards behavior as “purposive behavior,” paying attention to its subjectivity, but he thinks it is stimulated by human instinct or an internal motive. It attaches little importance to environmental events. Kornilov takes behavior as “reaction”; he has noted the influence of subjective factors and environmental factors, but he takes human behavior mechanically. Tolman takes behavior as “molar behavior” guided by cognitive factors. He observes cognitive factors’ influence on behavior and makes the subject more active, but he neglects human social culture. So Tolman’s behavior is almost determined by environment. Skinner believes that behavior is mainly “operant behavior,” which operates on the environment and is maintained by its consequences. Skinner includes subjective initiative within the concept of behavior; this is partly justified. However, he refuses to study mental phenomena, and uses “reinforcement” to replace the mind’s guidance of behavior, which is obviously problematic. Piaget takes human behavior as the interactive “action” of subject and object, and in his opinion action is the root cause of the separation of subject and object. Human cognitive schemas are formed on the basis of action through “assimilation” and “adaptation.” But Piaget’s study is within the framework of genetic epistemology in which social and cultural factors are always excluded. Vygotsky, Rubinstein, and Leontiev have studied human “activity.” They emphasize social, cultural, and historical constraints and the influences of mental, environmental, and physical factors on behavior, but the denotation of their “activity” is so broad that mind is taken as human “internal activity,” which erases the distinction between mind and behavior. Pan uses “action” to refer to human behavior, which reflects his acceptance of Soviet psychology’s activity theory to some extent, but he thinks action is “half subjective and half objective,” and is “the extension of subjective intention to objective world” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959354313486720">Pan, 1987</xref>, p. 188). He stresses the transformation from subject to object, but he doesn’t clearly point out that action is also indispensable in the transformation from object to subject.</p>
<p>From “reflex” of stimulus to vivid human “activity,” the meaning of behavior has become richer and more complex. We think “practice,” which is rooted in Marxist practical philosophy, can describe those rich and complex meanings of behavior accurately. “Practice” can reflect not only the influence of human mental and physical factors, but also the influence of natural, social, and cultural factors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0959354313486720">
<title>The structure of practice</title>
<p>Practice is the logical development of “behavior,” it is human creative activity, and it is the sum of all human activities. According to the influence that mind and environment have on practice, we can divide practice into three levels. They are: reflexive practice, cognitive practice, and social and cultural practice (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959354313486720">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0959354313486720-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Reflexive practice mainly refers to the practice related to human physiological motion, which represents the continuity of the human and animal. For example, the “reflex” of Sechenov, Watston, Pavlov, and “respondent behavior” of Skinner, are of this category. This kind of practice is the basic practice whereby humans meet their fundamental needs, and is not controlled by the human mind. Researchers can reduce it to human physiology, and even to physical and chemical changes.</p>
<p>Cognitive practice mainly refers to the practice guided by human cognitive factors, which represents human uniqueness distinguished from animals. This level of practice is controlled by human cognitive factors, and it is human goal-oriented practice. McDougall’s “purposive behavior,” Tolman’s “molar behavior,” Piaget’s “action,” Bandura’s “observational learning behavior,” and behavior in information-processing psychology are all influenced and controlled mainly by the subject’s cognitive factors, which exclude factors like human emotions, will, needs, and life values. Some human behaviors belong to this type, for example the study of science.</p>
<p>Social and cultural practice mainly refers to human practice influenced by social, historical, and cultural factors. Most practices belong to this category, which represents the unique features of every single man and woman. This practice is very closely related to human daily life, which is affected by the individual’s unique physical and social environment, as well as his or her mental factors (including cognitive and non-cognitive factors). “Activity” in Soviet psychology and the “behavior” in such schools of psychology as ecological psychology, community psychology, and environmental psychology are mainly this kind of practice.</p>
<p>From reflexive practice to cognitive practice, and then to social and cultural practice, the connotations become narrower while the denotations become wider. At the same time, their meanings become more complex, and their subjectivities become stronger. Social and cultural practice is first shown in, and based on, cognitive practice; human cognitive factors affect and constrain human practice. Humans’ cognitive practice is in turn based on reflexive practice. Finally, all practice is reflected in human physiological, physical, and chemical changes. Practice is the unity of the three, and it is the research object of psychology. Having understood the structure of practice, we now see that most of the previous studies of behavior have only touched one certain level of practice and have excluded others.</p>

<title>The study of psychology from the practical view: Two examples</title>
<p>From the perspective of practice, we obtain something different from traditional psychology. We are not going to reveal all the revolutionary influences of practice on psychology (in fact, we cannot do so). Here we will choose two examples from our studies to show these influences.</p>
<sec id="section16-0959354313486720">
<title>Example 1: The conflict and unification of two opposing psychologies</title>
<p>In the late 20th century, multiple articles were published discussing the conflict and unification of Western psychology. These held that psychology was in a crisis of fragmentation, and divided it into two opposing camps (or two opposing cultures): a scientist-oriented psychology and a humanism-oriented psychology. The separation of the two camps was mainly examined from four contrasting views: (a) the natural science model vs. the humanistic science model, (b) the method-centered vs. the subject-centered, (c) the value-free vs. the value-loaded, and (d) research vs. application (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959354313486720">Kimble, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959354313486720">Staats, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959354313486720">Ye, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Why would psychology split into two camps? Reasons often given include the separation of guiding principles in psychology, the division of academic organizations, and the dilemmas of mainstream psychology (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959354313486720">Ye, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959354313486720">2000</xref>). But all of these are the reflections of the fragmentation rather than the real reasons. From a practical view, the root reason is that the two opposing psychologies study two opposing kinds of mind and behavior.</p>
<sec id="section17-0959354313486720">
<title>Two opposing kinds of mind</title>
<p>As mentioned above, practice has three levels. Reflexive practice is related to physiological mechanisms, but the other two levels are connected closely with mind. They each correspond to two kinds of mind: mind-to-know-the-world (MKW) and mind-to-change-the-world (MCW). MKW corresponds to cognitive practice, including theories about “what the objective world is” and the mental activities in the process of pursuing those theories. MCW corresponds to social and cultural practice, including theories about “how to change the world” and the mental activities in the process of pursuing those theories. MKW and MCW are opposite to each other mainly in the following three aspects.</p>
<p>First, the two have opposing functions. MKW is to know the natural world; its purpose is to discover the rules of objective things and to get the truth of the objective world. It reflects the subject’s desire to pursue “the truth,” and it resolves the conflict between the subject’s mind and the object. MCW is to know the relationship between subject and object and the relationships among subjects; its purpose is to change the world to meet the subject’s needs. It reflects the subject’s desire to pursue “the good,” and it resolves the conflict between the object and the subject’s need.</p>
<p>Second, their contents are different. The content of MKW mainly concerns “what the objective world is” and “what laws it obeys,” and its activities mainly include the process during which the subject’s mind duplicates and reflects on the object. Sensation, perception, memory and thinking, and so on, all belong to MKW. The content of MCW mainly concerns “what the object means to the subject” and “what the object ought to be.” The activities of MCW mainly includes the process during which the subject creates mental strategies to change the object. Need, motive, interest, value, belief, ability, emotion and will, and so on, all belong to MCW.</p>
<p>Finally, MKW and MCW differ in their specific features. MKW is the process during which the objective world is transformed in the subject’s mind; its content comes from the object, and it is determined by the object. So, MKW is universal, determinate, and obeys certain rules. Unlike MKW, MCW mostly starts from the subject and reflects the subject’s free will. When MCW guides the subject’s behavior, it will be free, situational, dynamic, open, and unpredictable.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s important to state that there is no clear line between MCW and MKW. They are two aspects of the same mental process. MKW is the resource of MCW; its products become MCW’s content directly. MCW guides the subject to change the world, and in the same process MKW develops and changes itself gradually.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0959354313486720">
<title>From two opposing minds to two opposing psychologies</title>
<p>First, scientist-oriented psychology mainly studies MKW. The content of MKW is restrained by the object. MKW is universal, determinate, and obeys certain rules; so it accords to science’s determinism principle. We can use a neurophysiological method to research sensation and perception and use computer simulation techniques to research the process of thinking. In this way MKW accords to science’s reductionism principle. Theoretically, MKW meets the methodological principles that science-oriented psychology needs (e.g., objectivism, elementalism, reductionism, and determinism), and science-oriented psychology can study MKW properly. And, in fact, if we review the history of psychology, we shall find that science-oriented psychology mainly studies MKW (e.g., structural psychology, cognitive psychology).</p>
<p>Second, humanism-oriented psychology mainly studies MCW. The content of MCW reflects the individual’s free will; everybody’s MCW is different and is influenced by the social and cultural environment. MCW closely reflects human particularity, and makes human beings change the world actively, so it can’t be reduced to an animal’s mind or a robot’s intelligence. What’s more, MCW is situational, dynamic, open, and unpredictable, so it must investigate using qualitative methods rather than quantitative methods. All in all, MCW doesn’t have objective universality, nor does it obey the external general law of cause and effect. It can’t be reduced to the “animal” or split into elements, so it should use another approach that is different from scientist-oriented psychology. Humanism-oriented psychology is born when scientist-oriented psychology finds itself in difficulty; it emphasizes holism, subject-centeredness, qualitative methods, and it can study MCW properly. And, in fact, if we review the history of psychology, we do find that humanism-oriented psychology mainly studies MCW.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0959354313486720">
<title>The nature of the two psychologies’ opposition</title>
<p>From our previous exploration, we can find that the opposition of the two camps is rooted in the opposition of mind and behavior on the basis of practice. Scientist-oriented psychology starts from its methodology, and through its method it has found research objects, including MKW, reflexive practice, and cognitive practice. This is not problematic in itself; the difficulty arises from the fact that it takes these objects to be the entire range of objects of psychology and excludes MCW and social and cultural practice. Consequently it has been refuted by humanism-oriented psychology. Having found MCW and social and cultural practice and some proper methods, humanism-oriented psychology criticizes the weakness of scientist-oriented psychology. But it is problematic for the former to deny the latter totally.</p>
<p>No camp can replace the other to unify the whole of psychology. In fact, both study only one aspect or one process of psychology. So, from the perspective of practice, the struggle between the two camps seems to be life-or-death, but actually they are just two aspects of the same dimension, and both are based on Western culture.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0959354313486720">
<title>Unifying psychology on the basis of practice</title>
<p>The hierarchy of practice leads to the fragmentation of the two kinds of mind, and, further, gives rise to the two opposing psychologies. However, practice itself is united. Practice bridges subject and object and generates the real human world. Spirit and matter, thought and existence, and subject and object are unified in the process of practice. So, “practice can build the adequate image of human being, and it is the basis to integrate the whole psychology” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959354313486720">Peng, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The complex nature of practice demands that psychologists study psychology with a tolerant, open, and multivariant attitude. The object of psychology is so complex but, fortunately, every psychologist is unique. Every psychologist studies one aspect of psychology, but, together, they form a united group, which could get nearer to the truth of mind. So, psychologists should seek harmony but not uniformity, agree to disagree, and then the fractured pieces of mind may become a unity in the future.</p>

<sec id="section21-0959354313486720">
<title>Example 2: Promoting psychology’s “practical turn”</title>
<p>From the 1840s, Marxist philosophy has come into being as a “practical turn.” It believes that philosophy should “ascend from earth to heaven.” “We set out from real, active men, and on the basis of their real life-process we demonstrate the development of the ideological reflexes and echoes of this life-process” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959354313486720">Marx &amp; Engels, 1995a</xref>, p. 73). That is to say, philosophy should accept such a way of thinking: knowledge should come from real people’s practice. Just as Marx said, “Where speculation ends—in real life—there real, positive science begins: the representation of the practical activity, of the practical process of development of men” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959354313486720">Marx &amp; Engels, 1995a</xref>, p. 73).</p>
<p>Marxist philosophy’s “practical turn” has influenced the way of thinking in the study of psychology. So we advocate a “practical turn” in psychology: we should change our way of thinking and use practice as the starting point from which to study psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959354313486720">W. D. Yang &amp; Ding, 2007</xref>). Specifically, the “practical turn” in psychology includes the following aspects:</p>
<sec id="section22-0959354313486720">
<title>Mission: From theoretical interest to pragmatic spirit</title>
<p>To some degree, traditional psychologies limit their research subjects to a scope to which their theories and methods can be applied. They are more concerned with their theoretical interests and try to build perfect theoretical systems. Finally, they neglect or abandon the subjects which are not in accordance with their theories and methods, and leave the necessary problems to common-sense psychology. From the view of practice, psychology should admit that practice has priority over theory, so firsthand problems should mainly come from practice but not from the existing theories. Psychological theories come from practice and serve practice, but not the other way around.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0959354313486720">
<title>Research object: From objective or subjective mind to practice-based mind</title>
<p>Some traditional psychologies emphasize the objectivity of mind, regarding it as a purely objective thing that should be observed neutrally and value-free. Other psychologies emphasize the subjectivity of mind, taking mind as free will and ignoring the fact that it is constrained by the objective world in practice. They start from their own standpoint and exclude practice from psychology. Actually, no matter whether as a species or as individuals, people develop and are shaped in the process of practice. Mind is the terminal point for knowing the world and the starting point for changing the world. Mind is so complex that it only shows its adequate image in practice, and so practice is the most essential and closest expression of the human mind.</p>

<title>Methodology: From “method-centered” or “subject-centered” to “object-centered”</title>
<p>Some traditional psychologies insist on a method-centered research strategy, looking for research subjects from within their existing methods. Or they research their subjects using their methods improperly, as if they cut their feet to fit their shoes. Other psychologies hold a subject-centered methodology, trying to choose methods according to the features of the research subject. This seems reasonable, but when we examine their standpoints carefully, we find that their research subjects mainly derive from their theory. That is to say, they both exclude the real problems of practice. In fact, mind in practice is complex and dynamic. Any theory or method works only within a certain scope, under certain conditions, and to a certain degree; it is only an approach or a perspective to research the objects under investigation. So, from the view of practice, what method we should use is not determined by what methods we have, but by what the research object is. We should choose a method according to the object, which is object-centered, but not vice versa.</p>

<title>Theoretical framework: From grand theory to specific theory</title>
<p>Western psychology generally looks for universal laws and grand theories that can be applied to all human minds, concerned that psychology will not be scientific if it doesn’t pursue the universal laws. This is obviously biased. But in the broad area of human practice, there also exist rules that are not general but specific, not inevitable but obedient to the rules of statistics, not applicable to everything but conditional. These rules are more suitable in guiding human practice than universal laws, more likely to solve concrete living problems, more useful for improving individual mental health. Psychology should admit that psychological rules are particular, concrete, and historical; it needs to build some specific theories rather than grand theories to guide human practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0959354313486720">
<title>Evaluation criteria of theory: From logic to practice</title>
<p>The defect of traditional psychology is that it tries to set evaluation criteria and then decides to accept or reject a certain theory in its pre-set theoretical systems. Traditional psychology believes that the theories of psychology are “self-sufficient” and thinks that “theoretical reason” should be superior to “practical reason.” But from the practical view, practice is superior to theory. Every theory of psychology should be tested by practice. If it can pass the examination of practice, it is right and rational. So, we should not only accept theories that come from repeated experiments, but also employ theories gained from different methods. Not only should we respect the theory summarized by practical experience, but we should also value the theory obtained from intuition and introspection. If theories conflict with each other, we should revise them and seek support from practice. In this way, psychological theory will get closer and closer to the truth.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>Chinese psychology has been closely related to Marxist philosophy for a long time, and some scholars even propose building a “psychology with Chinese characteristics” under the guidance of Marxist philosophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959354313486720">Che, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959354313486720">P. L. Chen, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959354313486720">1997</xref>). However, since the late 1990s, psychologists in China have focused their attention on experimental psychology and paid less and less attention to Marxist philosophy. This paper has followed the tradition of the integration of psychology and Marxist philosophy. First it discussed Marxist practical philosophy’s basic viewpoints in China, and then it advocated the introduction of “practice” in psychology. Finally it explored the concept and structure of practice, and presented two studies to illustrate how to study psychology from the practical view.</p>
<p>Perhaps as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959354313486720">Parker (1999)</xref> has said, “Marxism has been yoked to many different kinds of psychology …, and this has sometimes produced more problems than it has solved” (p. 292). This paper is only a first step of a Long March; a lot of problems remain unsolved and even some viewpoints require further discussion. For example: How do we integrate Marxist practical philosophy with psychology? What is “practice” in psychology? How can we study psychology from the “practical view”? How can we evaluate existing psychology? How can we build a new conceptual system of psychology starting from practice? Few of these questions have been clearly answered. This is of course going to be a difficult job, which needs our enduring and persistent hard work.</p>
