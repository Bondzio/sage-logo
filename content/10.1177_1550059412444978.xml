<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Only two decades ago,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059412444978">1</xref>
</sup> the simultaneous application of transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and neuroimaging methods were considered unfeasible. There was a large number of technical issues that had to be addressed before Bohning and colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059412444978">1</xref>
</sup> published the first article investigating TMS-induced blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal modulations. Subsequently, Bestmann et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1550059412444978">2</xref>
</sup> introduced a new paradigm to study the neuroplastic changes induced by the repetitive application of TMS (rTMS). They<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1550059412444978">2</xref>
</sup> demonstrated that rTMS is capable of modulating neuronal activity beyond the actual stimulated area, in their case, the left primary sensorimotor cortex, illustrated by the significant increase in BOLD signal in bilateral lateral premotor cortex (PM) during subthreshold rTMS. Recent experiments employing the technique of continuous arterial spin labeling (CASL, see later) to measure the after-effects of TMS on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) indicated that TMS at the primary motor cortex (M1) induces remarkable alterations in rCBF in both the motor and PM areas.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1550059412444978">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Despite the growing number of studies (for a review, see Bestmann et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1550059412444978">4</xref>
</sup>), the application of the combined TMS-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) approach has remained technically challenging and accordingly has its limitations. An important problem still arises from the diamagnetic property of the TMS coil.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1550059412444978">5</xref>
</sup> Although magnetic resonance (MR)-compatible TMS coils are free of any ferromagnetic particles, they are still capable of causing inhomogeneities in the static magnetic field of the MR scanner, specifically underneath the coil, which results in a partially decreased or, in some cases, a complete signal loss. A second problem is related to a recently recognized leakage from the high-voltage capacitor of TMS stimulator.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1550059412444978">6</xref>
</sup> The residual current deriving from the high-voltage capacitor within the stimulator is still present in the TMS coil even when the stimulator is not being used. This residual current can induce a local disturbance in the magnetic field, which causes geometric distortion (stretching and compressing voxels) in the echo planar images (EPIs), afterward leading to an elevated noise level and even false-positive inferences. Interestingly, the magnitude of signal distortion varies according to the TMS output setup (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 99% of maximum capacity of TMS stimulator, without discharging the coil), indicating that the observed artifacts are highly dependent on the individual experimental design (for a correction method of this problem, see Weiskopf et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1550059412444978">6</xref>
</sup>). A third problem derives from the eddy current generated by TMS pulse, which can abolish all transverse magnetization on one hand and induce fluctuation in the magnetic field for at least 100 ms after coil discharge on the other.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1550059412444978">7</xref>
</sup> Therefore, in order to avoid TMS-generated artifacts which reduce or abolish EPI quality, the precise temporal synchronization of fMRI and TMS pulses is crucial.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1550059412444978">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1550059412444978">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Also, only a limited number of brain areas can be stimulated with TMS in the scanner for technical reasons. Restrictions derive from the physical extent of the TMS coil which has to be placed in the head or body coil. The latter prevents free positioning and direct contact with the TMS coil except for the upper head areas. Therefore, brain areas such as occipital or temporal lobes are relatively understudied<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1550059412444978">8</xref>
</sup> compared with other regions, such as the M1.</p>
<p>These problems do not occur when using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in the scanner. Low-intensity tDCS is an extensively studied noninvasive technique for shaping neuroplasticity in man. Much of the evidence for the neuronal effects of tDCS can be based on physiological studies both in man and in animals. In particular, measuring the amplitude of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) allows easy quantification of excitability changes induced by tDCS, however, only at the M1.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1550059412444978">9</xref>
</sup> Neuroimaging studies have the potential for extending our understanding of the effect of tES with regard to the complex relationship between behavioral data and brain topography beyond the stimulated area. Therefore, the combined, and mainly the concurrent tDCS and fMRI approach (for a schematic illustration, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1550059412444978">Figure 1</xref>), will provide information as to the spatial properties of neuroplastic alterations mediated by tDCS at any other area due to the high quality of spatial resolution of fMRI. Furthermore, it avoids the radiation exposure of the positron emission tomography (PET).<sup>

<p>For many years, tDCS-fMRI studies used such a design, whereby tDCS was applied outside the scanner or inside but without scanning, and therefore only the induced after-effects were able to be studied. This design usually requires recording 2 data sets; a baseline measurement and another one after the application of tDCS. Although these paradigms are informative about the tDCS-related changes in brain activation immediately after stimulation, the online modulatory effects may be different (for the 2 types of experimental procedure, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1550059412444978">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Consecutive Applications</title>
<p>Previous tDCS studies using single-pulse TMS as a measurement technique have demonstrated that anodal stimulation increases cortical excitability and accordingly, enhances the amplitude of TMS evoked MEPs, whereas cathodal stimulation decreases cortical excitability and reduces the size of MEPs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1550059412444978">14</xref>
</sup> Baudewig and colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1550059412444978">13</xref>
</sup> first demonstrated that reduced neuronal excitability following cathodal tDCS was associated with reduced brain activity. In this study, participants received anodal and cathodal tDCS for 5 minutes at 1.0 mA intensity. Either the anode or cathode electrode was placed over the left M1, specifically over the motor–cortical representation of the abductor digiti minimi muscle, whereas the return electrode was placed over the contralateral orbit. BOLD signal changes were acquired before the initiation of tDCS and after the termination of the stimulation at 0 to 5 and 15 to 20 minutes, while participants performed a sequential finger opposition task. Cathodal tDCS resulted in a significant reduction in the BOLD signal in the PM, supplementary motor area (SMA), and ipsilateral M1 but not in the stimulated M1. No significant changes were observed in the anodal condition. This latter negative result may have possibly derived from the design of the experimental paradigm causing a “ceiling effect” in the M1 activation. Accordingly, previous neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that even the movement of a single finger can result in the complete activation of the corresponding hand area,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1550059412444978">15</xref>
</sup> therefore, obscuring the additional activation caused by tDCS. However, in another study, using a different motor paradigm and a longer stimulation duration, anodal tDCS modulated brain activity in a distributed neural network<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1550059412444978">16</xref>
</sup> as was found in the first study after applying cathodal tDCS.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1550059412444978">13</xref>
</sup> Here, participants received either anodal tDCS or sham stimulation at 1.0 mA for 20 minutes over the left M1. The BOLD images were acquired before and after the stimulation intervention while participants were performing grasp–release hand movements at 1 Hz frequency for 21 seconds grasping followed by 21 seconds rest. Anodal tDCS increased BOLD response in the underlying M1 and in the SMA bilaterally and the contralateral PM. The discrepancy between the 2 above-mentioned studies<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1550059412444978">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1550059412444978">16</xref>
</sup> may have arisen due to the different motor paradigms, stimulation durations, and current densities derived from different electrode sizes.</p>
<p>Stagg and coworkers<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1550059412444978">17</xref>
</sup> applied functional connectivity analysis to evaluate tDCS-mediated effects. Healthy participants received anodal, cathodal, and sham stimulation for 10 minutes at 1.0 mA over the left M1 (return electrode over the contralateral supraorbital region) on separate days. Before and after tDCS, participants were engaged in a visual cued serial reaction time task using an alternating design with 30-second periods of movement followed by 30 seconds rest, while fMRI images were acquired in a 3.0-T MR scanner. Compared with sham condition, anodal tDCS led to increased activation in the left M1, SMA, and dorsal PM (PMd), whereas cathodal stimulation was associated with increased activation in the contralateral M1, PMd, and posterior parietal cortex ([PPC]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1550059412444978">Figure 3</xref>). After cathodal stimulation, an increase in the functional connectivity between the left M1 and contralateral M1 and PMd was observed. No change in functional connectivity was found after anodal tDCS.</p>

</fig>
<p>In a parallel attempt, Polanía et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1550059412444978">18</xref>
</sup> introduced a voxel-based approach of graph theory to explore tDCS-mediated changes in functional connectivity. Graph theory is based on the assumption that brain networks can be described as graphs containing nodes and edges (as neurons are connected by axons and dendrites).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1550059412444978">19</xref>
</sup> In the analysis, Polanía et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1550059412444978">18</xref>
</sup> calculated 2 values; the nodal connectivity degree and the minimum path length. The former provides information about the number of connections of each voxel possesses with the other voxels, whereas the latter gives the distance (number of edges) between 2 voxels. In this study, tDCS was delivered over the left M1 for 10 minutes at 1.0 mA current intensity. Before and after the real/sham stimulation, 2 resting-state fMRI data sets were acquired in a 3.0-T MR scanner. According to the results, the nodal connectivity degree increased in 2 regions: left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), whereas the minimum path length decreased in the left somatomotor cortex (SM1). Subsequently, a seed-based functional connectivity analysis was performed to investigate functional changes in these areas with other specific brain regions. Interestingly, tDCS-induced modulations appeared to mimic the activation changes caused by motor task-related modifications such as after motor training. In particular, the seed-based functional connectivity between the left SM1 and motor-related cortical areas (PM and M1) increased, whereas the functional coupling between the left SM1 and contralateral regions decreased. An increased functional connectivity between the right DLPFC and PCC, the region where the reference (cathode) electrode was placed, was also detected. This is further support of a study by Bikson et al,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1550059412444978">20</xref>
</sup> suggesting that the reference electrode may be active and capable of inducing significant changes in cortical excitability.</p>
<p>One important question is whether tDCS over the M1 is capable of affecting remote subcortical areas. This might be crucial for shaping an effective treatment option for patients with progressive basal ganglia degeneration such as Parkinson disease. To further investigate this question, Polanía et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1550059412444978">12</xref>
</sup> investigated the impact of tDCS on the corticostriato-thalamocortical functional circuit. They examined the hypothesis that tDCS over M1 would lead to an altered functional connectivity between striatal and thalamic regions and motor-related cortical regions. Five minutes resting state fMRI data sets were assessed in a 3.0-T MR scanner before and after the application of anodal, cathodal, and sham stimulation. Performing a seed connectivity analysis based on the data from right-handed healthy participants, Polanía and colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1550059412444978">12</xref>
</sup> found that anodal tDCS enhanced the connectivity between the left M1 and the ipsilateral thalamus, left caudate nucleus and superior parietal lobule, and decreased connectivity between caudate nucleus and PCC. Cathodal tDCS, on the other hand, significantly decreased functional connectivity between the left M1 and right putamen, in addition to the right thalamus and left superior frontal gyrus. The uniqueness of this study was to successfully demonstrate that low-intensity tDCS is capable of modulating functional connectivity not only in the neocortex but also in corticostriatal and thalamocortical circuits.</p>
<p>The number of studies using the combination of alternating current stimulation (tACS) and fMRI is limited. Chaieb et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1550059412444978">21</xref>
</sup> investigated the effect of transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS), a novel tES method applying alternating current using a frequency spectrum of 0.1 to 640 Hz over the region of interest. Participants received real tRNS over the M1 and sham stimulation for 4 minutes before image acquisition in a counterbalanced order. During MR acquisition, participants performed a visual-guided finger tapping (ft) task at 1 Hz frequency in an alternating fashion (17 seconds ft to 17 seconds rest; repeated for 5 times). During finger movements, the previously applied tRNS significantly decreased BOLD signal intensity in the underlying stimulated area, as well as in the PM and SMA, compared with the sham condition. The results were surprising because previous studies demonstrated excitability increases after the application of 10 minutes of tRNS over the left M1.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1550059412444978">22</xref>
</sup> The reason for this remarkable difference is a matter of debate, but it was proposed by the authors that different stimulation duration (4 vs 10 minutes) might alter cortical excitability differently. Importantly, a further study by Chaieb et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1550059412444978">23</xref>
</sup> is in accordance with this line of argument since it was found that the after-effect of tRNS at 1.0 mA, at least with regard to the after-effect on MEP amplitudes, was remarkably stimulation duration dependent. Intriguingly, only 5 and 6 minutes of stimulation elevated MEPs significantly (up to 10 minutes), however, 4 minutes of tRNS caused no changes in cortical excitability. Nevertheless, the after-effects of tRNS on MEPs and on BOLD responses might also be different.</p>

<title>Concurrent Applications</title>
<p>The investigation of BOLD changes induced by tDCS during stimulation has been made possible by technical developments, which include evading electrode-related artifacts during image acquisition, as well as tackling the risk caused by the potential heating of the wires.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1550059412444978">11</xref>
</sup> The first concurrent tDCS-fMRI study applied anodal tDCS at 1.0 mA intensity over the central knob of the left M1 with the reference electrode over the contralateral supraorbital area.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1550059412444978">24</xref>
</sup> The fMRI paradigm consisted of 3 sessions, each session started with a resting baseline of 21 seconds, followed by a 21-second tDCS repeated 4 times resulting in a “resting-tDCS-tDCS-tDCS-tDCS” design. Data from healthy individuals showed that only after the fourth train of tDCS, an activation of the left M1, the ipsilateral SMA, and the contralateral right PPC can be seen. One of the most prominent limitations of this study was the absence of cathodal and more importantly, sham stimulation, making the generalization of the obtained result difficult.</p>
<p>Antal and colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1550059412444978">11</xref>
</sup> used a different paradigm, applying tDCS stimulation for only 20 seconds, and no stimulation for 20 seconds, in an alternating fashion block design. Thus, the online effects of both anodal and cathodal tDCS during rest and performance of a motor task (finger tapping) could be compared. According to the volume of interest (VOI) analysis, anodal tDCS during the finger-tapping task led to a significant decrease in BOLD signal in SMA. In the case of cathodal tDCS, no significant changes were observed, only a tendency toward a decreased activation in the SMA. The moderate changes in BOLD signal during tDCS, compared with MEP measurements, may be linked to distinct physiological mechanisms. More importantly, the relatively short stimulation duration during BOLD measurements may reveal smaller effects than those of the longer stimulation durations in MEP studies. Also, the VOI analysis might not be the best method to detect local and remote effects of tDCS. The decrease in BOLD signal during anodal tDCS is in line with a previous neurophysiological article by Antal et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1550059412444978">25</xref>
</sup> in which it was found that tDCS-mediated after-effect was highly dependent on the state (resting vs active) of the participants, revealed by reduced amplitude of MEPs after concurrent application of a motor task (ball compression movements), both for anodal and for cathodal tDCS.</p>
<p>Employing a longer stimulation duration, compared with those used by Antal and colleagues,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1550059412444978">11</xref>
</sup> the study by Kwon and Jang<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1550059412444978">26</xref>
</sup> revealed increased activation following anodal tDCS. The paradigm consisted of 2 conditions. In condition A, (1) sham tDCS motor phase, (2) resting phase, and (3) real tDCS motor phase were implemented, whereas in condition B, (1) real tDCS motor phase, (2) resting phase, and (3) sham tDCS motor phase during scanning were applied in this order. In both motor phases, approximately 2 minutes of motor action (metronome guided grasping and resting at 1 Hz) were performed before the initiation of the stimulation, which was either an anodal tDCS (for 2 minutes at 1.0 mA) or sham. BOLD signals (in a 1.5 T scanner) were measured both during real and sham stimulation. In this study, a significant increase in voxel count and peak BOLD intensity, within the range of interest (SM1, M1, SMA, and PM), was observed during anodal tDCS when compared with sham. The reason for the apparent difference between the results of Antal et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1550059412444978">11</xref>
</sup> is most likely the different stimulation durations and motor tasks.</p>
<sec id="section5-1550059412444978">
<title>Stimulation of Nonmotor Areas</title>
<p>Only 3 articles investigated the neural activity changes related to non-motor tDCS in the scanner. Keeser and colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1550059412444978">27</xref>
</sup> examined the hypothesis that frontal tDCS-induced changes might be detectable during functional connectivity analysis in resting state networks. In a double-blind, randomized study, participants received real (2.0 mA, over the F3, the reference electrode over the F4) and sham stimulation for 20 minutes. Before and after the real/sham stimulation, participants underwent a resting state scanning for ∼5 minutes. Data from independent component analysis revealed that prefrontal tDCS alters functional connectivity in the resting-state network by specifically modulating frontal and frontoparietal regions. An important recent advance has been made by Holland and colleagues<sup>

</sup> who examined whether anodal tDCS, at 2.0 mA for 20 minutes over the left inferior frontal cortex (IFC), might result in an improved picture-naming performance. In line with the generally accepted linguistic role of Broca's area, faster picture-naming performance of healthy participants was observed after anodal tDCS, which was correlated with decreased BOLD signal in the IFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1550059412444978">Figure 4</xref>). This decrease, instead of an expected increase according to the classical MEP experiments,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1550059412444978">14</xref>
</sup> reflected the data seen by Antal et al<sup>

Twenty healthy participants received anodal tDCS at 1 mA (reference electrode over contralateral supraorbital region) and sham stimulation while acquiring resting-state fMRI, and subsequently performing a semantic fluency task (word generation according to 6 semantic categories, eg, hobby). Importantly, the stimulation duration was not predetermined but lasted until the end of performing the task, the average duration was 10.4 minutes. Compared with the sham condition, during anodal tDCS, participants produced significantly more words, which was also accompanied by reduced activity in the left ventral IFG, similarly to the findings of Holland et al.<sup>

<title>The Combined tDCS-MR Spectroscopy Approach</title>
<p>Many MEP studies have explored pharmacological aspects underlying plasticity changes following tDCS, starting with data on glutamatergic and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic signaling.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1550059412444978">30</xref>
</sup> The role of GABA and glutamate in tDCS-shaped neuroplastic changes is further supported by the investigation of Stagg et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1550059412444978">31</xref>
</sup> using MR spectroscopy (MRS). MRS is an ideal method for providing additional information about brain metabolism and neurotransmitters under tDCS. Applying anodal, cathodal, and sham tDCS over the left M1, proton MRS (<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059412444978">1</xref>
</sup>H-MRS) data obtained in a 3.0-T MR scanner revealed that relative to sham tDCS, anodal stimulation led to a significant decrease in GABA concentration without any change in combined glutamate and glutamine (Glx) concentration; whereas with cathodal stimulation both the Glx and the GABA concentration decreased. Stagg and colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1550059412444978">31</xref>
</sup> performed a further experiment to confirm that the Glx-level change, found only after cathodal tDCS, specifically related to glutamate decrease. In this additional experiment, they proved their initial hypothesis using a 7.0-T scanner. This field strength is able to reliably separate glutamate and Glx. The results show a decrease in glutamate concentration, leaving the Glx level unchanged.</p>
<p>Clark et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1550059412444978">32</xref>
</sup> also used <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059412444978">1</xref>
</sup>H-MRS to investigate spatial changes in brain neurotransmitter concentration. Participants received 2.0 mA anodal tDCS for 30 minutes over the right parietal cortex during rest. In contrast to the results reported by Stagg et al,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1550059412444978">31</xref>
</sup> after 30 minutes of anodal tDCS, a significant increase in Glx, <italic>N</italic>-acetylaspartate, and <italic>N</italic>-acetylaspartylglutamate (tNAA) was found beneath the anodal electrode, and more interestingly, a non-significant (<italic>P</italic> = .074) inverse pattern for tNAA concentration was observed for the contralateral hemisphere. Although the specific role of tNAA is not entirely understood, it has been proposed that it might be involved in neuronal energy regulation. It has to be noted that prolonged stimulation either by theta burst (Gamboa et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1550059412444978">33</xref>
</sup>), a patterned form of rTMS, or by anodal tDCS may reverse classical excitatory or inhibitory effects (according to an unpublished study in our laboratory), with possible consequences for MRS results.</p>
<p>Another line of information indicates that tDCS can result in altered energy consumption within the cortex.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1550059412444978">34</xref>
</sup> Energy consumption was increased by initiating a complex mechanism with tDCS causing a transient dip in ATP effecting hypothalamic K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activation which eventually elevated systemic glucose uptake in humans. The authors used<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1550059412444978">31</xref>
</sup> phosphorus MRS (<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1550059412444978">31</xref>
</sup>P-MRS) in order to examine the glucose homeostasis-related altered energy consumption following 20 minutes of 1.0 mA anodal tDCS. Glucose uptake was assessed by the use of hyperinsulinemic–euglycemic clamp. Neurohormonal measurements associated with the capacity to modify glucose uptake were also completed. Anodal tDCS caused an initial decrease in glucose uptake lasting for approximately 30 minutes, which reversed and reached its maximum 200 minutes poststimulation and ended 240 minutes after the onset of stimulation. By measuring high-energy phosphates, such as phosphocreatine/inorganic phosphate (PCr/Pi) ratio and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)/Pi ratio indicating intracellular energy status, the authors found that the temporal changes in both PCr/Pi and ATP/Pi functionally mirrored the changes assessed by glucose uptake with a significant long-lasting increase after a short-term initial drop. Moreover, the level of cortisol as a neuroendocrine indicator of systemic glucose metabolism was decreased.</p>
<p>Besides the changing levels of energy consumption, tDCS induces measurable alterations in rCBF. By measuring rCBF using PET after tDCS, it was found that anodal and cathodal tDCS of 1 mA intensity over the left M1 for 10 minutes induced widespread increases and decreases in rCBF in the left M1, right frontal pole, and right SM1, when compared with sham tDCS at rest (Lang et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1550059412444978">10</xref>
</sup>). These changes in rCBF remained stable throughout the 50-minute period of PET scanning. In a recent PET study, Paquette et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1550059412444978">35</xref>
</sup> investigated the effect of tDCS at 2.0 mA during rest and during a finger-tapping task for the dominant and the nondominant hand in a repeated-measured design. The tDCS was delivered bilaterally and the electrodes were placed over the motor–cortical representation of the first dorsal interosseus FDI muscle (anodal electrode over dominant and cathodal electrode over the nondominant side). Compared with sham, the concurrent application of motor movement and tDCS led to decreased rCBF on the cathodal side only but not on the anodal side and, more interestingly, no effect of stimulation on rCBF was found during rest. In another session, at least 1 week from the PET measurement, the TMS-evoked MEPs were also measured after applying the same experimental procedure, and the authors found a similar pattern of stimulation-related effects (ie, a significant decrease in average MEP size on the cathodal side only). Accordingly, only the concurrent application of tDCS and active motor condition resulted in observable changes in both ongoing rCBF measurements (measured for 60 seconds) and MEPs.</p>
<p>Zheng et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1550059412444978">36</xref>
</sup> have used Arterial Spin Labelling (ASL), an imaging technique which also possesses the potential to provide reliable measures regarding rCBF changes. Participants took part in anodal and cathodal stimulation delivered over the C4 position at different intensities (0.8-2.0 mA) in an interleaved “tDCS-off (10 minutes) tDCS-on (∼7 minutes)” paradigm, while acquiring ASL images in a 3.0-T MR scanner. Both anodal and cathodal tDCS resulted in a significant increase in rCBF under the electrode, with anodal tDCS causing an increase 3 times higher than cathodal tDCS. In the tDCS-off period, anodal stimulation led to a slight increase after the second tDCS-off period, whereas cathodal resulted in an inverse pattern in rCBF. The tDCS-induced rCBF changes were observable in a widespread network, specifically involving contralateral motor-related cortical areas. This is in agreement with previous fMRI studies that found altered BOLD signal in local and remote brain regions<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1550059412444978">13</xref>

</sup>; however, contrary to earlier articles, in this study, participants did not perform any motor tasks. Authors also found a significant effect of intensity since in the case of anodal stimulation there was a significant positive correlation between the current strength and the increase in rCBF when the stimulation was turned on. In cathodal cases, there was only a nonsignificant negative relationship, suggesting that higher current intensity was associated with a smaller increase in rCBF.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>By reviewing recent scientific findings, we have seen that tDCS can induce a widespread alteration in brain activity far beyond the stimulation site, accompanied by changes in CBF, in some neurotransmitters and metabolic activity. However, stimulation duration, the applied current intensity/density, behavioral paradigm, and state of the participants (ie, resting or motor task) varied remarkably in the reviewed studies. Therefore, in future investigations, the systematic manipulation of the relevant stimulation parameters, such as has been done in more than 100 MEP studies,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1550059412444978">9</xref>
</sup> will be crucial. Furthermore, there are several technical and methodological issues that still have to be resolved in upcoming studies.</p>
<p>One of the main questions with regard to further investigations is whether the tDCS-induced after-effects can be differentiated between relatively short (∼5-10 minutes) and prolonged (∼20-30 minutes) stimulation lengths.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1550059412444978">37</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1550059412444978"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1550059412444978">39</xref>
</sup> Previously, it was thought that a linear relationship existed between the durations of stimulation and the related after-effects: the longer the stimulation, the longer and more pronounced the observable polarity-specific after-effects. Interestingly, a recent experiment revealed that the application of continuous anodal tDCS for 26 minutes resulted in inhibition of MEP amplitudes (an unpublished study performed in our laboratory). In another study, the prolonged application of cathodal stimulation did not show an inverse pattern<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1550059412444978">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1550059412444978">39</xref>
</sup>. However, the total stimulation duration of 18 minutes may have been too short. Nevertheless, it is unclear to which extent the MEP “biomarker” may be transferred to imaging or behavioral results. For example, when the effects of 2.0 mA anodal tDCS, delivered for 30 minutes over the IFC/parietal cortex,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1550059412444978">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1550059412444978">40</xref>
</sup>were studied using an object-learning task in a virtual reality environment, tDCS resulted in a significant facilitatory effect on learning, in line with the study by Holland and coworkers<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1550059412444978">28</xref>
</sup> who also found improved language performance after prolonged anodal stimulation.</p>
<p>There is reasonable evidence, from studies investigating several aspects of human cognition following tDCS, that anodal stimulation improves while cathodal generally decreases performance; however, recent literature suggests the effects of tDCS on cognition are also far more complex.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1550059412444978">41</xref>
</sup> Complementary findings are that some tasks, for example, benefit only from cathodal and not from anodal stimulation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1550059412444978">42</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1550059412444978"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1550059412444978">44</xref>
</sup> A recent study by Ambrus et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1550059412444978">45</xref>
</sup> has even shown that anodal stimulation deteriorates implicit categorization. Therefore, it has been proposed that anodal/cathodal tDCS-induced neural excitability changes could be optimal or suboptimal depending on the applied paradigm. Importantly, Dockery et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1550059412444978">41</xref>
</sup> showed that there is an additional factor, the temporal dependency of the induced effects, which should be taken into consideration. It has been proposed by the authors that cathodal stimulation, by reducing neuronal excitability, might be beneficial in the early stages of learning, whereas anodal stimulation resulting in an increased excitability enhances performance at later stage, when participants almost acquired the task (Tower of London Test).</p>
<p>A challenge for future research will be the development of the concurrent tACS-fMRI approach. tACS is a younger technique than tDCS and probably differs in the mechanism of action.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1550059412444978">46</xref>
</sup> For example,  Moliadze et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1550059412444978">47</xref>
</sup> found that 140 Hz tACS at different intensities specifically involves inhibitory (0.4 mA) or excitatory (1.0 mA) neuroplastic processes that were not observed by applications of tDCS. Chaieb et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1550059412444978">48</xref>
</sup> stimulated<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1550059412444978">43</xref>
</sup> the M1 using tACS frequencies of 1, 2, and 5 kHz; 5 kHz generated the most prominent neuroplastic changes.</p>
<p>In summary, the concurrent tDCS-fMRI approach provides a unique insight into the temporal and spatial properties of tES-induced complex processes at the metabolic and neurophysiological levels, as well as at the level of neural system dynamics. Progress has been made in our understanding of the local and large-scale effects induced by tDCS, and this progression is expected to further continue by developing novel approaches measuring, for example, behavioral data during the concurrent tDCS-fMRI application.</p>
