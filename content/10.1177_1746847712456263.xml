<abstract>
<p>Compositing multiple plates into a single image creates challenges for lighting, grading and editing, while the distinct methods of each produces aesthetic challenges in creating apparently coherent space. The challenge is all the greater because digital screens and projectors afford only a strictly limited form of display, and the codecs associated with them share features that force these constructions of space to conform to the Cartesian grid of two-dimensional geometry. <italic>Avatar</italic> (James Cameron, 2009) attempts to build a coherent diegesis but fails because of these issues, which are redoubled in other technical domains, notably motion capture, and in the narrative. Nonetheless, ideological readings can only provide a negative response: careful analysis reveals utopian possibilities in composited live action and animated spectacle that need also to be included in the critical armoury.</p>

<p>I don’t know how humanity stands it</p>
<p>with a painted paradise at the end of it</p>
<p>without a painted paradise at the end of it.</p>
<p>(Ezra Pound, Canto LXXIV: 463)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Pound’s lines on paradise come from the <italic>Pisan Cantos</italic>, written while he was imprisoned in a military camp at the end of World War Two, contemplating suicide while stealing from his memories the shards of a <italic>Paradiso</italic> in echo of Dante’s. Released in the wake of the financial meltdown of 2009, <italic>Avatar</italic> (James Cameron, 2009) is in many respects a painted paradise. The ambivalence of that standing is apparent in media reports of ‘<italic>Avatar</italic> blues’, stemming from CNN. A typical response quoted there comes from a 17-year-old student games designer:<disp-quote>
<p>One can say my depression was twofold: I was depressed because I really wanted to live in Pandora, which seemed like such a perfect place, but I was also depressed and disgusted with the sight of our world, what we have done to Earth. I so much wanted to escape reality. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1746847712456263">Piazza, 2010</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We should consider these thoughts in a number of aspects. A number of colleagues involved in eco-critical film studies report that many students respond far more positively to <italic>Avatar</italic> than to art house films like Terrence Malick’s <italic>The Tree of Life</italic> (2011) or documentaries like <italic>An Inconvenient Truth</italic> (Davis Guggenheim, 2006). The ideal of a life lived in harmony with nature seems to have a specifically utopian appeal. For some, no doubt, the film kindled activist sentiments rather than apathy and depression. But for the young man cited by CNN, it brought a desire ‘to escape reality’, which is also a meaning of the word ‘utopian’ when used derogatorily, as perhaps most famously in Friedrich Engels’ widely-read analysis of <italic>Socialism: Utopian and Scientific</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1746847712456263">1975</xref>), which castigates early socialist dreams of harmony and justice, contrasting them with the demands of political economy and party discipline.</p>
<p>Ernst Bloch, the great philosopher of utopia, in an attempt to rescue the utopian impulse for socialism, rewrote the distinction between Engels’ categories of utopianism as wish-fulfilment and concrete utopia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1746847712456263">Bloch, 1986</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1746847712456263">Douglas Kellner (2010)</xref> emphasizes, Bloch sees ideology as a function that not only mystifies and obscures but also contains a residue of longing for a better tomorrow. Wishful thinking is as integral to utopianism as the strategic analyses of revolutionaries: it is evidence of a profound longing for another way of living. The risk of course is that where that longing – and the fantasies to which it gives rise – seem unobtainable, as they clearly did to the <italic>Avatar</italic> fan in the CNN report, the spirit sinks and falls into despondency.</p>
<p>Bloch’s monumental account of the utopian impulse, <italic>The Principle of Hope</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1746847712456263">1986</xref>), additionally makes clear that utopia has a history. This article pursues the idea that in the early 21st century, as it is expressed in James Cameron’s fantasy of the planet Pandora, the specific new form taken by the utopian impulse responds to a new configuration in our relations with our environment, and that this new form is apparent not only in the narrative but in the formal properties of his film. Bloch is clear that, although the yearning for a better world is a universal trait in human history, it is expressed differently over time. Animated films, I believe, have a privileged position in this history of utopian longing, not because they are severed from reality (they are not) but because they have a unique opportunity to emphasize the potential over the actual. Since their earliest days, animations have expressed in thousands of forms a yearning for beauty, innocence, harmony, anarchy, sexual liberation, peace or reunion with the world: all forms of utopian imaging, from the Edenic forest of Winsor MacKay’s <italic>The Centaurs</italic> (1921) to the autonomous zone of Toontown in <italic>Who Killed Roger Rabbit?</italic> (Robert Zemeckis, 1988). In many respects, the release from photographic realism entices animators towards imagining forms of life that do not depend upon the banality and oppression of the quotidian. Without denying the equal lure of dystopian imaginings, in the CGI technologies and the technological dreams of <italic>Avatar</italic> we can trace a new evolution of these animated paradises, and a new twist on the dialectics of illusions and picturings of a better way of life.</p>
<p>Commenting on <italic>Avatar</italic> in an earlier essay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1746847712456263">Cubitt, 2010</xref>), I argued that the film’s 3D aesthetic only worked if audiences conformed to the privileged organization of sight produced in the discrete layers of the composite image. Only by focusing on the ‘correct’, foreground elements of any scene can viewers avoid eyestrain, so duplicating the enforced focus attacked by André <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1746847712456263">Bazin (1971)</xref> in the classical cinema. The effect is enhanced by the application of ‘global light’, the automated system that organizes the virtual illumination of the scene so that all its elements are lit from a common source (or set of sources). A side effect of this is that the separate layers, especially those derived photographically, tend to flatten as the ambient light of the source element (or ‘plate’) is cancelled out by the addition of digital light. This, however, brings about a sense of incoherence: the layers which were intended to generate a believable spatial orientation and continuity among fore-, mid- and backgrounds instead produce schisms between them. The art of compositing (and of digital grading, the process of matching colour and light in discrete scenes and in the plates comprising a single shot) is to smooth the transitions between planes, to create the illusion of a continuous space. The 3D IMAX version of <italic>Avatar</italic> does not live up to that claim: the diegetic space is interrupted by apparent gaps between focal planes that are still traceable in many scenes viewed on standard screens.</p>
<p>The first 3D thrill comes when Jake (Sam Worthington) emerges from the tube where he has been in cryo-sleep into the vast blue-lit internal chamber of the spaceship carrying him to Pandora, one of the best realizations of depth in the film. There are fewer technical challenges for the deep space external shots of the spaceship approaching the planet: we expect there to be disjuncture, and the emptiness between foreground spaceships and background planets is therefore fully explicable in the diegesis. When Jake records his first log entry, the data to top and lower left pull the virtual screen of the diegetic computer forward of the actual screen in the cinema: here too the disjuncture is motivated by the action. But in this scene we also for the first time confront the artifice of screens within screens, a constant motif throughout the film, and one that echoes the spatial discontinuities of the 3D CGI. We are not here debating, as Bazin did, the truth of cinema to a pro- or pre- cinematic reality, nor the utopian prospect of their mutual evolution, which fired Bazin’s criticism. We are discussing the creation, in cinema, of believable diegetic worlds, however fabulous. In many films, especially in recent years, the imaginary worlds presented are at least as important as the stories they tell, be it Gotham City or the criminal underworld of <italic>GoodFellas</italic> (Martin Scorsese, 1990). Construction in depth is an integral part of the design of worlds for cinema, and the coherence of elements, pro-filmic locations (especially as they are explored through Steadicam and constant reframing, as in <italic>GoodFellas</italic>), or staged sets and composited frames as in the <italic>Batman</italic> cycle, starting with Tim Burton’s 1989 version, is a formative principle. What <italic>Avatar</italic> reveals, however, through its adoption of planar 3D, is that while the photo-realist image can make some claim to coherence (albeit a complex one), the animated image is of another kind.</p>
<p>In addition to the practice of compositing in layers, there are a number of reasons for this. The progressive or interlaced scan of web-streamed and televisual presentations respectively introduce the dimension of time into the single frame (prior, even, to the encoding of vector graphics as bitmaps and their subsequent parsing in compression–decompression algorithms). The coherent here-and-now of the image as image is interrupted by its incompleteness at any given moment. Moreover, as art critic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1746847712456263">Boris Groys (2008</xref>: 87) notes, video content circulates in multiple formats and social contexts. The result of these disturbances in the integrity of the image is unexpected:<disp-quote>
<p>Digitalization, that is, the writing of the image, helps the image become reproducible, to circulate freely, to distribute itself. It is therefore the medicine that cures the image of its inherent passivity. But at the same time, the digitalized image becomes even more infected with non-identity – with the necessity of presenting the image as dissimilar to itself, which means that supplementary curing of the image – its curating – becomes unavoidable.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At the centre of this is the non-identity of the (digital) image.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1746847712456263">1</xref></sup> Groys argues that the original of digital imagery is always code, and therefore invisible, so that every presentation is in effect an active performance of the code, much as a theatrical performance is of a script. The price of the active image is not only that it is never the same twice, but that it is inherently not self-similar, because the code and the image are of different orders. In our instance, this suggests that the separation of layers of diegetic space in <italic>Avatar</italic> ‘performs’ the insecurity of the multiply composite imagery, which in turn derives from different sets of code ‘originals’. The task of post-production, in Groys’ terms (he is speaking in the main of digital video art), is to cure, or cur(at)e, this incoherence. The task is all the harder when, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1746847712456263">Charles Acland (2011)</xref> points out, due to the multiple format release of extended editions and deleted scenes, ‘<italic>Avatar</italic> is not a single finished film with defined boundaries.’</p>
<p>But if we are to pursue the utopian dimension in CGI animation, we need also to recognize that breaking coherence, presenting the non-identity of the image, is not necessarily or only a sign of failure. It is in the interstices between layers that the imagination is freed to explore Pandora as a possible world: to think, even briefly, against Leibniz, that not our Earth but Pandora is ‘the best of all possible worlds’. The narrative of the film exists to organize this yearning for another, better place around the individual redemption of Jake. It is, as many commentators have noted, profoundly sentimental, not least in its resolution of the challenge of disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1746847712456263">Peterson et al., 2010</xref>), a challenge redoubled by electing to cast an able-bodied actor in the disabled role, a double lie that the plot must reconcile by giving the fictional Jake a new body better than that which the military promised to supply. Animation does not share this need to reconcile opposites, as almost any Donald Duck cartoon demonstrates. There remains in animation the possibility that the tear in the heart, the fault in reality, the rifts in the social are not reconcilable, but equally that worlds can be generated in which those features operate differently. Narration seeks to draw everything into a satisfactory unity, much as spectacle traditionally seeks to create a unified totality. (The relation between story and vision is central to film theory, from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1746847712456263">Mulvey’s, 1975</xref>, distinction between voyeurism and fetishism to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1746847712456263">Ndalianis’, 2004</xref>, account of the neo-baroque; crucial in <italic>Avatar</italic> is the production of unity between them.) Offering itself as a paradigm of the cinematic experience as narrative identification and spectacular immersion, <italic>Avatar</italic> also incorporates the interactive dream of video games, a world that is not only more controllable but open to reconciliation of a narrative kind. Victory, peace and rebirth are possible, fictively. But the trick is revealed in the irresistible fact that a film (or a game) must at some point end.</p>
<p>By offering a narrative resolution, <italic>Avatar</italic> enacts a utopia of wish-fulfilment. In this sense, Groys’ idea of curation is functionally carried through by narration – a cure on the literary model of Freud’s case histories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1746847712456263">Bernheimer and Kahane, 1985</xref>), except that Freud is very clear that he is describing structural and systemic transformations, even though he recounts them in a manner deriving equally from late 19th-century novels and medical discourse. The long struggle to escape the formal clutches of narrative is thus not only a matter of ideological critique, as in 1970s <italic>Screen</italic> theory, but a longer-term struggle over aesthetics. For narrative, humans perceive time as the basis of relations. Objectively, and in the privileged form of animation, however, relations are the basis of time. The non-identity of the animated image is just such a relation, one that interferes in the very struggle to exist, and therefore one that is impossible for self-identical existents.</p>
<p>In classical ontology, that which exists is definitionally identical to itself. This is the meaning of the fundamental axiom of logic, A = A, as it is of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1746847712456263">Wittgenstein’s (1961</xref>: 1) thesis that ‘The world is all that is the case.’ For Bloch, however, what is important about any situation is what is not the case, or more specifically what is not yet the case. The ontological position emphasizes the actual: a situation that exists is a concentration of all of its pasts into a concrete existent. Bloch emphasizes the virtual: a situation is pregnant with the myriad possible outcomes of its evolution. Though at least one possible worlds theorist has argued that logical possibility implies the actual existence of alternative worlds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1746847712456263">Lewis, 1986</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1746847712456263">Buckland, 1999</xref>), this misses the critical power of the virtual hypothesis: not that things might exist otherwise elsewhere, but that this world might itself become other than it is. Bifo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1746847712456263">Franco Berardi, 2009</xref>: 7) expresses the political aspects of virtuality thus:<disp-quote>
<p>At any given moment different paths open up in front of us, and we are continually presented with the alternative of going here or going there. Then we decide, we cut out from a set of infinite possibilities and choose a single path. But do we really choose …? The more the network of possibilities thickens, thanks to globalization, network technologies and social and territorial mobility, the more we find ourselves trapped by the automatisms that rule individual choices: technological, financial and psychic automatisms transform the multitude into a swarm.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Bifo goes on to argue that all is not lost: ‘cognitive labour is starting to see itself as a cognitariat, building institutions of knowledge, of creation, of care, of invention and of education that are autonomous from capital’ (p. 81). But in the interim he is able to analyse from the actual situation its virtual outcomes, negative and positive. These deeply differing potentialities are integral to the existing state of affairs, which, therefore, cannot be said to be self-identical. It is just this non-identity, which emerges as future (and therefore as time) from current structural relations between forces that inhabit the ostensibly seamless whole of spectacular entertainment, and which the flaws in <italic>Avatar</italic>’s compositing make apparent. Groys is both wrong and right: under existing circumstances, there is no cure for rifts in reality and its picturing, nor indeed for the rifts that emerge in the utopian daydream, except for a narrative resolution whose character as wish-fulfilment is all too obvious, and which betrays the dream by forcing it to come to a conclusion. Plans for two sequels to <italic>Avatar</italic> should, then, be understood less as cynical profiteering, and more as continuations of the extended and expanded release pattern of the home video versions of the film, as attempts to patch back together the remaindered problems of the narrative and the formal aesthetic, and to resolve, or at least defer, the incipient disappointment of concluding.</p>
<p>It is in the nature of utopia that not only does it have no content, but that as a result it cannot ever be complete. In their late conversation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1746847712456263">Bloch (1988)</xref> and his long-term critic Theodor Adorno agreed that to ascribe content to utopia would be to define it, to carry the premises of the present into the future and so deny the radical difference from the present which defines the future as future. Thus we must also appreciate the power of the wish-fulfilling daydream to produce impossible images of futures that will never come to pass, futures which are not only untrue in this world but impossible in any (like Garrison Keillor’s Lake Woebegone, where ‘all the children are above average’). Such was the function, according to Bloch, of mediaeval fantasies of the Land of Cockaigne where cooked chickens roosted in trees and the streams ran with wine. Such too might be the implication that Bifo’s ‘cognitariat’ (the class of networked knowledge workers) offers a mirror to the ‘precariat’, the casualized, migratory labour force demanded by ‘flexible’, post-Fordist capital. By ascribing the self-motivation of the cognitariat to the dispossessed precariat, and in return for the precariat’s anger and political motivation as drivers of the cognitariat revolution, Bifo is able to offer to his fellow post-autonomists a real-world model for a new proletariat, no longer subject to work discipline, but nomadic, work-averse (in a positive sense) and infinitely creative of survival strategies. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1746847712456263">Anna Mitropoulos (2005)</xref> observes, the conditions of these two new classes of ‘precarious’ workers are fundamentally different, leading her to ask ‘to what extent do the performative imperatives of artistic–cultural exploitation (visibility, recognition, authorship) foreclose the option of clandestinity, which remains an imperative for the survival of many undocumented migrants and workers in the informal economy?’</p>
<p>Jake is presented as such a nomadic subject, drifting through an accident of DNA into a world divided by loyalties to the military (which hides its mercenary relation to profit) and science (which hides its allegiance to the Na’vi). Fooled into believing he is an ambassador before realizing he has become an informer, Jake opts at first to act clandestinely towards the scientists, and later towards the military, until he chooses to abandon both science and the marines. His aim is no longer to inhabit the body of a Na’vi but to become one, another form of clandestinity, the clandestinity of the migrant worker who slips under the surveillance networks designed to keep him or her out or under. He elects to adopt a home, one that provides him with the love and status that his position as ignorant grunt denies him in the human universe as portrayed in the earlier part of the film. He is in this sense an escapee from the precariat who finds a way, via the cognitariat, to become truly tribal. This utopian passage has a price, however: to accomplish his transition, he has to abandon his body, a process only partially leavened by ascribing to his character a broken spine.</p>
<p>This is a process echoed not only in the basic narrative premise of <italic>Avatar</italic> but in its making. In interview with <italic>30 Ninjas</italic>, John Bruno, visual effects supervisor for the film, describes one part of production:<disp-quote>
<p>The motion capture system was basically people wearing suits with little reflective patches on it, but they had done something different here that I’d never seen, which is that a <italic>real time</italic> facial capture system was developed. What you were seeing – what the actors were doing – was instantly being interpolated and matched to an avatar or a character and played back [on monitors] in real time. It was still pretty rough – it was sort of a live action template … They’re acting on an empty stage, but what you’re seeing on the monitors around you and what Jim’s seeing on his virtual system is the composited real time image. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1746847712456263">Gill, 2009</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Acknowledging that the editors still had a lot of refining to do, this advance in animatics makes a significant change to previous motion-capture technologies in delivering not only real-time mappings, including the extremely challenging complexities of facial muscles, but also those features already composited with other elements and stored in the workflow system. The becoming-other that crowns the narrative is in operation in its technical base at the moment of filming. Actors in suits, already to that extent in disguise, are the objects of a process that produces not photographic but data visualizations of their actions, mapped as relations between points moving in time through the stage. The visualization gives more than a base organization of the characters in relation to the other plates of the composite, as Bruno goes on to explain: the stage is itself a 3D capture zone, so that the virtual camera, whose images play back on monitors around it, can itself be moved during capture, not only to record the spatial relations between characters, but their relation to the plates comprising the background. Real-time playback gives more than wireframe; it can provide on-the-fly texture maps and colour, effectively placing the suited actors in the presence of their filmic avatars, avatars whose movements they are responsible for performing. This does suggest that Groys may be wrong, and that the ‘originals’ of digital images need not be code, but may in fact be the actions of human agents, just as pro-filmic as the actors standing in front of a 35mm camera (it could well be added that the ‘image’ in painting is not comprised of paint but of what the painter does with it, and that most effects artists work with displays quite as much as they do with software directly controlling luminance, chroma and texture maps). Like game avatars responding to joystick activity, these real-time visualizations are the product of human actions, translated into the imaginary form of Pandoran aliens in an alien landscape.</p>
<p>The disruption to the image is again apparent here in that the motion capture database is clearly vector-based, the only type of graphics that allows for mobile virtual cameras. The 3D vector space, however, cannot be directly displayed, as there are no 3D vector screens (there are very few vector screens at all outside of scientific instruments such as oscilloscopes). The scene as stored <italic>in silico</italic> must be transferred to a bitmap in order to display on a raster screen. This transformation extracts only the frame visible to the virtual camera, and parses it as a pixel array, with luminance and colour values ascribed to each pixel, thus transferring from the geometrical space of the stage and database to the arithmetic language required by digital displays. The process is analogous to the translation of pro-filmic reality into cinema’s two dimensions, and to the filtering of light through the layers of Tripack film stock, which effectively records only luminance in the chemically programmed silver halides in each layer. But it is also in <italic>Avatar</italic>’s case a further analog of the disparity between the lived world of the humans and their separate existence as ‘zombies’. It re-echoes the trope of the electronic environment of the pods they enter to gain access to their Na’vi bodies, and it opens onto the database motif of the film as a whole, the film as expression of shots and ‘plates’ (composite shots) and elements within those plates, compiled and therefore recompilable in different combinations from digital storage, as they are in the Director’s Cut.</p>
<p>‘It’s a network. It’s a global network and the Na’vi can access it. They can upload and download data.’ These lines, spoken by head scientist Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) as she tries to get the villains to recognize the enormity of their attack on the Tree of Voices, reveal the intensity of the technological dream underpinning the Pandoran utopia. She has already tried a different metaphor that segues into the metaphor of the internet: the connections between trees are the equivalent of synapses in the human brain. The implication is that of certain types of cognitive science: the brain itself is an electro-chemical computer. The dense environment of screens and data displays throughout <italic>Avatar</italic> speaks to the powers of data visualizations, not least 3D visualizations, as a surveillant medium of power. What the Na’vi share with their environment is something else: the ability to connect their neurons to those of their mounts, be they earthbound or flying, and to the majestic network of the trees, and thence to their ancestors whose memories are retained in the network along with their life-force. The fantasy incorporates the console cowboys mainlined to the network in William Gibson’s <italic>Neuromancer</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1746847712456263">1984</xref>) with the dream of total identification with the land, and the perpetual solace of a scientifically validated afterlife that includes the possibility of communicating with the living. The various dialogue scenes are explicit: death is not terminal on Pandora. This is perhaps the oldest of all wish-fulfilment fantasies, and we should expect it to appear in <italic>Avatar</italic>.</p>
<p>Against this daydream we must place the reality of 21st-century networks. Land is by no means the only environment in which humans must survive. Indeed it can be argued that the land only became an environment, separate from the human population, as a result of enclosures, serfdom and colonization. In the Industrial Revolution, something similar overcame tools, once the living extension of human bodies, now turned into alien systems of manufacture set over and against the workers who learned to discipline themselves to them. In our era, something similar has overcome knowledge: alienated, systematized, and placed over and against the population. It is in order to heal all the previous rifts between human populations and what has become their environment – territory, technology, data – that Pandora functions to integrate population, land, tools and knowledge by re-imagining the land as a technical information network which includes its inhabitants.</p>
<p>The utopian aspect of the production process then becomes apparent. At a first level of analysis, actors are paid to subject themselves to an apparatus that seems to give them agency on the imagined world, and which will result as the feature film <italic>Avatar</italic>. This process is mirrored in Jake’s movement from precarious worker to skilled avatar-driver, crowned by his ability to change his life when he bodily integrates with the Na’vi, first in the ritual that makes him a member of the tribe, then in sexual union, and finally in abandoning his human body. Both production system and the military–industrial complex repay their workers with the illusory power of control over their own destinies. The film’s intelligence lies in recognizing these illusions and providing a stirring tale of love and courage winning out, with the precarious worker (become cognitariat, and then transcending both roles) taking centre stage as historical agent. At a second level, this scenario plays out on a planet where networks are synaptically linked to their users, in which all information is open-source, open-access and therefore takes the form of knowledge rather than the commodity form of data. The utopian dimension is not only an ecological wish-fulfilment, then, but an adaptation of the ideals of the ‘free/libre open source software’ (FLOSS) movement and the open economics of peer-to-peer exchange. To that extent, fantastic Pandora responds directly to the affordances of digital networks as possible world, as not-yet but immanent potentials of the actually existing internet. Integrating the FLOSS, peer-to-peer political ethos with environmentalism is presented as more than wish-fulfilment: it presents a vista of an integral world where the population no longer permits itself to be severed from its land, its technologies or its knowledge, and moves over to the environmental side of the divide, leaving no traction for power to claim its unique right to mediate between human and environment.</p>
<p>But, since this is Hollywood, the rule of the narration has to be that the individual counts, rather than the people. To provide the specific mode of emotional engagement that viewers of Hollywood films experience as depth, the narrative must revolve around an individual. <italic>Avatar</italic> draws on two major tropes here: the <italic>Braveheart</italic> (Mel Gibson, 1995) syndrome and the revenge narrative. In the former, as in Gibson’s tale of Scottish rebellion, a chosen, pre-destined, leader takes on overwhelming power in righteous war. The pre-destination theme, which ostensibly ought to sit ill with the accompanying discourse of freedom, drives many science fiction narratives, from <italic>Dune</italic> (David Lynch, 1984) and <italic>Star Wars</italic> (George Lucas, 1977) to <italic>The Matrix</italic> (Andy and Larry Wachowski, 1999), as well as Cameron’s own <italic>Terminator</italic> films (1984, 1991). Here Jake’s destiny is as a magical talisman who is appreciated first by the magical shamanic old woman of the tribe, and who is later greeted with the universal acclaim that proves its worth. In this, <italic>Avatar</italic>’s is a proto-fascist ideology. The revenge narrative is if anything even more common: whether the cause is an abducted child or the destruction of a planet, Hollywood deploys revenge as a powerful motivator of audience support for what might otherwise appear unacceptable violence. The revenge motif has had a significant part to play in post 9/11 politics in the USA, and although there is little reason to read <italic>Avatar</italic> in such institutional–political terms, the importance of revenge to the plotting needs to be remarked.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1746847712456263">2</xref></sup> <italic>Avatar</italic> also draws on a theme repeated throughout Cameron’s work, that of undying love.</p>
<p>Viewed cynically, a film without a love interest would have so much less appeal to the date market. Cameron is also known for his strong female characters: Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) in <italic>Aliens</italic> (1986), Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) in the <italic>Terminator</italic> films, and others. Ney’tiri (Zoe Saldana) is given, among other attributes, the role of tutor in the ways of the warrior, and courage and skill in the battle scenes. The Tree of Souls ties the two protagonists together, and allows the narrative to include marriage in its third-act resolution of plot difficulties. The heterosexual organization of the Pandoran world is bolstered by Cameron’s admission to <italic>Playboy</italic> that the Na’vi females were given breasts, even though they are not mammals, as part of the visual allure of the film (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1746847712456263">Peterson et al., 2010</xref>). The romance is depicted tenderly enough for military chief Quaritch’s (Stephen Lang) description of it as ‘getting some local tail’ to strike most viewers as insulting and wrong. It is important both that the meeting of species shivers with sexual jealousy as well as tension, and that love rather than the lure of a new body, or even of justice, should be the prime motivator. Here as so often in contemporary Hollywood, evil is clearly marked while good appears not as shining exemplar, but as innocence and the protection of the innocent: justice is the defeat of evil, not the construction of the public good, and its reward is peaceable normativity marked as marriage.</p>
<p>In the apartheid culture of the contemporary USA, casting a Hispanic American as the love interest, even elaborately remodelled as blue-skinned Ney’tiri, struggles to absolve the film from the irrational fear of miscegenation which still dogs North American creatives. There is, then, a remnant of progressive politics in the film, which also celebrates an inter-species sexual relationship, which, though thoroughly removed from prurience, jibes gently at racism, and provides a counter-argument to the sexual violence characteristic of colonial expansion. It is Jake who lies in a swoon after their lovemaking, his human alter ego wolfing down protein before returning to the scene. Sex changes the structure of relationships, though those changes are masked by the destruction that follows in the next scene. The ‘zombie’ nature of the human–Na’vi avatar gives the scene a strange dislocation, as does the cut acknowledging that the ‘real’, damaged body lies in a canister somewhere far away. The scene pulls from the same pool as the theme of undying love, the distressing thesis voiced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1746847712456263">Lacan (1975</xref>: 71–72) in late lectures that the sexual act is impossible, because what the man desires is not the woman but his own <italic>jouissance</italic>. The separation of Jake’s body from his avatar seems to align his lovemaking with internet sex as much as with the most intimate connection with his soul-mate, and the contradiction makes the inter-relation of love and death almost as poignant as in earlier Cameron handlings of the theme in <italic>The Abyss</italic> (1989) and <italic>Titanic</italic> (1997). Love is irreducibly melded with any vision of utopia, but here that utopian union is tinged with the sense of separation, in terms of both the human–avatar relation (Jake’s non-identity as Na’vi avatar and consequent absence from the scene of his own lovemaking) and the terminal separation of death. These separations are consistently coloured, in the tonality of the image and the orchestral colours of the soundtrack, with the warmth of nostalgia for a future that has yet to happen. This is perhaps the most conflicted region of the film’s utopian possibilities: love’s utopia is, it seems, always in the past.</p>
<p>This is too often the case with ecotopias more generally: once there was wilderness, and once we lived in harmony with nature, but now no more, whether the voice lamenting is that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1746847712456263">Heidegger (1977)</xref> lamenting the enframing of the world or that of deep ecologists yearning for return (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1746847712456263">Naess, 1989</xref>). <italic>Avatar</italic> plays out this orientation towards the past as an ending, told in voiceover by one who has already lived it, like a <italic>film noir</italic>. This is perhaps the moment of greatest betrayal: to have raised the spectre of utopia, not only as wish-fulfilment but as the not-yet outcome of a still evolving condition, the situation of network societies and their potential, and to have placed it not in the unknowable future but in the already-over. <italic>Avatar</italic>’s saving grace is that the aporias of animation interrupt this totalizing orientation. The non-identity of the image in gaps between layers, incomplete transformations, and even narrative contradictions between the human and the animated prise open little chinks of light, possibilities of being otherwise. ‘<italic>Avatar</italic> blues’ is a symptom not of the failure of cinema but the failure of reality, of the social, and of the rift between the social and our land, between tools and knowledge. There is the grievous realization that the paradise on the church wall is only paint, but there is too the realization that the paint on the wall is a foreshadowing of something other and better, and the animation of this paradise is both as paper-thin and as rich.</p>

<p>What ideas individuals may attach to the term ‘Millennium’ I know not; but I know that society may be formed so as to exist without crime, without poverty, with health greatly improved, with little, if any misery, and with intelligence and happiness increased a hundredfold; and no obstacle whatsoever intervenes at this moment except ignorance to prevent such a state of society from becoming universal.
