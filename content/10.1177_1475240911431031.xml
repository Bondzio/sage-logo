<p>Interest in the Reggio Approach was sparked in 1991 through the publication in <italic>Newsweek</italic> of an article on the excellence of the Diana School. This interest continues to grow as numerous early child educators from all over the world flock to Reggio Emilia, a city in northern Italy, to observe, learn and understand the philosophy and approach to Early Childhood Education that developed and continues to evolve in its 23 preschools and 26 infant toddler centres. The attention the Reggio pedagogues received from the world came as a pleasant surprise, for they believed what they were doing (their educational project to provide services for young children as rightful citizens of the community) was something ‘normal’, set deep in the roots of their culture and history. And in that sense, it would seem disrespectful to ‘clone’ the approach, without thoughtfully interpreting and translating the philosophy and approach into one’s own context.</p>
<p>The book begins with a well written Introduction which clearly identifies this very need to understand that one cannot ‘do Reggio’ as a method. Rather, the best approach is to identify values that may be found in common between early years settings in the UK and in Reggio. The Introduction clarifies the aim of the book, which is to present the philosophical ideas of the Reggio Approach in relation to the principles of good early years practice in the UK, and to make connections with the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) framework, providing a clear context for the interpretation of the Reggio Approach. The ideas from Reggio are complex, and the authors of the book are to be commended on the format of the book and the legibility of their language in communicating complex thoughts to readers new to the Reggio Approach. While the textual information on Reggio is easy to follow, I find some parts of the application of theory to practice rather didactic and too direct in approach, to the point where a suggestion can seemingly be read almost as ‘the thing to do’. In contrast, the book can certainly provide guidance on implementing strategies that can be helpful in supporting and enhancing one’s own learning environment and context.</p>
<p>Chapter 1, though brief, offers a helpful and much needed entry into understanding the history of the Reggio Approach and its organizational structures, and identifying the key values of the Reggio Approach which are covered in the remaining six chapters. This initial chapter ‘sets the scene’ in helping the reader to understand how the Reggio Approach is embedded deep in the history and culture of the city and its citizens, putting into perspective the origins of the underlying philosophy of the approach. Each of the following chapters (Chapters 2–7) examines one aspect of the Reggio Approach in more detail through a very precise and consistent format that (1) looks at what happens in Reggio, (2) makes connections with the EYFS framework, (3) looks at how inspirations from the Reggio Approach can be drawn, (4) illustrates how the ideas might look in practice, (5) suggests literature for further reading and research and (6) provides a list of questions to help practitioners reflect on current practice with a plan to make changes if needed. As the book looks at two contexts – the Reggio context and the EYFS context – this consistent format is a strength of the book, one that allows the reader to orientate and follow the threads and relations of the ideas in the two different contexts in a systematic way, focusing on one aspect chapter by chapter.</p>
<p>In reading the book, one is led to see the many similarities between the Reggio Approach and the framework of the EYFS, rather than the differences. This can be viewed as a strength of the book, but is also a danger for the reader who wishes fully to appreciate the complexities of the Reggio pedagogy. The book from Chapters 2 to 7 is sectioned into the following aspects: Relationships, Creativity, The Environment, Time, Learning and Teaching, and Reflective Practice. While the book provides an accessible introduction to the values and principles underlying the Reggio Approach through these chapters, I would argue that one extremely vital element of the Reggio Approach is lacking in detail which acts as the connector of all the values, and which most probably is significantly different to the approach in most educational settings, and important for the reader to interpret: the role of the aesthetic dimensions in learning and education. Without due consideration of this issue, I believe there cannot be true understanding of the Reggio pedagogy. To the Reggio pedagogue, the aesthetic dimension, first and foremost, ‘is a process of empathy relating the Self to things and things to each other’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1475240911431031">Vecchi, 2010</xref>). This means there needs to be an attitude of care and attention to the things we do, such as aspiration to quality in the choices we make, be it the choice of a colour, a word we use, particular music, and so on. In the context of education, the Reggio pedagogue believes the aesthetic dimensions deserve deep thought and reflection. In Reggio, each ‘language’ is made up of rationality, imagination, emotion and aesthetics; they are not seen as separate.</p>
<p>This sensitivity to interweaving different disciplines, be it mathematics, art, science, verbal language or others, observes patterns which can connect and relate to each other. Such an approach to education is seen as fundamental and needs serious attention if one is fully to appreciate their pursuit of beauty and loveliness, which Reggio pedagogues believe to be activators for learning and knowledge and are, therefore, viewed as necessary for learning, and for life. Only a small mention is given to the Atelierista and the Atelier (in the Introduction and Chapter 4, respectively). Further attention to the meaning of aesthetics related to Active Listening in Chapter 2 and extending the relationship between the concept of the ‘hundred languages’ and Creativity in Chapter 3 can provide deeper thought and understanding in making further critical connections and comparisons to the philosophy of the EYFS. To the Reggio pedagogue, as all aspects and values highlighted through the chapters are related and interconnected rather than separate, a chapter at the beginning of the book introducing the approach of the aesthetic dimensions towards learning and education would have been worthwhile, to help the reader appreciate and better understand the deep roots of how and why Reggio pedagogy places value on each of the aspects (Chapters 2–7) and the choices they have made.</p>
<p>In terms of readership, the book comes as a title in the ‘easy-to-read’ series, which provides an introduction to important early years philosophies. The book aims to appeal to early years practitioners, students and parents who wish to gain an understanding of the principles of the Reggio Approach; I feel that the book, seen as a guide, fulfils this aim. As an introduction to the Reggio Approach, it is an informative book to which readers can easily relate, in making connections with their practice. What I find most helpful in reading the book is the list of questions at the end of each chapter. The questions enable the reader to reflect on his/her practice and beliefs, thus being both a reflective and reflexive practitioner. The questions can act as a stimulus for discussion and research amongst colleagues, either to instigate needed change or to instil a stronger sense of belief and commitment in their work with young children. The suggested list of titles for further reading and research at the end of each chapter is another strength of the book. In the concluding chapter, the book makes clear that it is a brief description of the Reggio Approach to early years education and its influence in early years settings in the UK. For this reason, the suggested readings can offer a means by which readers can deepen their understanding.</p>
<p>The concluding chapter briefly and skilfully lists the connections between UK early childhood services and Reggio by highlighting similarities in the key principles of quality in the two varying contexts. The Conclusion brings readers back full circle so that, while being inspired by the Reggio Approach, they can remember the richness of their own context – an important message to all early years educators of the world.</p>
