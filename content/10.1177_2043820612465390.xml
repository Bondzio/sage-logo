Working in a context of fascist restoration, Gramsci set himself the task to ‘understand the strength of the status quo and then devise a strategy for its transformation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820612465390">Cox, 1999</xref>: p. 4). A crucial focus in his work is to understand and critique hegemony or the way dominant forces influence ‘common sense’ conceptions of the world and norms of conduct in such a way that their dominance is understood as legitimate and beneficial for all.</p><p>Davies’ book certainly contributes to this goal in providing a powerful deconstruction of today’s common sense understanding of network governance. It unveils governance theory as a deceptive <italic>ideology</italic> (alongside individualization), which asserts that ‘complexity renders obsolete any attempt to organize and plan society collectively and democratically’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2043820612465390">Davies, 2011</xref>, p. 99). Davies convincingly argues how the ideology of networks underpins and legitimates the neoliberal hegemonic project.</p><p>Davies also describes networks as <italic>institutional structures</italic> on which hegemonic struggles unfold. In recognizing the variable logic and contradictory character of networks (e.g. being simultaneously collaborative and competition-oriented or both horizontal and hierarchical), he identifies different types of network governance networks that offer different playing fields for hegemonic and counter-hegemonic forces, distributing resources and power in various ways.</p><p>However, Davies leaves underexplored the way networks are mobilized and deployed as <italic>strategies</italic> in hegemonic struggles. This is, one could argue, an indispensable step to move beyond an analysis of the strength of the status quo to the development of a long-term strategy for counter-hegemonic struggle. The strategic questions left aside by Davies will be addressed in this contribution. In what ways are networks also deployed strategically by the hegemon? What are its effects, positive or negative, for the struggle of counter-hegemonic forces? Are these effects avoidable or not, and how can we avoid or strengthen them?</p><p>To answer these questions, we will rely on ongoing research on network governance in urban and housing policies in Belgium. Urban and housing policies play a key role in Belgian economic development, and we have earlier on unravelled their role in hegemonic struggle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612465390">Loopmans, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820612465390">Loopmans et al., 2010</xref>). After the Second World War, suburbanization became the spatial pendant of a hegemonic model of capitalist development in Belgium. It was supported by homeownership subsidies, massive road building and a very generous allotment of peripheral land (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2043820612465390">Kesteloot and De Maesschalck, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820612465390">Loopmans et al., 2010</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2043820612465390">Mougenot, 1988</xref>). Yet, by 1970s, the inherent contradictions of this model surfaced in a severe legitimation and coordination crisis. The model came under attack from various sides. In the present contribution, we will reveal how ensuing government reactions exploited the strategic potential of network governance for passive revolution. Passive revolution is one of the more strategic concepts in Gramsci’s work. In particular, it is described as a ‘crisis strategy’ by excellence: a move of the dominant bloc within a configuration of power relations, where an antagonistic force potentially represents an alternative path of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2043820612465390">Lievens, 2011</xref>, p. 157). Passive revolution is fundamentally about undermining the coherence and revolutionary potential of the challenger force.</p><p>In the <italic>Prison Notebooks</italic>, Gramsci identified three ‘strategic modes of passive revolution’.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The incorporation, in the hegemonic state structure, of the counter-hegemonic forces’ leaders and movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820612465390">Gramsci, 2001</xref>, p. 962–963.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The development of policy practices that incorporates some claims of the counter-hegemonic project while ignoring others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820612465390">Gramsci, 2001</xref>, p. 1227–1229).</p></list-item><list-item><p>The (discursive) concealment of some of the various counter-hegemonic claims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820612465390">Gramsci, 2001</xref>, p. 1325).</p></list-item></list><p>Davies’ analysis of network governance provides us with an overview of network governance characteristics instrumental to various strategies of passive revolution.</p><p>First, network governance creates limited horizontal structures within an overall strategically selective hierarchical landscape of government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2043820612465390">Davies, 2011</xref>, p. 15). Such an institutional landscape does not only allows to approach and co-opt movement leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2043820612465390">Davies, 2011</xref>, p. 60) but also allows to do so in a way that they are simultaneously kept at bay from core state institutions and hence rendered harmless. In the 1970s, architects and urban planners had been at the forefront of the anti-suburbanization protest, but were quickly offered employment through temporary research projects for the public works department and in new and unstable local planning administrations; yet, they gained access to supralocal institutions, but decades later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612465390">Loopmans, 2008</xref>). Simultaneously, local governments set-up collaborative networks with urban community organizers, thereby restricting their action space to the neighbourhood level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612465390">Loopmans, 2008</xref>). Setting up specific governance networks was a strategy to circumscribe the ‘space of mobilization’ of core actors of the anti-suburbanization movement and ‘deflect’ their action from the regional scale of the city, where they had voiced their original claims to the less harmful local and neighbourhood scale of the governance networks installed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820612465390">Loopmans et al., 2010</xref>; Uitermark et al., in press).</p><p>Second, Davies reveals how networks are inherently flexible: not only are they created at a variety of places and scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2043820612465390">Davies, 2011</xref>, p. 36) but also are propagated as less institutionalized. Of course, network closure and creeping managerialism are always a threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2043820612465390">Davies, 2011</xref>, p. 61) and Davies rightly warns for the institutionalization of the integral state through network governance, as central state actors essentially control and regulate these networks (p. 101–124). Yet, what remains unexplored is how state actors exploit their central position in governance networks to deploy network flexibility as a passive revolutionary strategy. Gramsci argues how passive revolutions are inherently instable, as they always provide only partial solutions who cannot avoid the eruption of new expressions of its underlying contradictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2043820612465390">Hesketh, 2010</xref>, p. 384; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2043820612465390">Morton, 2010</xref>). The flexibility of networks, however, allows central actors to shift around contradictions in a way that the passive revolution can be sustained. Indeed, our research on urban and housing policies in Belgium has revealed how central actors essentially operate as gatekeepers switching on and off parts of the governance network at will to suppress new contenders (see also the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2043820612465390">Sites and Vonderlack-Navarro (2012)</xref> on the way the minority rights activists were divided through selective incorporation in governance networks in Chicago). The situation in Antwerp which Davies, on the basis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612465390">Loopmans (2008)</xref>, termed an ‘interregnum’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2043820612465390">Davies, 2011</xref>, p. 133–134) is probably better described as a sequence of passive revolutionary reactions to an ongoing crisis. Each time a different challenger surfaces, new networks at varying scales are activated while other are quenched. In doing so, different counter-hegemonic claims are subsequently ‘illuminated’ as crucial (and recognized through the instalment of new policy networks), while other are concealed. Thematic governance networks follow each other during the years from networks focussing on affordable housing in cities in reaction to the 1970s urban movements to networks focussing on multicultural tolerance in neighbourhoods after the 1980s electoral rise of the extreme right, those to be abandoned just a decade later when networks focussing on safety and gentrification are brought to the fore after urban policy makers contest their declining tax incomes during the 1990s (Loopmans et al., 2010).</p><p>Davies recognizes that a Gramscian perspective needs to consider networks not merely as an ideology or strategically selective structure for hegemony, but should also discuss strategic questions such as: ‘if governance networks generate new governing capacity, how is it mobilized? To what ends is it deployed and at the expense of what alternative interests, agendas and capacities? What contradictions manifest in the enactment of network relations, or in the relationship between network, context and outcome? And, how are contradictions deferred, resolved, or aggravated?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2043820612465390">Davies, 2011</xref>, p. 135). In this short review, we have sketched the potential of network governance for passive revolution. Network governance is instrumental to hegemonic forces to cream off the leaders of counter-hegemonic movements in a way that renders them harmless and powerless and deflects and circumscribes their space and scale of mobilization (see also Uitermark et al., in press). Moreover, the inherent flexibility of networks bears the potential to divide counter-hegemonic movements and displace and shift around the contradictions of passive revolution. From a strategic point of view, it is hard to argue for a general distrust to engage with governance networks, but the above analysis does set out the lines along which a strategic analysis of network governance can be conducted in particular cases.</p></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr2-2043820612465390"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cox</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>1999</year>) <article-title>Civil society at the turn of the millennium: prospects for an alternative world order</article-title>. <source>Review of International studies</source> <volume>25</volume>: <fpage>3</fpage>–<lpage>28</lpage>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr12-2043820612465390"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Davies</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2011</year>) <source>Challenging Governance Theory: From Networks to Hegemony</source>. <publisher-loc>Bristol, UK</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Policy Press</publisher-name>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr1-2043820612465390"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gramsci</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2001</year>) <source>Quaderni del Carcere</source> <article-title>[Prison notebooks].
