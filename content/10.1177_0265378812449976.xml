<abstract>
<p>The Rev’d Roland Allen’s grandson ventures to speculate on the attitudes his grandfather might be expected to have adopted regarding several of today’s controversial issues. After rehearsing briefly Roland’s published and unpublished work, Hubert Allen reviews, both on the basis of Roland’s expressed opinions and by inference from remarks made by him or by members of his immediate family, how he believes his grandfather would have reacted to six matters of current or recent controversy, namely: Modern Translations of the Bible, The Role of Women in the Church, Homosexuality, Ecumenism, Inter-Faith Dialogue, and the proposed Anglican Covenant.</p>

<body>
<p>I have been asked by OCMS to express my opinions about the probable views of my grandfather, the Reverend Roland Allen, regarding a few present-day matters of controversy. But why should we be worrying about ‘Granfer’ (my grandfather) anyway? Why should we (or anyone else) still be interested in someone who died more than half a century ago? After all, when he died, a bishop (who had known him quite well) dismissed him in a sympathetic letter to my father by remarking: ‘Such a gifted man. What a pity he achieved so little’.</p>
<p>So what <italic>did</italic> he achieve? Well, above all, he wrote several books. When I was 12 years old, I asked him if I could read his books. He replied ‘Oh yes, you can read them by all means – but you won’t understand them’. I suppose I must have looked a little hurt, because he quickly went on to say: ‘I don’t think <italic>anyone</italic> is going to understand them until I’ve been dead for ten years!’</p>
<p>So what <italic>were</italic> these books? A couple of years ago we marked the centenary of ‘Edinburgh 1910’ – the first World Missionary Conference, at which most European and American Protestant missionary societies were represented. Granfer, who had himself worked as a missionary in China, didn’t attend the conference (though his friend Temple-Gairdner of Cairo was Secretary): but he was so worried about some of its conclusions that less than two years later he published a book entitled: <italic>Missionary Methods – St Paul’s or Ours?</italic> In this book he challenged a lot of traditional missionary practice. In particular, he remarked that: ‘St Paul preached in a place for five or six months and then left behind him a Church, not indeed free from the need of guidance, but capable of growth and expansion’. In contrast, as Bishop Henry Whitehead of Madras pointed out in the book’s Introduction, ‘We found Churches and keep them in leading strings for a hundred years, and even then are not within measurable distance of giving them independence.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0265378812449976">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>This book, and a supplementary study, <italic>Missionary Principles</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0265378812449976">2</xref></sup> (which has been called ‘<italic>a textbook on how to be a missionary of Jesus Christ’</italic>), was only the first of Roland Allen’s challenges to the church establishment. Even when I was an undergraduate, many Anglican churches would have Mattins and Evensong every Sunday, with Holy Communion only once a month. Unfashionably at that time, Roland was already arguing before the First World War that the Eucharist ‘is the essential centre of the life of the Church’. In <italic>Educational Principles &amp; Missionary Methods</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0265378812449976">3</xref></sup> he suggested that – whereas St Paul’s methods had much in common with the principles of eminent contemporary educationists such as Pestalozzi, Froebel and Montessori – the mission schools’ approach to Christian mission and evangelism tended to be rote-based, timid, and above all lacking in trust in the Holy Spirit. He dismissed the argument that the gulf between contemporary missionaries and those to whom they went was greater than that between St Paul and his converts. He developed these arguments in <italic>Pentecost &amp; the World</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0265378812449976">4</xref></sup> suggesting that most existing churches and their missions seemed to lack faith in the Holy Spirit, not trusting the Spirit to work through local people as St Paul had done. In <italic>The Spontaneous Expansion of the Church, and the Causes which Hinder It</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0265378812449976">5</xref></sup> Roland suggested that the dead hand of traditional western Christendom, and the missionary societies’ excessive concern with providing social services, were interfering with the spread of the Gospel: ‘You do not want buildings and machinery to propagate ideas or a faith;’ he wrote, ‘you want ideas and a faith’. Finally, <italic>The Case for Voluntary Clergy</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0265378812449976">6</xref></sup> was the culmination of arguments he had begun as early as 1920 in favour of what was later called the non-stipendiary ministry. And in addition to these, and other minor books, he wrote very numerous thoughtful and thought-provoking articles on a wide range of topics – chiefly in <italic>World Dominion</italic>, the house journal of the Survey Application Trust, but also in many other learned secular and theological publications</p>
<p>However, most of Granfer’s church contemporaries considered him to be nothing more than an eccentric nuisance. It wasn’t until the early 1950s – only a little less than the ten years after his death that he had foretold – that some influential people (above all Bishop Lesslie Newbigin of the Church of South India) began to urge people to read, or re-read, Granfer’s books. Ever since then, several of the ones I’ve mentioned have become compulsory reading for almost anyone who is interested in the mission of the Church. So this man, who was thought by that bishop to have achieved so little, has had <italic>five</italic> of his books (two of them collections of shorter writings assembled by David Paton<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0265378812449976">7</xref></sup>) re-published this century, nearly 60 years after his death, with introductions by contemporary scholars – Bishops Michael Turnbull and Michael Nazir-Ali, and Professors Lammin Sanneh and Brian Smith<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0265378812449976">8</xref></sup>. The Episcopal Church of the USA has even assigned him a day in their Anglican Church Calendar!<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0265378812449976">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Well, that’s all very fine, but it’s now history. All those books are available, and most of his ideas have become mainstream thinking. Surely there can’t be anything more to learn from a man who’s been dead for well over half a century?</p>
<p>Maybe, but I’m not so sure. In Rhodes House, here in Oxford, there are still a few interesting unpublished papers of his in some boxes deposited there by USPG.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0265378812449976">10</xref></sup> Some people believe that the sermon notes in those boxes could be helpful, if they were expanded for publication. And others think people could benefit from reading the rest of his imaginary studies of how ordinary bystanders might have reacted to Jesus’ parables: he left such studies of about two dozen parables, some complete, others in note form, some typewritten, some simply in his beautifully clear handwriting. Only one of these – <italic>The Good Samaritan</italic> – has so far been published, together with his draft preface, but another – <italic>The Prodigal Son</italic> – now appears elsewhere in this issue (p. XXX).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0265378812449976">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>In particular, some scholars – mostly American – would like to see in print a pamphlet he left unfinished, which he had provisionally entitled <italic>The Ministry of Expansion: the Priesthood of the Laity</italic>. In this he challenges very powerfully the accepted views about the apostolic ministry, as defined by two highly respected scholars, whose writings are still today cited as definitive for the Anglican Church: Bishop Charles Gore and Professor Robert Moberly.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0265378812449976">12</xref></sup> Roland doesn’t pull his punches, writing:
<disp-quote>
<p>Their theory of the Apostolic Succession appears to me legal, formal, strained and based upon extremely doubtful interpretations both of the language of the New Testament and of the passages from the early Church Fathers which they quote. They fail to convince me even within their limits.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0265378812449976">13</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>But can we go even further? Can we infer from any of his writings, published or unpublished, or from the memories of anyone still alive, what Roland Allen might have had to say about more recent or current controversies? I think possibly we can, but we must be very cautious, because a frequent problem with my grandfather’s writings is that he wrote in different ways to different audiences about a very wide range of subjects. Consequently – just as happens with St Paul’s epistles – different people can often find phrases to support conflicting points of view, very often citing them completely out of context.</p>
<p>With that warning, I shall be foolhardy enough to hazard some guesses about what opinions I think he might have held about a few of today’s controversial issues. We must remember that he died, as he had lived, an Anglican (even though a controversial one). And I try to be an Anglican myself. So I shall confine my suggestions to controversies that confront <italic>that</italic> part of the Church in particular, although of course most of them are of much wider concern.</p>
<sec id="section1-0265378812449976">
<title>Modern Translations</title>
<p>Roland’s books are rooted in Scripture – almost always the New Testament – but he tended very often to cross-check by reference to the original Greek or Hebrew, and the writings of the Early Fathers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0265378812449976">14</xref></sup> In sermons he preferred to quote from the King James’ <italic>Authorized Version</italic>, rather than from the <italic>Revised Version</italic> of the 1880s – probably to appeal to his audiences’ familiarity with the text of the <italic>Authorized Version.</italic> My father told me that Roland didn’t think much of <italic>Moffat</italic> as a translator, but he thought he would have liked JB Phillips’ <italic>Letters to Young Churches</italic>. I’m sure he would have thoroughly approved efforts to recover the original meaning, so he would have applauded any fresh translations so inspired, and based on genuine scholarship. Nevertheless, we need to remember that in his later years he was becoming critical even of the Scriptures themselves, noting that: ‘to accept as equally divinely inspired the book <italic>Ecclesiastes</italic> and the <italic>Sermon on the Mount</italic> was absurd’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0265378812449976">
<title>The role of Women in the Church</title>
<p>I am not myself aware that Roland ever addressed the subject of the possible ordination of women, still less of their elevation to the episcopate. But he had enormous respect for women’s perceptiveness and sensitivity. For example, in his diary about his travels in India he often alluded to the frequency with which the wives of the British bishops and other leaders, whom he had come to visit, were much quicker to understand and to approve his theological arguments in favour of non-stipendiary clergy. As I remark in my monograph, his refusal to condemn polygamy among Africans and native North Americans demonstrates that, although he was insistent on following the <italic>methods</italic> of St Paul, he wasn’t advocating that we should necessarily follow the practice of Pauline <italic>society</italic>. In my personal opinion, I think Roland would have pointed with approval to St Paul’s heavy reliance on such women as Lydia, Prisca, Nympha and Phoebe; and that his advice to Timothy <italic>must</italic> be read in the context of contemporary male-dominated social practice. What was for Roland of supreme importance was that <italic>all</italic> the Sacraments should be readily available to <italic>all</italic> God’s people – and if that implied a need for women to administer them, then he would have fully approved of the idea.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0265378812449976">
<title>Homosexuality</title>
<p>I have never found anything about this in his writings, and I think it exceedingly unlikely that the topic would ever have been discussed, even within the family. We must remember that until about 20 years after his death, the practice was still unlawful in this country and subject to a prison sentence. The only faintly relevant evidence I have is that his son Iohn – my father – was removed from his boarding school in Marlborough, and sent instead to school in Westminster as a day-scholar; and somewhere in the course of research for my biography I came across correspondence between my father and one of his contemporaries, perhaps his only true friend at Marlborough – Max Warren, later General Secretary of the Church Missionary Society: this makes clear that the reason Iohn was removed from the school was his personal revulsion from the ubiquitous pederasty in his boarding house. Since until well after graduation Iohn seems to have been almost totally subservient to his father’s opinions,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0265378812449976">15</xref></sup> this revulsion may indeed have reflected Roland’s own views. But even so, I don’t think we can necessarily conclude that Roland would in consequence have been intolerant of gay clergy: as with women, he would quite possibly have been prepared to tolerate <italic>anything</italic> that could make the Sacraments more readily available.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0265378812449976">
<title>Ecumenism</title>
<p>Although ‘Edinburgh 1910’ had moved a very little way towards improving inter-church cooperation, Roland was always convinced that ecumenism ought to go very much further. As early as 1900, during the Boxer troubles, he wrote admiringly of two American Presbyterian ministers, remarking that:
<disp-quote>
<p>missionaries like these, ready to lay down their lives for their people, exercised a great influence and won converts to the fold. . . . It made me feel doubly sad at the divisions of Christendom which separate from Communion men who jeopardize their lives for the name of the Lord Jesus.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>His colleagues in the World Dominion Movement during ten of the most productive years of his life were a Congregationalist and a Presbyterian. And in one passage in <italic>Pentecost &amp; the World</italic> he remarked:
<disp-quote>
<p>Men who hold a theory of the Church which excludes from Communion those whom they admit to have the Spirit of Christ simply proclaim that their theory is in flat contradiction to the spiritual fact . . . If the Holy Ghost is given, those to whom He is given are certainly accepted in Christ by God . . . Men may separate them, systems may part them from the enjoyment and strength of their unity; but, if they share the one Spirit, they are one.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0265378812449976">16</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0265378812449976">
<title>Inter-Faith Dialogue</title>
<p>My grandfather certainly had great admiration for <italic>some</italic> individuals of other faiths. In 1900, when the Boxer movement was gathering strength, and threatening those who collaborated with foreigners, an elderly Confucian was coming daily to teach Roland about classical Chinese texts. Granfer urged him to stop running such risks, but the old man replied:
<disp-quote>
<p>I find nothing in my religious books to tell me I have been doing anything wrong in coming here to teach you . . . If I am punished for it, that has nothing whatever to do with me, because I am doing what is right.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Roland felt humbled, remarking: ‘He is a better man than I am’.</p>
<p>In a paper entitled <italic>The Place of ‘Faith’ in Missionary Evangelism</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0265378812449976">17</xref></sup> Roland contrasted admiringly the confident certainty of Buddhist and Muslim preachers in China with the timidity of Christian missionaries. And in his old age he admired and translated Muslim epics from Swahili into English.</p>
<p>I have already mentioned that Roland’s son Iohn (my father) was deeply influenced by his parent’s opinions. In a talk to students in Uganda in 1965, Iohn spoke of the hatred of Muslims and Christians for one another, and commented: ‘This is the hate of near neighbours, who are so close to each other that they fear that any concession may breach the wall between them, and let in the enemy. I have tried all my life,’ he went on, ‘to breach that wall and let in a friend. . . .’ He continued that he:
<disp-quote>
<p>could not accept that people were totally wrong who believed a very great deal of what I believe myself and who often act on their beliefs better than I do myself. Nor could I treat them as enemies, when they were engaged on the same search for truth as myself. . . .<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0265378812449976">18</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I think that passage would very probably reflect Roland’s own attitude when dealing with genuinely sincere ‘seekers after truth’ of other faiths.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0265378812449976">
<title>The Anglican Convenant</title>
<p>Here I feel I can speak with real confidence. As Lesslie Newbigin wrote, Roland saw ‘that one can cherish the elements of order which give coherence to the universal Church and yet be free from the heavy structures with which these elements have been associated during the centuries of “Christendom”’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0265378812449976">19</xref></sup> I am fairly sure that Granfer would have considered the proposed Anglican Convenant to be just such a ‘heavy structure’. ‘The Gospels are not law books,’ he wrote; ‘Christians in establishing Christian Law, standards, codes, have gone back from Christ to Moses’. I don’t think he would have worried at all about a divided Anglicanism. In fact, in his own words:
<disp-quote>
<p>the Church of England . . . is plainly incapable of any universality . . . Roman Catholicism made great claims to solve this difficulty by infallible utterances . . . (but that was) simply a form of ecclesiastical Nazism (which) could no more endure than political Nazism could endure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0265378812449976">20</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>And he remarks elsewhere: ‘The wind bloweth where it listeth, said Christ, and spontaneous activity is a movement of the Spirit in the individual, and in the Church, and we cannot control the Spirit’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0265378812449976">21</xref></sup> So his attitude, I think, would have been to urge each part of the Church to seek prayerfully to interpret the movement of the Holy Spirit as it applies to them in their situation, irrespective of what other parts of the same Church may decide, and certainly not bound by any ‘Convenant’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0265378812449976">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>I have said more than enough, and I feel it has been very impertinent of me to say so much, because I am <italic>not</italic> a theologian nor a missiologist, and I really do not know anything more than I wrote in a short biography published in America sixteen years ago.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0265378812449976">22</xref></sup> In that book I could do little more than describe Roland’s eventful life. In summary, as an Anglican missionary in Peking (Beijing) he became the Chinese-speaking British chaplain during the siege of the Peking legations in the Boxer rising of 1900;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0265378812449976">23</xref></sup> he resigned from his English vicarage in 1907 in protest against the use of the Church as no more than a social convenience; in 1914 he swam ashore from the wreck of a hospital ship, and later served with the YMCA in Rouen; he joined with two Nonconformists in challenging contemporary Church behaviour, especially in the mission field; in the 1920s he travelled adventurously in India, Canada and southern Africa; in the 1930s he acted as an up-country locum during his retirement in Kenya, where during the War he ministered to Germans interned in prison camps; and in his old age he translated Muslim epics from Swahili into English, in Nairobi, where he lies buried.</p>
<p>Finally, I must emphasize, all these suggestions of mine are based on what I <italic>guess</italic> he <italic>might</italic> have thought in his lifetime, although throughout that life his ideas were maturing and changing. So everything I have suggested above is the wildest speculation, and I must beg you to treat it accordingly.</p>
