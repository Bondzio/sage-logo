<p><italic>Background</italic>: There is a lack of effective smoking cessation interventions which have a high reach among adolescent smokers. <italic>Method</italic>: We conducted a randomised controlled trial of an adolescent smoking cessation intervention for students aged 15–21 at 22 continuation schools in Denmark.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Although the dangers of smoking have been known for half a century, smoking still remains one of the most important challenges to public health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494811435488">1</xref>]. Among children and adolescents the effort has been aimed at preventing smoking onset, and only in the recent years focus have been on smoking cessation interventions for adolescents. A national cross-sectional survey conducted among 16–20 year olds in Denmark in 2003 found 22% were daily smokers and 7% were occasional smokers among males and 19% were daily smokers and 9% were occasional smokers among females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494811435488">2</xref>]. Among the daily smokers, 53% of the males and 50% of the females would like to quit smoking, 43% of all smokers had attempted to quit, and 52% had attempted to reduce cigarette consumption within the last year; 17% planned to quit smoking with the next 1–6 months and 9% planned to quit within the next month. Among all the young people surveyed (both smokers and non-smokers), 2.3% said they had quit smoking during the last year. The survey revealed difference in smoking prevalence between school types: in the upper secondary schools 13% were daily smokers whereas in the lower secondary schools there were 35% smokers. In the social and health schools 20% were daily smokers.</p>
<p>At the time of the development of our smoking programme (2003), it was unclear what conclusions could be drawn from the existing adolescent smoking cessation (ASC) interventions. On the basis of a review of 20 studies that had been evaluated in a rigorous study design, McDonald <italic>et al.</italic> concluded that: “Cognitive-behavioural interventions are a promising approach for helping young smokers quit smoking. Evidence is insufficient to draw other conclusions at this time” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494811435488">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Prior to intervention development we conducted a pilot study testing a “conventional” group based five-session smoking cessation programme in three different school settings for students aged 16–20 in Denmark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494811435488">4</xref>]. The study showed that most schools did not consider smoking cessation a relevant topic for their school curriculum and we concluded that the prerequisites for smoking cessation courses were not present at the schools at that time (2002). We also found that, even though the cessation groups were held during school hours, we were only able to recruit about 5% of the smokers at the schools. In a qualitative study of the adolescent smoking cessation process, we found that adolescents expected cessation interventions to be patronising and regarded support seeking for an internal personal process as excessive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494811435488">5</xref>]. These findings were in line with those of McDonald who found that the median recruitment for adult smoking cessation interventions were 2.0% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494811435488">6</xref>] and Backinger <italic>et al.</italic> who reported that a researcher might expect between 2 and 10% recruitment to adolescent smoking cessation interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494811435488">7</xref>]. If this problem cannot be overcome, it is unlikely that ASC programmes will have a significant effect on the total smoking proportion among adolescents – even in cases where programmes are effective for participants.</p>
<p>In this trial we tested the effect of an ASC intervention on all daily adolescent smokers at 22 continuation schools for students aged 15–21. Our main research questions were whether the intervention was effective in reaching a sizeable amount of the adolescent daily smokers and whether it was effective in increasing the 1-month- and 14-month cessation rates among all baseline daily smokers.</p>

<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>We conducted a randomised controlled trial of an adolescent smoking cessation intervention for students aged 15–21 at 22 continuation schools in Denmark.</p>
<sec id="section3-1403494811435488">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>All 15 counties in Denmark were contacted and offered participation in the research project. To participate, each county had to enrol two continuation schools for students in the age group of 15–21 year. Continuation schools include all school types aimed at students aged +15. In collaboration with the counties we decided to restrict the study to either commercial or social and health schools. From the commercial schools, one educational line Higher commercial education (HHX) could be considered as upper secondary school and one educational line Vocational Commercial Training (HG) as lower secondary school. The social and health schools should be considered as lower secondary school. All schools contacted were informed that participation involved the collection of three rounds of a self-administered questionnaire and that they would receive the intervention in either year 1 (intervention) or year 2 (waiting list controls). Eleven counties volunteered to enrol in the project with a total of 18 commercial and four social and health schools.</p>
<p>The randomisation was done by flipping a coin. In order to minimise the effects of geographical and school type differences we blocked the randomisation process in such a way that each county comprised both intervention and control schools, and that both the intervention and the control group consisted of nine commercial and two social and health schools. Due to variation in school size and the number of school divisions at the schools, the randomisation yielded eight divisions of higher and nine divisions of lower education in the intervention group, and six and nine divisions of higher and lower education in the control group, respectively.</p>
<p>At each school a coordinator was responsible of collecting data from students of the relevant educational lines and the collection of data followed the same procedures at the intervention and the control schools. Self-administered questionnaires were collected in week 5/2005 (baseline), week 11/2005 (first follow up, short term) and week 11/2006 (second follow up, long term). Each questionnaire had an anonymous identification code (date of births, month of birth, and first two letters of their first name).</p>
<p>Since we wanted to test the effect of the intervention on the school level (and considered all baseline daily smokers as “intervention” in the analysis) we created two “independent” cohorts and did not exclude non-responders from first follow up from the long-term cohort. The cohorts were created by merging respondents from baseline with respondents of first follow up and respondents of second follow up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1403494811435488">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1403494811435488">2</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>All schools collected baseline data, but unfortunately school identification codes were missing from students from one social and health school in the control group. Since we could not exclude that single questionnaires from the other schools had missing school identification codes the school was not included. At second follow up, one intervention school lost the collected data and one school from the control group collected data from a wrong school division.</p>
<p>In addition, some students were absent the day of data-collection and some had filled in the identification code wrongly, which caused fewer matching pairs in the cohorts.</p>
<p>The final sample consisted of 514 baseline daily smokers in the short-term follow-up group and 369 baseline daily smokers in the long-term follow-up group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1403494811435488">
<title>Attrition</title>
<p>The reasons for attrition in the study were: change of address, not at school on the data collection day, misfiling in the identification code, and school handling of questionnaires. However, we checked whether there was a difference between those who only responded to baseline (drop outs) with those who also responded to the first follow up and found significant differences regarding sex, ethnicity, educational level, and girl/boyfriend smoking. However, except regarding educational level, these differences were similar for both the intervention and the control group and therefore we do not think that attrition in the study was selected.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1403494811435488">
<title>Intervention</title>
<p>The intervention development was based on the methodology of intervention mapping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494811435488">8</xref>]. This methodology revealed that successful quitting was related to a line of performances or sub-behaviours, which, in turn, was found to be related to specific change and learning objectives (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494811435488">Table I</xref>).</p>

<p>Theoretically the intervention was based on Self-regulation theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494811435488">9</xref>], the Trans Theoretical model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494811435488">10</xref>], and Social Cognitive theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494811435488">11</xref>]. In practice, the intervention was based on open events where all smokers and exsmokers were offered the following: (1) Carbon monoxide measurement; (2) a personal and short counselling based on motivational interviewing focused on motivation for quitting, management of cigarette craving, problem solving, and development of cessation skills; (3) self-help materials with a combination of quit-guides and various postcards/materials; (4) referral to a smoking cessation programme using the internet, text messages (SMS), and e-mail; and (5) referral to telephone counselling. Participation was voluntary and the participants did not have to register for the intervention. The students participated because they either passed by the cessation stand by chance when visiting the school canteen or because they were encouraged by friends or classmates. On average each counselling session took 3–5 minutes.</p>
<p>The events took place centrally at the school (typically in the canteen) in the time period 10.00–13.00 and were offered once a week in four sequential weeks. The counselling was carried out by experienced nurses who had attended a minimum of 3-day smoking cessation counselling course and in addition were trained directly for this project.</p>
<p>The intervention took place in the weeks 6–10 (2004) at the intervention schools and in the weeks 13–16 (2005) at the control schools after the second follow up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494811435488">12</xref>].</p>

<sec id="section6-1403494811435488">
<title>Measurements</title>
<sec id="section7-1403494811435488">
<title>Smoking</title>
<p>Assessment of smoking status was based on self-reports. Participants were asked whether they smoked daily, weekly, once a month, or were non-smokers. In addition, we asked for smoking consumption, years of smoking, and previous smoking.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1403494811435488">
<title>Cessation</title>
<p>Short- and long-term quitters were defined as students who were daily smokers at baseline and: (1) had quitted smoking within the last 30 days at first follow up (students answered “No, I do not smoke” and also stated that “Yes I have quitted and have been smoke free for the last 1–7 days” or “Yes I have quitted and have been smoke free for the last 7–30 days”); and (2) had been smoke-free for at least the last 30 days at second follow up (students answered “No, I do not smoke” and also stated that “Yes, I have quitted and have been smoke free for the last 1–6 months” or “Yes, I have quitted and have been smoke free for more than the last 6 months”).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1403494811435488">
<title>Cessation attempt</title>
<p>Short-term quitters were defined as students who were daily smokers at baseline and: (1) had either quit smoking; or (2) had tried to quit smoking within the last 30 days at first follow up (to the question “have you tried to quit smoking?”, students answered “yes, within the last month?”). Long-term quitters were defined as students who were daily smokers at baseline and: (1) had either quitted smoking; or (2) had tried to quit smoking within the last 14 months at second follow up (to the question “have you tried to quit smoking?”, students answered “yes, within the last 14 months?”).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1403494811435488">
<title>Intention to quit</title>
<p>According to the Trans Theoretical Model, smokers and exsmokers can be subdivided into: pre-contemplation (no actual plans for quitting), contemplation (plans for quitting within next six months), preparation plans for quitting within next month), or action (quitted smoking within 6 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494811435488">10</xref>]. By comparing the baseline status to the status at follow up, we determined whether a negative stage progression (moving to a stage closer to the pre-contemplation stage), a positive stage progression (moving to a stage closer to the action stage), or no progression had been made.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1403494811435488">
<title>Self-efficacy</title>
<p>Participants were asked to indicate on a five point Likert scale from “definitely” to “definitely not” if they thought they could refrain from smoking in 12 typical smoking triggering situations (e.g. “Do you think that you can refrain from smoking if you spend time with people who smoke”). We created a scale from the 12 items (Cronbach’s alpha=0.87) and calculated the sum of change for all 12 items from baseline to first follow up.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1403494811435488">
<title>Health beliefs, knowledge, and attitudes towards cessation</title>
<p>Participants were asked to indicate on a five point Likert scale from “agreed” to “disagreed” with statements regarding: (1) health beliefs (seven items), e.g. “Smoking is damaging to health”; (2) knowledge of cessation support (one item), “I know where young people can get help to quit smoking”; (3) cessation preparation strategies (five items), e.g. “If I were to quit smoking, I would quit from one day to the next”; (4) individual cessation strategies (seven items), e.g. “If I were to quit smoking, I would eat candy, fruit, or something else when I felt the urge to smoke”; and (5) strategies for obtaining social support (five items), e.g. “If I were to quit smoking, I would tell my closest friends that I was quitting”. We tested for correlation between the items regarding health beliefs. However the Cronbach alpha was too low to justify scale construction. Therefore we analysed the items individually.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1403494811435488">
<title>Decisional balance</title>
<p>We measured decisional balance by asking the students to indicate whether or not they agreed to 20 (10 positive and 10 negative) statements about smoking (example positive statement: “Smoking is good when you are bored”; example negative statement: “My parents do not like that I smoke”). If students agreed with a positive statement they got +1 and if they agreed with a negative statement they got −1. In cases with no indication they got 0. We calculated the total decisional balance by summing up all statements.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1403494811435488">
<title>Communication about smoking</title>
<p>To test whether the intervention did put smoking “on the agenda” of the youths, we asked whether they had talked “more than usual”, “as usual”, or “less than usual” about smoking with their friends within the last 2 weeks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1403494811435488">
<title>Social influence</title>
<p>To describe social influence we asked about “parents smoking”, “sibling smoking”, “girlfriend/boyfriend smoking”, “best friends smoking”, and “perceived number of smokers among friends”.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1403494811435488">
<title>Background factors</title>
<p>In addition we asked for the following background factors: “school type”, “sex”, “ethnicity”, and “age”.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1403494811435488">
<title>Reach of intervention</title>
<p>At first follow up, we asked whether the students had received any type of information material concerning smoking at the school and whether they had received any type of counselling/carbon monoxide measurements (from none/one/two/three/four/more than four times) within the last 5 weeks.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section18-1403494811435488">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Analyses were performed as intention to treat and therefore all baseline smokers were included at both intervention and control schools when determining intervention effects. A significance level of α=0.05 was used. Since data were collected from schools we tried to evaluate the effect of clusters by school using multilevel analysis. However, due to low counts of subjects in either of the two outcome categories for the 22 different schools in the two different conditions, it was not possible to perform this type of analysis when including both intervention and school as factors in the analysis. Instead, ordinary logistic regression was used in the analysis of results regarding “smoking cessation” and “quit attempts”. It was, however, possible to perform multilevel analysis when including only the random factor school in the analysis. These analyses gave no indication of differences between the schools for the outcome variables (that is no indication of “school interdependency”). The statistical software for the analysis was SAS version 9.1.</p>

<p>To check whether our randomisation was successful or we had to control for possible confounding factors, we checked whether there was an equal distribution between the intervention and the control group regarding all relevant factors measured (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494811435488">Table II</xref>). In the short-term follow up, we found more students in higher education and more of Danish ethnicity in the intervention group. In addition, fewer had a girl/boyfriend who was a smoker and self-efficacy was higher among students in the intervention group.

<p>We found large variation in intervention reach between schools: ranging from 81.8% of student reporting having received either counselling or/and written material in the best example to 33.4% in the worst case. We were not able to fully explore this variation on the basis on the data available, but in one school the counsellor reported that the school had been closed due to a snow storm at two of the intervention days, and in another school the counsellor reported that facilities for delivering the intervention were poor due to the refurbishing of the school canteen.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this paper we have presented the evaluation of an adolescent smoking cessation intervention aimed at continuation schools in Denmark. The intervention could be described as a “minimal” intervention based on short counselling and a range of self-help materials. We found positive short-term effects of the intervention regarding cessation, self-efficacy, and intention to quit, but did not find any changes with regard to health beliefs, knowledge of cessation support, and attitudes towards cessation. After 1 year we did not find any differences between the intervention and the control schools.</p>
<p>This lack of long-term intervention success can be caused by many factors. Interventions can address the wrong determinants, set up the wrong change objectives, or use inappropriate methods or strategies. In addition, seemingly well-developed programmes can be poorly implemented either because they are not used or because they are executed improperly. Since there is a strong agreement between the theoretical basis of our intervention and the recommendations from major review in the area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494811435488">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494811435488">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494811435488">14</xref>], it is unlikely that we selected the wrong theoretical methods for our intervention. This idea is further supported by the fact that we did find short-term behavioural change accomplished by changes in both self-efficacy and cessation intentions. However, the fact that the intervention did not change health beliefs, knowledge of cessation support, and attitudes towards cessation, indicate that not all methods had the desired effect. Seemingly appropriate methods might be ineffective if conditions are inadequately taken into consideration. One possible interpretation of our results is that the format with short counselling and self-help materials did not provide the necessary conditions for achieving long-term effects simply because it was not comprehensive enough. In short, one could say that we chose the right methods but the wrong strategy (short counselling).</p>
<p>Others have shown that interventions developed on the same cognitive–behavioural basis as ours can have long-term effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494811435488">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494811435488">15</xref>]. These interventions are more comprehensive and based on formal enrolment in a cessation course approach, indicating a dose–response relations ship between intensiveness of counselling and the behavioural outcome.</p>
<p>The intervention was successful in reaching more than half of all daily smokers in the target group with more than 30% receiving counselling at least once in the intervention period. This indicates that in spite of the numerous studies indicating that adolescents have rather negative perceptions towards smoking cessation interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494811435488">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494811435488">18</xref>], there is a strong interest for taking part in interventions as long as participation is made available in the youth environment and do not require too much difficulty.</p>
<p>In future research it would be interesting to see if this approach can be combined with other more intensive interventions like group counselling, individual counselling, or intensive internet support.</p>
<sec id="section30-1403494811435488">
<title>Strengths and limitations</title>
<p>In this trial we used a cluster-randomised design to test the effects of an ASC intervention on the whole group of baseline daily smokers. Therefore, we did not have the usual problems seen in non-randomised trials with baseline differences between intervention participants and controls (e.g. differences in motivation/intentions towards quitting). However, this study also had some limitations potentially biasing the results of the study:</p>
<p>The randomisation process yielded an unequal distribution of numbers of students in lower and higher education, ethnicity, self-efficacy, and boy/girlfriend smoking between the control and intervention schools. However, when controlling for these potential confounders we found no effect of any of the intervention effects.</p>
<p>The relatively high attrition in the study has limited the efficiency of the study. However, except for the factor “school type”, there was not differential attrition between the intervention and control group.</p>
<p>Multilevel analysis with the factor “intervention” included in the model did not converge due to small numbers. Therefore it was not possible to adjust for possible school effects in the analysis and we cannot exclude that we have overestimated the precision in our results. However, multilevel analysis of single variables indicated no effects of school level. In addition, the matched design took into account possible effects of geographical and school type differences. Third, since only two school types were enrolled, little variation could be expected between schools. We therefore assume that there was only a limited chance that school influences have biased our results.</p>
<p>We had no biochemical validation of self-reports on smoking. Although self-reports have been found reliable in many adolescent smoking studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494811435488">19</xref>], there is still debate on this issue, especially in cases where self-reports are used in controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494811435488">20</xref>]. Potential unreliability in self-reports would only be a major problem if there was a difference in reliability of self-reports between the intervention and the control group. One way of optimising self-reporting is to secure strict confidentiality of the responses. Confidentiality procedures were carefully applied in this study.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We evaluated the effect of an easily implemented adolescent smoking cessation intervention. The intervention was successful in reaching more than half of all daily smokers in the target group with more than 30% receiving counselling at least once in the intervention period. We found modest short-term effects on smoking cessation, self-efficacy, and intentions to quit smoking, but none of these effects were sustained at the 1-year follow up. Additional research is needed to develop interventions that can maintain effects.</p>
