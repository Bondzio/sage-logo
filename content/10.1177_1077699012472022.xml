<p>This engrossing, wide-ranging history of American journalism from the colonial era to the present makes a tremendous contribution to mass communication education by being that rarest kind of textbook—one that reads like literature instead of CliffsNotes. Covering all the bases, from the Zenger trial to the Huffington Post, and with excursions into much lesser known histories across news media, <italic>Covering America</italic> makes perfect and enjoyable mandatory reading for undergraduate and graduate classes in journalism history.</p>
<p>Christopher Daly, an associate professor at Boston University’s Journalism Department, approaches this monumental historical survey with the reportorial flair appropriate for a former Associated Press and <italic>Washington Post</italic> journalist, which sets it apart from more pedagogical classics like Emery, Emery, and Roberts’s <italic>The Press and America</italic>. Literally from the first line, Daly grabs the reader with striking, cinematic details that make the past come alive. Page 1 opens with a teenage Benjamin Franklin skulking along the dark streets of eighteenth-century Boston, trying to put one over his brother in order to start his writing career—and the readers are hooked, be they scholars who have been teaching colonial journalism for years, like this reviewer, or freshmen who might have never heard of Franklin.</p>
<p>Similarly intimate visual vignettes are peppered throughout the next nearly five hundred pages, including an iconic Ed Murrow “sitting on a bench in a White House hallway, chain-smoking Camel cigarettes” as FDR decides how to react to just-received news of Pearl Harbor. At the other end of the press–government relationship spectrum, we are treated to the image of President Nixon dancing at the White House wedding of his daughter at the very same moment when “the typesetters and pressmen at the [<italic>New York</italic>] <italic>Times</italic> started printing” the Pentagon Papers stories.</p>
<p>Most helpful for classroom use, in all these cases and across the volume, Daly assumes no prior historical knowledge on the readers’ part, and retells the basics of U.S. history through the eyes of the journalists and media owners who put its first draft in front of the American people. Most chapters even conclude with short summaries of how their main characters—from Franklin to David Halberstam—ended up, much like the end titles in documentaries, so that no gaps are left in a remarkably comprehensive story.</p>
<p>Some journalism historians might object that this volume skates very close to the “Great Men” tradition. The narrative focus is unabashedly on the major figures that made journalism what it is (and yes, for the vast majority of the three hundred years covered it was mostly white men). As Daly puts it repeatedly, social, political, economic, and technological developments influenced the shape of journalism, but for the major shifts to happen, “somebody had to <italic>do</italic> something.” Since this book’s main audience is not the specialist, focusing on the adventures of those various “somebodies” at the expense of scholarly interpretative controversy seems an effective trade-off for terrific storytelling that gets the major points across memorably.</p>
<p>In addition, the book does make two fundamental conceptual arguments that give it depth and a unifying thread. Daly argues that journalism has been central to the history of the country. From the early Republic Party press all the way to today’s blogs (which, as Daly notes, are not that different), the media history narrated in the volume shows how journalism helped shape American life. Sometimes, it has done so with nefarious effects, but also with a “long tradition of service to humanity.” That service, however, has recurrently been imperiled by the practice of journalism as a business.</p>
<p>The most heartfelt, compelling question raised is the strange bed fellowship of journalism and money. At the end of chapter 12, which focuses on the Pentagon Papers and Watergate and is perhaps the book’s best, Daly reflects on what he feels was the “apotheosis” of the raison d’être for independent, aggressive journalism: “Build a big enough audience so that you can make enough money to tell anyone to go to hell. The risk of such an attitude is sounding arrogant, but without it there is no real journalism.” But money, as the book shows, is not always a journalist’s friend—not when it has meant acquiescence to governmental or corporate interests, not when it is intended to fatten shareholders’ wallets instead of newsgathering operations, and not when it is made by pandering to the evil twin of mass interest, the enduring prurient passion for celebrity scandals and gore.</p>
<p>For an overview book, the level of detail is astounding, especially since it does not detract from the narrative flow. With illuminating forays into law, technology, and policy making, readers are introduced to pamphleteers, editors, reporters, columnists, and broadcasters, from Thomas Paine to Matt Drudge by way of Horace Greeley, Ida B. Wells, Adolph Ochs, Harry Luce, and less obvious figures, such as Harold Ross and Walter Winchell. From the smelly printing equipment in colonial shops to the Supreme Court justices’ opinions and the account behind the iconic napalm-burned Vietnamese girl photograph, there are no major stories left untold. Striking quotes straight from the media—the <italic>Liberator</italic>’s opening editorial, Ernie Pyle’s Captain Waskow’s tribute, Earl Caldwell’s report of the King assassination—enrich the atmospheric narrative.</p>
<p>Until, that is, the digital era: The one major criticism of this volume is that its treatment of what Daly calls the last major period of journalism history, the digital revolution from the mid-1990s onward, is unsatisfactorily perfunctory. The entire digital era gets a twenty-page chapter that does not even mention such critical developments as the rise of fake news shows or shattering scandals such as the Jayson Blair affair, which is hinted at in the conclusion.</p>
<p>Writing what amounts to a history of the present is certainly difficult, but the end of the book feels abrupt, and the first decade of the twenty-first century deserves the same lively, in-depth study as the other eras so masterfully narrated. Despite that shortcoming, this volume is a top-choice main history textbook and reference work for journalism educators, researchers, and students at all levels.</p>
