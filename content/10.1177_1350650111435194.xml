<abstract>
<p>Friction composite materials based on combinatorial variations of fly ash and graphite were fabricated and evaluated on Krauss friction tester under inertia-braking mode following the ECE R-90 regulation. The frictional responses, such as friction fade at elevated temperatures and friction recovery on cooling, of the composites have demonstrated three regimes of friction evolution irrespective of the composition and the test runs. The composite with the highest fly ash content (i.e. 65 wt.%) and without graphite, shows the highest frictional performance, comparable frictional fluctuation, permissible fading but the highest wear with the highest rise in disc temperature. The composite with 60 wt.% fly ash in combination with 5 wt.% graphite showed higher frictional performance, permissible fading, lower wear volume and relatively lesser rise in disc temperature. However, the other composites having &lt;60 wt.% fly ash and &gt;5 wt.% graphite contents show unacceptable frictional level and friction-fade characteristics. Recovery performances of all composites remained above 100%. The study comprehensively established that composite material with ≥60 wt.% fly ash content in combination with ≤5 wt.% graphite content is functionally ideal to meet the desired performance requirements. Analysis of frictional data revealed the predominance of fade coefficient, whereas material coefficient remained minimally influential. Wear data analysis indicates that the inherent material factor predominates the wear performance followed by temperature-induced effects. Among the fade and recovery influences, the recovery coefficient has been observed to be predominant over the fade coefficient in the determination of the wear behaviour. Worn surface morphology revealed the role of topographical attributes in controlling the friction and wear performances.</p>

<p>Continuous efforts to counter resource depletion via the usage of industrial wastes in several non-critical structural and functional components/applications have remained intense in the recent times owing to stringent environment regulations implemented globally. In this regard, management, containment and reuse of industrial waste such as fly ash generated due to coal combustion in a massive scale in thermal power plants have been a challenge. Automotive composites such as friction materials, as a multi-component heterogeneous system, integrally comprise a large amount of mineral fillers which can potentially be replaced by fly ash. Recently, the use of fly ash in friction composites has been reported by several researchers that the friction and wear performance can be enhanced when fly ash is incorporated into the formulations. In this regard, Mohanty and Chugh,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350650111435194">1</xref></sup> Malhotra and Valimbe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350650111435194">2</xref></sup> and Dadkar et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350650111435194">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350650111435194">4</xref></sup> have carried out an extensive work. These reports independently establish the potential of fly ash in enhancing the mechanical, thermo-physical and tribological properties of friction materials as automotive brake pads. The right combination of particle size (20–30 μm), high specific heat (∼800 kJ/kg K) with poor thermal conductivity of fly ash is a key to enhance the tribological performance at the braking interfaces. Additionally, fly ash can enhance the abrasion resistance and porosity of composites and hence can augment the specific performance of the composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350650111435194">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>In light of the above literatures, the present investigation aims to examine fly ash as potential multi-functional filler having promising commercial prospects in brake linings. This study aims to study the role of fly ash-graphite combination in controlling the friction and wear performance of phenolic-based reinforced friction composites to fundamentally evaluate the dynamic interplay of the four representative classes of ingredients used in friction materials (i.e. binder, filler, fibre and friction modifier) and their possible consequences onto the friction-fade and friction-recovery performances.</p>

<p>Composites based on the various ingredients used in the formulation (as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1350650111435194">Table 1</xref>) amounting to 100% by weight were fabricated as per the fabrication conditions and procedure mentioned in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1350650111435194">Table 2</xref>. Plough shear mixer is used to ensure mechanical isotropy while mixing. The moulding conditions are adopted as per the curing isotherm of the matrix novolac resin. The adhesive-coated back plates of mild steel support the mould cavity. Volatiles released during curing were expelled via multiple intermittent breathings, so as to prevent cracking of the composites. Finally, post-curing of the composite pads was carried out in an oven to relieve the frozen-in/moulded-in stresses. Then, the samples were surface polished and used for the evaluation of various physical, mechanical and tribo-properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350650111435194">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350650111435194">6</xref></sup>

<sec id="sec4-1350650111435194"><title>Physical, mechanical and surface characterization</title>
<p>The finished composites were physically and mechanically characterized for their density, ash content, acetone extractable, void content, hardness, shear strength and compressibility. The ash content is determined as loss of weight due to burning of organic matter at a very high temperature ≈850°C, for 6 h in the muffle furnace. Acetone extraction test of the cured powdered mix has been carried out using Soxhlet apparatus to estimate the amount of uncured resin or any other organic fraction to define the composites more accurately. Rockwell hardness was measured on digital hardness tester on R-scale. The distribution of surface hardness confirms mechanical isotropy achieved while mixing the ingredients. Cross-breaking/shear strength was measured on a universal testing machine (model: UTN 20, S.No:9/83-603) from Fuel Instruments and Engineers Private Limited, India. It indicates composite integrity throughout the bulk and adhesion with back plate. The compressibility of the composites was determined to measure the strain-along-thickness under elastic loads as per industrial practice. The on-set to degradation temperature of the composites in pre-braking and post-braking scenarios were determined by conducting thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) at a heating rate of 20°C/min using thermal analyser from TA instruments. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out on Zeiss electron microscope to analyse the associated wear mechanisms and topographical attributes responsible in controlling the tribological performance.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1350650111435194"><title>Tribological performance evaluation method</title>
<p>The fade and recovery tests were conducted on Krauss-type inertia-controlled friction testing machine with data acquisition capability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350650111435194">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350650111435194">6</xref></sup> The rotor disc is connected to a shaft through an interchangeable flange that has a moment of inertia of 2.5 kg-m<sup>2</sup> and rotates at 660 r/min. This acts as a source of generation of kinetic energy. Two brake pads with a total area of 30 cm<sup>2</sup> were press-fit into a pressure-actuated sliding calliper assembly. Pads were forced against opposite sides of the rotor disc at a mean contact radius of 95 mm. The loads on the pads were adjusted to keep the applied contact pressure of 2 MPa. A load cell mounted on the frame carrying the calliper pad assembly was used to measure the friction force. The nominal surface temperature of the pad and disc was measured using thermocouples touched against the circumference width of the disc. For the recovery cycle, in order to evaluate the cold friction-fade and friction-recovery characteristics of the prepared composites, standard regulatory test PVW-3212 as per ECE R-90 standards is followed. The friction force and temperature rise of the disc surface were recorded after every cycle of braking in a synchronized manner. For this study, a pearlitic grey cast iron rotor disc with a diameter of 215 mm, thickness of 10.5 mm and a hardness of 183–212 HB was used as mating counterface. The Krauss machine is interfaced with computer for feeding the operational input and data acquisition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1350650111435194"><title>Procedure for standard fade-recovery test as per ECE R-90 standard</title>
<p>The procedure consists of two major parts, viz. bedding run and the actual testing cycle run. Bedding cycle was carried out in order to ensure more than 80% conformal contact which was confirmed by an optical microscope. For this, the polished pad surface were allowed to bed-in for the initial 30 brakings of 10 s each, under the normal braking pressure/load of 2 MPa and the speed of the rotor disc maintained at 600 r/min in such a manner that the temperature rise of the disc does not exceed 280°C. However, in case temperature exceeds the limit, it was allowed to cool down till the temperature is brought to 100°C by intermittent use of air blower. Thus, controlled friction-induced thermal history is ensured by the bedding cycle. After the bedding cycle, the actual testing cycles resumes. The friction-assessment test cycles consists of seven steps/runs, viz. one cold run, five fade runs and one recovery run. Each run is of 10 brakings with 10 s as the braking duration. Thus, in the complete test cycle, total number of brakings would be 70. In cold friction run, the initial temperature was maintained at 45°C. This is followed by five fade runs termed as 1st, 2nd, 3 rd, 4th and 5th fades. Each fade run begins with initial temperature of 100°C and it uninterruptedly rises until the run completes. The subsequent fade proceeds similarly. Finally, after 5th fade run, recovery run (7th and the ultimate cycle of PVW-3212/ECE R-90 standard test) begins in which the disc was cooled down to a temperature of 100°C with the help of air blower. The friction force and the temperature rise of the disc surface were recorded after every cycle of the braking in a synchronized manner. With the help of in-build software in the machine, averaging and plotting of <italic>µ</italic> were done. The wear of the tribo-pairs, i.e. disc and brake pads were measured in terms of the change in thickness and weight loss before and after the tests. The <italic>µ</italic>-fade (<italic>µ</italic><sub>f</sub>), <italic>µ</italic>-recovery (<italic>µ</italic><sub>r</sub>) and <italic>µ</italic>-performance (<italic>µ</italic><sub>p</sub>) were calculated as the average <italic>µ</italic> across the fade cycle, recovery cycle and the whole 70 braking (as per ECE R-90 protocols) instances, respectively. The worn surface morphologies of the composite pads after the completion of the braking performance evaluation protocol are subjected to SEM on a Zeiss electron microscope to study the contact patches formation–destruction dynamics vis-à-vis the topographical attributes.</p>

<sec id="sec8-1350650111435194"><title>Physical and mechanical characteristics of the composite</title>
<p>The density, void content and the acetone extractable fraction remained almost same as the fly ash content decreases, i.e. physical properties apparently show non-dependence on the composition in the investigated range. Slight variations in the hardness across the composition may be attributed to the fact that friction materials are multi-component porous materials and incorporation of vermiculite and graphite with fly ash having broad particle size distribution (∼5–100 μm). Additionally, the macroscopic packing-related structural fluctuations of the composite due to disparate nature of the ingredients also contribute to the statistical nature of mechanical response of such composites. The shear strength observed to be composition independent barring FG-2, whereas compressibility showed an increasing trend. Further, the thermo-oxidative and thermo-mechanical stabilities of all composites have also been found to be enhanced an aspect apparent from TGA investigations. In general, the standard variations/deviations in performance properties remained within the permissible limits of industrial norms.</p>

The decrease in friction coefficient with the addition of graphite is theoretical, though expected the presence of fly ash-graphite combination has been seen to cause a composition-dependent friction build-up and friction-decay phenomenon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350650111435194">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>It is observed from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1350650111435194">Figure 2</xref>, that <italic>µ</italic><sub>p</sub> decreased with the increase in graphite content and remained broadly in the range of ∼0.40–0.24.

Overall the frictional performance has been observed to be satisfactory for the friction materials with a fly ash content ≥60 wt.%, i.e. FG-1 and FG-2. This was attributed to the fact that fly ash particles potentially act as hard abrasives causing severe temperature build-up at the braking interface and thereby the abrasive component of wear and friction plays a dominant role in determining the overall tribological performance. The presence of higher amount of fly ash enhances susceptibility of the composites to undergo third-body-abrasion/rolling-abrasion effects at the braking interface which contributes to the rise in <italic>µ</italic>-performance vis-à-vis the disc temperature rise.

The fluctuations remains almost comparable for all, barring the composite FG-2 (with fly ash 60 wt.%) that shows surprisingly highest fluctuations. The frictional fluctuations attributed to the relatively unstable characteristics of the operating friction films at the braking junctions. The unstable nature of friction film is influenced by the mechano-chemical and surface energy interactions, which vary with the compositional ratio of fly ash-to-graphite and their diffusive interactions with the grey cast iron rotor disc during braking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350650111435194">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350650111435194">8</xref></sup> Theoretically, the frictional fluctuations should be as least as possible to avoid any fiction-induced noise and vibrations.</p>

<p>The recovery performance of all the composites remained well above the desirable range, i.e. &gt;100%. During the recovery cycle, the in situ dynamics of the formation–deformation–reformation of friction films predominate the friction recovery, an aspect that rests upon the composition of friction film formed. The elastically and plastically deforming nature of the friction films at the braking interfaces has been reported to be dependent on composition by Trefilov.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350650111435194">7</xref></sup> The cooling down of braking surface to room temperature, the friction film that comprising of loosely attached wear debris particles, disintegrates eventually exposing the surface underneath that is relatively harder. The wear debris so broke loose from the braking interface may get entrapped in the mating zone and may act as hard abrasives (as third bodies) leading to third body abrasion (TBA). Such effects consequently enhance abrasive-action via rolling-abrasion mechanism and thereby frictional response gets restored to the original level of tangential traction called as recovery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350650111435194">9</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350650111435194">11</xref></sup> It has further been observed that the fade, recovery, wear and temperature rise of the disc are viciously interdependent. As the temperature rise of the disc drops across the composition variations, recovery and wear performance improves, whereas fade performance deteriorates. The maximum disc temperature rise remained above 450°C for the compositions with ≥60 wt.% of fly ash, whereas the temperature rise dropped below 400°C for the compositions with ≤60 wt.% of fly ash in the friction composites. These thermal-induced effects have been observed to cause systematic changes in fade, recovery and wear losses.</p>

<p>The maximum temperature rise of the disc and wear performance of the composites in terms of weight loss and pad thickness loss are shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1350650111435194">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1350650111435194">6</xref>. The order of wear volume is FG-1 ≫ FG-2 ≥ FG-3 ≥ FG-4 and that of maximum temperature rise in disc is FG-1 (∼600°C) &gt;FG-2 (∼475°C) &gt;FG-3(∼400°C) &gt;FG-4 (∼380°C). The trend of wear of composites and rise in disc temperature qualitatively remained similar indicating that the wear mechanism may possibly be thermally activated. However, on a quantitative look the wear showed a substantial drop from FG-1 to FG-2 followed by FG-3 and FG-4. Such observations indicate that in the case of FG-1 with the highest amount of fly ash and with the maximum disc temperature rise the wear may be an outcome of simultaneous contribution of disc rubbing, thermal degradation and thermal fatigue-induced surface cracks leading to the generation of higher amount of wear debris. Overall, the magnitude of wears remained comparable in all the graphite-filled compositions. The comparable wears in the graphite filled compositions may be attributed to the fact that presence of graphite may cause the formation of a smooth lubricating film on the friction material surface causing a lower temperature rise (∼380–475°C) on one hand and reduced contribution of abrasion/ploughing effects due to arrested direct intervention of hard ceramic fly ash particles in the friction mating zone. The inclusion of adequate combination of graphite with fly ash leads to enhanced thermo-oxidative and thermo-mechanical stabilities, an aspect which was also evident from TGA, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1350650111435194">Table 3</xref>.</p>
<p>Compositionally, FG-1 with the highest fly ash content, i.e. 65 wt.% exhibits the highest temperature rise of the disc (∼600°C) and the highest wear volume. This may be attributed firstly to the fact that (i) resin content becomes insufficient to bind the powdery contents because of their overall larger bulk surface area relative to other composites, secondly to (ii) the highest rise in interfacial temperature as evident from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1350650111435194">Figure 5</xref> may have led to rapid pyrolysis of the resin causing a consequent reduction in the thermo-mechanical integrity of the composite eventually resulting into more wear debris and thirdly (iii) fly ash particles acting as mild abrasives qualitatively enchances the abrasive contribution via grooving/ploughing action.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350650111435194">12</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350650111435194">17</xref></sup> These combined effects cause not only higher frictional performance and interfacial temperature at the braking junctions but also cause low fading as was aleady shown and discussed in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1350650111435194">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1350650111435194">5</xref>.</p>
<p>The wear volume decline sharply and becomes almost same for the later compositions, while rise in disc temperature continually fall from ∼475°C in FG-2 to ∼400°C in FG-3 to ∼380°C in FG-4. In these composites, content of fly ash was decreased that is complenented by a corresponding increase in graphite content. In presence of graphite, friction film rapidly forms at rubbing interface and has good adhesion with rotor and pad surface, that enhances lubricating action which ultimately reduces wear volume. The lubricity of graphite is known to depend on the absorbed moisture; hence, it shows drastic reduction in lubricity at higher temperature where it may act as a mild abrasive in conjunction with hard abrasive fly ash particles. Addition of higher lubricant leads to higher adhesive than abrasive contribution, which results in formation–deformation–reformation of smooth and continuous friction films (resin–fly ash–graphite layers), indicating role of lubricants in wear minimization and stabilization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350650111435194">9</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350650111435194">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350650111435194">18</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350650111435194">20</xref></sup></p>

The lower magnification images show the overview of the topographic features and the formation of contact patches, whereas the higher magnification images have enabled the investigation of the underlying modes of contact patch formation such as plastic flow and debris compaction. The micrographs reveal distinct characteristics of friction film/contact patches/wear debris formation with compositional variations. The fibrous and other constituents are clearly visible in the morphology of wear surface. The micrograph corresponding to FG-1 reveals porous surface morphology with rough surface as indicated by the dislodged fly ash particles, fibre-debonding and pulled-out fibres that are scattered across worn surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1350650111435194">Figure 7</xref>(a)). In such composites, the abrasive wear mode primarily dominates the wear mechanism, since thermally activated fatigue-induced contact patch damage-assisted wear debris generation promotes TBA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1350650111435194">Figure 7</xref>(a)(ii)). This is responsible for the highest frictional response combined with the least fading tendency vis-à-vis the highest wear and the highest rise in disc temperature, as has been observed. The surface micrograph of FG-2 reveals more contact patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1350650111435194">Figure 7</xref>(b)(i)), consisting of agglomeration of fly ash particles of about ∼2–10 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1350650111435194">Figure 7</xref>(b)(ii)) and other ingredients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1350650111435194">Figure 7</xref>(b)). The wear phenomenon in such composites is controlled by transition from abrasion-dominated to adhesive and fatigue mechanisms due to the formation of smooth graphitic contact patches. The topographical attributes in terms of roughness in FG-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1350650111435194">Figure 7</xref>(b)(i)) are lesser than those in FG-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1350650111435194">Figure 7</xref>(a)(i)) causing a lower disc temperature rise and lower wear. The reduction in wear is well recognized as an effect of friction film stabilization process. It is well reported that fatigue-induced subsurface damage adversely affects the nature of the operating friction film/friction patches by limiting the elasticity of the vicious formation–deformation–damage-reformation cycle of the friction film.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350650111435194">22</xref></sup> The surface micrographs of composites FG-3 and FG-4 having lower (55–50 wt.%) fly ash in combination with higher (10–15 wt.%) graphite content clearly reveals smooth and uniform friction film formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1350650111435194">Figure 7</xref>(c) and (d)(i)).

<p>The frictional responses of the composites have clearly demonstrated the three regimes of friction evolution irrespective of the composition and the test runs. The composite with 60 wt.% of fly ash and 5 wt.% graphite combination has led to the optimal level of tribological performance. The fade and recovery performance of the composites with ≤5 wt.% of graphite remained in the range of 15–20% and 100–120%, respectively. On increasing the graphite content above 5 wt.% in combination with 50–55 wt.% of fly ash has caused unacceptable level of fade and over-recovery. The fade-recovery and temperature rise of the disc have been critically analysed, and relationships between wear and composition have been found to be thermally activated. Analysis of frictional data comprehensively, indicates that the contribution of fade-coefficient predominates, which is closely followed by static friction and recovery coefficients. Wear data analysis indicates that the inherent material wear factor predominates the wear performance followed by temperature-induced effects. Among the fade and recovery influences, the recovery coefficient observed to be predominant over the fade coefficient in the determination of the wear behaviour. Worn surface morphology investigation revealed the dynamics of formation–destruction of the contact patches (friction layers) and topographical attributes to be largely responsible in controlling the friction and wear performance as a function of fly ash-to-graphite ratio in the composites.</p>
