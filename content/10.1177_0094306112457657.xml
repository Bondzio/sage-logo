<p>At first glance, these two books do not have much in common except being, in a popular sense, “global,” that is, not only about the United States. In <italic>Globalization in Crisis</italic>, a special issue of the journal <italic>Globalizations</italic>, Barry K. Gills has brought together high-profile scholars to examine the current financial crisis, asking whether it is a system-transforming crisis and where possible transformations might lead. This volume is not about globalization as a concept or set of processes, but rather about capitalism and its current crisis. The authors agree that there are many interlinking crises—food, energy, environmental, civilizational—intensifying since the 1970s. The crisis, therefore, is not new but rather reflects a decaying capitalist system and declining American hegemony. New forms of regulation or a return to Keynesianism will not resolve this systemic crisis, but rather something new must be tried. The authors in this book seek to develop a plan. Sociologists looking for systematic data analysis, research based on new sources, or engagement with globalization theories will be frustrated. This volume will likely interest those writing about the current crisis/crises, while some of the chapters may be useful for graduate courses on economic sociology and world systems theory.</p>
<p>Marion Fourcade’s <italic>Economists and Societies</italic> is a deeply sociological and scholarly book. She studies the economics professions in France, Great Britain, and the United States, examining the structures within which they have developed. Many sociologists will be drawn to her methodology. She takes what she calls a “critical organized comparison” approach, which brings together the analysis of objective conditions and subjective forces (p. 13). Objectively, national political culture creates the field in which economics professions in different countries develop. Institutions—especially the state, economic organizations, and the university—create this national culture or logic. This objective situation has subjective consequences. National political culture shapes economic thinking, economic practice, and what it means to be an economist. Therefore, Fourcade seeks to dispel the idea that the discipline of economics has intrinsic universality. Within their unique national political cultures, economists practice their profession, which Fourcade describes as: “American ‘scientific and commercial professionalism’”—within “the centrality of market institutions to U.S. political culture,” “British ‘public-minded elitism’ and French ‘statist divisions’” (p. 8). Economic practice in turn changes the state and political culture, transforming the conditions for economic knowledge production now towards neoliberal governance. Yet, any move toward an international or global economics profession will “neither erase the national structures nor stand separately from those structures. Rather, they play into the struggles that continuously reshape the national fields themselves” (p. 260). Therefore, the varieties of capitalism produce varieties of economics.</p>
<p>Sociologists and especially economic sociologists have developed new, innovative knowledge starting from criticisms of economists’ often abstract, non-empirical, market-advocating, methodologically individualist work. Fourcade contributes to this literature by demonstrating how national institutions and cultures shape economists’ work. The rich historical analysis of the three case studies is a great resource for those studying economics professions. Fourcade importantly integrates the self-perceptions of economists, exploring how they themselves understand their work as fundamentally different from that practiced in other countries. Her argument nicely complements the globalization literature that shows how nation-states still matter in a globalizing world and that dispels the view that the world is homogenizing. National contexts thus provide different opportunities for economics to “perform” economies. According to Fourcade, the U.S. context offers economists in the United States more opportunities to transform the American economy than the French context does for French economists. Fourcade contributes to economic sociology and the sociology of knowledge an exciting method incorporating structure and subjectivity.</p>
<p>Both books reviewed here share a view that economists trained in neoclassical or marginalist economics necessarily support free-market capitalism. In <italic>Globalization in Crisis</italic>, Heikki Patomäki discusses the neoclassical literature on finance and argues, “Deregulation, liberalization and optimism about the ‘outgrowths of the thriving free market system’ are not arbitrary policy choices, but rather stem from the neoclassical theory” (p. 70). Patomäki calls instead for a return to, and rethinking of, the ideas of Keynes and Minsky. Though not advocating specific economists, Fourcade similarly writes, “the new scientific methods and procedures of marginal analysis and statistics were the best defense against the perceived evils of radical political partisanship” (p. 80) and later “the key institutions in the U.S. research economy concentrated their support on those aspects of economics that were antagonistic neither to the interests of the United States nor to those of American capitalism” (p. 90). Both books present neoclassical economists, at least in the United States, as advocates for free market capitalism.</p>
<p>For Fourcade, the institutions of American capitalism shape not only economists’ work and self-perceptions, but also their very ideas. Her book is about “the codependence of ideas and institutions” (p. 242). However, it is difficult for the reader to gain an understanding of economists’ ideas beyond a general view that they are neoclassical or not, and that they are market-oriented or state-oriented. For example, American practices are presented in broad generalities—formal mathematical training, neoclassical economics, and an imperialistic attitude toward the social sciences—though she suggests that national political culture encourages American economists to support <italic>laissez-faire</italic> competitive markets, American capitalism, and neoclassical or marginalist price and growth theories. In contrast, French practices are more state-oriented, which makes French economic thought different from its American counterpart. According to Fourcade, French economic thought falls into three main schools shaped by three fundamentally different training and career tracks. However, these three main schools resemble the American economics presented: a <italic>laissez-faire</italic>, dogmatic tradition; a highly mathematical, marginalist tradition; and, in contrast to the American, a socio-historical tradition (p. 231). The economists interviewed perceived significant differences between American and French economics, though this perception is not necessarily the reality of their ideas, models, and methods.</p>
<p>Fourcade has clearly made the case for the centrality of national political cultures in economic work and in globalization more generally, though she has not as successfully linked the objective conditions of economics professions to the specific ideas (especially the theories and methods) used by economists. In the analysis, the ideas associated with each national economics profession seemed arbitrarily determined. Fourcade may not have gone far enough with her Bourdieuian analysis, and needed to study economists’ class, sub-class, and professional struggles and alliances within the often transnational world of their professional writings. This analysis requires more than a division into market-oriented cultures and state-oriented cultures.</p>
<p>Neoclassical economics has had a complex relationship to capitalism and socialism. The pioneers and innovators in mathematical economics and marginalism worked transnationally and moved their ideas through various national contexts. As I have discussed elsewhere, Austrian, German, Hungarian, and Russian economists brought mathematical economics from 1920s and 1930s Central Europe to Britain, France, and the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094306112457657">Bockman 2011</xref>). They had developed their ideas, moreover, within the crucible of many socialisms. In 1922, after working in the Hungarian Soviet Republic, Karl Polanyi argued that, since Marxism was a critical science of capitalism, marginalist economics provided the only economics for socialism. Neoclassical economists had long envisioned using the equations of a competitive market economy to plan states, replacing the auctioneer with a central planner. Central planner models promised to work as well in the Soviet state, as in the corporations and the military of Britain, France, and the United States. Today, economists continue to examine and reform economies from the perspective of a central planner.</p>
<p>For Polanyi and many others, the options were not markets or states. Polanyi found both a state-less market economy and a market-less centrally planned economy equally impossible, as well as authoritarian corporations highly undesirable. Instead, Polanyi argued for the embedding of the market in an economy organized by producer and consumer associations to create a socialism very different from that in the Soviet Union, and from the capitalisms in Britain, France, and the United States. By labeling national economies as either market-oriented or state-oriented, we lose sight of many alternatives, alternatives often based on firms and networks. The ownership and control of firms—the ownership and actual control of the means of production, rather than market exchange which Polanyi had shown had existed throughout human history—matter for socialism and workers. Neoclassical economics and different kinds of firms or networks—corporations, cooperatives, non-profits or other economic organizations—could be used to build a variety of systems. In Eastern Europe leading up to 1989, neoclassical economists envisioned their science as a tool for radically democratic market socialism. Therefore, in the mind of such economists, neoclassical economics might provide a path to the possible future presented by Samir Amin in the <italic>Globalization in Crisis</italic> volume: “the transition to world socialism” (p. 261). At the same time, Jeffrey Sachs and Milton Friedman could use neoclassical economics to support the transition to authoritarian neoliberal capitalism.</p>
<p>In her conclusion, Fourcade presents ways in which the international is refracted through the national, which provides an enticing avenue for future research. Building on her case study of France, one could study the variety of constituencies that economists have or might have: the nation-state, domestic capital, international finance, a socialist nation-state, the international proletariat, the Third World, the international precariat, women migrants, and so on. How have these constituencies changed (or how might they change) the nature of economic knowledge? The conditions for neoliberalism and for the spread of American “scientific and commercial professionalism” might lead to new, emerging forms not yet allied with states or capital. In the <italic>Globalization in Crisis</italic> volume, Saskia Sassen argues that fundamental changes in advanced capitalism are destroying traditional capitalist forms through expulsions and accumulation by dispossession. Her work suggests that new forms of solidarity might develop out of the transnational survival circuits and networks of the poor within the civicness of the global city. In the same volume, Henry Veltmeyer maintains that Latin American left-leaning regimes with state power, except Venezuela, have continued neoliberalism, but he notes that “in Latin America diverse popular and non- or anti-capitalist responses are paving the way for a way out of the crisis that goes beyond out-of-control markets, greedy bankers and ineffective regulation or saving capitalism and that challenge the institutional structure of the system if not some of its pillars” (p. 216). The view from the South in the <italic>Globalization in Crisis</italic> volume provides insight into the future of capitalism and economics, not as a retreat into Keynesianism or state socialism, but new forms explored by sociologists and economists: solidarity economies, economies based on social ownership, new urban participatory experiments, and transnational, anti-capitalist social movements. While <italic>Globalization in Crisis</italic> suggests some ways to explore this environment, Fourcade’s book provides an exciting methodology for studying professions within this emerging environment.</p>
