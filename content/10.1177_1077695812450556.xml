<p>Journalism often disappoints its audience. That was true during the buildup to the Iraq war in 2002–2003. Even when journalists and news organizations have tried to rectify the shortcomings that critics have identified, journalists have failed to sustain those reform efforts.</p>
<p><italic>Prophets of the Fourth Estate</italic>, by Amy Reynolds and Gary R. Hicks, demonstrates the longevity of many criticisms of the press, and Matthew C. Ehrlich’s <italic>Radio Utopia</italic> examines how one medium tried to provide better journalism and why that effort faded after a few years.</p>
<p>Reynolds and Hicks focus on press critics of the early twentieth century, with a special emphasis on Charles Edward Russell, Moorfield Storey, and Oswald Garrison Villard. For the most part, the authors allow these critics to speak for themselves, reprinting in part or in full essays the critics published early in the twentieth century. Many complaints have as much force today as they did one hundred years ago.</p>
<p>Russell, who had worked for both Joseph Pulitzer’s <italic>New York World</italic> and William Randolph Hearst’s <italic>New York Journal</italic>, complained in a 1914 piece for <italic>Pearson’s Magazine</italic> that the control of the press was not vested in the reporters and editors but in advertisers and financiers. Newspapers were reluctant to publish stories that might offend advertisers, who provided most of their revenue. Financiers controlled access to capital that news organizations needed to acquire modern machinery and pay production costs. Publications that offended financial interests could find themselves starved of capital. Even the Chautauqua movement, the talk radio of the World War I era, was vulnerable to commercial pressures. Speakers favorable to the interests of wealthy businesses were subsidized.</p>
<p>For Storey, one of the founders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and its first president and legal director, sensationalism was undermining the value of news media. Instead of enlightening the public about the problems of labor, taxation, foreign policy, and other complexities of the twentieth century, news reporters were pursuing stories about the prurient details of private lives.</p>
<p>Villard, who owned the <italic>New York Evening Post</italic> and <italic>The Nation</italic>, worried about the growing concentration of media ownership. Some cities, he noted in a 1919 piece published in <italic>The Atlantic Monthly</italic>, had only one morning newspaper. And the number of companies providing features and editorial material to weekly newspapers was dwindling rapidly.</p>
<p>Other essays in <italic>Prophets of the Fourth Estate</italic> examine threats to the press posed by wartime government censorship, increases in postal fees, and public relations. In every case, contemporary parallels come to mind easily.</p>
<p>The authors provide brief but helpful biographical information about Russell, Storey, and Villard, but other writers included in the book have little or no identifying information about them. One excerpt is a piece by Robert L. Duffus about an advertising campaign by a meatpacking company to rebuild its reputation after a Federal Trade Commission investigation, but the authors provide no information about Duffus or about where or when the article was published.</p>
<p>Sometimes Reynolds and Hicks introduce an essay with background information. An unsigned editorial from a 1918 edition of <italic>The Public</italic>, an opinion magazine, on the impact of postal rate reform followed almost seven pages of background information on the history of postal rates for newspapers and magazines and the effects of changes in those rates on the industry.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, however, explanation is missing. One Russell piece mentions “General Otis” and “the McNamaras.” The authors fail to identify Harrison Gray Otis as the very conservative and antiunion publisher of the <italic>Los Angeles Times</italic> and the McNamaras, brothers John and James, as union leaders responsible for the 1910 bombing of the <italic>Times</italic> building that killed twenty-one people.</p>
<p>One also wonders why the authors omitted any of Will Irwin’s writings. His series, “The American Newspaper,” was published in <italic>Collier’s</italic> magazine in 1911, the heart of the period Reynolds and Hicks are covering, and Irwin’s name appears in the book a couple of times in passing. There may be an excellent reason the authors chose to omit Irwin and focus on other press critics, but they do not explain.</p>
<p>While Reynolds and Hicks alert readers to commercial media weaknesses, Matthew Ehrlich’s <italic>Radio Utopia</italic> shows that at times, mass media produce praiseworthy content. But Ehrlich is no utopian; he notes that the flowering of radio documentaries in the six or seven years immediately following World War II occurred largely because it served the economic and political interests of network owners.</p>
<p>Ehrlich introduces readers to the leading figures in network radio documentaries and their most important and influential programs. Some figures, such as Fred Friendly and Edward R. Murrow, are familiar. But others, such as Norman Corwin, Robert Lewis Shayon, and Ruth Ashton, are less well known. The people and the programs are interesting in their own right, but Ehrlich’s more important contribution is to show how economics, technology, and ideology changed the climate for and nature of radio documentaries in the years immediately after the war.</p>
<p>During World War II and before, the radio documentaries were really docudramas. The technology for going to remote locations and recording sound and voices was limited, and CBS and NBC had policies prohibiting the use of recorded material on air. Most documentaries were like Robert Lewis Shayon’s “The Eagle’s Brood,” an examination of juvenile delinquency. Shayon had traveled widely and gathered many insights into delinquency, but the broadcast used actors to recreate as fictional characters the people with whom Shayon had talked.</p>
<p>An early effort to break this mold was Norman Corwin’s “One World Flight,” a 1946 trip around the world to examine the condition of people in several nations after the war and the prospects for world peace. Corwin used a wire recorder to capture ambient sounds and the voices of actual people. But the technology was so finicky that producers returned to the docudrama format.</p>
<p>NBC, meanwhile, was developing magnetic tape technology, and producer Fred Friendly used that to create in 1950 a four-part documentary about nuclear weapons and nuclear power called “The Quick and the Dead.” Although the series’ host was Bob Hope, the program presented the voices and views of people such as <italic>The New York Times</italic> reporter William Laurence, Manhattan Project director Leslie Groves, and pilot Paul Tibbets, whose plane had dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima. The following year, Friendly moved to CBS to collaborate with Murrow on “Hear It Now,” a weekly news program that used only real sounds and real voices in its reports.</p>
<p>As the technology enabled broadcast journalists to produce more realistic documentaries, the ideology of the time pushed them to be more objective and less optimistic. Shayon’s “The Eagle’s Brood” had suggested the problem of juvenile delinquency could be managed through community activism. Elmore McKee produced a series called “The People Act,” which told stories of people acting on their own to improve conditions in their communities.</p>
<p>By 1950–1951, radio documentaries reflected the fears and doubts of a world plunged into the Cold War. Some early documentary producers, such as Corwin and Shayon, who had strong ties to the New Deal and to reform efforts on various issues were having trouble finding work. Those who remained at the networks, like Murrow, avoided showing personal opinions or appearing as reformers. During “Hear It Now’s” radio run, Murrow was so successful at keeping his own preferences out of his stories that even Sen. Joe McCarthy praised him for his fairness.</p>
<p>The radio documentaries had served an economic purpose for broadcasters. The Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) “Blue Book” and the Hutchins Commission’s <italic>A Free and Responsible Press</italic> both called on media to provide more and better journalism. At CBS, William Paley created a documentary unit and charged it with the task of improving radio programming. While the documentaries may have helped the networks and station owners look good to the FCC and to intellectuals, broadcasting executives understood that documentaries were less profitable than entertainment programming. The documentaries often aired at less popular times, such as Sunday morning. Or a network might schedule a documentary against a popular entertainment show on another network. CBS ran Corwin’s “One World Flight” opposite the highly rated Bob Hope show on NBC. Ehrlich successfully weaves together these various analytical strands to explain why networks expanded their radio documentary offerings after the war and why they largely abandoned that work early in the 1950s.</p>
<p>Neither Ehrlich nor Reynolds and Hicks offer any solutions to the problem of how to promote the creation of independent and insightful journalism on a sustained basis. What they do, however, is help readers understand how news organizations operate in and reflect the values of existing economic and political systems.</p>
