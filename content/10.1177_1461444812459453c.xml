<p>Justin Patchin and Sameer Hinduja have established a reputation as authorities on cyberbullying over the last five years. As this book demonstrates, they have successfully sifted through the volumes of information (and misinformation) in the field, to peel away the layers of complexity and provide an insightful and practical resource. Their thoughtful selection of contributing experts, each of whom brings an important and unique perspective to the intersecting challenges, provides a comprehensive guide for stakeholders who yearn for help navigating the dilemmas of online free expression, privacy, supervision, safety and regulation brought about by cyberbullying. As the authors explain in the preface, the chapters are informed by research; however, the content is written in accessible ways for teachers, parents and policymakers.</p>
<p>It is not a very long book, but it packs in important contextual issues and potential solutions that are essential to bring to the public’s attention. Ann Collier’s opening chapter reminds readers that the ‘living Internet’ (p. 2) is constantly evolving to reflect its user base, and argues for the modeling of digital citizenship and increased attention to media literacy. Patchin and Hinduja then provide context for this with an overview of a body of research on the nature, extent and consequences of online aggression, including attention to such psychological issues as suicidal thoughts, and the impact of cyberbullying on academic performance. Patricia Agatston, Robin Kowalski and Susan Limber corroborate other research in the field to confirm that young people do not readily report cyberbullying unless they know adults will take them seriously. There are also guidelines for school counselors in Chapter 5 by Russell Sabella. The importance of empowering bystanders and giving ownership is addressed by Stan Davis and Charisse Nixon in Chapter 6. Chapters 7 to 9 provide information and analysis of programs, books, ‘tools’ and practical strategies for schools to engage and educate school communities, complete with an appendix containing a selection of cyberbullying curricula, lesson plans and resource materials.</p>
<p>With increased adoption of social media such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, mobile and smartphones, the boundaries of acceptable online communication and forms of expression have become blurred. The news media often sensationalize cyberbullying incidents, creating moral panic that assumes that both the Internet and young people are out of control. This has resulted in calls by parent and teacher lobbies for specific laws to address cyberbullying, with harsher penalties for offenders. North American legislators have complied by introducing specific laws targeting cyberbullying. In this regard, <italic>Cyberbullying Prevention and Response</italic> is also well timed. The book includes a chapter by well-known legal authority, Nancy Willard, who highlights important legal issues that surround cyberbullying. Patchin and Hinduja have also appended a list of American states that have passed bullying and cyberbullying laws, with information on whether the law is proposed, updated or amended, whether it includes cyberbullying as part of bullying in its definition, electronic harassment, criminal sanctions and school sanctions. This appendix provides a starting reference point for school administrators, and a platform from which researchers interested in policy can build compendia of legal resources as new laws emerge. The book also includes detailed information on policies of corporate intermediaries such as Facebook with respect to offensive materials.</p>
<p>I would have liked to see more analysis of the value and potential impact of the emerging state laws that are appended in the book. Although the editors touch on them in their last chapter on law enforcement, a broader and deeper discussion of the impact of these emerging statutes would have been helpful. Nancy Willard’s chapter highlights legal considerations that are applicable under <italic>existing</italic> legal frameworks such as tort law, criminal law and the constitution. It would be helpful to know Patchin and Hinduja’s assessment of whether new laws that <italic>specifically</italic> target bullying and cyberbullying are necessary, and the extent to which these laws might prevent or reduce them. Moreover, it would help to know what kinds of financial resources, if any, are provided by state authorities and the U.S. government to support schools in meeting their obligations under these new statutes. Mike Donlin’s chapter, ‘You Mean We Gotta Teach <italic>That</italic>, Too?’, is reflective of the response that emerging laws targeting cyberbullying in Canada have received from schools. Three Canadian provinces have developed laws that require schools to develop school safety plans. In Quebec, Bill 56 has drawn a panicked response from school authorities and teachers because schools are expected to develop sustainable school safety plans and report their successes or failures to the Ministry of Education. However, few financial or educational resources or incentives have been provided to help schools accomplish this endeavor. Is this the same in the United States in states where new laws targeting cyberbullying have been introduced? Moreover, the <italic>Acceptance Act</italic> in Ontario, Canada, encourages schools to set up gay–straight alliance clubs to address cyberbullying. The provincial government has received a backlash from religious parents who do not agree with these clubs because homosexuality is against their religion. It would be helpful to learn the extent to which some of the American state laws address discrimination and homophobia as an aspect of cyberbullying, and what, if any, obligations are imposed on schools to address it. Given the strong religious right lobbies in the U.S., this is an important factor to consider.</p>
<p>Another question that could have been addressed in the book, relates to whether laws specifically targeting bullying or cyberbullying might penalize young perpetrators too harshly when they engage in cyberbullying without intending to break the law. Research suggests that digital natives (youth growing up immersed in digital media) have difficulty defining the lines between jokes or teasing, and demeaning, offensive forms of expression that constitute criminal harassment, defamation and libel that carry legal risks. This is evidenced in the well-publicized case of Dharun Ravi in the Tyler Clementi case (see our blog <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cambridgeblog.org/2012/03/confronting-cyberbullying-defining-the-lines-between-ethical-choices-and-jail-terms-by-shaheen-shariff-ph-d-and-courtney-retter/">http://www.cambridgeblog.org/2012/03/confronting-cyberbullying-defining-the-lines-between-ethical-choices-and-jail-terms-by-shaheen-shariff-ph-d-and-courtney-retter/</ext-link>), where Ravi was convicted of criminal offenses. In many cases youth send out sexual photographs of other peers to make friends laugh – without realizing the legal risks. Under existing criminal laws some states are charging youth with possession and distribution of child pornography when they engage in ‘sexting’. While the book acknowledges the need for media literacy and parental accountability, it would also be important to stress <italic>legal</italic> literacy as part of teacher education, professional development and school curricula. Digital natives need to be made aware of the legal risks to push home the message that they could end up with criminal records and jail terms for their pranks.</p>
<p>Overall, I strongly recommend this book as a practical guide for educators, policymakers, parents and researchers. I will certainly learn from it, and use it as a valuable resource in my teaching, research and writing.</p>
