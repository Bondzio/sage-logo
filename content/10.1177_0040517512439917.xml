<abstract>
<p>This study evaluated the usefulness of bioceramic materials (ceramic materials that emit high-performance far-infrared (FIR) rays), processed into fabrics using a traditional manufacturing melt spinning method. Numerous measurements were designed to test the biological functions of 1% bioceramic fabrics. These included physical induction of intracellular nitric oxide (NO) in NIH 3T3 cells (mouse fibroblasts), the effects on cell viability in osteoblastic cells (MC3T3-E1) under hydrogen peroxide-mediated oxidative stress, and the effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in a chondrosarcoma (SW1353) cell line. When compared to the control group, the bioceramic fabrics were capable of inducing further intracellular NO production using NIH 3T3 cells, and maintaining increased viability and against cell intoxication of osteoblastic cells by suppressing cell release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) under oxidative stress. In addition, it was found to suppress LPS-induced COX-2 production more significantly in a SW1353 cell line. These processes represent the biomolecular changes occurring during promotion of decline in aging, prevention of osteoporosis, and prevention of inflammatory processes within the human body. Therefore, these bioceramic fabrics are likely to fulfill their claims of having health-promoting benefits.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0040517512439917" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Maintaining warmth and being decorative and stylish are fundamental requirements for garments. Wearing garments composed of fabrics that provide health-promoting benefits is an attractive concept for the growing aging population worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0040517512439917">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0040517512439917">2</xref></sup> However, no existing specialized field combines medical and textile technologies to research these materials.</p>
<p>The present study performed a general survey on fabric samples from markets in Asian counties, including some garments manufactured of fibers produced using the melt spinning method and others that had surfaces post-processed with mineral ore additives. In addition, this study measured ionizing radiation emissions. The main sources of ionizing radiation in mineral ore are rare radioactive elements (such as uranium or radium). Previous studies have observed that low doses of ionizing radiation have immunological modulatory effects. Short exposure to low-dose radiation influenced T-cells and macrophages,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0040517512439917">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0040517512439917">4</xref></sup> resulting in short-term amelioration of autoimmune diseases. However, exposure of tissues to low-dose ionized radiation for longer periods is not absolutely safe, increasing the possibility of DNA mutations and deletions, and leading to cancer risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0040517512439917">5</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0040517512439917">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ionizing radiation has higher frequency ranges and shorter wavelengths than does the visible light spectrum (of 400 to 750 nm) and, therefore, may have sufficient energy to break chemical bonds. High-energy ionizing radiation can also strip off electrons or break up the nuclei of atoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0040517512439917">5</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0040517512439917">7</xref></sup> Non-ionizing radiation has lower frequency ranges and longer wavelengths than does the visible light spectrum. Non-ionizing radiation rarely has sufficient energy to break chemical bonds.</p>
<p>Far-infrared (FIR) radiation (3–1000 µm) consists of invisible electromagnetic waves, with wavelengths longer than visible light, and is the major heat-transmitting radiation at wavelengths of 3 µm to 1 mm, as defined by the CIE (1987). Particularly in the range of 8–14 µm, FIR was suspected to have many biological effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0040517512439917">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>This spectrum of wavelength transfers energy that thermoreceptors in the skin perceive as heat. In previous years, people had believed that the optimal wavelength most effective for life is between 8 and 14 µm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0040517512439917">9</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517512439917">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Numerous published medical studies have used FIR with a heat supply source to demonstrate that the FIR wavelength increased skin microcirculation in rats, improved blood flow of arteriovenous fistulas in hemodialysis patients, extended survival of skin grafts, and had other health-promoting effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0040517512439917">17</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0040517512439917">22</xref></sup> However, these studies have utilized an FIR application with a heat source dependent on electricity, which is inconvenient for wider application during everyday life.</p>
<p>In Asian garment markets, an increasing numbers of products contain fiber additives, such as bamboo charcoal and mineral ores, which the manufacturers claim can promote health when worn on the body. Garments composed of bamboo charcoal have putative health-promoting functions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0040517512439917">23</xref></sup> Although the authors cannot deny the health benefits of these products in maintaining warmth, observing physiological responses to the fabrics in clinical practice has indicated that these products cannot be defined as actual health-promoting materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0040517512439917">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0040517512439917">24</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0040517512439917">33</xref></sup> However, further objective analyses are necessary for confirmation.</p>
<p>Assessing some of the samples available on the market did not verify these biological functions as claimed by the product advertisement. Examination also revealed that some of the samples emitted ionizing radiation, which is potentially hazardous to public health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0040517512439917">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0040517512439917">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>People may believe that a special invisible light spectrum can promote human health. However, lack of thorough investigations, general knowledge, and professional education indicates that the public is incapable of discerning between non-ionizing and ionizing radiation. Even within the fields of materials science and textiles, some confusion exists regarding the concept of radiation. Therefore, manufacturers producing clothing contaminated with ionized radiation, unbeknown to the consumer, is possible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0040517512439917">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>The emissive efficiency of the FIR ray spectrum cannot be measured using ordinary types of instruments. Thus, mainstream medical applications cannot easily identify FIR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0040517512439917">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0040517512439917">37</xref></sup> In our previous study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0040517512439917">9</xref></sup> we applied two research methods to living human bodies to: (i) measure the possible biological functions of a garment using infrared thermography to produce thermal images; and (ii) observe the real-time dynamic status within the microvasculature of the dorsal human fingertip, based on vascular corrosion casting, using a stereoscopic microscope.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0040517512439917">9</xref></sup> Recording the physiological parameters before and after the textile made contact with the skin enabled determining its biological functions. However, human physiological responses, such as body temperature and microcirculation, are constantly changing and have numerous influencing factors. Therefore, these two human tests, though easily performed, have dubious objectivity unless investigators strictly control all of the experimental procedures.</p>
<p>The current study was a collaborative work of professionals from different fields, including medical radiology, clinical sciences, biomedical sciences, and textiles engineering. This study created and researched a new type of ceramic compound that emits an effective electromagnetic wavelength, as confirmed by previous molecular biology studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0040517512439917">9</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517512439917">16</xref></sup> Our earlier publications investigating bioceramic materials (ceramic materials that emit high-performance FIR rays) focused primarily on the basic medical science of cells and animal models, and we showed that bioceramic materials promote microcirculation and have other effects by upregulating calcium-dependent nitric oxide and calmodulin in different cell lines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0040517512439917">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517512439917">16</xref></sup> An inhibitory effect of bioceramic material on murine melanin cancer cell (melanoma) growth was reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0040517512439917">38</xref></sup> We also demonstrated that bioceramic material has an antioxidant effect by increasing the hydrogen peroxide-scavenging ability of various cells, including murine macrophages (RAW264.7),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0040517512439917">15</xref></sup> murine calvaria-derived osteoblast-like cells (MC3T3-E1),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0040517512439917">10</xref></sup> NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517512439917">16</xref></sup> and murine myoblast cells (C2C12).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0040517512439917">13</xref></sup> A physical-chemical test platform was also developed to examine other characteristics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0040517512439917">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0040517512439917">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our mission has been to develop fabrics containing bioceramic materials capable of being applied in regular textile manufacturing processes. Because it is difficult and expensive to embed higher than 1% by-weight of bioceramic granules into fiber using a melt spinning procedure to manufacture bioceramic fabrics, whether or not the biological function can be preserved as the original material powder is unknown. As is widely known, 1% solid content in the melt spinning process is commonly used, and the fiber spinning process needs less adjustment. Otherwise, the fiber is easily broken during the spinning and texturing processes; therefore, we choose a 1% bioceramic material as the final composition in the nylon fiber. Thus, this study evaluated the health-promoting and biological functions of assayed textiles and garments (1% by-weight of bioceramic) based on measurements of intracellular nitric oxide (NO) production, antioxidant effects such as bone-forming cell viability under oxidative stress, and anti-inflammatory effects, especially concerning joint diseases.</p></sec>

<p>This study used a ceramic powder composed of micro-sized particles produced using several ingredients, mainly mineral oxides, provided by the Materials Laboratory of Taipei Medical University (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0040517512439917">Figure 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0040517512439917">9</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517512439917">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0040517512439917">38</xref></sup> The known ingredients (TiO<sub>2</sub>, SiO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, ZnO, and MgO) of the FIR ceramic powder were combined to form a bio-organically harmless formula, based on conclusions from our previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0040517512439917">9</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517512439917">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0040517512439917">38</xref></sup>

<p>The average optimal emission wavelength of the ceramic powder is between 8 and 14 µm, as confirmed by the Industrial Technology Research Institute (Hsinchu City, Taiwan), and represents an extremely high ratio of FIR ray intensity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0040517512439917">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0040517512439917">37</xref></sup> Bioceramic material was ground into a powder using a grinding process consisting of two stages, wet and dry grind. The powder was prepared by further pulverizing it to a suitable size for adoption in the melt spinning procedure, using various types of fibers such as nylon or PET fibers.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0040517512439917"><title>Preparing bioceramic fabrics and assessing biological functions</title>
<p>A functional bioceramic powder with a desired size of approximately 200 nm was blended with a matrix polymer, such as PET or nylon, using a twin-screw melt compounding procedure, which was also used to obtain masterbatch chips containing bioceramic powder. In creating a nylon/bioceramic polymer compound, nylon polymer was selected as the matrix because it is soft to the touch when spun into a fiber.</p>
<p>A dispersing agent was usually required to improve the segregation of the bioceramic particles. The dispersing agent we used is a WAX-type of surfactant, which could melt at approximately 180°C or higher. Formulated adjuvants are added for numerous reasons, including improved mixing and handling, increased effectiveness and safety, more efficient distribution, and drift reduction.</p>
<p>Through the blending process, a masterbatch chip with a desired function was obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0040517512439917">Figure 2</xref>). A masterbatch chip was added to the matrix polymer in the melt spinning process. Varying the number of masterbatch chips can adjust the effective concentration of the bioceramic material in the fiber. Therefore, fine denier fibers incorporated with functional bioceramic particles were obtained via the melt spinning process. After the drawing and twisting processes, a yarn with a desired function was produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0040517512439917">Figure 3</xref>). The terminal fabrics, containing 1% high-performance FIR ray-emitting bioceramic material, were produced under the supervision of the Taiwan Textile Research Institute (Tucheng, Taiwan).

<p>The diameter of melting spinning fibers (D) could be approximately estimated using the equation D  =  10 × (fiber denier)<sup>1/2</sup> (µm). For example, our fiber denier is approximately 2 d (70 d/36 f); therefore, the corresponding fiber diameter is approximately 14 µm. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0040517512439917">Figure 3(b)</xref> shows that the diameter of the as-spun fiber is approximately 13 µm, which corresponds to our estimated result.</p>
<p>The SEM image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517512439917">Figure 4</xref>) shows the surface of the nylon/bioceramic masterbatch chip. No clear aggregation is on its surface (the dark portions are holes, not aggregation). We believed that the fiber was easily broken during the melt spinning process when the bioceramic particle aggregated into a larger particle. However, the melt spinning process was smooth and the spinning pack life sustained for several days. Thus, in the author’s opinion, the status of aggregation was not heavy. Nevertheless, we do not have direct evidence (cross-section TEM image) to identify the bioceramic particle distribution in the nylon/bioceramic compound fibers.

<p>To summarize, the shape of the powder showed no significant change after the milling, and the grains were unequiaxed, homogenous, and without micro-pores, as observed using an electronic microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517512439917">Figure 4</xref>). The ground powder was then embedded with nylon by spinning it with an overall proportion of 1% ceramic within the fiber. The fiber denier we used in the study was approximately 2 denier (70d/36f). The fabrics used in such experiments are weaving fabrics (220 g/m<sup>2</sup>). The fabric was cut into 100 square centimeters (10 cm × 10 cm); therefore; we could ensure that each experiment was conducted uniformly.</p></sec>

<p>Textile production includes a wide range of post-processing methods prior to application, such as dyeing and setting. Occasionally, surfactants are dissolved in a hot water bath with detergent during the dyeing process. Therefore, we presumed that the amount of dispersing agent residual in the fibers was less, following the textile production process. Most of the dispersing agent could be washed out during the dyeing process in the hot water bath. Although the residual dispersing agent may still have some effects on the anti-bacterial properties, there is no clear evidence to show that the dispersing agent has health-promoting benefits. In the author’s opinion, those positive biological effects were a result of the 1% bioceramic material within the fabrics.</p>
<p>According to our previous studies, bioceramic material is capable of increasing the intracellular NO levels produced by calcium-dependent nitric oxide synthetase, which is beneficial to us and limited under many pathological and aging conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0040517512439917">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The present study shows that using fabrics with 1% bioceramic content also exhibit NO inducing effect on cells. As is widely known, the discovery of cellular NO as a vital signal messenger molecule involved in numerous physiological processes within the human body helped three scientists win the Nobel Prize in 1998. Appropriate levels of NO production are essential for maintaining normal functioning in different mammalian organs. NO participates in a wide range of molecular biological processes, performing vital roles in vessel homeostasis, inhibiting vascular smooth muscle contraction, platelet aggregation, and leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium. Phagocytes (monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils) also generate NO as part of the human immune response, leading to vasodilation and smooth muscle relaxation, thereby preventing myocardial and cerebral ischemia. NO also participates in the regulation of neurological functions, increases renal function, promotes wound healing processes, and is involved in fertility, penile erection, and prevention of dysmenorrhea.<sup>31,</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0040517512439917">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0040517512439917">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0040517512439917">39</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0040517512439917">44</xref></sup> Bioceramic manufactured garments may act as remedies, or at least alternative paramedical applications for patients, especially those suffering from the aforementioned diseases.</p>
<p>Bone formation requires differentiated and active osteoblasts to synthesize the extracellular matrix that supports the mineralizing process. Regarding bone and joint studies, our results from this cell model with induced oxidative stress indicated that bioceramic fabrics may have the beneficial effects of preventing oxidative damage to bone tissues. Bioceramic fabrics have also demonstrated potential anti-inflammatory effects on joints, reversing LPS-induced arthritis in an animal model and inhibiting COX-2 production in cell model experiments. The results of this study indicate that bioceramic fabrics can scavenge hydrogen peroxide, increase cell survival, and prevent cell damage reflected by lesser release of LDH under H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a stable enzyme present in all cell types, is rapidly released into the cell culture medium when plasma membranes are damaged. Therefore, LDH is the most widely used marker in cytotoxicity studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0040517512439917">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0040517512439917">45</xref></sup> In addition, COX-2, an enzyme inducible by LPS, is known to be a key enzyme causing inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis. COX-2 is, therefore, an ideal target of rheumatoid diseases and osteoarthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0040517512439917">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0040517512439917">47</xref></sup> The present study revealed that bioceramic fabrics downregulated the LPS-inducing COX-2. Using bioceramic fabrics could potentially protect bone tissue against aging degeneration and the osteoporotic process, relieve the pain of acute inflammatory joint disease, and, thus, help maintain bone health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0040517512439917">48</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0040517512439917">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the authors’ opinion, bioceramic fabrics may fulfill health-promoting or anti-aging claims by partly compensating for human deficiencies during insufficiency and degenerative statuses.</p>
<p>This material can be used to design different garments, and can be widely applied in hospitals and in promoting health. Aside from aging and skeletal disease, using bioceramic fabrics may help patients in the postoperative recovery stage, oncological patients exhausted from chemotherapy and radiotherapy, patients with chronic renal failure who are receiving hemodialysis, and patients suffering from insufficient leg circulation because of uncontrolled diabetes.</p>
<p>This study employed fabrics with 1% high-performance FIR ceramic powder, manufactured traditionally using the cost-effective melt spinning method. Because the obtained fibers containing bioceramic resulted from the melting spinning process, the bioceramic were embedded into the spun fibers and could not easily be washed out. The fabrics can still demonstrate their functions because of the bioceramic remaining in the fibers during the textile production process.</p>
<p>This study evaluated the usefulness of bioceramic materials added into fabrics. Our previous study already confirmed that our original bioceramic powder demonstrates biological functions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0040517512439917">9</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517512439917">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0040517512439917">38</xref></sup></p></sec>
<sec id="sec18-0040517512439917" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Based on existing evidence, the newly developed 1% bioceramic fabrics were capable of inducing further intracellular NO production using NIH 3T3 cells, maintaining increased viability and against cell intoxication of osteoblastic cells by suppressing cell release of LDH under oxidative stress. In addition, it was found to suppress LPS-induced COX-2 production more significantly in a SW1353 cell line. These processes represent the biomolecular changes occurring during promotion of decline in aging, prevention of osteoporosis, and prevention of inflammatory processes within the human body. However, additional tests are necessary to ensure quality control for garment manufacturing, and to maintain health-promoting standards.</p></sec>
