<abstract>
<p>Casing treatment was applied to three blade geometries for axial flow pumps to investigate its influence on their hydraulic characteristics and the well-known typical head curve instability. The geometries were a conventional blade with a radial leading edge and two blades with 45° forward and backward sweeps, respectively. The measurements were performed to show whether the effect of casing treatment does always remove the head curve instability and whether its smoothing effect on the head curve exists also in case of forward and backward sweeps, both of which geometries are known to differ considerably in stall inception. The head curves were measured in a standard way in cavitation-free flow, and additionally the pump head as function of net pressure suction head was measured to record the cavitational behaviour of the different set-ups. It was found that casing treatment strongly reduces the head curve instability though it does not always fully remove it and seems to have no distinct effect on the cavitation characteristics. All three impeller geometries are characterized by critical stall region near the tip.</p>

<p>Casing treatment is known since long to have a strong influence on the performance characteristics of pumps and compressors notably on the part load instability [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957650912440547">1</xref></bold>], which is closely related to stall and surge whose formation is also reasonably well understood [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957650912440547">2</xref></bold>]. Stall is known as a separated flow around one or more impeller blades – so-called stall cells – which usually rotate in a sense opposite to the impeller sense of rotation. If these stall cells grow and cover the full impeller circumference, surge may develop as a flow from the impeller backwards to its suction side. Surge is rarely only observed in axial flow pumps but is a well-known phenomenon in compressors, whereas stall can be observed practically in all kinds of axial fluid machineries and is the cause for the head-curve instability treated in this article. Stall formation strongly depends on the casing geometry and can thus be influenced, as is also well known from a large number of publications, e.g. references [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957650912440547">3</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0957650912440547">4</xref></bold>]. However, casing treatment in pumps, notably axial flow pumps which suffer enormously from this famous part load head curve instability limiting the operational flowrate, has only been investigated by few researchers, e.g. references [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957650912440547">5</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957650912440547">6</xref></bold>].</p>
<p>The head curve instability of axial turbo machinery is known to be related to the mentioned stall which starts in the form of modes and spikes [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957650912440547">2</xref></bold>]; this was also investigated for swept pump bladings [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957650912440547">7</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0957650912440547">8</xref></bold>]. Casing treatment is expected to influence the formation of stall and surge only if the stall is initiated along the outer wall [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0957650912440547">9</xref></bold>], as is the case for all three impeller bladings (unswept, forward swept, and backward swept), for which the stall inception in the form of modes and spikes along the tip was shown [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0957650912440547">8</xref></bold>].</p>
<p>This study investigates how the head curve of axial flow pumps with conventional unswept blades as well as with the forward and backward swept blades depends on casing treatment.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0957650912440547"><title>2 EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP</title>
<sec id="sec3-0957650912440547"><title>2.1 Test rig for hydraulic measurements</title>
<p>All experiments were performed on a cavitation – four-quadrant-test rig. The booster pump is installed as low as possible for cavitation reasons. The model pump and the vacuum pressure vessel (to adjust a variable system pressure, to allow cavitation free as well as strongly cavitating flows) are installed in the upper level, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957650912440547">Fig. 1(a)</xref>. The model pump as well as the booster pump are both variable speed controlled.
<fig id="fig1-0957650912440547" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>(a) Four-quadrant-test rig and (b) measurement planes</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650912440547-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The flowrate was measured by an inductive flow meter which was calibrated with a venturi pipe and the measurement of the differential pressures prior to the measurements. For this calibration, the inductive flow meter was installed at the place of the test pump (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957650912440547">Fig. 1(a)</xref>), whereas during the experiments described below, the shown venture pipe was replaced by the flow meter. The pressure, also for the measurement of the head curve, was measured by electronic differential pressure gauges (accuracy ±0.5 per cent) and the torque by means of a hydrostatic bearing and the measurement of the reaction bearing force (accuracy also ±0.5 per cent). The location of the measuring planes in front and behind the runner is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957650912440547">Fig. 1(b)</xref>.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0957650912440547"><title>2.2 Pump blading</title>
<p>The geometrical data of the unswept pump bladings are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0957650912440547">Table 1</xref>. The forward and backward swept blades result from this basic blade design by shifting the different profiles on their cylindrical plane in the relative flow direction, so that the blade axis is directed 45° towards this flow direction or 45° with it, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650912440547">Fig. 2</xref>. Hence, in this article, forward and backward sweeps relate to the hub. The hub-to-tip ratio is 0.508 for all three configurations.

<p>The specific speed of the unswept blade is <italic>n<sub>q</sub></italic> = 210 and differs slightly from the ones for the swept blades, as the best efficiency point is shifted to larger or smaller values as no correction of the blade design recommended by Smith and Yeh [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0957650912440547">10</xref></bold>] was applied. The Smith and Yeh corrections have not been used as the bladings of these experiments were taken from previous experiments [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957650912440547">7</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957650912440547">11</xref></bold>] where the correction was neither applied as they served to study the sweep effect in comparison to unswept blades. For simplicity reasons, the same blades were used again to look into the effect of casing treatment on swept and unswept blades.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0957650912440547"><title>2.3 Casing treatment</title>
<p>The normally flat outer casing which has a diameter of 274 mm was reconfigured with 60 grooves of 3.25 mm depth and 3 mm width, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0957650912440547">Fig. 3</xref>.
<fig id="fig3-0957650912440547" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Casing treatment</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650912440547-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>All grooves were located in front of the blading so that there were no grooves above the blade tips. The geometry and form of the casing treatment was taken as the same as investigated by Goltz [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957650912440547">6</xref></bold>], which had a similar specific speed though other geometric data, namely the hub ratio were different. At such an early stage of research on casing treatment in axial flow pumps, this method seemed reasonable especially as basic principles were under investigation rather than optimization steps.</p></sec></sec>

<sec id="sec7-0957650912440547"><title>3.1 Head curve stability of non-cavitating flow of conventional and swept blades with and without casing treatment</title>
<p>Though it is not the purpose of this article to compare the head curves for unswept blades to the ones for forward or backward swept blades for conventional walls without grooves, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0957650912440547">Fig. 4</xref> exhibits these head curves to give an impression of how the stall inception varies for these geometries. Backward sweep results in a head curve instability at considerably larger flowrates than the unswept blade, whereas the one for the forward swept blade appears at smaller flowrates, i.e. this blade follows its head curve longer when the flow is throttled and the operational range is remarkably larger than for the unswept of backward swept blade.
<fig id="fig4-0957650912440547" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Head curves for unswept, forward swept, and backward swept blades for smooth casing</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650912440547-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>To study the effect of wall treatment, the head curve of the unswept conventional blade is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0957650912440547">Fig. 5</xref> both for the smooth casing and the one with casing treatment, as described above. Also, the well-known hysteresis can be measured for both geometries. As can be seen, the strong instability of the blade with smooth casing [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957650912440547">11</xref></bold>] is very much reduced for the blade with casing grooves in front of its leading edge, though the instability is still present.
<fig id="fig5-0957650912440547" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Pump characteristics of unswept blade with and without grooves for cavitation-free flow</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650912440547-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The efficiency for both arrangements is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0957650912440547">Fig. 6</xref>. The flowrate of best efficiency remains unaltered when compared between smooth casing and grooved casing. With casing treatment, best efficiency decreases slightly only as compared to the smooth casing which agrees well with other measurements [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957650912440547">6</xref></bold>]. In part load, the hysteresis is again visible and there the efficiency of the geometry with casing treatment is clearly better than its smooth counter part, though the power consumption of the groove geometry (not shown) is higher.
<fig id="fig6-0957650912440547" position="float"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Efficiency of unswept blade with and without grooves</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650912440547-fig6.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The head curves for forward and backward sweeps are shown in Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0957650912440547">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0957650912440547">8</xref>, respectively. Similar to the results for the unswept blade geometry, the casing grooves strongly reduce the head curve instability though it neither fully disappears. If the head curve of the unswept (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0957650912440547">Fig. 5</xref>), forward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0957650912440547">Fig. 7</xref>), and backward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0957650912440547">Fig. 8</xref>) sweeps are compared, we observe that the head curve instability is shifted:
<list id="list1-0957650912440547" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>to smaller flowrates for forward sweep;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to larger flowrates for backward sweep.</p></list-item>
</list>

<p>Both findings apply both for the head curves with casing treatment as well as for smooth casing. For the latter, they are known since long [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957650912440547">11</xref></bold>]. The best efficiency flowrate (not shown) is also shifted to smaller flowrates for forward sweep (from 270 to 240 l/s) and to larger flowrates for backward sweep (from 270 to 290 l/s).</p>
<p>Though the shift of the instability and best efficiency does not come as a surprise as they are well known [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957650912440547">11</xref></bold>], another aspect of these findings as reported is a bit surprising, namely the head curve improvement (i.e. stabilization) is not only found for the unswept blade but also detectable for forward sweep in a similar extend. For the forward swept blade it was to be expected that the tip blade loading would decrease and more work done in regions further away from the wall and the tip. Then, it could be concluded [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957650912440547">6</xref></bold>] that wall treatment would not work in case of forward sweep. However, contrary to this assumption, the measurements verify that wall treatment also stabilizes forward swept blades. This observation is explicable by the stall formation which is known to start from the tip for all blade geometries, also the forward sweep [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0957650912440547">8</xref></bold>]. The stall of the unswept blade starts at the casing so that an effect of casing treatment is to be expected anyway. Obviously, the observation of the stabilizing casing treatment effect also on forward and backward swept blades underlines the earlier findings that these blades stall at the tip [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0957650912440547">8</xref></bold>].</p>
<p>Casing treatment is by far not new and has often been investigated – though not so often for pumps, examples are given in section 1 – and has been shown to influence stall inception but under the condition that stall starts from the blade tip or the outer casing wall [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0957650912440547">9</xref></bold>]. In accordance with these earlier results, it can be seen that the tip stalling effect of pump blades does not change with sweep.</p>
<p>A possible reason could be that in study of Greitzer <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0957650912440547">9</xref></bold>], bladings of larger aspect ratio are investigated as they are common for stationary or aircraft compressors, whereas here low aspect ratio geometries are concerned with a comparatively large hub-to-tip ratio. The reason seems to be that the influence of casing treatment on stall inception is detectable on this forward swept blade because the aspect ratio is low and consequently, the location of casing treatment and stall inception are still quite close to each other and thus depend on each other.</p>
<p>An argument for an aspect ratio effect is also the fact that both for the smooth casing geometry as well as the one with grooves, the instability flowrate remains unaltered and only the losses seem to be influenced.</p>
<p>Also Goltz [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957650912440547">6</xref></bold>] reports an argument that stall inception should be reconsidered. In this study, stall formation and head curve instability for an axial pump blading of similar aspect ratio – though with a specific speed of 150 rather than 210 as in this case – were studied and a clear relation between stall inception and casing treatment could be elaborated.</p>
<p>Though clarity can only be found by way of a detailed flow analysis of the swept blades with casing treatment, it is expected that casing treatment in low aspect ratio blades extends much deeper into the blade channel, and thus also might have an influence on hub stall inception of these geometries. The stall formation itself surely is so reliably investigated that it is believed to hold also in this case. However, these reflections necessarily remain speculative as long as further measurements are still missing.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-0957650912440547"><title>3.2 Cavitation characteristics of conventional and swept blades with and without casing treatment</title>
<p>The cavitational behaviour of the three different blade geometries each with and without the casing treatment described above was also measured and the results are given in the following figures. The measurement of a constant operation point <italic>Q</italic>/<italic>H</italic> and decreasing net pressure suction head (NPSH) are shown for the unswept blade in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0957650912440547">Fig. 9</xref> for three flowrates (best efficiency flowrate, over load, and part load). The suction pressure for incipient cavitation (not shown) remains unaltered when using casing treatment instead of a smooth surface. However, the drop of the head curve starts earlier as can be seen better in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0957650912440547">Fig. 10</xref> giving the NPSH<sub>3</sub> for 3 per cent head loss as a function of the flowrate. The curve for casing treatment runs slightly above the one for the smooth surface geometry, showing a NPSH<sub>3</sub> minimum at flowrates below the point of best efficiency for all three kinds of blades, as it is usual for axial pumps other than radial pumps where the NPSH<sub>3</sub> decreases to smaller values in part load.

<p>The curve NPSH<sub>3</sub>(<italic>Q</italic>) exhibits its typical parabola like form and increases for flowrates below best efficiency until it achieves a maximum in part load and decreases for lower flowrates. Again, this is typical for axial pumps whereas this curve shape can be found for radial pumps only for incipient cavitation. In general, this shape is attributed to the formation of suction recirculation where the through flow – due to the separation zones at the casing – concentrates around areas at or closer to the hub, where then higher meridional velocities and angles of attack closer to the design value are gained as if the flow was evenly distributed over the whole channel. Here, this shape is found for the cases with and without grooves and for all blade geometries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0957650912440547">Figs 10</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0957650912440547">12</xref>).
<fig id="fig12-0957650912440547" position="float"><label>Fig. 12</label><caption><p>NPSH<sub>3</sub> as function of flowrate for backward swept blade with and without grooves</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650912440547-fig12.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>However, it is remarkable that the flowrate where NPSH<sub>3</sub> reaches a maximum and then decreases is slightly larger with casing treatment than without – and this observation holds for all three geometries. Obviously, suction recirculation starts at larger flowrates if casing treatment is applied for smooth casing surfaces. This is in so far worth a look as the head curve instability appears at the same flowrate for the concerned blade geometry irrespective of the fact whether casing treatment is applied or not. However, generally, suction recirculation and stall are related to each other.</p>
<p>For all three geometries, the NPSH<sub>3</sub> values for the grooved casings are higher than for the smooth ones, i.e. cavitation is stronger. Hence, it must be concluded that the grooves disturb the flow with respect to cavitation. As the flow was not visualized, the reason can only be presumed: the velocity components along the wall, but perpendicular to the grooves, can be expected to cause a separated flow within the grooves which results in larger cavitation zones around the tip. However, this is exactly the region where the blade performs a large portion of its work. Also, if the cavitation becomes stronger, the pressure head decreases.</p>
<p>Although not investigated with casing treatment, it can be expected that the cavitational zones at least for incipient cavitation develop in a rotating manner as was shown by Penninger [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957650912440547">12</xref></bold>] for the three blade geometries but smooth casing and was also expected – though not measured – by Goltz [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957650912440547">6</xref></bold>].</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec9-0957650912440547" sec-type="conclusions"><title>4 CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>The investigation has shown that casing treatment in the form of grooves in front of the blading can be expected to reduce strongly and in almost any case, the head curve instability of axial flow pumps, though it might not fully remove it.</p>
<p>Casing treatment does not necessarily improve the cavitational behaviour.</p>
<p>Casing treatment improves the head curve stability of bladings where the critical stall area is located at the tip, underlining that forward sweep did not shift the stall region away from the tip as might be expected but as was shown earlier. In any case, the way casing treatment influences stall inception asks for further investigation, especially as its enormous potential to solve a long-lasting operational problem for axial pumps is evident.</p></sec>
