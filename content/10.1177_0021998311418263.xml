<abstract>
<p>The fundamental behavior of the fiber-reinforced composite beams with mechanical joints was examined using coupon and full-scale specimens. The effect of applied bolt torque, the contribution of adhesive bonding, and the number and configuration of bolts on the load capacity and failure mode of the double-lap bolted joints were investigated. The results showed that at different levels of applied bolt torque (10, 15, 20 and 25 N-m), little friction resistance developed. A slight increase on the load capacity was however observed with increasing tightening torque. On the other hand, the mechanical joints using bolts accompanied by adhesive bonding provided resistance against slipping. The flexural behavior of full-scale fiber composite beams with joints at midspan connected with bolts alone and a combination of bolts and epoxy was further examined. The beams connected using bolts and epoxy exhibited the same strength and stiffness as the beams without joints while using bolts alone resulted to a beam with only 65% of the stiffness of those without joints. This showed that the combination of bolts and epoxy adhesives could provide a reliable connection method for fiber-reinforced composite beams.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998311418263" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The advancement of fiber composite materials in civilengineering applications has resulted in the combination of two or more different fibers such as carbon and glass into a structure to improve its mechanical performance at very little additional cost.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311418263">1</xref></sup> This is commonly known as hybrid fiber composite structures. Recently, an effective application of fiber composite materials for bridge beams from the aspect of strength and cost was studied by Hai et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311418263">2</xref></sup> The innovative feature of this composite beam is the combined use of carbon and glass fiber-reinforced polymers in the top and bottom flanges. The carbon fiber (CF) is added to improve the mechanical performance of the beam because of its high modulus and high strength while glass fiber (GF) is only used in the web because it is relatively cheaper and it is expected that smaller stress is induced in this part. While structural componentsmade up of fiber composite materials can be produced at almost any specified lengths, the limitations in the transportation and installation required them to be produced at manageable lengths to minimize weight and facilitate handling, making the connections inevitable in the construction of composite structures.</p>
<p>The design of efficient connection system represents one of the major challenges in the development of fiber composite structures. According to Magness,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311418263">3</xref></sup> the structural components must be joined such that the overall structure retains its integrity while performing its intended function. Unfortunately, there is limited knowledge on joining technology for fiber composite structures and only few research studies have been conducted in this area for civil engineering applications. In civil infrastructure, the structural members are usually joined by bolted connections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311418263">4</xref></sup> This type of connection is relatively easy to assemble, has the ability to be easily removed when required, and is capable of transferring the high loads.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311418263">5</xref></sup> However, fabricating a hole for a bolted connection in composite materials may damage the continuous fibers through the components and compromises the strength of the members at the joint. Similarly, the mechanisms by which the damage initiates and propagates in the bolted joints for fiber composites can be different. Because of this, additional research and developmental works which aim at understanding the behavior of structural components with mechanical joints should be conducted to determine an effective and reliable jointing method for fiber composite beams.</p>
<p>In this article, the mechanical behavior and the applicability of bolted joints in fiber composite beams for civil engineering applications were investigated. The effect of applied bolt torque, number and configuration of bolts, and the contribution of adhesive bonding on the strength and behavior of bolted joints were characterized through experimental investigation using coupons and full-size composite beam specimens.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0021998311418263"><title>Connections for fiber composite structures</title>
<p>Many types of connections for composite structures havebenefited from research in automotive and aerospace engineering. For civil engineering applications where thicker members are generally used, a number of researches have been conducted so far. Hart-Smith<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311418263">6</xref></sup> was the first to present the fundamental concepts of mechanically fastened joints for fiber composite materials. Basedon his paper, fiber composites with bolted connections may fail due to tension, shear-out, or bearing. Itmay also fail by cleavage of the laminate, the connector pulling through the laminate, or by bolt failure either by single or double shear. Furthermore, he concluded that thesefailure modes largely depend on the geometry of theconnection, that is, width of the specimen (w), edge distance (e), diameter of the hole (d<sub>h</sub>), side distance (s), gauge or transverse spacing (g), pitch or longitudinal spacing (p), diameter of bolts (d<sub>b</sub>), thickness of the laminate (t<sub>pl</sub>), and hole clearance (d<sub>h</sub> d<sub>b</sub>). These geometric parameters are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311418263">Figure 1</xref>.
<fig id="fig1-0021998311418263" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Geometric parameters for multi-bolt joint connection.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311418263-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The effect of various geometric parameters on the capacity and failure mode of bolted joint has been studied by a number of researchers. Jurf and Vinson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311418263">7</xref></sup> had a study on the behavior of bolted joints in composite laminates using various geometric patterns. Results of their experimental investigation showed that the bearing strength increases with respect to s/d<sub>b</sub> or e/d<sub>b</sub> ratio independent of lateral restraint. Rosner and Rizkalla<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311418263">8</xref></sup> on the other hand examined the effects of t<sub>pl</sub>, w/d<sub>h</sub> ratio, e/d<sub>h</sub> ratio, and the fiber orientation with respect to load on the behavior of bolted connections for GF composite members. Their study showed that increasing the t<sub>pl</sub>, w, and e increased the load capacity of the connection while changing the angle of the fibers with respect to the applied load from 0 to 90 degrees reduces the strength of the connection. Aktas and Dirikolu<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311418263">9</xref></sup> investigated a pin loaded carbon epoxy composite laminate with different stacking sequences in order to determine its maximum bearing strength. Ekh<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311418263">10</xref></sup> studied the multi-fastener single-lap joints in composite structures. He found out that the single lap-joints generate out-of-plane deflection and caused a nonuniform bolt-hole contact pressure through the plate thickness. Similarly, Sen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311418263">11</xref></sup> investigated the failure mode and bearing strength of mechanically fastened bolted-joints in GF-reinforced epoxy composite plates. The results showed that the failure modes and the bearing strength of GF laminated composites were considerably affected by the increasing preload moments applied on the bolts.</p>
<p>Lateral constraint due to clamping pressure can significantly increase joint strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311418263">12</xref></sup> Kishima and Meiarashi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311418263">13</xref></sup> investigated the effect of clamping pressure on the bolted joint strength in GF-reinforced laminates applied to civil infrastructures. The results of their study showed that a higher clamping pressure and high strength adhesive increased the bolted joint strength. Similarly, Khasaba et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311418263">14</xref></sup> investigated the influence of the tightening torque and the washer’s outer diameter on the strength of bolted joints in GF-reinforced epoxy composites. Experimental results showed that the slope of the load–displacement curve of bolted joints increases with increasing washer size and the bearing strength increases with increasing tightening torque.</p>
<p>Currently, there is no distinct failure criterion for theexperimentally tested mechanically fastened composite joints. Herrington and Sabbaghina<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311418263">15</xref></sup> showed that the load displacement curve of bolted joint specimens had a linear behavior up to a certain point, followed by an unstable nonlinear behavior. They defined this point as the bearing failure, the maximum load just prior to the unstable, nonlinear behavior. On the other hand, the bolt bearing strength calculated by Hollman<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311418263">16</xref></sup> was based on the ultimate failure load. In most studies, the ultimate strength and failure mode of bolted connections were investigated to determine the behavior of bolted connections. However, Allred<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311418263">17</xref></sup> stated that it is desirable to obtain not only the ultimate values of bearing load but also the entire load deflection curve, because the material ‘yield strength’ from such curve provides a better understanding of the behavior of the bolted connection than the ultimate bearing strength.</p>
<p>A large part of the literature on mechanically fastened joints presented the effect of stacking sequence, geometric properties, clearance between the hole and the pin, and the degree of lateral clamping pressure on the strength of bolted connections. However, most of these researches deal only with thin laminates and made up of the same type of fibers. Inview of the very large number of variables involved, complete characterization of the joint behavior is impossible. In this article, the behavior of double-lap bolted connections for composite beams consisting of glass and CFs was investigated experimentally.</p></sec>

<p>In the specimen preparation, the holes in the composite laminates were made using a diamond-tipped drill. The specimen was clamped with the bolt through 9 mm thick SS400 splice plate (yield strength of 400 MPa) and the torque was applied to the bolts using a presetting torque wrench at 10, 15, 20, and 25 N-m. Sandpaper with a grit size of 60 was provided on the aluminum plate to increase the resistance againstslipping at the gripping end. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311418263">Figure 2</xref> shows the geometrical configuration of the fiber composite laminates with 8-bolted joints. The specimens with epoxy adhesives and those without had the same configuration. The Techniglue-HP structural epoxy supplied by ATL Composites was applied on both sides of the composite laminates before the torque was applied on the bolts. Washers were also provided between the composite laminates and the splice plates to maintain the thickness of the epoxy. The epoxy adhesives were allowed to harden for a week before the specimens were tested.

<p>The experimental test set-up for composite laminate with bolted joints is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311418263">Figure 3</xref>. Angular aluminum bars were attached on both sides of the composite laminate and the splice plates. Linear and draw-wire displacement transducers (LVDT) were then provided on these aluminum angular bars to measure the relative displacement between the composite laminate and the splice plates. Displacement transducers were also used to determine if slipping would occur at the metal grips during the initial tests. Each specimen was instrumented with back-to-back strain gauges attached on the splice plates to measure the load distribution on the bolt rows. The specimens were gripped at both ends in a 500 kN capacity universal testing machine and tension force was applied at the top end while keeping the bottom end fixed. All specimens were loaded at a rate of approximately 0.5 kN/s and all the measurements were obtained using a data logger. The test was discontinued after a drop in the applied load was observed and the specimen was removed from the testing machine to observe and record the final failure mode.

<sec id="sec6-0021998311418263"><title>Full-scale test of composite beams with mechanical joints</title>
<p>The flexural behavior of the full-scale fiber composite beams with mechanical joints at midspan was determined. The composite beam has a total length of 3700 mm and a clear span of 3000 mm. In the preparation of the full-scale specimen with bolted joints, the composite beam was cut into halves with lengths of 1850 mm each. The location of the bolt holes was marked and the holes were made on each beam usinga diamond-tipped drill bit. The cut beams were joined at the flanges using 10 mm diameter stainless steel bolts and 9 mm thick SS400 splice plates, while 4 mm thick splice plates were used to connect the web. A gap of 5 mm was provided between the beam end faces. Atorque of 20 N-m was applied to the bolts.</p>
<p>The beam with bolted and epoxy bonded joints had the same configuration as the beam without epoxy. Inorder to maintain the thickness of the epoxy adhesives, washers were provided between the laminates and the splice plates.

The beam was simply supported and the load wasapplied manually by hydraulic jack at third points through a spreader beam. Displacement transducers were installed to measure the displacement at the loading points and at the midspan of the beam. Strain gauges were attached on the top and bottom flanges of the composite beams and the splice plates to evaluate the strain during loading and until failure. Data logger was used to record the strains with the load–deflection curve displayed in real time during testing to monitor the beam behavior.

<p>The experimental results for the fiber composite laminates with different bolted joint configurations are presented in the following sections. The behavior of the full-scale composite beams with bolted joints at midspan under static bending test is also discussed.</p>
<sec id="sec8-0021998311418263"><title>Effect of applied bolt torque on joint strength</title>
<p>The effect of the applied bolt torque on the strength of bolted joints in fiber composite laminates was determined. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311418263">Figure 6</xref> shows the failure load of composite laminates with 2 bolts at different levels of applied bolt torque (10, 15, 20, and 25 N-m). In the range of the investigated tightening torques, it was observed that the strength of bolted joints increased slightly with increasing tightening torque. The bolted joints with25 N-m tightening torque has the highest average failure load while the bolted joint specimen with 10 N-m tightening torque has the lowest. A more consistent result was also observed for bolted joints with a higher applied bolt torque. This could be due to the higher lateral constraint provided by the higher clamping pressure in the splice plates which suppressed the out-of-plane deformation in the composite laminates. Forspecimens with higher applied bolt torque, the damaged laminates due to bearing accumulated between the splice plates and the specimens were able to carry a higher load before the final failure. However, it was observed that the specimens with 20 and 25 N-m applied bolt torque failed at almost the same level of applied load. In order to determine the optimal amount of applied torque to be used in the succeeding tests, thebehavior of composite laminates with 8-bolted joints using 20 and 25 N-m applied torque was examined.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311418263">Figure 7</xref> shows the load–bolt displacement relationship of laminates with 8 bolts at 20 and 25 N-m applied torque. In the figure, the load is the resistance of the specimen while the displacement is the difference of the averages in the readings on displacement transducers attached on both sides of the specimen which includes the hole elongation and the bolt deformation. The load–displacement behavior indicated that with the different levels of bolt torque applied, there was very little friction resistance, since slipping of the connections occurred at the initial loading stage. The little resistance against slipping provided by the bolted joint can also be due to the stress relaxation due to creep in the through thickness direction of the laminates as observed by Caccese et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311418263">5</xref></sup> This relieves some of the clamping pressure provided by the applied bolt torque in thick fiber composite laminates. After slipping, the load displacement relation curve was almost linear indicating that the bolts already slipped into bearing with the composite laminates. This linear load–bolt displacement behavior occurred up to an applied load of around 300 kN and a displacement of 3 mm. After this point, the load displacement curve became nonlinear until final failure. This nonlinear behavior is due to the initiation of bearing failure in thefiber composite laminates combined with bending of the bolts. The load reduction occurred gradually as the crushing damage at the contact surface between the bolts and the bolt hole continues to grow. The load then suddenly dropped after excessive displacement. Itwas also observed that the specimens with 20 N-m applied bolt torque showed a higher stiffness and failed at a slightly higher load. The specimen 8b-20t failed at an average load of 420 kN while the specimen 8b-25t failed at 410 kN. It was then concluded that an applied torque of 20 N-m is reasonable for bolted connections of the full-scale fiber-reinforced composite beams. This is almost similar to the optimum bolt clamping pressure of 22 MPa for CF-reinforced laminates as recommended by Coolings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311418263">19</xref></sup>

<p>The contribution of epoxy adhesives on the strength and behavior of bolted joints for fiber-reinforced composite laminates was examined using specimens with 4 and 8-bolt configurations at 20 N-m tightening torque. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311418263">Figure 8</xref> shows the load–bolt displacement relationship of the specimens with and without epoxy adhesives. The results show that the slipping of the bolted joints in all specimens without epoxy occurred at a lower load. A linear load displacement curve was then observed up to approximately 140 kN and 320 kN for specimens 4b-20t and 8b-20t, respectively. The curve then became nonlinear until final failure. On the other hand, the contribution of epoxy adhesives issimilar for specimens 4b-20t-e and 8b-20t-e. The bolting accompanied by adhesive bonding provided resistance against slipping between the splice plates and the fiber composite laminates. There was no observed slip until an applied load less than the resistance developed between the two surfaces with the bolts carrying little load until the adhesives failed. Slipping occurred at an applied load of around 150 kN and 200 kN for specimens 4b-20t-e and 8b-20t-e, respectively. This shows that a higher resistance against slipping can be attained in bolted joints with epoxy adhesives. An abrupt drop in load was observed after debonding of the epoxy adhesives after which, the load again increased indicating that the applied load was transferred to the bolts. The connection then behaved similar to the bolted joints without epoxy adhesives until final failure.

This means that the bolts were loading the hole uniformly throughout the specimen thickness. On the other hand, a higher strain on the bolts close to the application of the load was measured than those bolts located farther back indicating the unequal distribution of load among the bolts.

These results verified that in multi row joints, the row of bolts closest to where the tensile load is applied carries the most load than those farther back. A higher load distribution factor was observed in the experiment for bolted specimens compared to the recommended values. The addition of epoxy adhesives further increased the load carried by the bolt rows closest to the applied load. In specimen 8b-20t-e, the bolt row number 1 carries almost all the load and the last row carries almost no load. The high load carried by the bolts closest to the application of load also explains the reasons why net-tension failure occurred in row 1 in the tested laminates from the web and also on the GF side of the flange with 4 and 8 bolts. In both specimens 8b-20t and 8b-20t-e, the load carried by bolt rows 1 and 2 is higher compared that of the suggested value of only 42% and 25%, respectively.

<p>In flange specimen with bolts and epoxy adhesives, the specimen 8b-20t-e failed due to the net tensile failure in the GF, bearing failure with shear out in the CF, and all the bolts in double shear as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0021998311418263">Figure 12(b)</xref>. Delamination between the CF and the GF laminates was also observed which resulted in the net tensile failure in the GF laminates and initiated theshear out failure in the CF as the CF and the GF laminates acted separately in resisting the applied load. Similarly, the bearing failure in the specimen 8b-20t is more obvious compared to specimen 8b-20t-e. This could be due to the slipping at the bolts which occurred at the early stage of load application for specimen without epoxy adhesives and resulted in a more gradual failure behavior than that of specimens with bolts andepoxy.</p>

According to the result, the beam FC1 behaves linear elastic up to failure. The beam failed at an applied load of 94.9 kN and a midspan deflection of 39.1 mm. The slope of the load-midspan deflection of beam FC2 is the same as that of beam FC1 only up to an applied load of 5 kN. With the continuous application of load, the beam showed a slight yet steady decrease in the stiffness. This could be due to the slipping of the bolts and the gap provided between the beam end faces which allowed the specimen to rotate. The specimen was loaded up to 97.9 kN with a midspan deflection of 56.3 mm. This applied load is slightly higher compared with the load capacity of the hybrid FRP girder without joints. However, the beam deflected to a greater degree than expected. At this point, the test was stopped and the load was released. There were no signs of failure observed in the bolts and in the composite laminates when the splice plates were detached. It was then concluded that if the test was continued, the beam FC2 might have carried a higher load before its final failure. Using the same beam, epoxy adhesives were provided inthe bolted splice joints and the flexural behavior of this beam was examined under the same loading condition.

<p>In the fiber composite beam with bolted and epoxy bonded joints, the load increases linearly with deflection until final failure. There was almost no decrease instiffness observed at every initiation of epoxy debonding at the splice plates. The beam FC3 failed at an applied load of 93.9 kN with a midspan deflection of 36.9 mm. It is noteworthy that the stiffness of beamFC3 is slightly higher than that of specimen FC1 even though the load levels at failure are almost identical for the two specimens. The difference in observed stiffness can be attributed to the contribution of the steel splice plates on the bending resistance of thebeam. Similarly, the epoxy filling the gap between the beam ends might have prevented it to rotate.</p>
<p>Overall, the beam FC3 exhibited the same strength and stiffness as the beam FC1 while beam FC2 has only65% of the stiffness of specimen FC1. This result suggests that the use of combined bolts and epoxy adhesives provided a more reliable connection method for fiber-reinforced composite beams.</p>

Results showed that the strains in both tension and compression increased linearly with load for all beams. This suggests that the composite beams with and without bolted joints behaved linearly elastic during the test. An average maximum strain of around 4500 μm in tension and 4600 μm in compression were measured for all beams at failure. It is interesting to note that the failure in all beams occurred at a level of compressive strain comparable with the established critical strain value of 4000 microstrains determined from the test of coupons while the maximum tensile strain measured was only 30% of the failure strain.

A decrease in strain was then observed with the continuous application of the load at different levels. This showed that there was a progressive debonding of epoxy in the joints of beam FC3. At every initiation of epoxy debonding, a sudden decrease in strain at the outer part of the splice plate was observed but increased again which indicates that the bolts at these locations started to carry the load.

In general, higher strains were measured in the splice plates of beam FC2 than in beam FC3. This shows that the bolts in beams without epoxy are more stressed compared to the beams with epoxy.

<p>The beam FC2 exhibited large amount of deflection when the test was stopped at an applied load of 97.9 kN.

This is due to the high tensile strength of the fiber composite laminates in the flanges eliminating the possibility of net tensile failure. Using the <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula4-0021998311418263">Equation (4)</xref>, the estimated joint capacities based on the strength of the bolts in double shear are 5–7% higher than the experimental results. Based on the predicted values, it can be concluded that the flange of the fiber composite beams with bolted joints should be designed to fail due to bearing in the laminates. Bearing failure is the crushing of the fiber composite material supporting the bolt which is a desirable form of failure due to its progressive nature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311418263">21</xref></sup> This result also showed that the strength of the bolted joints in the flanges can be reliably designed based on the compressive strength properties of the materials determined from the test of coupons. Furthermore, the result showed that an edge distanceof 30 mm is sufficient for the fiber composite beams with mechanical joints since the bearing failure occurred.</p>
<p>The predicted load of the web specimen with bolted joints due to bearing and double shear (of the bolts) is1.3 to 6.4 times higher than the actual failure load. However, the failure load estimated based on the tensilestrength of the web using the <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0021998311418263">Equation (2)</xref> is only 10-12% higher compared to the failure load obtained fromthe experiment. A failure load of almost 76 kN was computed for the web to fail in net tension but all the web specimens failed at the critical section at a load of around 68 kN. The lower failure load could bedue to the presence of the bolt holes which might have damaged the ±45° GF fibers thus reducing its strength.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec15-0021998311418263" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Experimental investigation on the behavior of fiber composite materials made up of carbon and GFs with bolted joints was conducted using test of coupon specimens and full-scale beams. The effects of applied bolt torque, contribution of epoxy adhesives, and the number and configurations of bolts on the strength and the failure mode of bolted joints were examined.</p>
<p>The results of test using fiber composite laminates with double-lap bolted connections showed that at different levels of applied bolt torque, little friction resistance developed between the splice plates and thecomposite laminates but increased significantly with the addition of epoxy adhesives. A slight increase in the failure load was however observed with the increasing tightening torque. The flange specimens with bolted joints failed due to bearing failure with initial signs of shearing out while the web specimen failed due to net-tension failure. It was verified that the strength of the fiber composite laminate with bolted joints can be approximated using the mechanical properties obtained from the coupon tests.</p>
<p>The combination of bolts and epoxy adhesives was determined to be a better connection for the fiber composite beams than bolts alone. The beam with this type of connection at midspan exhibited the same strength and stiffness as the composite beam without joints while connecting with bolts alone resulted in a beam with only 65% of the stiffness of those without joints. The final failure of the composite beams with and without joints was the delamination between the stiff composites of the combined CF and GF and the comparatively soft GF at the top flange. This shows that if the joint is sufficiently designed, the strength and behavior of the composite beams with joints is governed by the compressive strength of the flange.</p>
<p>Further investigation on the behavior of full-size beam with joints not at the midspan should be conducted. Similarly, studies on hybrid FRP beams with bolted connections which will fail at the joints should be carried out in order to fully examine the behavior of this type of connection. The results of these studies could provide a better understanding on the behavior of bolted connection leading to the practical application of fiber composite beams investigated in this study for civil infrastructure.</p></sec>
