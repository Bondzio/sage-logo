<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study was to clarify the role of shared leadership in self-directed teams by testing its relationship with teamwork mental models and team performance. Data from 40 intact, naturally occurring teams involved in highly interdependent tasks demonstrated that the distribution of informal leadership and whether or not perceptions of leadership were reciprocated among leaders were related to the degree of similarity and accuracy of team mental models as well as subsequent team performance. Specifically, teams with a coordinated type of shared-leadership perception demonstrated significantly higher levels of team mental model similarity, team mental model accuracy, and team performance than teams with a distribution of leaders that failed to recognize each other as leaders as well as teams with no leaders. However, teams with distributed-coordinated leadership were significantly different than teams with centralized leadership only with respect to team mental model accuracy scores. Finally, this study builds on prior research by demonstrating that the team mental model accuracy contributes more to team performance than team mental model similarity.</p>

<p>Emergent leaders are individuals whose power and influence over others in a group are derived from acceptance by group members rather than from position, status, or rank. In other words, emergent leaders have earned, over time and past experiences with others, their leadership role to the extent that they are perceived as such by the rest of the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1368430211422923">Hall, Workman, &amp; Marchioro, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368430211422923">Hollander &amp; Julian, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1368430211422923">Schneier &amp; Goktepe, 1983</xref>). To emerge as leaders, individuals must demonstrate characteristics and behaviors that fellow members interpret as enabling the group to complete the task at hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1368430211422923">Lord, Foti, &amp; De Vader, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1368430211422923">Neubert &amp; Taggar, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1368430211422923">Nye, 2002</xref>). Emergent leaders play a significant role, by influencing group processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1368430211422923">Taggar, Hackett, &amp; Saha, 1999</xref>), efficacy, emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1368430211422923">Pescosolido, 2002</xref>) and, ultimately, outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1368430211422923">Kickul &amp; Neuman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1368430211422923">Mehra, Smith, Dixon, &amp; Robertson, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Since emergent leaders play a significant role in influencing group processes and performance, it is important to understand how leadership emerges in an undifferentiated group. The purpose of the current study is to focus on what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1368430211422923">Morgeson, DeRue, and Karam (2010)</xref> term nontraditional emergent leadership structures. We view this as an important advance because it helps not only to shift the focus from <italic>the leader</italic> of a group to the <italic>leadership processes</italic> within a group, but it also explicitly acknowledges the diverse sources of leadership within a group.</p>
<p>Increased interest in emergent leaders within groups can be at least partially attributed to two factors. The first factor is the recent rise in self-managed work teams and the consequent need for leadership to arise from within groups rather than being imposed upon them externally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1368430211422923">Pearce &amp; Conger, 2003</xref>). The second factor is the idea that leadership can be shared, or distributed, across a number of group members, rather than being focused in a single leader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1368430211422923">Carson, Tesluk, &amp; Marrone, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1368430211422923">Day, Gronn, &amp; Salas, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368430211422923">Friedrich, Vessey, Schuelke, Ruark, &amp; Mumford, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1368430211422923">Mehra et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1368430211422923">Pearce &amp; Conger, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1368430211422923">Pearce &amp; Sims, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Shared leadership has been defined as a process that results from the dynamic interactive influence among a group of members who are pursuing similar group or organizational goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1368430211422923">Morgeson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1368430211422923">Pearce &amp; Conger, 2003</xref>). When leadership is shared, an individual’s role may repeatedly shift from leader to follower or follower to leader, as new events are encountered which require the unique expertise of team members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368430211422923">Friedrich et al., 2009</xref>). When these changes occur frequently, leadership may be more appropriately conceptualized as an emergent property of a team rather than at the individual level of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1368430211422923">Shondrick, Dinh, &amp; Lord, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Within self-managed teams, often there is a reliance on members to step forward and informally carry out leadership functions within the team. Moreover, it is believed the persons actually doing the work (i.e., the team members) are in the best position to determine who should take various role responsibilities. Using an emergent-leadership approach to examining shared leadership focuses on leadership as a phenomenological construct. That is, leaders are in the eye of the beholder. This perspective is consistent with the classic sociometric work on emergent leadership in groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1368430211422923">Bales, 1950</xref>) as well as implicit leadership theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1368430211422923">Lord, Foti, &amp; Phillips, 1982</xref>) and follower-centric views of leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430211422923">Meindl, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Working cooperatively requires that group members coordinate by anticipating and predicting each other’s needs through a common understanding of the environment and expectations of performance. This shared understanding of team goals, individual team member tasks, and the coordination of the team to achieve common goals is referred to as team mental models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1368430211422923">Cannon-Bowers, Salas, &amp; Converse, 1993</xref>). Team mental models are the cognitive structures individuals use to organize information about their dynamic team environment and the response patterns needed to manage these dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1368430211422923">Salas, Rosen, Burke, &amp; Goodwin, 2009</xref>). Therefore, teams with well-developed team mental models should have a common view of what is happening, what is likely to happen next, and why it is happening; enabling enhanced decision making and higher performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1368430211422923">Cannon-Bowers et al., 1993</xref>). Thus, a common theoretical assumption is that team mental models are precursors to effective team performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1368430211422923">Klimoski &amp; Mohammed, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1368430211422923">Salas et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>More importantly, when leadership is shared, a clear and unifying direction is well understood within the team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1368430211422923">Carson et al., 2007</xref>). A common direction facilitates the development of accurate shared mental models of their operating environment and how, as a team, they need to respond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1368430211422923">Kozlowski, Gully, McHugh, Salas, &amp; Canon-Bowers, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368430211422923">Kozlowski, Watola, Jensen, Kim, &amp; Botero, 2009</xref>). In addition, team mental models are likely facilitated by shared leadership through the continual interactions and social exchanges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1368430211422923">Klimoski &amp; Mohammed, 1994</xref>) that occur as team members share leadership responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1368430211422923">Burke, Fiore, &amp; Salas, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Although leadership processes may directly impact team performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1368430211422923">Pearce &amp; Sims, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1368430211422923">Taggar et al., 1999</xref>), perhaps this relationship can be better understood by accounting for other, intermediary processes such as fostering shared and accurate team mental models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1368430211422923">Day et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1368430211422923">Klimoski &amp; Mohammed, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1368430211422923">Zaccaro, Rittman, &amp; Marks, 2001</xref>). Therefore, the purpose of the current investigation is to contribute to both areas of research by clarifying the role of shared leadership in self-directed teams with respect to its impact on team mental models and the impact of both of these variables on team performance.</p>

<title>Team mental models</title>
<p>A team mental model is the structural representation of an individual group member’s knowledge and level of expertise concerning key elements of his or her team environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1368430211422923">Cannon-Bowers et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1368430211422923">Klimoski &amp; Mohammed, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1368430211422923">Mohammed, Klimoski, &amp; Rentsch, 2000</xref>). Specifically, the codevelopment of team mental models among team members enables them to anticipate one another’s actions and coordinate these actions in complex, high-pressure situations in which there is insufficient time for communication and planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1368430211422923">Edwards, Day, Arthur, &amp; Bell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368430211422923">Lim &amp; Klein, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Conceptually, the primary distinction between team mental models and shared leadership is that the latter concerns collective influence, whereas the former concerns collective cognition. Specifically team mental models refer to the manner in which knowledge important to team functioning is mentally organized, represented, and distributed within the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368430211422923">Kozlowski &amp; Ilgen, 2006</xref>), whereas, with shared leadership different members contribute leadership influence while working on a single task or project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1368430211422923">Pearce &amp; Conger, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Team mental models have been classified into four domains: equipment, task, team members, and team interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1368430211422923">Cannon-Bowers et al., 1993</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1368430211422923">Mathieu, Heffner, Goodwin, Salas, and Cannon-Bowers (2000)</xref> consolidated these four content areas, reducing them to two categories: (a) taskwork, which includes task and tool models, and (b) teamwork, which includes team member and team interaction models. Due to the emphasis on leadership and interpersonal dynamics in the current research, this latter type of team mental model—teamwork—is the focus of this study.</p>

<title>Shared leadership and team mental models</title>
<p>The presence of multiple leaders within a group has been theorized as having both positive and negative consequences. For example, some researchers believe multiple leaders within a group will lead to decentralized authority, less agreement and more conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1368430211422923">Festinger, Schachter, &amp; Bach, 1950</xref>). However, others suggest multiple leaders may be helpful through an increase in communication, the quantity of information being circulated throughout the group, cooperation, and a lower susceptibility to groupthink (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1368430211422923">Stewart &amp; Manz, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Some team researchers have proposed a relationship between leadership and shared team mental models. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1368430211422923">Marks, Zaccaro, and Mathieu (2000)</xref> showed that when a leader was extensively debriefed about the crucial elements in the team’s task environment, team mental model similarity and accuracy increased, which then boosted cooperative interactions and level of team performance. Marks et al.’s finding showed the importance of a single team leader in regulating the shift of team knowledge structures in accurate and similar ways in order to respond effectively. Furthermore, Kozlowski and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1368430211422923">Kozlowski et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368430211422923">Kozlowski et al., 2009</xref>) posited that leaders enhance the development of team mental models through setting learning goals and giving feedback. Therefore, the development of similar and accurate team mental models may hinge on the presence of multiple leaders within the group to encourage communication and the spreading of crucial team knowledge. However, the impact of multiple emergent leaders on this process has not been empirically tested.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the relationship between shared leadership and team work mental model variables may not be linear and straightforward. Shared leadership in the context of group functioning has been classified in two ways: (a) distributed-fragmented and (b) distributed-coordinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1368430211422923">Mehra et al., 2006</xref>). In distributed-coordinated shared leadership, group members conceptualize leadership as a process that can be shared and mutually enacted and reciprocated among group members. There is a dynamic exchange of leadership and followership that is constantly being renegotiated across time and situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1368430211422923">DeRue &amp; Ashford, 2010</xref>). In such contexts, the boundaries between leader and follower roles are permeable, and as a result, few conflicts and little tension over leadership will emerge.</p>
<p>In a team with distributed-fragmented leadership perceptions, multiple individuals are identified by their teammates as leaders but do not recognize one another as leaders. Given the importance of leadership in aiding the communication of information to team members and developing accurate knowledge structures that will help the team adapt to changing task demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1368430211422923">Marks et al., 2000</xref>), when there is distributed-fragmented leadership, communication within the team may be stunted. As a result, the team may be subdivided and not able to effectively coordinate their efforts, resulting in the emergence of multiple divergent mental models within the group. On the other hand, if distributed-coordinated leadership emerges within the team, there is more potential for the leaders to synchronize their efforts, strategies and responsibilities. Subsequently, the information and knowledge that these leaders convey to the team may represent the actions of all members, binding their concerted efforts into one mental model that is both similar and accurate. Therefore, given the interdependent nature of the team task, requiring inputs from multiple team members, and the amount of time the team members worked together, we made the following hypotheses. Groups with distributed-coordinated leadership will have higher team mental model similarity (Hypothesis 1a) and accuracy (Hypothesis 1b) than groups with distributed-fragmented leadership, groups with centralized leadership, and groups with no leader.</p>

<sec id="section3-1368430211422923">
<title>Shared leadership and team performance</title>
<p>Shared leadership is an important resource available to teams, and therefore it should enhance team performance on complex tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1368430211422923">Day et al., 2004</xref>). However, when team members perceive differences in leadership relationships among team members, it can result in negative team outcomes such as team conflict and decreased level of performance. Ultimately, the reciprocation of leadership, or the lack thereof, will have both direct effects on team processes, such as team mental models as well as direct effects on team outcomes, such as performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368430211422923">Friedrich et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1368430211422923">Mehra et al. (2006)</xref> partially clarified the relationship between shared leadership and team performance by demonstrating that the extent to which shared leadership positively influences team performance depends on whether the distribution of leadership within a team was coordinated or fragmented. Specifically, teams with distributed-coordinated leadership exhibited higher levels of team performance than teams with one centralized leader; whereas teams with distributed-fragmented leadership did not.</p>
<p>The current study differs from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1368430211422923">Mehra et al. (2006)</xref> in two ways. The first difference between <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1368430211422923">Mehra et al.’s (2006)</xref> and the current study concerns the nature of the task. In the Mehra et al.’s study, the task was financial services sales. The frequency of team meetings ranged from weekly to monthly. In the current study, given the highly interdependent nature of the team problem-solving task, the team members worked together almost daily. The second difference is that the teams in Mehra et al.’s study contained formally appointed leaders. Therefore, the conceptualization of shared leadership involved perceptions of leadership among formal and informal leaders in the same teams. Although obstacles to reciprocity in leadership perceptions may differ between these two types of groups, it seems likely that members of both types of groups are likely to hold conceptualizations of leadership ranging from a process that can be shared and mutually enacted among group members to one that is hierarchically structured with only one leader in a group. Given the highly interdependent, complex nature of the team task in the current investigation and the view that shared leadership is an important team resource for complex tasks, it is hypothesized that groups with distributed-coordinated leadership will outperform groups with distributed-fragmented leadership, centralized leadership, or no leader (Hypothesis 2).</p>

<sec id="section4-1368430211422923">
<title>Team mental models and team performance</title>
<p>Findings in team research point to a consistent positive impact of team mental models on various aspects of team functioning such as coordination and cooperation among team members, as well as team performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1368430211422923">Kang, Yang, &amp; Rowley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1368430211422923">Marks, Sabella, Burke, &amp; Zaccaro, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1368430211422923">Marks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1368430211422923">Mohammed, Ferzandi, &amp; Hamilton, 2010</xref>). In addition, team mental models are related to both subjective and objective indicators of team performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1368430211422923">DeChurch &amp; Mesmer-Magnus, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1368430211422923">Mohammed et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>There has been some debate over the relative contributions of team mental model similarity and accuracy to levels of team performance. Similarity among team mental models refers to the extent to which teammates’ cognitive structures match one another, whereas accuracy refers to the extent to which teammates’ mental models match “correct” or target cognitive structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1368430211422923">Edwards et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368430211422923">Lim &amp; Klein, 2006</xref>). Because shared teamwork knowledge may turn out to be erroneous, highly convergent mental models, in combination with those that are of high quality, are expected to yield the greatest team performance benefits (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1368430211422923">Edwards et al., 2006</xref>). That is, if members share a common mental model that accurately captures their performance requirements for a given environment, it will best enable them to respond effectively. Alternatively, should a highly shared model turn out to be inaccurate, it could prove quite detrimental for the team. Indeed, failure to measure accuracy may overestimate the importance of similarity when accuracy is really driving relationships with team outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1368430211422923">Smith-Jentsch, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent studies exploring the role of accuracy in shared-knowledge representations suggest that similarity and accuracy have both unique and interactive effects on team performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368430211422923">Lim &amp; Klein, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1368430211422923">Marks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368430211422923">Mathieu, Heffner, Goodwin, Cannon-Bowers, &amp; Salas, 2005</xref>); however, the empirical results are quite mixed. The results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368430211422923">Lim and Klein (2006)</xref> revealed main effects on performance but no significant interaction between the similarity and accuracy of teamwork mental models. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368430211422923">Mathieu et al. (2005)</xref> found no main effects but a significant interaction between teamwork similarity and accuracy in predicting team processes. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1368430211422923">Marks et al. (2000)</xref> reported an interaction between the similarity and accuracy of teamwork mental models in predicting team performance. Therefore, it is hypothesized that both team mental model similarity and accuracy will predict the level of team performance. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the relationship between mental model similarity and team performance will be stronger when team mental model accuracy is also high resulting in a significant interaction between similarity and accuracy (Hypothesis 3).</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section6-1368430211422923">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 40 undergraduate computer science teams from universities throughout the northeast United States, participating in a regional computing competition. Each team consisted of three individual members for a total of 120 participants. The team members represented the top-ranked junior and senior computer science majors from their respective universities and were hand-picked by their professors to participate in the team competition. The teams had formed approximately 3 months prior to the competition and engaged in extensive preparation for the competition during this time.</p>
<p>The competition, itself, required each team to solve 20 computer-programming problems in 5 hours. The content of the competition was summarized by expert judges as problem-solving scenarios that tested the team’s creativity, programming skills, and ability to work together. The teams were also described by their professors as highly interdependent in that most problems in the competition required the input of all team members to be solved accurately. For example, each problem must be broken into subtasks and assigned to team members such that all team members should be working at once in order to maximize efficiency. Furthermore, professors indicated that team members typically choose the strategy of double-checking each others’ work and providing continuous internal feedback prior to submitting a response. Feedback concerning the accuracy of each submitted response was immediately provided to the teams, allowing teams to regroup and adjust their strategies. Therefore, the task resembled a combination of additive and conjunctive tasks. In exchange for participation, there was a lottery drawing in which two of the participating teams were randomly selected to each receive $100.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section8-1368430211422923">
<title>Leadership perceptions</title>
<p>Using the social network analysis based approach by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1368430211422923">Mehra et al. (2006)</xref>; participants were provided with a list of their team members and asked to check those they perceived as a leader. Each team member was asked to nominate leaders within the team in response to the question “Who do you see as the leader(s) of your team? Check all that apply.”</p>
<p>Perceptions of leadership distributions were examined and placed into four categories, as follows: Teams in which no leaders emerged were coded as “no leaders” (<italic>n</italic> = 10); teams in which only one leader emerged were coded as “centralized leadership” (<italic>n</italic> = 11). In order to ascertain the degree to which multiple leaders within a team acknowledged one another as such, teams with multiple leaders were identified and the leadership scores given for each leader by the other leader(s) were examined. A team was categorized as “distributed-coordinated” if all emergent leaders identified one another as leaders (<italic>n</italic> = 12). In other words, at least two members emerged as leaders and both (or all) recognized one another as occupying the role of leader. Conversely, teams in which two or more leaders emerged but at least one of the leaders failed to acknowledge the other leader(s) in the team were classified as “distributed-fragmented” (<italic>n</italic> = 7).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1368430211422923">
<title>Teamwork mental models</title>
<p>The content to be included in the team mental model measure was acquired from the two judges in the competition, in the form of a detailed, written description of how teams should best interact with one another and what sequences of actions would be most appropriate and beneficial to improving competition performance. The written descriptions were then examined by the researchers and reduced to nine concepts, each concept ranging from being very closely related to not at all related to each of the other concepts. Example concepts included “Rank order the problems in terms of level of difficulty” and “Check/supervise each other’s work.” The participants were asked to indicate the relatedness of each pair of concepts (36 pairs, total) on a scale from 1 (not at all related) to 9 (very highly related). The two expert judges also completed the measure in order to obtain an index of accuracy for the team members’ mental models.</p>
<p>Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1368430211422923">Marks et al. (2002)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368430211422923">Lim and Klein (2006)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1368430211422923">Edwards et al. (2006)</xref>, Pathfinder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1368430211422923">Schvaneveldt, 1990</xref>) was used to assess the structure of the team mental models. In order to determine the similarity of team mental models within a team, Pathfinder computed a similarity index (<italic>C</italic>) for each pair of team members per team. <italic>C</italic> equals the number of links in common between the networks divided by the total number of links in both networks, resulting in a score that ranges from 0 (not at all similar) to 1 (identical) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1368430211422923">Schvaneveldt, 1990</xref>). There were three members per team; therefore three similarity indices were computed. Next, these similarity indices (one for each pair of team members in each team) were averaged to produce an overall team mental model similarity score.</p>
<p>In order to calculate team mental model accuracy, a technique used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368430211422923">Lim and Klein (2006)</xref> was employed. Specifically, team mental model accuracy was determined by calculating the similarity index between each individual member’s model and the average between the two experts’ models. Prior team mental model research has demonstrated stronger support for the predictive validity of indices obtained from averaged expert models over a single expert model (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1368430211422923">Day, Arthur, &amp; Gettman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1368430211422923">Edwards et al., 2006</xref>). However, in order to justify averaging the experts’ models, and thus the quality of the averaged model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368430211422923">Mathieu et al., 2005</xref>), the similarity index between these two models, as well as the similarity index between each individual model and the average, was computed. All three indexes were found to be adequate (<italic>C</italic> = .71; <italic>C</italic> = .67; <italic>C</italic> = .73, respectively) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1368430211422923">Edwards et al., 2006</xref>). Since there were three members in each team, three similarity indices were calculated. Then, the similarity scores of all members in each team were averaged for an overall team mental model accuracy score.</p>

<title>Task performance</title>
<p>The objective measure of performance for each team was its final score in the regional competition. The score is a calculation taking into account the following factors in descending order: the number of problems each team accurately completed, the amount of time taken to complete each problem, and the number of problems attempted. In essence, the more problems completed in the shortest amount time, the higher the team’s score.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Data were collected in a two-step process. At Time 1, each participant completed a packet containing the teamwork mental models measure and the shared-leadership questionnaire. Once the researcher had received the completed packets, there was a random drawing of two teams, and each team received $100. At Time 2, the team performance scores were requested from the judges.</p>

<title>Shared leadership and team mental models</title>
<p>Two one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were performed to determine the impact of shared-leadership perceptions (no leader, centralized leadership, distributed-coordinated, distributed-fragmented) on teamwork mental model similarity and accuracy (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1368430211422923">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1368430211422923">3</xref>, respectively). The global <italic>F</italic> statistic was significant for both team mental model similarity, <italic>F</italic>(3, 36) = 7.83 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and teamwork mental model accuracy, <italic>F</italic>(3, 36) = 6.75 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Furthermore, post hoc multiple comparisons between distributed-coordinated leadership and each of the remaining categories of leadership perception (distributed-fragmented, centralized, and no leader) were calculated. Due to unequal group sizes, the Tukey-Kramer procedure was used. For teamwork mental model similarity, comparisons revealed significant differences between teams with distributed-coordinated leadership and teams with the following distributions of leadership (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1368430211422923">Table 2</xref>): distributed-fragmented and no leader. For teamwork mental model accuracy, post hoc comparisons yielded significant differences between teams with distributed-coordinated leadership and teams with the following distributions of leadership (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1368430211422923">Table 3</xref>): distributed-fragmented, centralized leadership, and no leader. Therefore, partial support was found for Hypothesis 1a and 1b. In other words, teams with distributed-coordinated leadership had a greater overlap in teamwork mental models than teams with distributed-fragmented leadership and teams with no leader. Furthermore, teams with distributed-coordinated leadership had more accurate teamwork mental models than teams with distributed-fragmented, centralized, or no leadership.</p>

<title>Team mental models and team performance</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1368430211422923">Table 1</xref>, both teamwork mental model similarity and accuracy were significantly correlated with team performance. Hypothesis 3 was tested in a two-step hierarchical regression analysis. In Model 1, team performance was regressed onto both teamwork mental model similarity and accuracy, simultaneously. As predicted, teamwork mental model similarity and accuracy, together, significantly predicted team performance (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .32, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). However, only the mental model accuracy beta weight was significant (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1368430211422923">Table 5</xref>). Although the beta weight for mental model similarity was nonsignificant, the correlation between teamwork mental model similarity and performance was significant (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1368430211422923">Table 1</xref>). Model 2 of the hierarchical regression analysis included the main effects of teamwork mental model similarity and accuracy with the addition of the product term of these two variables. Model 2 was significant (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .33, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). However, the beta weight for the product term was nonsignificant (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1368430211422923">Table 5</xref>). Therefore, Hypothesis 3 was partially supported. Accuracy of the teamwork mental models predicted team performance, but the relationship between team mental model similarity and team performance was not strengthened by higher levels of accuracy in teamwork mental models.</p>

<p>The current findings contribute to a mounting body of literature regarding the impact of shared leadership on team effectiveness (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1368430211422923">Carson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1368430211422923">Mehra et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1368430211422923">Taggar et al., 1999</xref>). Specifically, our results suggest shared leadership is beneficial to both team mental model accuracy and team performance levels when perceptions of leadership are coordinated among team leaders. To date, there has been no investigation into the relationship between shared leadership and team mental model variables in teams. Therefore, this study adds to the empirical and theoretical domain of teams and leadership by providing an empirical link between these two variables.</p>
<p>In addition, studies investigating the impact of team mental models on performance have predominantly focused on teams formed in laboratories (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368430211422923">Lim &amp; Klein, 2006</xref>). Although the teams included in the current investigation were composed of college students, the teams were naturally occurring in that they formed independently of this study and their performance goals had personal relevance and significance (e.g., winning the competition, academic recognition, and success). Therefore, the current study supplements the team mental model literature by providing further evidence of the positive effects of team mental model similarity and accuracy on performance in self-directed, naturally occurring teams, as well as demonstrating the importance of team mental model accuracy in determining team performance.</p>
<p>The focus of the current investigation was the distribution of leadership within self-directed teams. Therefore, the content of the team mental models measured in the current study included the most crucial aspects of the team’s competition performance that involved interactions among team members, rather than the specific technical knowledge contained in each problem. Given the highly technical nature of the problems being solved in the competition, it seems likely that the accuracy of task expertise models impacted team performance as well. The relative contributions of technical-task mental models and teamwork mental models to team effectiveness are encouraged in future endeavors.</p>
<p>In addition, we did not measure other alternative explanations for our results, such as liking or familiarity among team members, or general mental ability. However, teams were formed using a similar process (i.e., the three top computer science students at their respective universities) and worked together for a similar period of time.</p>
<p>An additional limitation to our results is the modest sample size of teams included in the analysis. The sample size provided sufficient power to detect some effects (i.e., power indices ranged from .78 to .96 for all significant effects). However, there was insufficient power to detect many of the effects. Specifically, power sizes were as low as .12 for the insignificant <italic>q</italic>-statistics computed for the post hoc comparisons and the interaction between the team mental model variables. Therefore, replication of the current findings with a larger sample of self-directed teams is warranted.</p>
<p>The current study was static in nature. All variables were measured within a short time period, and shared leadership was treated as an input variable. However, shared leadership has alternatively been conceptualized as emerging, fluctuating levels of leader-like behavior exhibited by all individuals throughout the lifetime of a team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1368430211422923">Barry, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368430211422923">Conger &amp; Pearce, 2003</xref>). Team mental models have also been treated as emerging, dynamic variables that change over time as a result of continuous learning and feedback (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1368430211422923">Burke, Stagl, Salas, Pierce, &amp; Kendall, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1368430211422923">Edwards et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, assessing these variables at multiple stages within the team’s lifetime might reveal more specific patterns of interaction among the process variables in response to feedback concerning performance and distance from goal performance levels.</p>
<p>For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1368430211422923">Pescosolido (2001)</xref> found that informal leadership was more influential over team processes early in the formation of the teams. Furthermore, team mental models require more dramatic development early on the formation of the team. However, the level of complexity and variability of team tasks may inhibit this trend and result in a greater need for leadership throughout the lifetime of the team. Therefore assessing the trends of these variables and how they interact over time may contribute to a greater understanding of the mechanism by which teams learn, improve and perform in future events.</p>
<p>As suggested by many, leadership is a promising leverage point for enhancing team effectiveness. Perhaps organizations should not reserve leadership development training for just the nominal person in charge of the team. Developing leadership in all team members may result in better team functioning. Organizations may also want to look for ways to facilitate shared leadership. For example, managers should ensure that each team has a clear and shared sense of direction and purpose, promote and establish norms of participation and input into the team’s activities and strategies, and seek to foster a positive environment where team members encourage one another and actively recognize each other’s contributions.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our findings build on prior research to demonstrate the importance of shared-leadership distribution for both teamwork mental models and performance levels of self-directed teams. Specifically, we found that shared leadership is beneficial to the accuracy of team mental models and team performance when perceptions of leadership are reciprocal among leaders. However, failure of multiple leaders to acknowledge one another is highly detrimental to these outcomes.</p>
