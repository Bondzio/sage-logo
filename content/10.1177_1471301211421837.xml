<abstract>
<p>Quality of care, and indeed, quality of life, for people living with dementia in long-term care is often underpinned by philosophies of care, such as person-centred care and relationship-centred care. The translation of these philosophies into practice is influenced by a range of individual and organizational features, including the context in which such care occurs. Within modern care organizations, the context of care is evidenced through organizational documents.</p>
<p>This study sought to identify the key documents guiding dementia care within one large Australian long-term care organization and to explore points of consistency and tension within the documented system of care. Results highlight a lack of consistency and clarity in the philosophy of dementia care and a disconnection between the key documents guiding practice. This disconnection creates tension for clinicians and carers, and may contribute to the gap between rhetoric and reality in dementia care.</p>
<p>This study suggests that a congruent documented dementia system can help bridge the gap between espoused philosophies of care and everyday care practices.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1471301211421837" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>People are living longer than at any other time in the past. As a result, the incidence of chronic conditions associated with ageing and longevity is rising rapidly. This is especially true fordementia, which is widely touted to be approaching epidemic proportions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1471301211421837">Access Economics Pty. Limited, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1471301211421837">Nepal, Ranmuthugala, Brown, &amp; Budge, 2008</xref>). Global burden of disease estimates suggest that the disability weight or burden for dementia is high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1471301211421837">World Health Organization, 2003</xref>). In Australia, dementia is estimated to be the leading causeof burden of disease among people aged 75 years and over and it creates the fifth highest burden across all ages (Australia Institute of Health and Welfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211421837">AIHW), 2010</xref>). In part, this is because people with dementia tend to be heavy consumers of health services, particularly community and long-term care services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1471301211421837">Ferri et al., 2005</xref>). Indeed, approximately 60 per cent of people living in long-term care in Australia have a recorded diagnosis of dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211421837">AIHW,2010</xref>) and this figure is estimated to be much higher if those without a formal diagnosis are considered. Furthermore, cognitive impairment is frequently a cause of admission to long-term care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1471301211421837">Andel, Hyer, &amp; Slack, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1471301211421837">Bharucha, Pandav, Shen, Dodge, &amp; Ganguli, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Although we can do little as yet to stop the onset or progressive decline associated with dementia, healthcare professionals in community and long-term care are well placed to affect quality of care and, by extension, quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1471301211421837">Courtney, O'Reilly, Edwards, &amp; Hassall, 2009</xref>). Since the late 1990s, notions of quality in dementia care have been associated with thephilosophies of person-centred care (based on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1471301211421837">Kitwood, 1997</xref>) and, more recently, relationship-centred care (based on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1471301211421837">Nolan, Davies, Brown, Keady, &amp; Nolan, 2004</xref>), and their tenets have become foundational to considerations of quality dementia care. Some of these tenets include the recognition of the ethical aspects of personhood, including interdependence and respect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1471301211421837">Kitwood, 1997</xref>); recognition of thesubjective experience of the person, regardless of cognitive ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1471301211421837">McCormack, 2004</xref>); the use of biographical knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1471301211421837">Kellett, Moyle, McAllister, King, &amp; Gallagher, 2010</xref>); a focus on the person over tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1471301211421837">Edvardsson, Fetherstonhaugh, &amp; Nay, 2010</xref>); and a recognition of the importance of the relationship between the person with dementia, their family and care staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211421837">Nolan et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1471301211421837"><title>Rhetoric and reality</title>
<p>These tenets have spawned a number of models and frameworks for practice including theSenses Framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1471301211421837">Nolan et al., 2004</xref>), the VIPS Framework<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1471301211421837"/> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1471301211421837">Brooker, 2007</xref>) and the person-centred care framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1471301211421837">McCormack &amp; McCance, 2006</xref>). While there is debate surrounding the theoretical and empirical rigour of such frameworks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1471301211421837">Edvardsson et al., 2010</xref>), it is widely accepted that, despite the best intentions of these models and frameworks, practice remains largely rooted in traditional, task-focused care, bound by the three Rs – routines, rules and regulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1471301211421837">Robinson &amp; Gallagher, 2008</xref>). As a result, it is increasingly obvious that there is a gap between the rhetoric surrounding accepted best practice and the realities of everyday practice in dementia care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1471301211421837">Draper, Low, Withall, Vickland, &amp; Ward, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1471301211421837">Hill, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1471301211421837">Moyle, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Consequently, researchers and service providers are increasingly focusing on ways to operationalize person- and relationship-centred care in an attempt to bridge this gap between rhetoric and reality. One of the approaches to achieving this is through education. This approach focuses on developing the knowledge and skills of individual care providers toenhance their understanding and uptake of philosophical tenets into practice. However, despite some benefits, it is increasingly recognized that education on its own is not sufficient tochange practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1471301211421837">Edvardsson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211421837">Nolan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1471301211421837">Vollmar, Butzlaff, Lefering, &amp; Reiger, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Other attempts at bridging the gap have focused on the link between social and physical environments, with space and design principles in the built environment increasingly being considered from a person- and relationship-centred viewpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1471301211421837">Alzheimer's Australia, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211421837">Davis, Byers, Nay, &amp; Koch, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1471301211421837">Fleming &amp; Purandare, 2010</xref>). Such approaches support dementia-friendly built environments that encourage active participation and an understanding of the experience of life through a social model rather than an institutional or medical model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211421837">Davis et al., 2009</xref>). Despite more aesthetic and dementia-friendly environments, there is little evidence of widespread alteration in everyday practice and quality of care for people with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1471301211421837">Edvardsson et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, an emerging area in bridging the gap between rhetoric and reality in dementia care incorporates insights from the field of knowledge transfer, knowledge translation and knowledge utilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1471301211421837">Moyle, 2010</xref>). These focus around processes to facilitate the dissemination and application of research findings and the subsequent use of this knowledge in changing practice, and embedding ‘best’ practice in a systematic and consistent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1471301211421837">Greenhalgh, Robert, Macfarlane, Bate, &amp; Kyriakidou, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1471301211421837">Quinlan, 2009</xref>). Although this approach offers the promise of actual change and alignment of principles and practice, it is also limited by the requirement for specialist staff, organizational commitment and appropriate resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1471301211421837">Moyle, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>What is evident, despite this body of work, is that, while there are some examples of qualitydementia care in practice, in general, everyday dementia care remains deeply rooted in traditional, task-focused care. A number of reasons have been proposed for this including the transient nature and often limited education of the long-term care workforce, the volume of research and speed of knowledge generation in dementia care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1471301211421837">Draper et al., 2009</xref>), thehistorically slow integration of research into practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211421837">Dearing &amp; Kreuter, 2010</xref>), and subtle differences between knowledge dissemination (which researchers may be experienced at), knowledge diffusion and knowledge utilisation (making changes in practice based on newknowledge) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211421837">Dearing &amp; Kreuter, 2010</xref>). Such challenges in the linkage of knowledge, evidence and practice are not, however, specific to dementia care or to aged care in general.Indeed, such gaps lie at the very core of the evidence-based practice movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1471301211421837">Dopson, FitzGerald, Ferlie, Gabbay, &amp; Locock, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In dementia care, this gap is, in part, a reflection of the fact that quality of care and quality of life are complex and multidimensional concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1471301211421837">Brod, Stewart, Sands, &amp; Walton, 1999</xref>) atboth an individual and a social level. Such complexity is compounded in the context of broader organizational systems, competing demands and the regulatory nature of contemporary long-term care provision. Together these individual, organizational and social factors form the context of care for people with dementia living in long-term care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1471301211421837"><title>Context of care: documentation</title>
<p>Within modern health and social care organizations, the context of care is manifested in organizational documents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1471301211421837">Prior, 2003</xref>). Modern organizations and social institutions produce massive volumes of documented material that are wide-ranging in scope and form. They may be hard copy or electronic, text or image or both, and relate to policy, education orpractice, including written policies, processes, guidelines, educational and training materials, forms and audits, as well as assessment and care plans, progress notes, medication administration forms, and behaviour charts. Most importantly, for the purposes of this study, documents may be organized into themes or systems associated with organizational endeavour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1471301211421837">Smith, 2005</xref>) or aspects of clinical practice. Thus, it is possible to identify an organization's system of dementia care through its documentation and to explore the context of dementia care through document analysis.</p>
<p>This paper explores an organizational care environment for people with dementia (the context of dementia care) evident in a documented dementia care system. This documented system analysis (based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1471301211421837">Smith, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1471301211421837">2005</xref>) was undertaken as part of a larger study on quality of life and moral worth of people with dementia living in long-term care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1471301211421837">Moyle, Hsu, Lieff, &amp; Vernooij-Dassen, 2010</xref>). Specifically, this documented system analysis sought to:
<list id="list1-1471301211421837" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>identify the organizational documents that guide the care of people with dementia within one care organization;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>consider the context of care identified through these documents; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>identify consistencies and tensions within the documented system of care for people with dementia.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1471301211421837"><title>Research method</title>
<p>The analysis method presented in this paper is based on hermeneutics and institutional ethnography. In its broadest sense, hermeneutics refers to the interpretation of texts and the study of meaning, while institutional ethnography is concerned with the ‘textual architecture of routine organisational action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1471301211421837">Campbell &amp; Gregor, 2004</xref>, p. 4). The method used is underpinned by considerations of language and tensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1471301211421837">Gadamer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1471301211421837">Smith, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1471301211421837">Townsend, Langille, &amp; Ripley, 2003</xref>). Such tensions reflect discord between the ‘truth’ of anexperience and the dominant ideology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211421837">Habermas, 1972</xref>). Identifying these tensions isanimportant mediator of understanding and the essence of the hermeneutic task. Such an approach also recognizes the broader sociocultural context of dementia and the experience of dementia care through a focus on organizational culture, defined here as the ‘material and ideational’ aspects of an organization represented through its documented systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1471301211421837">O'Connor et al., 2007</xref>, p. 132).</p>
<p>Two analytical movements are used within this study to identify tensions and uncoverpoints of dissonance within the documented system of dementia care. First, a question-and-answer dialectic is used, in which questions are posed and answers sought from within documents, and secondly, a process of critical reflection, moving between thewhole and the parts at various levels within the process of analysis is used. Thus, each document is analysed as both an individual document and as part of the broader documented system of dementia care.</p>
<p>The innovative research design used the following three-step approach:
<list id="list2-1471301211421837" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Gathering</italic> and <italic>sorting</italic> of relevant documents into a document matrix;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Analysis <italic>within</italic> a single document category (across-level analysis); and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Analysis <italic>across</italic> all document categories (drill-down analysis).</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The documentation matrix and analytical framework (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1471301211421837">Table 1</xref>) were developed in line with the aims of this study and are innovative in identifying new ways to manage and analyse documented data.

<sec id="sec5-1471301211421837"><title>The study</title>
<sec id="sec6-1471301211421837"><title>The setting</title>
<p>The study was conducted in one not-for-profit care organization operating a range of care services across New South Wales and Queensland, Australia. As well, as community care and retirement living services, the organization also operates 25 long-term care facilities, ranging in size from 60 to 160 beds. The documents involved in this study were those used across the 25 long-term care facilities. Like many aged care organizations in Australia, this organization is undergoing a period of rapid growth, as smaller providers are subsumed within larger organizations in search of ‘economies of scale’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1471301211421837"><title>Ethical considerations</title>
<p>The study received approval from the human research ethics committee of Griffith University and had the support of the not-for-profit organization. While the organization was supportive of this research, there was some concern over confidentiality and commercial sensitivities inrelation to the reporting of organizational material. Thus, for ethical and commercial reasons the reporting of source material in this paper is limited.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1471301211421837"><title>Data collection</title>
<p>Data collection entailed an iterative and exploratory process to identify and review relevant documents within the organization. Documents were drawn from electronic and hard-copy sources and identified:
<list id="list3-1471301211421837" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>through a process of electronic searching of the organization's document management system using the terms ‘dementia’ and ‘behaviour’;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>through manual searches; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>through the organization's dementia specialists and facility staff.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>This process was aided somewhat by the organization's document management system, which linked relevant documents, both internal and external to the organization, via hyperlinks or notation. As a result, a range of relevant documents were identified, including brochures, forms, policy and procedure documents, the mission statement, philosophy of care documents, dementia care educational resources for staff, assessment forms and care plans.</p>
<p>Documents underwent initial screening to ensure relevancy to the study and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1471301211421837">Table 2</xref> identifies the questions posed of each document during the initial screening. At this stage, it was determined that documents assigned to category 1 (higher-order documents that seek toguide care) would, by necessity, include general organizational documents, that is, they did not need to relate specifically to dementia care. This is because most care organizations onlyhave one set of guiding documents; one philosophy of care document, one mission statement and one set of organizational values. These would, therefore, be common drivers for any documented system within the organization. Category 2 (mid-range documents that seek to operationalize aspects of care within a documented system of care, e.g. guidelines, practice models) and category 3 documents (documents used in practice at the client/staff interface, e.g. care plans, assessment forms), however, are more specific and, in this study, dementia-specific documents were sought. Thus, documents were excluded if they related to general care (relevant to all clients with or without dementia). Due to the specific aims of the larger study, it was determined that category 4 documents (those that reflect outcomes of care, e.g. interviews, observations, satisfaction surveys) would be dealt with solely from a research focus. Results of the category 4 analysis are published separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1471301211421837">Moyle et al., 2011a</xref>; Moyle et al., 2011b).

<p>The above process resulted in a final set of organizational documents that were dementia-focused and covered policy, care, education, practice and regulation/standards. These documents were then catalogued into one of the three levels of the documentation matrix according to their category (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1471301211421837">Table 1</xref>). Following this, the analysis occurred, first across each of levels 1–3 followed by a drill-down analysis through each level within the matrix. Analysis considered language, context, history and culture, as well as temporal changes evident within the documents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1471301211421837">Gadamer, 2004</xref>). This level of analysis aimed to develop an understanding of the key elements of each category, including congruent or shared features and those that reflect a disconnection or that created dissonance and, therefore, tension within the documented system. The final stage of analysis involved a drill-down analysis to consider documents across all four categories in order to consider congruency, disconnections and tensions between the categories.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1471301211421837" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>Two main themes emerged from the analysis of each category and of the system as a whole. The first of these themes is titled ‘Aspiring, delivering, doing’ in response to the purpose and focus of each document category. The second theme is titled ‘The great divide’ in response to the findings from the drill-down analysis. Each theme contains a number of sub-themes.</p>
<sec id="sec10-1471301211421837"><title>Aspiring, delivering, doing</title>
<sec id="sec11-1471301211421837"><title>Aspiring … What we want to do!</title>
<p>Category 1 documents are aspirational in nature, in that they identify the values and goals of the organization. Documents in this category serve as the philosophical and theoretical drivers for the provision of care within the organization, and included the philosophy of care, mission, vision and value statements. Analysis of this category, as a whole, reveals a focus on the individual and on responsiveness to individual needs (both client and staff). The philosophy of care is referred to as the ‘lifestyle approach’ and this reflects a focus on supporting the maintenance of individualized choice and lifelong growth and participation as key outcomes for clients. Values identified within these documents included concepts such as honesty, integrity, trust, caring, respect and openness. In general, these documents identify with concerns about the individual's health, well-being, choice, decision-making and complex relationships.</p>
<p>Despite a general consistency in the focus of most of these documents, there are also someinconsistencies within this category, and a point of dissonance. Inconsistencies are particularly evident in the philosophy of care documents whereby a number of versions of these documents were evident and rather than old versions being archived as the documents were revised, they remained active in the system. While this led to some inconsistency and confusion, it did facilitate understanding of the development and evolution of this key document over time. For example, the addition of terminology associated with ‘evidence-based practice’ emerged in the most recent versions of the document, but was not evident in the original versions.</p>
<p>The organization's mission statement was also identified as a point of dissonance as this statement took a completely different focus to other documents in this category, by identifying the organization's mission in business terms (‘industry leader’; ‘first choice provider’), rather than in service terms, such as care. This dissonance creates a subtle tension in organizational identity and focus within the documents and this tension between business and care is highlighted further by the organization's listing as a not-for-profit setting.</p>

<p>Category 2 documents specifically serve toguide and direct the care of the person with dementia. Documents in this category include the organization's Dementia Approach (care model), dementia system views, brochures andprocess documents relating to the care of people with dementia and staff training and educational materials associated with dementia care. These documents draw heavily on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1471301211421837">Kitwood (1997)</xref> and are based, to a greater or lesser degree, on a person-centred care philosophy that recognizes the uniqueness of each individual. The key document in this category is the Dementia Approach (referred to as the Dementia Management Model), which is aligned to the National Framework for Action on Dementia (2006–2010) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1471301211421837">Australian Health Ministers’ Conference (AHMC), 2006</xref>) and includes value statements associated with inclusion, respect, personhood, sustaining and flexibility.</p>
<p>There are two sub-themes evident in the documents in this category. Firstly, the person withdementia is recognized as an individual whose personhood is to be valued and respected, and secondly, staff knowledge, skill and specialist support is considered to be a vital component of dementia care. Documents across this category display a high degree ofcongruency and indeed, most of them were authored by the same small group of specialist staff.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1471301211421837"><title>Doing … What we do when staff and residents come together!</title>
<p>Category 3 documents arethose used in the practice domain, where staff and clients come together in the process ofassessing, planning and documenting care of the person with dementia. Across-level analysis suggests that this category of documents is also reasonably consistent in its focus. While there are no stated values inherent in these documents, they do reflect a fairly traditional, biomedical focus, with an emphasis on physical care and identifying client deficits and limitations, with relatively less emphasis on psychosocial care and capacity.</p>
<p>Documents within this category frequently paid homage to category 1 documents (particularly in their title), without necessarily embracing the values and concepts espoused in category 1 documents. For example, the ‘Lifestyle support needs’ document includes medication and pain management without mentioning client choice or holistic care, while the ‘Lifestyle issues' document covers skin integrity, eating and drinking, toileting, mobility and safety management.</p>
<p>While there were some exceptions, these documents largely reflected a biomedical approach to assessment and care planning, although there was some limited evidence of psychosocial data capture (primarily around terminal care beliefs, funeral arrangements, alcohol and smoking preferences, and aspects of life which are important to the individual). While well-being and communication needs were identified within the documents, they were again largely conceptualized from a biomedical perspective. For example, well-being for the person with dementia was measured using a combination of the Psychogeriatric Assessment Scale (PAS) and Cognitive Impairment Scale (CIS), as well as various behaviour and depression scales. While the organizational documentation includes a form titled ‘My profile’, which aimsto assist staff in ‘identifying and rekindling past pleasurable activities that might be still within the resident’s capabilities’ and ‘to get to know the residents better’, there is little evidence thatthis form, which is used by the diversional therapists in planning activities, is actually linked to individual activity plans. Thus, even where assessment documents do offer some support for individualized care, this is rarely carried through in action-oriented (planning) documentation.</p>

<sec id="sec14-1471301211421837"><title>The great divide</title>
<p>Not surprisingly, given the above results, the drill-down analysis of the document system as a whole highlighted a significant tension. This tension occurred between category 1 and 2 documents, which were reasonably compatible, and those in category 3. In many ways, this is areflection of the broader tension between rhetoric and reality discussed earlier in this paper.</p>
<p>This tension sees a marked shift in purpose, function and focus of documents within category 3 and breaks the focus on the individual. This shift to a biomedical structure and focus is evident in the assessment documents in particular, and includes a shift to measurement and losses/limitations, as opposed to capacity and holistic considerations. By applying a biomedical view, category 3 documents promote a standardized view of people with dementia, and residents in general, with little capacity for individualization. Category 3 documents are found at the interface between clients and staff and are essentially action-oriented documents, that is, they have effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1471301211421837">Prior, 2003</xref>), and this change in focus serves to redirect practice and action away from the individual needs. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1471301211421837">Smith (1988)</xref> suggests, everyday experience is regulated by organizational practices and policies (through documented systems), and these shape both the experience of care (for clients) and the practice of care (for staff).</p>
<p>One possible explanation for this disconnection between category 1/2 and category 3 documents is the document drivers. In this study, two principal sources or drivers are identified:

<fn>
<p>Drivers for Levels 1 and 2 documents: Evidence-based literature Drivers for Level 3 documents: Legislation and funding.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap></p>
<p>Professional and research-based literature reflects the professional knowledge base and professional standards for practice. These are reflected in professional guidelines, research, evidence-based practice information and professional discussions. The key concepts embedded in contemporary, professional literature related to dementia care include notions of personhood, person and relationship-centred care, and quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1471301211421837">Venturato, 2010</xref>). These are evident in, and consistent with, the key themes identified in category 1 and 2 documents.</p>
<p>The second source or drivers identified in this study are legislative and regulatory in nature. In Australia, these include the Aged Care Act 1997 and documents related to accreditation and regulation of the long-term care industry. These documents are developed by government in order to establish standards for aged care regulation. Key concepts within these documents include the identification of indicators of quality of care and its link to accreditation and funding. In particular, the Aged Care Funding Instrument (ACFI) serves to classify resident need according to diagnostic information and the level of care required across 12 care needs. While not designed to guide assessment and care planning, its interpretation, or misinterpretation, drives assessment documents and processes within the industry as organizations seek to maximize their funding and revenue through assessment, care planning and associated documentation.</p>
<p>Thus, an explanation for the tension point and break in conceptual congruency, i.e. a focus on individual care versus a biomedical focus, might be that category 1 and 2 documents tend toreflect research and professional narratives associated with best practice in dementia care. However, analysis of category 3 documents suggests that the practice focus is driven by government standards and regulation requirements. This, together with nursing's traditional, biomedical focus, may afford an explanation for the disconnection and tensions identified between categories.</p>

<sec id="sec15-1471301211421837"><title>Implications and discussion</title>
<p>Two issues associated with the delivery of quality care for people with dementia have become apparent in recent times. The first of these is the challenge of operationalizing person-centred care and relationship-centred care concepts in everyday practice. This challenge is evident in the recognition of a gap between practice and theory commonly being referred to as the gapbetween rhetoric and reality in dementia care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1471301211421837">Moyle, 2010</xref>). This gap is generally considered in one of two ways: as an individual practitioner issue, usually related to knowledge or attitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1471301211421837">Moyle et al., 2010</xref>); or as a function of the work environment, associated with workload and time constraints, which are seen to limit opportunities for individualized care and interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1471301211421837">Edvardsson, Sandman, Nay, &amp; Karlsson, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>This study suggests a third possibility: that documented systems of care within organizations serve to maintain this gap through directing action (and interaction) towards standardized, biomedical and task-focused practices. This may be because ‘people routinely conduct their work through texts, forms and reports’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1471301211421837">Campbell &amp; Gregor, 2004</xref>, p. 33). Indeed, it is recognized that organizational culture (including values and beliefs, resource allocation, textual systems and even architecture) contributes to ‘shaping the nature of services and the manner in which they are delivered’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1471301211421837">O'Connor et al., 2007</xref>, p. 132).</p>
<p>This has a number of implications for people with dementia, the staff caring for them andthe organizations providing care services. For people with dementia, the implications include a sense of being devalued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1471301211421837">Moyle et al., 2010</xref>), limitations to the quality of individualized care, and ultimately, limitations to their quality of life. For staff, the tension between aspiring/delivering (what they should do) and doing (what they actually do) can lead to role strain and burnout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1471301211421837">Edvardsson et al., 2009</xref>). For organizations, the development ofeffective systems and efficient processes is essential to the delivery of quality care, as well astheir sustainability in the marketplace. Tensions within documented systems may impact on staff engagement and retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1471301211421837">Venturato, Kellett, &amp; Windsor, 2007</xref>), as well as their abilityto deliver quality care. It also limits the efficiency and effectiveness of organizational processes.</p>
<p>This study suggests that organizations, and in particular those within organizations whowrite policy, procedure and practice documents should consider their documented systems as a whole, rather than focusing on individual documents as single entities. Such consideration would seek to align practice documents with aspirational documents in order to minimize tensions within the system. Furthermore, a congruent documented dementia caresystem may help bridge the gap between espoused philosophies of care and everyday care practices.</p>
<p>The second issue associated with the delivery of quality care for people with dementia centres on processes for changing practice. This has become particularly evident in consideration of knowledge transfer and utilization and the evidence-based practice (EBP) movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1471301211421837">Moyle, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1471301211421837">Masso &amp; McCarthy, 2009</xref>). While EBP has largely focused on change at the individual level, quality improvement processes have often focused on systems and processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1471301211421837">Masso &amp; McCarthy, 2009</xref>). While it is not the intent of this paper to engage in a lengthy discussion relating to developing EBP processes, this study does suggests that consideration of documented systems of care may offer an approach to bridge this gap between EBP and quality improvement processes and link individual action and practice with system and process issues.</p>
<p>For example, current literature suggests that care planning in long-term care should incorporate resident involvement and procedures for ongoing consent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1471301211421837">Butterworth, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1471301211421837">Worden &amp; Challis, 2008</xref>), as well as narrative approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1471301211421837">Heliker, 1999</xref>). It is also recognized that biographical, as well as biological data needs to be captured, particularly in care planning in chronic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1471301211421837">Kellett et al., 2010</xref>). Traditional EBP approaches focused on the individual practitioner would support education and skill development to reframe care planning processes. However, findings from this study suggests that changing care planning practices within the organization also requires changes to the documented system – in both clinical documents (assessments and care plans) and policy and process documents. Given that texts shape actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1471301211421837">Prior, 2003</xref>), changing practice needs to consider both the individual practitioner and the systemic issues that shape their practice.</p>
<p>A third issue associated with the delivery of quality care for people with dementia has become apparent in this study: the issue of different drivers that shape organizational systems. Within aged care in Australia, organizational systems are shaped by research andprofession discourses, as well as by legislative and regulatory structures. While research and professional discourse focus on best practice and quality of care issues, in general, regulatory and legislative structures focus on industry control and the policing of minimum standards, and quality is conceptualized as a measure of economic efficiency. Thus, these drivers serve very different purposes.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1471301211421837">O'Connor et al. (2007</xref>, p. 132) suggest that:<disp-quote>
<p>‘… at any given time, there are multiple and competing discourses, or storylines, available through which one can make sense of the world … [and] to develop a contextualized account of personhood in dementia, it is necessary to identify and interrogate the different storylines that are being used to construct the dementia experience in relation to their social, historical and political contexts’.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>They also note that research that considers these varied contexts is only just beginning toemerge.</p>
<p>This study supports the need for further research and ‘interrogation’ of the political contextas a contributor to the broader social discourse and as a shaper of organizational structures and systems. In this respect, this study supports that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1471301211421837">Downs (2000)</xref> who called for a comprehensive and multidimensional vision of care for people with dementia that includes the personal (subjective), the organizational and the broader social and political storylines.</p>
<sec id="sec16-1471301211421837"><title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>It should be noted that the findings are drawn from one research study and one long-term careorganization. Other organizations may have a different structure in their document systems, for example, a three-level document system. There may also be a place within this approach for broader policy and external document review as drivers and as a source of analysis. A comprehensive system analysis, incorporating category 4 documents (outcomes of care) may also be useful, particularly if considering broader documented systems of care (e.g. beyond one organization). It is also outside the scope of this study to establish how practice (category 3) documents may be modified to incorporate philosophical concepts of care and whether this would indeed enhance quality of care and quality of life for people living with dementia in long-term care.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-1471301211421837" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study of a documented system of dementia care offers further insights into both the context of care for people with dementia living in long-term care and the tensions inherent within such systems. These tensions within the system go some way towards explaining thecomplex web of issues associated with grounding philosophical notions of best practice, such as person-centred care, in everyday practice. In this way, this study adds a further dimension to understanding the gap between rhetoric and reality in dementia care and moves such understanding beyond the individual practitioner to include broader system and contextual challenges. Furthermore, the findings from this study suggest that documented system analysis is a useful methodological approach to understanding organizational and contextual issues associated with quality of care within long-term care organizations.</p>
