<abstract>
<p>This study assessed the reliability of the self-perceived lower-body size and shape using 3D body-scanning technology. Comparison of each participant's measurements on the relevant variables to categorized Size USA data provided a method of identifying where an individual is placed in relation to the population. Comparing perceptions (survey results) to actual placement in the population (derived from a participant's 3D body measurements) gave insight into how different categories of participants viewed themselves and how valid their self-assessments were at various locations on the body. This study also analyzed the relationship between garment fit satisfaction, body cathexis, and self-perception of lower-body size and shape for each body location because apparel companies have had difficulty in understanding fit from a consumer's perspective. The researchers expect that the analyses of the influences of body cathexis and body perceptions on fit satisfaction can help apparel companies further understand their customers' fit satisfaction goals.</p>

<p>Online sales in clothing and clothing accessories are growing at a dramatic pace, and online sales accounted for US$ 23.2 billion in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0887302X13493127">U.S. Census Bureau, 2012</xref>). However, according to a study by Mintel Group Ltd., 6 in 10 shoppers hesitated to buy clothes from online retailers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0887302X13493127">Fits.me, 2012</xref>). Americans made only 8% of all clothing purchases online, compared with 41% of computers and 21% of books, and return rates for clothing bought online, at 14%, were twice as high as those for other products bought on the web (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0887302X13493127">Barbora, 2007</xref>). A study of online shoppers conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0887302X13493127">Fits.me (2012</xref>) found that one of the biggest obstacles to increasing online apparel sales is the difficulty for shoppers to find the right size.</p>
<p>The survey results indicated that pants are the most challenging clothing item for shoppers to find an appropriate size, and fit remains the primary concern for pant buyers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0887302X13493127">Eccles, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0887302X13493127">Piller, 2008</xref>). To help customers find pants or jeans that fit them better, certain companies, such as Zafu.com or Levi Strauss’ Curve ID, offer online shoppers online-based programs for automated Ready-to-Wear (RTW) pants size selection on the basis of answers to questions about lower body size, shape, and fit problems that the consumer has encountered previously in their pants sizing (e.g., gap at waist; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0887302X13493127">Benander, 2010</xref>). The body size and shape information that customers provide for themselves is critical to ensure correct size selection and purchase well-fitted clothing on the web. Apparel companies might believe that customers can provide their body size and shape information reliably. However, self-reported body size and shape may not be reliable because customers lack know-how or accuracy in taking measurements, and response to their body shape is based on personal perceptions and subjective judgments of their own body. Several different studies have been undertaken regarding the reliability of self-perceived body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0887302X13493127">Marangoni, da Costa Machado, Passos, Fisberg, &amp; de Pádua Cintra, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0887302X13493127">Stommel &amp; Schoenborn, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0887302X13493127">Stunkard, Sørensen, &amp; Schulsinger, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0887302X13493127">Thoma et al., 2012</xref>). However, the previous studies were mainly about height, weight, body mass index (BMI), simple girths, or whole-body shape; there are few studies specifically for lower body areas.</p>
<p>In this study, the researchers assessed the reliability of the self-perceived lower body using 3D body scanning technology to capture actual body measurements and compare to women’s self-reported information. The researchers developed a method for categorizing each participant by size and shape, using 3D body scan measurements of SizeUSA data (a U.S. national anthropometric survey data). Comparison of each study participant on the relevant variables to categorized SizeUSA data provided a method of identifying where an individual is placed in relation to the population as a whole. Comparing perceptions (survey results) to actual placement in the population (derived from a participant’s 3D body measurements) gave insight into how different categories of participants in the study viewed themselves and how valid their self-assessments were at various locations on the body. The researchers believe that the findings will help apparel companies determine how customers generally judge their body sizes and shapes. In addition, apparel companies can see that they need to consider ways to improve the reliability of this information so as to provide the best fit for their clothing.</p>
<p>The researchers in the current study also analyzed relationships between the perception of body, body cathexis, and fit satisfaction for specific areas of the lower body in relation to pant fit. Previous studies mainly addressed the relationships between them for whole-body shape or weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0887302X13493127">Alexander, Connell, &amp; Presley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0887302X13493127">Chattaraman &amp; Rudd, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0887302X13493127">Feather, Ford, &amp; Herr, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0887302X13493127">Gross, Scott-Johnson, &amp; Browne, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0887302X13493127">Manuel, Connell, &amp; Presley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0887302X13493127">Thompson, 1986</xref>). Apparel companies have had difficulty in understanding fit from a consumer’s perspective because each individual has her own standard for judging fit satisfaction. The researchers expect that the analyses of the influences of body cathexis and body perceptions on fit satisfaction will help apparel companies further understand their customers’ fit satisfaction goals.</p>

<title>Reliability of Self-Perceived Body Size and Shape</title>
<p>Several different studies have been undertaken regarding the reliability of self-perceived whole-body size. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0887302X13493127">Stunkard, Sørensen, and Schulsinger (1983</xref>) developed a nine-level figure rating scale, which displays <italic>slim</italic> (1) to <italic>large</italic> (9) female body size, and researchers have used or adapted this method for their study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0887302X13493127">Keshtkar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0887302X13493127">Koprowski, Coates, &amp; Bernstein, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0887302X13493127">Must, Willett, &amp; Dietz, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0887302X13493127">Tehard, van Liere, Com Nougué, &amp; Clavel-Chapelon, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0887302X13493127">Marangoni, da Costa Machado, Passos, Fisberg, and de Pádua Cintra (2011</xref>) found that adolescents who selected “skinny silhouette” from the body silhouette scale underestimated their self-reported BMI, whereas those who perceived themselves as “fat” overestimated it. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0887302X13493127">Stommel and Schoenborn (2009</xref>) noted that self-reported BMI values tended to overestimate measured BMI values at the low end of the BMI scale (&lt;22) and underestimate BMI values at the high end, particularly at values &gt;28. These discrepancies also varied systematically with age. Younger and older respondents underestimated their BMI more than respondents aged 42–55. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0887302X13493127">van Vliet, Kjölhede, Duchén, Räsänen, and Nelson (2009</xref>) found that adolescent girls’ self-reported weight indicated their awareness of actual body size. However, these girls’ body perceptions showed an overestimation of body size relative to international reference values for BMI but not for waist girth.</p>
<p>As shown earlier, there are several studies regarding discrepancy of perceived and actual body size, but studies regarding body shape are limited. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0887302X13493127">Thoma et al. (2012</xref>) assessed the validity of self-reported whole-body shape, especially apple and pear shape. They adapted figure drawings from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0887302X13493127">Connell, Ulrich, Brannon, Alexander, and Presley (2006</xref>) and compared them with BMI and waist-to-hip ratios, which are anthropometric measures commonly used to assess obesity. The results showed that self-reported whole-body shape was consistent with the two anthropometric measures.</p>
<p>As shown already, the previous studies were mainly about details of body size such as height, weight, BMI, simple girths, or whole-body shape. There are few studies particularly for specific lower body areas based on various anthropometric measures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0887302X13493127">
<title>3D Body Scanning Technology</title>
<p>3D body scanning technology has mainly two advantages compared to manual measuring. First, 3D body scanners can automatically generate a set of over 100 measurements in a short time (5–15 s for the scan and 1–2 min to generate measurements). Several nations such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, Japan, Korea, and Thailand have been used for conducting several large-scale anthropometric surveys (Charoensiriwath &amp; Spichaikul, 2009). Body scans have eliminated many of the costs of large-scale surveys by significantly reducing the time taken to capture measurement data for each person. Mass customization and automated custom clothing companies have recently used 3D body scanners when implementing their processes for custom clothing. Companies such as Brooks Brothers, Lori Coulter, C and A, Aston Blake, Arthur Calliman, and Alton Lane are producing custom-made garments using measurements taken from a 3D body scanner (Textile/Clothing Technology Corporation, 2011).</p>
<p>Another advantage of 3D body scanning technology is that it can capture 3D visual image. 3D body scan data can help RTW companies identify their customers’ body shapes and proportions and improve their sizing systems. Victoria’s Secret partnered with Textile/Clothing Technology Corporation ([TC]<sup>2</sup>), who conducted the SizeUSA project, and used visual data of 3D body scans to categorize different body types and address issues in their sizing system (Textile/Clothing Technology Corporation, 2006). Companies such as Jockey International, JCPenney, and Sears have also worked with data from 3D body scans to update their sizing systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0887302X13493127">Davis &amp; Munro, 2008</xref>). Department stores such as Selfridges and Co. and RTW companies such as Levi Strauss Curve ID individually conducted anthropometric surveys using 3D body scanners to identify the body sizes and shapes of their target market customers to provide the best fit for them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887302X13493127">Levi’s, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0887302X13493127">Manninen, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Another powerful use of 3D data could be for analysis of fit from 3D clothed scans for validation of a sizing system. To produce a garment, apparel companies normally choose a fit model whose body shape and proportions are consistent with their target market, and they then fit prototype garments in a single base size. A set of additional sizes are created using grade rules developed by the firm to create the full range of sizes for their sizing system. However, the full range of sizes in the system is seldom tested, and most companies do not know how their sizing actually fits their target market. In terms of this issue, 3D scans have potential as a tool for fitting garments on target market consumers. The technical design department at Nike collaborated with Cornell University to conduct a research project to analyze fit of their RTW jackets across a full range of sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0887302X13493127">Buckner, Ashdown, &amp; Lyman-Clarke, 2007</xref>). The researchers recruited 73 college women and asked them to wear a jacket in their best-fitting size. They evaluated fit at critical locations for each participant from their clothed scans. These analyses were used to assess the overall effectiveness of the sizing system, allowing Nike to determine what sizes and areas need revision based on the results of fit assessment.</p>

<title>Associations Between Perception of Body, Body Cathexis, and Fit Satisfaction</title>
<p>There have been several studies on the associations between perception of body and body cathexis (the degree of body satisfaction). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0887302X13493127">Thompson, Heinberg, Altabe, and Tantleff-Dunn (1999</xref>) found that as individuals perceived body size to be larger than it actually was, they justified negative feelings about their body size. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0887302X13493127">Feather, Ford, and Herr (1996</xref>) found that the type of body form (ectomorph, ecto-mesomorph, mesomorph, endo-mesomorph, and endomorph) had a significant effect on body cathexis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0887302X13493127">Gross, Scott-Johnson, and Browne (2005</xref>) examined actual and perceived weight status and the body cathexis of college-age African American males. They found that overweight and inaccurately perceiving males were dissatisfied with their upper torsos and body parts (arms, legs, and chest area) because they perceived them to be smaller than their preferred size. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0887302X13493127">Alexander, Connell, and Presley (2005</xref>) found that significant associations between perceived whole-body shape (hourglass, rectangle, pear, and inverted triangle) and body cathexis occurred. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0887302X13493127">Manuel, Connell, and Presley (2010</xref>) studied whether self-reported whole-body shape (hourglass, rectangle, pear, and inverted triangle) impacted body cathexis for African American women.</p>
<p>Regarding the associations between body cathexis and fit satisfaction, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0887302X13493127">Feather et al. (1996</xref>) found that satisfaction with uniform fit paralleled satisfaction with the body among female collegiate basketball players. This study examined the relationships for the upper, lower, and total body. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0887302X13493127">LaBat and Delong (1990</xref>) found relationships on these variables at bust, arm, back, neck, shoulder, waist, hip, thigh, buttocks, and abdomen, citing weak but positive correlations. They only considered the significance of the correlation and did not identify the magnitude of the correlation in this study.</p>
<p>About relationships between perception of the body and fit satisfaction, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0887302X13493127">Feather et al. (1996</xref>) found that the perceived type of body form (ectomorph, ecto-mesomorph, mesomorph, endo-mesomorph, and endomorph) had a significant effect on uniform fit satisfaction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887302X13493127">Feather, Herr, and Ford (1997</xref>) noted that correlations for the perceptions of body (upper, lower, and total body) and garment fit were positive and significant. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0887302X13493127">Chattaraman and Rudd (2006</xref>) noted that increase in body size correlated with preference for a loose fit.</p>
<p>Previous studies mainly addressed the relationships between these variables for whole-body shape or weight. However, the researchers in the current study analyzed relationships between the perception of body, body cathexis, and fit satisfaction for specific areas of the lower body in relation to pant fit, because it was found that pants are the most challenging clothing item for customers to find in an appropriate size, and fit is the primary concern for pant shoppers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0887302X13493127">Piller, 2008</xref>). There is a study on the lower body (LaBat &amp; DeLong, 1990), but it was conducted about 20 years ago to assess only the relationship between body cathexis and fit satisfaction.</p>

<sec id="section7-0887302X13493127">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>The researchers recruited 83 female participants aged 18–35 for the study by distributing fliers and placing advertisements in Ithaca, New York, in the United States in January 2010. Participants were required to have a hip girth between 86.4 cm (34 in) and 121.9 cm (48 in), thus corresponding to standard sizes 2–20 of <italic>ASTM D5585-95</italic> (U.S. standard for adult female Misses figure type sizes). The reason that the researchers selected the hip girth as a key measurement for size selection was that online fit guides developed by apparel companies such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887302X13493127">Levi’s (2009</xref>) Curve ID direct customers to select their pants fit based on their hip size. The researchers recruited 83 women from sizes 2 to 20 somewhat evenly, although size 12 (22.9%) was overrepresented, and size 2 (1.2%) was underrepresented compared to the other recruited sizes: Sizes 4 (6.0%), 6 (6.0%), 8 (7.2%), 10 (14.5%), 14 (9.6%), 16 (16.9%), 18 (8.4%), and 20 (7.2%).</p>
<p>Participants read and signed a consent form and filled out a questionnaire. The questionnaire had two sections: (I) Fit satisfaction and (II) self-perceived body size/shape and body cathexis. Section I consisted of questions investigating their general satisfaction with fit of RTW woven pants at 10 locations (waist, abdomen, hip, thigh, calf, crotch length, inseam length, crotch length, waist placement, and side seam placement), which are included in a standard list of fit parameters described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0887302X13493127">Rasband and Liechty (2006</xref>). Respondents rated their satisfaction levels on a 5-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 (<italic>very dissatisfied</italic>) to 5 (<italic>very satisfied</italic>). If dissatisfied, they indicated their reasons for dissatisfaction as follows:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>For circumference-related locations, such as waist and hip: tight or loose.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>For length-related locations, such as inseam length: short or long.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>For waist placement: low or high.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>After judging all the areas, respondents rated their overall satisfaction with fit.</p>
<p>Section II was designed to explore self-perceived body size/shape and body cathexis at 11 locations (height, weight, waist size, abdomen shape, hip size, buttocks’ shape, waist-to-hip shape, thigh size, calf size, waist height, and leg length), which online companies such as Zafu.com and Levi Strauss generally ask their customers to recommend their pants size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0887302X13493127">Benander, 2010</xref>). The participants had three options to rate self-perceived body size and shape as follows:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>For waist size and hip size: <italic>small</italic> (1), <italic>average</italic> (2), and <italic>large</italic> (3).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>For thigh size and calf size: <italic>slim</italic> (1), <italic>average</italic> (2), and <italic>full</italic> (3).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>For length-related areas: <italic>short</italic> (1), <italic>average</italic> (2), and <italic>long</italic> (3).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>For abdomen shape and buttocks’ shape: <italic>flat</italic> (1), <italic>average</italic> (2), and <italic>full</italic> (3).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>For waist to hip: <italic>straight</italic> (1), <italic>average</italic> (2), and <italic>curvy</italic> (3).</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The researchers investigated body cathexis using a modified version of the original Body Cathexis scale developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0887302X13493127">Mahoney and Finch (1976</xref>). The researchers measured a total of 11 body parts on a 5-point Likert-type scale from 1 = <italic>very dissatisfied</italic> to 5 = <italic>very satisfied</italic>. At each location, respondents chose their body sizes or shapes first, and then rated their feelings of satisfaction/dissatisfaction with that location. After rating all the areas, respondents assessed their overall satisfaction with their body.</p>
<p>After the participants filled out questionnaires, the researchers scanned them twice in underwear and close-fitting tank tops/leggings. The researchers measured height, crotch height, and weight manually. The researchers converted the 3D scan files to rbd format using <italic>NX16 Software version 6</italic> from [TC]<sup>2</sup>, and a set of body measurements for each scanned participant was automatically acquired. By using the same measuring software as used for collection of the SizeUSA data, landmarks were automatically detected and measurements generated in the same manner. Thus, the study data were comparable to SizeUSA data.</p>

<title>Determining a Standard to Rate Actual Body Size and Shape From SizeUSA Data</title>
<p>To investigate how a self-perceived body differed from the actual body (Objective 1), the researchers needed a standard to rate actual body size and shapes. Textile/Clothing Technology Corporation (2006) categorized age groups into five categories (18–25, 26–35, 36–45, 46–55, and over 56) for SizeUSA data. To match the subject population, the researchers selected 2,981 women aged 18–35 from SizeUSA data as a data set to calculate overall missy size population sizes and shapes. To eliminate obese women outside the size range of our study, the researchers first calculated the percentiles of BMI, waist girth, and hip girth measurements. A BMI value of 30 (classified as the “obese” category provided by National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0887302X13493127">1</xref>
</sup>) was positioned between the 75th and the 90th percentile for the SizeUSA data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0887302X13493127">Table 1</xref>). The researchers compared waist girth and hip girth measurements for size 20 (the maximum size) of the sizing standard <italic>ASTM 5585-95</italic> with the girth measurements for the SizeUSA data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0887302X13493127">Table 1</xref>). Both waist girth and hip girth measurements for Size 20 were positioned between the 75th and the 90th percentile for SizeUSA data. In consideration of the distribution of all three of the values, the researchers selected only women (<italic>n</italic> = 2,682) within the 90th percentile of BMI (34.1) for this study to eliminate obese women. Next, the researchers removed outliers (defined as any subject with body measurements that exceeded 3 times the standard deviation from the mean for measurements used in the study). As the number (<italic>n</italic> = 194) of outliers was less than 10% of the total, the researchers considered that the final data set (<italic>n</italic> = 2,488) was appropriate for analysis.</p>

<p>At each body measurement location used to determine actual body size and shape, the researchers divided the SizeUSA data into three groups by dividing them at the 33.3rd percentile and the 66.9th percentile. The researchers labeled individuals ranging from the minimum size to the 33.3rd percentile as the “short/small/flat/straight” group, those from the 33.3rd percentile to the 66.9th percentile as the “average” group, and those from the 66.9th percentile to the maximum as “tall/large/prominent/curvy” group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0887302X13493127">Table 2</xref>). The original SizeUSA data set included most of the measurements needed for a comparison to other variables in the study; however, the researchers should calculate front abdomen depth minus front waist depth as a measurement for comparison to perceived abdomen shape, and they calculated the drop value of hip girth to waist girth for waist-to-hip shape.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The researchers analyzed the data using the statistical package SPSS 17.0. To analyze Objective 1, the researchers determined the actual body group of each participant by comparing their measurements with the standards (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0887302X13493127">Table 2</xref>) derived from the SizeUSA data at each location. Then the researchers compared each participant’s actual group to the perceived group she indicated in the questionnaire for each body location and categorized participants into three categories: (1) <italic>perceived group</italic> &lt; <italic>SizeUSA group</italic> (category where the respondents perceived their body or shape as smaller/shorter/straighter than their actual body or shape); (2) <italic>perceived group</italic> = <italic>SizeUSA group</italic> (category where the respondents defined their body or shape according to the group identified from the SizeUSA data); and (3) <italic>perceived group</italic> &gt; <italic>SizeUSA group</italic> (category where the respondents perceived their body or shape as larger/taller/curvier than their actual body/shape) at each location. Then the researchers conducted cross-tabulation of frequencies and χ<sup>2</sup> test.</p>
<p>To test Objective 2, the researchers performed Duncan’s multiple range test of analysis of variance (ANOVA) post hoc analysis to analyze relationships (1) between body satisfaction and perceptions of body size and shape and (2) between fit satisfaction and perceptions of body size and shape. The researchers considered a 3-point scale for selecting perceived body size and shape as a categorical variable, while the researchers considered a 5-point scale for rating fit and body satisfaction to be a continuous variable. To identify the relationship (3) between body satisfaction and fit satisfaction, the researchers performed a regression analysis to compare the magnitude of correlations.</p>

<p>Regarding locations related to height (height and crotch height), almost 50% of the respondents defined their body according to the SizeUSA groupings. Most others tended to consider their height shorter than their height group as identified by the SizeUSA data (height: 48%, waist height: 36.3%, and crotch height: 47.6%).</p>
<p>Regarding weight, 61.4% of the respondents defined their weight according to the SizeUSA data. The “perceived group &lt; SizeUSA group” category (22.9%) had slightly more respondents than did the “perceived group &gt; SizeUSA group” category (15.7%).</p>
<p>Regarding locations related to size at waist, hip, thigh, and calf, approximately 50% of the respondents defined their body according to the SizeUSA groupings. The rest of the respondents tended to consider their body size larger than their actual size, especially at thigh (perceived group &lt; SizeUSA group: 34.9%, perceived group &gt; SizeUSA group: 8.4%) and hip (28.9% compared to 4.8%).</p>
<p>Regarding buttocks’ shape, none of the respondents perceived their buttocks as being flatter than their SizeUSA category. However, 66.3% of the respondents perceived their buttocks as curvier than their SizeUSA category. Also, for the waist-to-hip shape, 51.8% of the respondents perceived their waist-to-hip shape as curvier than their SizeUSA category, while fewer respondents (26.5%) perceived their waist-to-hip shape straighter than their SizeUSA category. It was found that 45.1% defined their shape consistent with the SizeUSA category to which they belonged.</p>

<p>When self-perception of height was taller, height satisfaction increased. On the other hand, when the self-perception of weight was heavier, weight satisfaction decreased. As waist, thigh, and calf size were perceived to be smaller, satisfaction increased. As abdomen was perceived to be flatter, abdomen satisfaction increased. Regarding hip size, respondents who perceived their hip size as average had a higher hip satisfaction than those who perceived their hip size as small or large. While the respondents had relatively low hip satisfaction when they perceived their hip as large, their buttocks’ satisfaction increased as their buttocks were perceived as prominent. As leg length was perceived to be shorter, satisfaction decreased.</p>

<title>Conclusion, Discussion, and Further Study</title>
<p>The researchers assessed the reliability of the self-perceived lower body using 3D body scanning technology to capture actual body measurements and compare them to women’s self-reported information. The researchers developed a method for categorizing each participant by size and shape, using 3D body scan measurements of SizeUSA data (a U.S. national anthropometric survey data set). Comparison of each study participant on the relevant variables to categorized SizeUSA data provided a method of identifying where an individual is placed in relation to the population as a whole. Comparing perceptions (survey results) to actual placement in the population (derived from a participant’s 3D body measurements) gave insight into how different categories of participants in the study viewed themselves and how valid their self-assessments were at various locations on the body. The researchers believe that the findings will help apparel companies determine how customers judge their lower body sizes and shapes and assist them in considering ways to improve the reliability of this information, so as to provide the best fit for their clothing. The findings also help consumers to identify fit of lower body garments, especially pants, because pants that fit comfortably are the most difficult item of clothing for customers to find; fit is the primary concern for pants shoppers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0887302X13493127">Piller, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>To define actual body size in this study, the researchers divided each population variable into three categories based on percentile data. This choice could be seen as an arbitrary division that might not correspond in practice to general perceptions of these categories. For example, are women between the heights of 5′3″ and 5′5″ generally considered average height, as defined by this method? There is also the common problem that is encountered in any process that attempts to categorize people into discrete size categories when data are continuous: The researchers designated a boundary that divides people of almost identical measurements into two different categories. However, this method has the advantage of being population based and dependent entirely on the data, and as such, it can form a basis for reliable comparative studies.</p>
<p>The researchers also analyzed the relationships among fit satisfaction, body cathexis, and body shape and size perceptions, while previous researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0887302X13493127">Alexander et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0887302X13493127">LaBat &amp; Delong, 1990</xref>) found relationships between only two of the three factors. The uniqueness of this study is that we can integrate these findings into the results of comparisons between the perceived and the actual body. From the integration of all these results, the researchers can determine the consumer-preferred body size and shape for each location as follows: At the waist, overall more respondents perceived their waist to be larger and preferred to have a smaller waist. At the abdomen, respondents perceived their abdomen to be more prominent than it was and preferred to have a flatter abdomen. However, there was no relationship between perception of abdomen size and fit satisfaction or between body satisfaction and fit satisfaction. Regarding hip size, while participants generally perceived their hips to be larger than they were, they preferred to have a medium-sized hip. There was no relationship between perception of hip size and fit satisfaction at this body location, but there was a weak association between body satisfaction and fit satisfaction.</p>
<p>At the thigh, while women perceived their thighs to be thicker, they preferred to have thinner thighs. The thigh showed the second highest relationship between body satisfaction and fit satisfaction for all the body locations. Regarding leg length, while women perceived their leg length to be shorter than it was, they preferred to have a longer leg length. When women perceived their leg length to be short, they showed lower satisfaction than did those who perceived their leg length to be long.</p>
<p>As shown earlier, the perceived body and the preferred body were opposite at the waist size, abdomen size, hip size, thigh size, and leg length, resulting in body dissatisfaction. On the other hand, the participants preferred to have prominent buttocks and they also felt they had them. Regarding the waist-to-hip shape, like the buttocks’ shape, this location showed agreement between the perceived body and the actual body; respondents preferred to have a curvier waist-to-hip shape and they also felt they had this shape. There was no relationship between perception and fit satisfaction, but there was a weak association between body satisfaction and fit satisfaction at these two locations.</p>
<p>From the comparison between actual body and perceived body, and between perception of the body and body satisfaction, the researchers could identify which body sizes and shapes customers considered as ideal, namely small waist, flat abdomen, full buttocks, curvy waist-to-hip shape, thin thighs, and long leg length. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0887302X13493127">Martin (2010</xref>) noted that the strongest influence on the discrepancy between actual body and perceived body comes from the media. In terms of the apparel industry, fit that apparel companies have produced for customers would cause women to have discrepancy between actual body and perceived body. The companies have produced fit that can validate only certain shapes, so women with different body shapes cannot find good fit and thus feel that there is something wrong with their body. Manufacturers need to develop sizing systems for the population that include more diverse shapes.</p>
<p>When customers correctly know their body size and shape, they can order their appropriate clothing sizes and be more satisfied with the clothing fit. However, customers do not have many actual chances to measure their body or judge their own body shape. Because there is a low possibility for customers to change their wrong perception of their body, apparel companies need to understand their customers’ tendency regarding the perception of their bodies. The researchers believe that the findings in this study will help apparel companies determine how customers generally judge their body sizes and shapes. In addition, apparel companies can see that they need to consider ways to improve the reliability of this information, so as to provide the best fit for their clothing.</p>
<p>The limitation of this study was that the sample consisted of college female students from a university in the Northeast region of the United States. Nevertheless, the strength of this study is that the researchers used measurement data taken by a 3D body scanner to identify a person’s actual body size and shape in comparison to population data. We expect that our study can be a positive basis for reliable comparative studies. For further studies, if the researchers recruited a random sample in different areas proportionally, the researchers could better generalize the results. Further studies of upper-body measurements, whole-body measurements, and product categories other than pants could also be conducted. Studies of larger women, younger and older women, and men in all of these categories could also be conducted for useful comparative data and further valuable findings.</p>
