<abstract>
<p>This study provides a novel observational method to observe repetitive seating patterns chosen by students in a classroom. Although prior work that relied on self-reports suggests that students claim the same seats repeatedly, the main hypothesis of the study was that in a repeated use of a public space, people tend to occupy the same position, thus establishing a form of territoriality. Student seating locations were observed in two university lecture halls, 6 times during a span of 4 weeks. Observations were carried out on a sample of 47 and 31 students for Lecture Halls A and B, respectively. Two parameters were computed: mean displacement and mean territory dimension. The results showed very low mean displacements in both halls and the establishment of very small territories inside the halls. The results are explained in terms of conflict and anxiety avoidance, and the interaction between spatial preference and goal fulfillment driven by motivational and personality factors.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Past research on territorial claims in public spaces includes observational studies of territorial markers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013916511403803">Brown, 1987</xref>, for a review) or survey studies of territorial preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013916511403803">Guyot, Byrd, &amp; Caudle, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013916511403803">Kaya &amp; Burgess, 2007</xref>). Surprisingly, few studies of stated territorial preferences have been confirmed through observational data. Residents of retirement homes have been found to claim the same spaces over time, but these results may be due to the home-like nature of the setting studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013916511403803">Lipman, 1967</xref>). Less is known about how individuals use more public settings over time and whether design contributes to their pattern of use over time.</p>
<p>According to Altman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013916511403803">Altman, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013916511403803">Altman &amp; Chemers, 1980</xref>), primary, secondary, and public territories exist. They differ in their importance to the individual’s or group’s life, to the extent of perceived ownership, the amount of personalization, and the likelihood of defense if violated. Primary territories (e.g., a home or perhaps a retirement home) are most important, followed by secondary and public territories. Public territories (e.g., public park, lecture hall at the university, trains, and buses) are not owned, and therefore, it is very difficult to assert control. Occupancy is usually very short, control is very difficult to assert, and personalizations or markings and defense are limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013916511403803">Taylor &amp; Stough, 1978</xref>).</p>
<p>Past research on classrooms that provide the opportunity to create public territories has shown that students report sitting in the same seat between 78% and 86% of the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013916511403803">Guyot et al., 1980</xref>). Even when seating arrangements varied considerably, such as U-shaped arrangements versus rows and columns, one study showed that college students chose ends seats most often and that females were more likely to prefer having the same seat each time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013916511403803">Kaya &amp; Burgess, 2007</xref>). However, these self-reports were based on choices made for completely vacant classrooms. They were not validated by objective observational data. In daily life, students establish patterns of seating over time and in the presence of others, where it is less likely that seating choices remain exactly the same over time.</p>
<p>When students do choose different seats over time, the design of classroom seating configurations may make a difference. The gestalt perceptual grouping principles of proximity and good continuation may predict how students choose alternative seats. In a lecture hall with long rows where seats are close together, the row may be especially perceptually salient due to proximity and grouping. When students do not choose the same seat, their alternative choice is expected to be in the same row. When rows are not as salient, such as in a smaller classroom with shorter rows, alternative choices may be to move along columns as well.</p>
<p>The present study uses unobtrusive photography to provide objective data on seat choice changes over time. To quantify the degree of variation in seat choice, a displacement score is calculated to represent the spatial variation over time in seating choices away from the original seat. A novel calculation of a control condition, representing random seating choices for a given population size, enables comparisons between observed and random seating arrays. The study tests whether observational data confirmed that the same seat was chosen each time and quantified how much individuals moved or were displaced from their prior seat of choice. In addition, the study examined both directions of displacement (along rows vs. columns) and gender differences.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-0013916511403803">
<title>Lecture Halls, Participants, and Procedure</title>
<p>To guarantee a large number of degrees of freedom, both sampled lecture halls had many more seats available than students enrolled, thus maximizing students’ abilities to choose their seat, independent of any crowding pressures. Furthermore, to minimize the effects of mutual social relationships in the choice of seat, the two courses were chosen from among those of the first university term, and the data were collected on six occasions across the first 4 weeks of the term. In both lecture halls described below, the entrance to the hall was to the rear, opposite the lecturer’s desk, which was slightly elevated, in front of and facing the students, parallel to the first row.</p>
<p>Lecture Hall A had 202 seats distributed in 10 rows of tablet-arm chairs divided by a central passage. The seats in each row were 52 cm apart, whereas the rows were 95 cm apart. The lecture hall was windowless but evenly lighted by artificial lamps. Enrollment included 47 university students with a mean age of 22.4 years for male students (<italic>n</italic> = 14) and 21.3 years for female students (<italic>n</italic> = 33). Eleven (20%) students attended all of the six lessons, 11 (20%) attended five lessons, 8 (14.5%) attended four lessons, 7 (13%) attended three lessons, 10 (18%) attended two lessons, and 8 (14.5%) attended one lesson. These last 8 students were dropped from the study because it was not possible to track their seating preference over time.</p>
<p>Lecture Hall B had 58 seats distributed in 10 rows of tablet-arm chairs. The front two rows had 5 seats, whereas the remaining rows had 6 seats. Seats in a row were 63 cm apart, whereas rows were 102 cm apart. Three large windows illuminated the hall from the left (facing the students). Enrollment included 31 students with a mean age of 23.6 years for male students (<italic>n</italic> = 6) and 24.3 years for female students (<italic>n</italic> = 25). Eight students attended six lessons (22%), 7 (19%) attended five lessons, 11 (31%) attended four lessons, 2 (6%) attended three lessons, 3 (8%) attended two lessons, and 5 (14%) attended one lesson. These last 5 students were discarded from the analysis. In both cases, the students attended psychology-related lessons at the University of Bologna.</p>
<p>Participants were not told the research aims until the study ended. The spatial positioning of each student was obtained by a hidden high-resolution digital camera positioned frontally in the lecture hall and activated by a self-timer. Seat choices were tracked six times over the course of 4 weeks in two public university halls. The students were free to choose where to sit at every lesson.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0013916511403803">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>I created matrices of the rows and columns of seats in the classrooms to facilitate tracking seating choices, which were defined as displacement scores. Displacement scores were quantified as the sum of the displacement in rows and the displacement in columns. For example, a movement of 1 row back or forward, maintaining the same column, would score as 1; a shift of 3 seats left or right along the same row would score 3; a movement of 2 rows forward and 3 columns left would score 5; and no movement scored 0.</p>
<p>In the control condition, hypothetical students were randomly assigned to the different seats and the mean of all possible displacements were computed. Two conservative criteria were applied: (a) It was supposed that the starting seating place of the student that served in the control condition was in the center of the lecture hall, thus diminishing the entity of the mean displacement (starting from a corner, in fact, would have resulted in a greater mean displacement) and (b) the mean displacement was computed taking into account that not all the seats could be available due to the presence of the other students in the lecture hall.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0013916511403803">
<title>Control Conditions</title>
<p>Occupancy rates in the actual classrooms were used to calculate the population size for the control conditions that use random allotment of seats to calculate displacement scores. In Lecture Hall A, occupancy rates were 36 of 202 for Day 1, 36 of 202 for Day 2, 35 of 202 for Day 3, 33 of 202 for Day 4, 31 of 202 for Day 5, and 29 of 202 for Day 6. The mean occupation rate was 33.33 of 202 (16.5%). As the mean occupation rate was 33.3 or about 34, a total of 34 students (including the target student) were placed in random seats in the lecture hall and their places did not enter in the computation of the mean random displacement. According to these criteria, mean random displacement resulted as 7.38.</p>
<p>In Lecture Hall B, occupancy rates were 17 of 58 for Day 1, 27 of 58 for Day 2, 28 of 58 for Day 3, 24 of 58 for Day 4, 21 of 58 for Day 5, and 27 of 58 for Day 6. The mean occupation rate was 24 of 58 (41%). As the mean occupation rate was 24, a total of 24 students (including the occupant that was under analysis) were placed in random positions in the hall and their places were not considered when computing the mean random displacement. According to these criteria, mean random displacement was 3.26.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section7-0013916511403803">
<title>Mean Displacement</title>
<p>In Lecture Hall A, mean displacement for the 47 students resulted as 2.82 (±2.06). This mean displacement was compared with the mean displacement value for the control-random condition using a <italic>t</italic> test. The comparison was significant: <italic>t</italic>(46) = −16.18, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 (effect size, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 4.77). Sex was not significant. Mean displacement, therefore, was significantly lower than that expected in a condition in which the students randomly chose a free seat in the lecture hall.</p>
<p>Displacements (considering all observations along the 6 days) ranged from 0 to a maximum of 6. In about half (47.8%) of the cases, the student chose the same seat. Progressively larger displacements were less frequent: 29.2% for 1, 15.6% for 2, 2.8% for 3, 4.2% for 4, and 0.7% for 6.</p>
<p>In Lecture Hall B, mean displacement for the 31 students was 1.22 (±0.94). A <italic>t</italic> test was used to test whether this meant that displacement was significantly lower than the control-random condition. The comparison was significant: <italic>t</italic>(30) = −12.03, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 (effect size, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 4.39). As in Lecture Hall A, mean displacement was not significantly different for males and females.</p>
<p>No displacements greater than 4 were observed. In 26.8% of cases, the students returned to the same seat. The majority of displacements were for the minimal distance of 1 seat (38.8%), whereas displacements greater than 1 were less frequent: 14.8% for 2, 17.6% for 3, and 1.8% for 3.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0013916511403803">
<title>Row Preference</title>
<p>In Lecture Hall A, seats within a row were 60 cm apart, whereas within a column, the distance was 95 cm. For the perceptual grouping principles of proximity and good continuation, rows were perceptually more pregnant than columns. Therefore, it was hypothesized that displacements were preferred within the same row (left–right direction) than in front–rear direction.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, each single displacement was separated in their two components: Left–right and front–rear movements. The movements were quantified in number of seats.</p>
<p>The results showed a mean left–right movement of 1.88 (±1.73) and a mean front–rear movement of 0.94 (±0.75). The difference was significant: <italic>t</italic>(72) = −3.03, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, thus indicating a preference for the same row in the lecture hall.</p>
<p>Lecture Hall B had much shorter rows than Lecture Hall A, resulting in a less perceptual salience for rows. The statistical analysis showed a mean left–right movement of 0.65 (±0.52) and a mean front–rear movement of 0.57 (±0.5). The difference was not significant. Students did not show any preference for their displacements inside the hall.</p>

<sec id="section9-0013916511403803">
<title>Mean Territorial Area</title>
<p>The territorial area for each student was defined as the area of the polygon whose vertexes were the seats occupied by the student on the different days of observations. The polygons were traced on a digital topographical map of the classroom at a scale of 1:100. The polygon area was determined by the Xfig digital image processing software. For Lecture Hall A, the mean territorial area was 3.62 m<sup>2</sup>, with a standard deviation of 4.17, over a possible seating area of the lecture hall of 150.54 m<sup>2</sup>. Mean displacements, therefore, implied an area of only 2.4% of the whole lecture room space, showing a strong “attachment” of each student to a small area of the classroom. For Lecture Hall B, the mean area was 1.12 m<sup>2</sup>, with a standard deviation of 0.84. Considering that the whole seating area in the classroom was 41.76 m<sup>2</sup>, the mean area covered only 2.7% of the whole area.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study clearly shows that students choose the same seat over time in university classrooms. This territorial behavior emerges also if people do not have the possibility to personalize “their” space and to defend it against the invasion of other users when they are absent. These results offer strong observational data in support of the self-reports of seating preferences measured in past research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013916511403803">Guyot et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013916511403803">Kaya &amp; Burgess, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The territorial behavior observed in public settings may originate from the reducing influence that territoriality exercises on conflict behavior. The ability to link a person or a group with a particular location seems to help in predicting both other people’s behavior in that space and interaction patterns. Territorial functioning in public territories, therefore, helps individuals to control the environment to achieve goals with minimal interference, thereby reducing stress and anxiety. The goals in our specific case could be to facilitate attention and visibility during lectures for those students who preferred to sit in the first few rows or to promote independence, privacy, and freedom of movement for those students who preferred to stay at the back of the hall. The spatial location of the student in the lecture hall, in fact, has direct implications on the way the student “interacts” with the lecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013916511403803">Koneya, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013916511403803">MacPherson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013916511403803">Montello, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013916511403803">Sommer, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013916511403803">Stires, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>Establishing a rather small territory inside the lecture hall avoids the necessity of “renegotiating” the seating arrangement with other occupants each time and makes the accomplishment of behavioral-psychological goals easier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013916511403803">Taylor, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>The design of the public space can influence the shape of the occupant’s territory. For example, in a lecture room in which rows are perceptually salient, due to their length or due to their uniformity, student territories tend to be elliptical and not circular, with the major axis set in the direction of the rows.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the marked territoriality in public settings shown in this study may also be partly due to instances of social bonding between the occupants. To avoid this effect in this study, the observations were run in lecture halls attended by freshmen in the first 4 weeks from the start of term. However, it cannot be excluded that part of the students already knew each other. Given the lower variability of the effect found in this study, it is possible to say that the effect was general and not confined to the limited subset of students who attended in groups, the members of which were bonded by strong social relationships. Further research, however, should better clarify how social bonding affects the strength of territoriality in public settings.</p>
<p>Future investigations should test the generalization of the effect found in this study in other types of spaces that share a more public nature than university halls. For example, it can be suggested that a similar effect could be traced in commuters who use public transportation. In this case, travelers should show a tendency to sit in the same position on the bus or train. Other examples could be the choice of the same seating area in those attending parks, the preference for the same room in those returning to a particular hotel several times, or the preference for a particular place for those attending public libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013916511403803">Costa, 2009</xref>).</p>
