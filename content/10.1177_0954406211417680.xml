<abstract>
<p>In this article, a new two-stage rolling piston CO<sub>2</sub> compressor was developed. A test rig was designed to measure the performance of this compressor. Based on the measured <italic>p–V</italic> indicator diagram, the distributions of indicated power and compressor performance under various operating conditions have been analysed in detail. It is shown that the discharge passage loss of the first stage and the suction passage loss of the second stage are much higher than other losses for the tested compressor. The overall efficiency of the tested compressor decreases by 1.2 per cent with the decrease of the discharge pressure at the same suction conditions. It is also found that the superheating at the compressor inlet has very small (0.3 per cent) effect on the compressor performance.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954406211417680"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), as a natural refrigerant, has attracted many attentions again because of global warming issue around the world. The heat rejection process of gas cooler and heat absorbance of evaporator during the trans-critical compression cycle happen at the supercritical and the subcritical regions, respectively, due to low critical temperature of CO<sub>2</sub> (31°C). Under the normal working conditions, CO<sub>2</sub> refrigeration system is operated at the trans-critical condition. The obvious feature of CO<sub>2</sub> trans-critical cycle is that the pressure ratio is rather low, while the operating pressure and pressure difference between compressor suction and discharge ports are quite high compared with the traditional refrigeration cycles [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406211417680">1</xref></bold>].</p>
<p>In the residential refrigeration and air conditioning systems, the rolling piston compressor has been studied widely. Suzai <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954406211417680">2</xref></bold>] and Tadano <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954406211417680">3</xref></bold>] developed a two-stage hermetic rolling CO<sub>2</sub> compressor in 2000. This compressor featured with intermediate back pressure from the discharge of the first stage. Their experimental data showed that this two-stage design had advantages in efficiency and reliability. In 2004, Tecumeseh Company cooperated with University of Maryland proposed a new two-stage CO<sub>2</sub> compressor [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954406211417680">4</xref></bold>]. The test data indicated that the system cooling capacity and coefficient ofperformance (COP) increased with the increase of suction temperature.</p>
<p>The <italic>p–V</italic> diagram of a rolling piston rotary compressor was measured by Sakurai and Hamilton [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406211417680">5</xref></bold>]. The indicated gas work, frictional loss, and mechanical and indicated efficiencies with high accuracy were obtained based on the measured <italic>p–V</italic> diagram. The results indicated that mechanical and indicated efficiencies at higher compressor speeds were less than at lower speeds. Matsuzaka and Nagatomo [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406211417680">6</xref></bold>] studied the effect of the discharge port shape of the rolling piston compressor on compression loss and re-expansion loss by experimental and numerical methods. The authors also produced and tested a compressor with 94.8 per cent mechanical efficiency based on the highest engineering level at that time. Wakabayashi <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954406211417680">7</xref></bold>] experimentally and numerically studied the factors effecting on the performance of a rolling piston-type hermetic compressor. The results implied that the percentages of motor loss and heat loss, including leakage and heat transfer loss, were 50 and 20 of total loss, respectively. The flow inside the accumulator of a rotary compressor was qualitatively studied using a hybrid particle tracking velocimetry. The test data confirmed that there is a periodic pulsating flow characteristic according to the phase of compressor [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954406211417680">8</xref></bold>]. Wu <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954406211417680">9</xref></bold>] established a mathematical model for calculating the indicator <italic>p–V</italic> diagram of twin-screw compressor. The effects of internal leakage, heat transfer, refrigerant property, etc. were taken simultaneously into account for this model. This model was validated by the author's experimental data and it had a good agreement with the test data. Wu <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954406211417680">10</xref></bold>] also performed the experimental investigation on the effects of the superfeed pressure together with economizer type on the performance of the twin-screw refrigeration compressor by means of the indicator.</p>
<p>In the recent years, due to high efficiency of CO<sub>2</sub>, especially under low environmental temperature, CO<sub>2</sub> refrigerant and CO<sub>2</sub> refrigerant system and components have been studied widely [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954406211417680">11</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954406211417680">13</xref></bold>]. Cavallini <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954406211417680">12</xref></bold>] pointed out that two-stage compression seems to be a good opportunity to improve the performance of CO<sub>2</sub> trans-critical cycle, since it enables splitting the throttling process into two stages. According to their experimental and theoretical analyses, there exists an optimum upper cycle pressure to ensure the maximum system energy efficiency. Ooi [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954406211417680">13</xref></bold>] proposed a mathematical model of rolling piston compressor to study the effects of using carbon dioxide as the refrigerant and its effects on compressor performance when operating at a trans-critical CO<sub>2</sub> cycle. The experimental results showed that leakage of rolling piston compressor can greatly reduce COP. The analysis also revealed that the frictional loss of compressor increases linearly with discharge pressure, but the suction and discharge losses are insignificant and their variation is also insignificant. Cho <italic>et al</italic>. experimentally studied the performance and operating characteristics of a two-stage CO<sub>2</sub> compressor with gas injection. The results showed that the cooling COP was maximally enhanced by 16.5 per cent with the electronic expansion valve (EEV) opening [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954406211417680">14</xref></bold>]. The best way to investigate the behaviour of the compressor is to analyse its thermodynamic process either theoretically orexperimentally, especially by means of the indicator diagram.</p>
<p>Wang <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954406211417680">15</xref></bold>] experimentally indicated that the system COPs of two-stage CO<sub>2</sub> compressor at cooling and heating are about 24.5 per cent and 21.5 per cent higher than that of single-stage compressor system, respectively. Their numerical results showed that there is an optimum intermediate pressure of two-stage compressor. Agrawal group [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954406211417680">16</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954406211417680">17</xref></bold>] did some theoretical analysis on two-stage CO<sub>2</sub> trans-critical systems. Their simulation data showed the flashing intercooler is not economical for CO<sub>2</sub> system and there is no optimum inter-stage pressure [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954406211417680">16</xref></bold>]. They also carried out an optimization study on CO<sub>2</sub> two-stage heat pump cycles [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954406211417680">17</xref></bold>]. Their simulation results also indicated that internal heat exchanger effectiveness has marginal influence on the system performance although the compressor isentropic efficiency showed an about 10 per cent variation in COP. As well as their previous study [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954406211417680">16</xref></bold>], optimum gas cooler and intermediate pressures have only marginally affected the system COP. Yari [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954406211417680">18</xref></bold>] presented a new configuration of ejector-expansion two-stage CO<sub>2</sub> refrigeration system with an internal heat exchanger and intercooler to enhance system performance. The COP and second law efficiency of this new design are higher than that of conventional two-stage cycle. Tian <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954406211417680">19</xref></bold>] theoretically and experimentally studied the performance of two-stage compression system with intercooler. The thermodynamic simulation data showed that there existed an optimum discharge pressure of compressor to achieve an optimum system performance, and the test data indicated that the intercooler can improve the performance of CO<sub>2</sub> system.</p>
<p>In this article, a new hermetic two-stage rolling piston compressor used for CO<sub>2</sub> refrigeration cycle is developed. The <italic>p–V</italic> indicator diagram and motor efficiency of this compressor are obtained by measurement under various working chamber pressures and the position of the crankshaft. Based on the <italic>p–V</italic> indicator diagrams and motor efficiency, the power losses of this compressor at different operating conditions are analysed.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0954406211417680"><title>2.1 Compressor</title>
<p>In this article, a new hermetic two-stage rolling piston compressor was developed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406211417680">Figure 1</xref> shows the schematic view of this compressor in conjunction with the refrigerant flow path. The low-pressure refrigerant flows into the first-stage compression unit located in the lower part of the whole compression unit. In addition, it is compressed to an intermediate pressure determined by the suction pressure and the structure of the compressor. After that, the refrigerant is directly discharged out of the compressor from the first-stage compression unit. After a cooling process in the intercooler, the refrigerant enters into the second-stage compression unit located in the upper part of the compression unit. In this compression unit, the refrigerant is compressed to high pressure, and then discharged into the shell of the compressor. Flowing through the gaps of motor on the upper of the compressor, the refrigerant is discharged out of the compressor to gas cooler of CO<sub>2</sub> trans-critical compression refrigeration cycle.
<fig id="fig1-0954406211417680" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Schematic view of the CO<sub>2</sub> compressor</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211417680-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Obviously, the discharge pressure in the shell of the two-stage compressor is much higher than that of theintermediate pressure compressor. According to this special compression arrangement, the oil at the bottom of the compressor can be easily pumped into the clearance between the movement parts. The lubrication becomes better and compressor reliability is improved. In addition, before being discharged out of the compressor, the refrigerant flowing through the gaps of motor can reduce the oil flowrate ratio (defined as the ratio of the oil flowrate to the refrigerant mass flowrate) and improve the efficiency of the refrigeration system.</p>
<p>In order to easily measure the pressure and displacement volume inside of the compressor, a modified hermetic two-stage rolling piston compressor was used as the tested compressor. The existing shell of the compressor was replaced by the bolted shell designed for the installation of sensors. In addition, the motor performance of this compressor was tested at a motor test rig before experiments.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0954406211417680"><title>2.2 Refrigeration test rig</title>
<p>For the purpose of measuring the performance of the two-stage CO<sub>2</sub> compressor, a new compressor test rig was designed and built. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406211417680">Figure 2</xref> shows the schematic view of this test rig. The test rig consists of the main components such as tube-in-tube gas cooler, evaporator, intercooler, EEV, and superheater and auxiliary components such as oil separator, filter, and vapour–liquid separator. A water tank whose temperature can be controlled is used as heat source and heat sink for evaporator and gas cooler. The mass flow meter was installed at the outlet of the gas cooler where the density of the refrigerant is the highest. During the tests, the suction pressure of compressor is controlled by adjusting the water flowrate flowing through the evaporator. The superheater is used to fine tune the suction temperature, and the discharge pressure of the compressor is controlled by the opening degree of the EEV.

<p>According to Moffat's method [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954406211417680">20</xref></bold>], the precision and uncertainties of main parameters in this test are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954406211417680">Table 1</xref>, in which power loss and volumetric and overall efficiencies are calculated parameters.

<p>Cylinder pressures inside the tested compressor were measured with very small piezoelectric sensors. The sensors which measured the pressure in suction and discharge chambers were installed close to the suction and the discharge ports, respectively. In the test rig, there are four piezoelectric sensors installed in the compressor. In order to identify the rotational angle of the crankshaft, a timing gear was fixed at the shaft, and a displacement sensor was used to pick up the signal of the timing gear.</p>
<p>The pressure sensor response frequency is as high as 500 kHz and the displacement sensor's response frequency is 200 kHz. The pressure and displacement signals were collected and analysed by the LMS Test Lab data acquisition system. Based on the pressure and displacement signals (shaft angle position signal), the pressure curve <italic>versus</italic> the shaft rotation angle could be obtained. This curve was then converted to the <italic>p–V</italic> indicator diagram <italic>via</italic> the relationship between the shaft rotation angle and the volume of working chambers.</p>

It can be seen that the pressure ratio of the second stage is lower than that of the first stage. This makes the CO<sub>2</sub> compressor to undergo a long discharge process, which results in a large discharge passage loss. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954406211417680">Table 3</xref> shows the indicated power distribution of the two-stage compressor. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954406211417680">Table 3</xref>, the discharge passage loss of the first stage is much higher than the other losses. It might be caused by the unsuitable discharge passage of the first stage and the discharge passage will be optimized in the future.

<p>The first and the second stages of the compressor are separated only by the partition plate, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406211417680">Fig. 1</xref>. Because of heat transfer through the plate, the temperature in the first stage is higher than it should be and the temperature in the second stage is lower than it should be. This temperature change makes the heat loss of the first stage during compression process much higher than that of the second stage, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954406211417680">Table 3</xref>. Meanwhile, the lower temperature in thesecond stage will cool down the refrigerant in the suction chamber. This process will result in a higher suction passage loss and a lower suction heat loss, asshown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954406211417680">Table 3</xref>.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the pressure ratio of the second stage is lower than that of the first stage. Hence, the re-expansion loss of clearance volume in the second stage is lower than that of the first stage. As a summary, the indicated efficiency of the second stage is higher than that of the first stage, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954406211417680">Table 3</xref>.</p>
<p>The measured compressor efficiency under operating condition Case 1 is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0954406211417680">Table 4</xref>. The volumetric efficiency of the CO<sub>2</sub> compressor is lower than the other HFC or HCFC compressors due to the large pressure difference. Because of the lower indicated efficiency of the first stage, the overall indicated efficiency of this compressor is lower relatively. The efficiency of the induction motor used in this tested compressor is about 84 per cent under this operating condition.

Since the decrease of pressure ratio in Case 2, the discharge process will become much longer and the discharge passage losses will increase in the first and second stages compared to Case 1. Meanwhile, the re-expansion losses of the clearance volume of the first and second stages drop slightly.

<p>According to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0954406211417680">Table 6</xref>, the suction passage losses of the first and second stages under operating condition Case 2 are larger than that of the Case 1. The suction heat loss increases in the first stage and decreases in the second stage under operating condition Case 2 compared with Case 1, but the compression heat losses have an opposite trend. These are mainly caused by the leakage and heat transfer during suction process and compression process.</p>
<p>As a result, the volumetric and indicated efficiencies of the tested compressor decrease slightly under operating condition Case 2, and the overall efficiency decreases by 1.2 per cent, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0954406211417680">Table 7</xref>.

It is implied that the discharge passage losses of the first and second stages increase with the rise of superheating.

<p>Due to the increase of superheating, the temperature distribution of the components of the two stages will change. It induces the changes of pressure in the working chambers. These changes will affect the leakage and heat transfer during suction and compression processes and influence the indicated power distribution, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0954406211417680">Table 9</xref>. As a result, the indicated efficiencies of the first and second stages will increase slightly.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-0954406211417680">Table 10</xref> shows the measured compressor efficiency for operating condition Cases 1 and 3. The overall efficiency of the tested compressor increases by 0.3 per cent under Case 3, which means that the influence of superheating on the overall efficiency is very small. For two-stage compressor, the indicated and volumetric efficiencies increase a little with the increase of suction superheating temperature. The reason is that the leakage is one important factor influencing indicated and volumetric efficiencies. For a rolling piston compressor, leakage is based on lubricant with refrigerant. When the lubricant leaks from high- to low-pressure side, the refrigerant will escape from the lubricant. More the refrigerant, more the heat loss during suction and compressor process. At the same time, the discharge temperature will increase with the increase of suction superheating temperature as well as lubricant temperature at the bottom of the compressor. In general, for the same pressure difference, the solubility is different for the different temperature. Higher the temperature, lower the solubility. It also means that the refrigerant amount escaping from the leakage is smaller when the pressure decreases, and also the heat loss will decrease. Because of the above reasons, the indicated and volumetric efficiencies will increase from 76.8 per cent to 77.8 per cent and from 87.2 per cent to 88.3 per cent with the increase of the suction superheating temperature, respectively.

<sec id="sec11-0954406211417680"><title>4 CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>A new two-stage rolling piston compressor used for CO<sub>2</sub> refrigerant has been developed. It features high back pressure (discharge pressure) in the shell, which has the advantages on better lubrication and lower oil flowrate. A test rig for performance test of this kind of compressor has been built and the new compressor is experimentally studied. The small pressure sensors and displacement sensor are installed in the modified compressor to obtain the <italic>p–V</italic> indicator diagrams for further understanding of the CO<sub>2</sub> compressor. This modified compressor was tested under various operating conditions at the developed test rig. Based on the tested results and indicator diagram, the indicated power distribution and compressor performance have been analysed.</p>
<p>From the indicator diagrams, it is shown that the discharge passage loss of the first stage and the suction passage loss of the second stage are much higher than other losses for the tested compressor. Therefore, more attention should be paid to these two losses for the improvement of further performance of this kind of compressor.</p>
<p>The discharge pressure of compressor has a little influence on overall efficiency of two-stage CO<sub>2</sub> compressor with high back pressure. The overall efficiency of the tested compressor decreases by 1.2 per cent when the discharge pressure decreases at the same suction pressure. The superheating has only small (increased by 0.3 per cent) effects on the performance of the tested compressor because the compressor lubricant leakage and heat loss are increased with high back pressure of the compressor.</p>
