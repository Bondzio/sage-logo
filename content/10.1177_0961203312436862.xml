<abstract>
<p>Accumulating evidence from murine studies suggests that the RhoA/ROCK pathway plays an important role in the development of autoimmune disorders. We previously demonstrated that ROCK inhibition ameliorates disease in MRL/lpr mice, a spontaneous model of lupus. This study aimed to explore the protective effects of the ROCK inhibitor fasudil in a distinct model of lupus, NZB/W F1 female mice, to assess the broad applicability of ROCK inhibition for the treatment of lupus. NZB/W F1 female mice were administered fasudil continuously in their drinking water starting at 18 or 24 weeks of age up until 44 weeks of age, or remained untreated. Fasudil treatment significantly improved survival and decreased proteinuria, particularly when treatment was started at 18 weeks. There was also a significant decrease in serum anti-dsDNA autoantibody production, glomerular IgG and C3 deposition, and glomerulonephritis. Analysis of the splenic lymphocyte compartment revealed reduced effector/memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell and plasma cell numbers in fasudil treated mice while the frequency of other B cell and T cell subsets was unchanged. These results thus indicate that fasudil can ameliorate disease in NZB/W F1 female mice, suggesting that ROCK inhibition might be broadly effective for the treatment of lupus.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0961203312436862" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypical systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by hypergammaglobulinemia, autoantibody production and multi-organ involvement.<sup>1-3</sup> Aberrant T and B cell function is known to play a crucial role in disease development and progression by driving autoantibody production, a hallmark of SLE. Recently, human and murine studies have provided evidence for a role for interleukin-17 (IL-17) and IL-21, two key cytokines produced by T helper 17 (Th17) cells, in the pathogenesis of SLE and other autoimmune disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203312436862">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312436862">5</xref></sup> While IL-17 has pro-inflammatory functions during host defense against extracellular pathogens, it can mediate inflammation and excessive tissue damage via its ability to promote the secretion of cytokines and chemokines. IL-21 is also a critical contributor to the pathogenesis of autoimmunity via its capacity to amplify the differentiation of Th17 cells and, particularly, to drive T-dependent humoral responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312436862">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Production of IL-17 and IL-21 is absolutely dependent on the transcription factor Interferon Regulatory Factor 4 (IRF4).<sup>7-9</sup> In addition to the induction of IL-17 and IL-21, IRF4 is also a critical regulator of B cell function. In particular, IRF4 controls Ig isotype switching and the differentiation of mature B cells into antibody-secreting plasma cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203312436862">10</xref></sup> Consistent with a critical role of IRF4 in these processes, a recent study has demonstrated that deficiency of IRF4 can ameliorate lupus nephritis in a murine model, and that this effect was accompanied by decreased production of IL-17 and IL-21 and marked reductions in Ig levels and autoantibodies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203312436862">11</xref></sup> We have previously demonstrated that the activity of IRF4 can be controlled by the serine-threonine kinase ROCK2, which phosphorylates IRF4, thereby promoting IRF4 binding to the IL-17 and IL-21 promoters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203312436862">12</xref></sup> Importantly, we have found that treatment of MRL/lpr mice with the ROCK inhibitor fasudil reduced IL-17 and IL-21 production and ameliorated autoimmune symptoms, including anti-dsDNA antibody production, immune-complex deposition and proteinuria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203312436862">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Given the heterogeneity of SLE and the fact that no single murine model emulates the complexity of human lupus, particularly since multiple genes and mechanistic pathways can trigger lupus-like phenotypes, we investigated whether ROCK inhibition could exert protective effects in another well-established murine model of SLE, the NZB/W F1 mouse. We demonstrate that administration of the ROCK inhibitor fasudil significantly prolongs survival and ameliorates SLE disease in NZB/W F1 female mice. This effect was associated with a significant reduction in serum anti-dsDNA autoantibody titers. Analysis of the splenic lymphocyte compartment revealed reduced effector/memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell and plasma cell numbers in fasudil-treated mice, while the frequency of other B cell and T cell subsets was unchanged between groups. These studies thus suggest that ROCK inhibition could be broadly effective for the treatment of lupus.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec3-0961203312436862"><title>Mice</title>
<p>NZB/W F1 mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory and were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. The experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Columbia University and of the Hospital for Special Surgery.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0961203312436862"><title>In vivo fasudil studies</title>
<p>NZB/W F1 female mice were assigned to one of three groups: 1) untreated controls, 2) fasudil treatment commencing at 18 weeks of age and 3) fasudil treatment commencing at 24 weeks of age (<italic>n</italic> = 10 per group). Mice in the three different groups had similar serum anti-dsDNA antibody titers. Mice were administered 100 mg/kg fasudil, monohydrochloride salt (LC Laboratories) continuously in their drinking water, and were monitored regularly during the course of the study for urine proteinuria (Chemstrip 2 GP, Roche), weight gain/loss and water intake. Surviving mice were killed at 44 weeks of age, and blood, urine, kidney and spleen specimens were collected at the time of sacrifice. Proteinuria was assessed semi-quantitatively by using albumin reagent strips (Chemstrip 2 GP, Roche). Grades of proteinuria were expressed as 0 (none), trace (0–30 mg/dl), mild (30–100 mg/dl), moderate (100–500 mg/dl) and severe (500 or more mg/dl).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0961203312436862"><title>Histological and immunofluorescence analysis of kidneys and spleens</title>
<p>Kidney and spleen samples were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin and the various histopathologic alterations in different compartments of the kidney, including the severity of inflammation, were graded in a semi-quantitative manner using hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) stained sections (3 µm thickness). The severity of glomerulonephritis (GN) was graded in a four tiered fashion, normal, mild, moderate, or severe (score 0–3), by assessing the size of glomeruli, glomerular cellularity (mesangial, capillary and presence of crescents), immune complex deposition associated changes (capillary loop/glomerular basement membrane thickening, mesangial widening/nodularity) and extent of glomerulosclerosis. A score of 3 (severe GN) was assigned to cases that displayed cellular crescents, even in the presence of other less severe glomerular changes. The severity of interstitial and perivascular chronic inflammation (lymphocytes and plasma cells) was also graded from normal to severe (score 0–3) in a semiquantitative manner. Presence of vasculitis led to the assignment of a score of 1 (and absence, a score of 0). The severity of GN was tabulated separately and scores of each component were also added to generate a global ‘injury score’. For immunofluorescence, kidneys were snap-frozen in OCT compound and 6 -µm-thick sections stained with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) or FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse complement C3 (MP Cappel). Fluorescence intensity, representing IgG and C3 deposition, was measured as the mean fluorescence in 10–15 glomeruli per mouse (Adobe Photoshop CS4, Adobe).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0961203312436862"><title>Flow cytometry</title>

<p>Since fasudil was effective in ameliorating disease in MRL/lpr mice,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203312436862">12</xref></sup> we investigated whether fasudil could also provide a protective effect against the development of lupus in female NZB/W F1 mice. Fasudil (100 mg/kg) was administered orally to female NZB/W F1 mice starting at either 18 or 24 weeks of age, up to 44 weeks of age. Consistent with previous reports, fasudil treatment was well tolerated.<sup>12-14</sup> Administration of fasudil resulted in a marked decrease in overall mortality in female NZB/W F1 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203312436862">Figure 1(a)</xref>). While only 20% of untreated NZB/W F1 mice survived to 44 weeks of age, 70% of fasudil treated mice survived to that age regardless of whether treatment was initiated at 18 weeks or 24 weeks of age. Consistent with these findings only 30% of fasudil-treated NZB/W F1 mice in the 18-week treatment group developed severe proteinuria, compared with 80% of untreated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203312436862">Figure 1(b)</xref>). Although improvements in the development of proteinuria were also observed when fasudil was administered starting at 24 weeks of age, these results did not reach statistical significance (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0588). Thus, fasudil can be effective in ameliorating the development of proteinuria and prolonging survival in NZB/W F1 female mice, particularly when treatment is initiated during the earlier stages of disease.

<sec id="sec11-0961203312436862"><title>Effects of fasudil on autoantibody production, immune-complex deposition and glomerulonephritis</title>
<p>SLE is characterized by autoantibody production including antibodies to dsDNA, leading to immune complex formation and deposition in multiple organs particularly in the kidney, which subsequently drives a local inflammatory response that can lead to tissue damage and clinical disease.<sup>1–3</sup> Fasudil treatment significantly lowered anti-dsDNA IgG autoantibody titers in both the 18 and 24 weeks treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0961203312436862">Figure 2(a)</xref>). Consistent with the improved survival and reduced proteinuria, furthermore, fasudil treatment resulted in reduced renal IgG and C3 deposition as assessed by quantitation of IgG and C3 staining intensity in the glomeruli of mice in the different treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0961203312436862">Figure 2(b</xref>) to (e)). Histopathological analysis supported the idea that fasudil treatment lessened the severity of glomerulonephritis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0961203312436862">Figure 2(f), (g)</xref>).

<sec id="sec12-0961203312436862"><title>Effects of fasudil treatment on immune cell subsets</title>
<p>To gain further insights into the effects of fasudil on the immune abnormalities underlying development of lupus in NZB/W F1 mice, flow cytometry analysis was conducted on surviving mice at 44 weeks of age. Fasudil treatment did not affect splenomegaly, the frequency of total splenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, or the numbers of splenic regulatory T cells (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0961203312436862">Figure 3(a</xref>) to (c)). There was, however, a reduction in the frequency of effector/memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in both 18 and 24 weeks-treated mice as assessed by the expression of CD44 and CD62L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0961203312436862">Figure 3(d)</xref>). No alterations in the frequency of B220<sup>+</sup> B cells, marginal zone B cells (B220<sup>+</sup>CD21<sup>hi</sup>CD23<sup>lo</sup>), follicular B cells (B220<sup>+</sup>CD21<sup>lo</sup>CD23<sup>hi</sup>) or germinal center B cells (B220<sup>+</sup>PNA<sup>+</sup>) were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0961203312436862">Figure 3(e)</xref> to (h)). Consistent with the decrease in autoantibody production, NZB/W F1 mice administered fasudil exhibited a striking decrease in the number of B220<sup>lo</sup>CD138<sup>+</sup> plasma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0961203312436862">Figure 3(i)</xref>). Taken all together these results suggest that fasudil treatment markedly diminishes the aberrant plasma cell accumulation that characterizes NZB/W F1 mice.

<sec id="sec13-0961203312436862" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Previous studies from our lab have demonstrated that <italic>in vivo</italic> administration of the ROCK inhibitor fasudil to MRL/lpr mice leads to decreased IL-17 and IL-21 expression, lowers the production of autoantibodies and ameliorates the development of lupus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203312436862">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203312436862">13</xref></sup> Here we demonstrate that administration of fasudil lengthens the life span and delays the development of proteinuria in NZB/W F1 mice, a distinct murine model of lupus, particularly when treatment is commenced at 18 weeks of age. Taken all together these results suggest that ROCK inhibition may be broadly effective for the treatment of lupus.</p>
<p>One of the most noticeable effects of fasudil treatment was the significant decrease in anti-dsDNA autoantibody production. This was associated with a lower number of plasma cells in the spleens of fasudil-treated NZB/W F1 mice, a finding also observed in fasudil-treated lupus-prone MRL/lpr mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203312436862">12</xref></sup> Given that IL-21 is a critical regulator of humoral responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312436862">5</xref></sup> and that we previously demonstrated that aberrant activation of ROCK2 in MRL/lpr T cells leads to elevated levels of IL-21 production via its effects on IRF4,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203312436862">12</xref></sup> it is likely that inhibition of the ROCK2-mediated production of this cytokine plays a role in the beneficial effects exerted by fasudil in NZB/W F1 mice. In further support of this hypothesis both murine and human studies support a role for deregulation of IL-21 production in lupus pathogenesis and IL-21 producing T cells have been observed in the acceleration of lupus disease in NZB/W F1 that occurs upon IFNα administration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203312436862">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is, however, likely that the protective effects of fasudil also encompass actions on additional cellular compartments. Although we have not observed any direct effects of ROCK inhibitors on the ability of B cells to differentiate into plasma cells <italic>in vitro</italic> upon stimulation with anti-CD40 and IL-21 (PB, unpublished observations), we cannot exclude that ROCK inhibition may exert direct effects on the B cell compartment. Furthermore, the improvements in survival and proteinuria that we have observed in fasudil-treated NZB/W F1 mice are also likely to involve actions beyond its effects on lymphocytes. Indeed, the RhoA/ROCK pathway has previously been shown to play an important role in inflammation, via its ability to regulate the recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils as well as their function, including the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and pro-fibrogenic factors such as TGFβ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203312436862">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203312436862">17</xref></sup> Recent studies utilizing various models of diabetic nephropathy have furthermore highlighted the critical importance of the RhoA/ROCK pathway in progressive kidney disease via effects on glomerular endothelial cells, mesangial cells, podocytes and tubular epithelial cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203312436862">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203312436862">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Interestingly, although the protective effects of fasudil on the development of proteinuria were less marked when treatment was initiated at 24 weeks, we did see beneficial effects on survival even when treatment was started at such a time. Additional studies will thus be required to fully assess the effectiveness of ROCK inhibition at later stages of disease. In conjunction with our previous findings, these studies thus suggest that ROCK inhibition might be broadly effective for the treatment of lupus and other autoimmune disorders, and thus warrants further investigation as a potential therapy for the treatment of human autoimmune disorders.</p></sec>
