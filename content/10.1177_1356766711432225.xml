It is argued that these KPIs are particularly unsuited for assessing the impact of DMO digital platforms and provide little strategic direction for brand development in today’s disintermediated marketing environment.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Today, there are 265 countries in the world (plus a number of territories and other administrative areas), and regardless of their level of tourism development, almost all of them engage in destination marketing. Research conducted for the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1356766711432225">World Tourism Organisation (WTO) and European Travel Commission (ETC; 2009)</xref>, <italic>Handbook on Tourism Destination Branding</italic>, reveals that the majority of Destination Management Organisations (DMOs; 82%) have an official brand strategy and a toolkit explaining how to apply their brand (80%), whereas 75% consider that they have developed a unique destination positioning. Of particular relevance to this article, however, is the report’s finding that over a third of these DMOs have no plans to evaluate their brand strategy, a statistic that reveals much about the complex challenge posed by destination marketing evaluation and many DMOs' preparedness and ability to meet it.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, at a time when national governments worldwide are placing greater than ever importance on tourism’s economic significance, many (especially in Europe and North America) are questioning the rationale for DMOs' continued involvement in the sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1356766711432225">Lennon et al., 2006</xref>). Partly as a consequence of the devolution of decision-making power to local and provincial levels, partly as a result of the dominance of neo-conservative political philosophies, and partly as an outcome of diminishing budgets, there has been a clear trend towards public sector disengagement in the management and promotion of tourism in recent decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1356766711432225">Davies et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1356766711432225">Prideaux and Cooper, 2002</xref>). Thus DMOs have evolved so that, especially in countries with a high level of economic activity, their role has changed from that of a public administration model to one based on partnerships involving local authorities and the private sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1356766711432225">Hall, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Today, DMOs exist less to manage and more to coordinate, not simply to communicate with the consumer but to support the wider destination system – establishing, nurturing, and servicing partnerships between a range of stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1356766711432225">Fyall and Garrod, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356766711432225">Pike, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1356766711432225">Wang and Fesenmaier, 2007</xref>). As organisations often funded largely from the public sector, DMOs are under increasing pressure to account for their activities and the ‘additional value’ provided by their marketing interventions. Indeed, DMO managers identify relevance and responsibility as two of the three most significant challenges facing their organisations today – the third being new technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1356766711432225">Day, 2009</xref>). This pressure is likely to be exacerbated further by the continuing economic crisis in more economically developed countries, its impact on their public spending resource allocation, and the subsequent drive for value-for-money. If DMOs cannot demonstrate this added value, they will face further budget reductions and the curtailment of their activities.</p>
<p>This article critically reviews the extant literature on destination marketing evaluation and considers the challenges of such evaluation in todays dynamic and disintermediated DMO marketing environment. It makes a contribution to the tourism management literature through its analysis of how one DMO (Visit Wales) has developed an innovative marketing evaluation framework, which is ‘fit-for-purpose’ in the contemporary digitally dominated marketing environment. The outcome of a collaboration between tourism’s academic and industry knowledge communities, the article attempts to create knowledgescapes of benefit to academics and DMOs by exploring the process by which the new KPIs were developed and their subsequent implementation. In doing so, it furthers dialogues between industry and academia, which have the potential to improve knowledge transfer, enhance cross-sector understanding, and lead to management innovation across the DMO sector.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1356766711432225">
<title>Literature review</title>
<p>Destination marketing evaluation is a complex area for DMOs, and the methodologies they employ have tended to focus on tracking research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1356766711432225">Eagle et al., 1998</xref>), economic modelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1356766711432225">Tellis, 2004</xref>), and more recently on brand awareness, equity, and image impacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1356766711432225">McDonald, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1356766711432225">2000</xref>). While marketing evaluation <italic>per se</italic> is challenging for all organisations, for DMOs, the situation is further complicated by the nature of destinations themselves. Unlike fast-moving consumer goods, destinations are amorphous, they deliver a broad and diverse range of products, services, and experiences, and they exist on multiple geopolitical levels as inherently political entities subject to diverse aspirations, interests, and demands (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1356766711432225">Buhalis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1356766711432225">Pike, 2005</xref>). These characteristics lend themselves to collaborative marketing partnerships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1356766711432225">D’Angella and Go, 2009</xref>), but the geographical and political boundaries that divide many destinations often render considered management theory irrelevant, while the consistent lack of funding and the need to balance the demands of residents and the experiences of visitors create challenges beyond those of traditional consumer and business marketing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1356766711432225">Pavlovich, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1356766711432225">Pike, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1356766711432225">Ritchie and Hudson, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Of all these challenges, perhaps the most difficult to overcome are the heterogeneous market interests of the diverse group of active stakeholders that constitute the destination. This point was reinforced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1356766711432225">Manente and Minghetti (2006</xref>: 230) who argue that the ‘presence of a wide range of stakeholders who interact with and within the resort, each one with diverging interests and different perceptions of the destination, make it very hard to plan coherent development of the destination’. They continue that the ‘key issue is to harmonize the variety of interests/perceptions on the one hand and of tourism products on the other with the identity of the destination, in order to create an integrated system of tourism supply’. Not only do DMOs have to balance these competitive pressures, but they also tend to conduct their business in highly politicised, resource-poor environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1356766711432225">Day, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1356766711432225">Pride, 2002</xref>). At the same time, although many DMOs and academics have undertaken substantial research into the tourist destination decision-making process, our understanding of this remains very limited. Rational modelling of this process, akin to that which dominates the consumer behaviour literature, predominates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1356766711432225">Sirakaya and Woodside, 2005</xref>), yet arguably destination and place image are determined as much by emotional as rational appeals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1356766711432225">Boschma and Fritsch, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1356766711432225">Kitson et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In such an environment, evaluation of tourism destination marketing campaigns is extremely difficult, especially as place images are derived from so many sources and so many partners typically contribute to ‘collaborative image formation on the destination level’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1356766711432225">D’Angella and Go, 2009</xref>: 437). The tourist consumer decision-making process is particularly complex, and it has proved a challenge to establish a clear causal link between the decision to visit a destination and its marketing campaign activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1356766711432225">Bigne et al., 2001</xref>). Any advertising campaign performs one or more of three basic functions, namely, to persuade, to change or reinforce brand values, and to raise a brand’s profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1356766711432225">Uncles, 2005</xref>). These functions are further complicated by the time frames involved in the evaluation process: potentially, advertising can stimulate both short- and long-term consequences for the brand (or destination) in question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1356766711432225">Vakratas, 2005</xref>). Thus, the evaluation phase of any marketing activity is usually the most challenging stage in the cycle because while it is relatively straightforward to establish certain marketing effectiveness measures (such as consumers' awareness of a brand before and after a campaign), it is much more difficult to establish shifts in consumer attitudes, brand perceptions, or consumer actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1356766711432225">Morgan and Pritchard, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>This is not to suggest that DMOs have failed to conduct marketing evaluations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1356766711432225">Faulkner, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1356766711432225">Seaton and Matthews, 2003</xref>). Indeed, there is an established history of destination marketing evaluation techniques, which typically measure key performance indicators (KPIs) such as advertising awareness and impact (tracking research), response levels and cost per response (response reporting), conversion of enquiries to customers (conversion research), and return on investment (ROI) or value of business (financial value models). Such conversion, tracking, and ROI measures have a long history of application in the sector, although questions have been asked about how they have been utilised. Thus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1356766711432225">Hildreth (2011)</xref> argues that existing measures are hugely detailed but provide little insight and that research is most useful in simply verifying whether a destination is part of the consideration set of its relevant audiences. Researchers have noted how<disp-quote>
<p>Unbelievable as it may seem, ... advertising evaluation research is often conducted without a true understanding of what individual campaigns are trying to do for a brand, or the way in which a creative execution is attempting to work (Research International, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1356766711432225">Morgan and Pritchard, 2000</xref>: 100).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>While many DMOs continue to utilise such evaluation instruments, they are proving to be increasingly ineffective as successful and responsive measures of performance. Importantly, of course, before DMOs can do any effective evaluation, they must know which factors are the ones to assess, and it could be argued that today the most often used KPIs measure only what <italic>can</italic> be measured rather than what <italic>should</italic> be measured. This is because they largely fail to address four crucial points. First, whether additional visitor spend has been generated through above-the-line advertising; second, they do not appraise increasingly significant online marketing activities; third, they fail to investigate the relationship between brand advertising (a growing and increasingly crucial element of all DMO portfolios) and its impact on online consumer responses; and finally, they do not evaluate the growing emphasis on public relations management and social media engagement (instead of traditional advertising) in many DMOs.</p>
<p>In short, traditional KPIs developed in the 1990s are no longer fit-for-purpose in today’s marketing environment and provide little strategic direction for the development of future DMO marketing activity. Most of the current DMO marketing evaluation techniques (summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1356766711432225">Table 1</xref>
) have significant flaws. Conversion studies may overestimate the relationship between marketing activity and consumer decisions to visit or extend their stay because they do not encompass non-respondents in the survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1356766711432225">Pratt et al., 2009</xref>). Such studies also tend to inflate ROI calculations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1356766711432225">Kim et al., 2005</xref>), while tracking studies may imply a one-off relationship with advertising, thus overestimating its effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1356766711432225">McWilliams and Crompton, 1997</xref>), which is clearly untenable in today’s media-saturated environment. Advertising tracking research also has a number of other inherent weaknesses, principally, inclusion in face-to-face omnibus surveys is expensive, the long-term impact of television advertising cannot be measured over time, and tracking research is unable to calculate the level of business directly generated by a campaign or ROI. With the shift in DMO activity towards brand and awareness raising, this presents a significant gap in understanding; indeed, DMOs' rapidly developing role in place brand building is proving extremely difficult to evaluate and as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1356766711432225">Pike (2007</xref>: 52) notes, ‘There has been almost no research reported that has tracked the effectiveness of destination brand initiatives'.</p>

<p>In addition to this evaluation gap, conversion research is showing a reduced ROI in our digital age. Digital channels can no longer be said to be ‘new’ media, and as response through traditional channels has fallen, consumers are becoming increasingly disengaged by one-way dialogues. The marketing environment has changed beyond all recognition, and customers are engaging in more meaningful relationships with brands and demanding that they humanise their communications with them. For DMOs, this creates serious and exciting challenges, not least of which is how to introduce new measures that evaluate the effectiveness of their communications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1356766711432225">Munro and Richards, 2011</xref>). Thus, conversion research lends itself to marketing methods that have some form of consumer response mechanism, such as ‘traditional’ lists of brochure requesters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1356766711432225">Seaton and Matthews, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1356766711432225">Woodside and Dubelaar, 2003</xref>). Yet, as marketing activity has changed, so has the consumer journey as people have evolved from being brochure requesters to web researchers, actively searching DMO and business websites. Such is the importance of the internet that it is already involved in 85% of all vacation purchases, while a third of smartphone users anticipate booking travel services on their mobile phones in the near future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356766711432225">Cinchmarketing, 2011</xref>). Unlike the traditional brochure requestor, the journey of the web researcher is untraceable and therefore not measurable in a typical conversion model. Thus, while the virtual world now dominates destination marketing activity, evaluation techniques have failed to keep pace with the revolution in marketing practise, continuing to mimic offline evaluation tracking and conversion practises which fail to grasp the complexity of online media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1356766711432225">Dossa and Williams, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1356766711432225">Munro and Richards, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Having discussed the flawed nature of traditional KPIs, and especially their lack of precision in measuring today’s digitally dominated destination marketing activities, we now examine the development of a new evaluation framework in the DMO of Visit Wales. Innovations in public tourism service provision and in destination management and governance have not had the attention they deserve, particularly as the public sector is often a key stakeholder, driver of innovation and repository of research-based knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1356766711432225">Hjalager, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1356766711432225">2010</xref>). Marketing evaluation innovation clearly occurs in DMOs but takes place in a complex and informal fashion as knowledge resources are diffuse. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1356766711432225">Hjalager (2010</xref>: 6) notes that ‘tourism research has only scraped the surface of these issues, and a proper understanding of how such innovation processes take place is still only fragmentary’. Clearly, significant knowledge exists in any organisation as tacit knowledge, but if it is to drive innovation, such knowledge has to be captured and made explicit, interpreted, and recoded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356766711432225">Behara, 2000</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1356766711432225">
<title>Study approach</title>
<p>It has been well documented that there are insufficient dialogues between industry and academia, which adversely impacts on knowledge transfer and diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1356766711432225">Cooper, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1356766711432225">Shaw and Williams, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1356766711432225">Stamboulis and Skayannis, 2003</xref>). This article is the outcome of collaboration between tourism’s academic and industry knowledge communities, which attempts to create knowledgescapes of benefit to DMOs and tourism academics. The article attempts to share expertise within tourism’s knowledge-generating communities, capturing and transforming organisationally held knowledge into publicly available explicit knowledge, which has the potential to create good practice and inform sectoral innovation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1356766711432225">Figure 1</xref>
). Sharing expertise is a difficult task as industry experts often lack the motivation and time to document their expertise, and at the same time, academics have been slow to recognise the value of the knowledge held within industry. New approaches based on mutually beneficial relationships are required to facilitate more effective knowledge transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1356766711432225">Shaw and Williams, 2009</xref>). One such framework is the developed expertise cycle where academics or ‘knowledge stewards' build personal trusted relationships with experts, interview them, construct the knowledge, and document it, making it available for knowledge seekers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1356766711432225">Karhu, 2002</xref>). This article is the outcome of established academic-industry collaboration and adds a further dimension to Karhu’s approach as here the senior industry expert is also a co-researcher and co-author.</p>

</fig>
<p>Knowledge management has been described as central to developing competitiveness and sustainability in tourism, yet there is a very limited literature focused on how it can ‘assist destinations in becoming more sustainable learning destinations integrating knowledge into responsible planning and policy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1356766711432225">Cooper and Sheldon, 2010</xref>: 215). While there are many definitions of knowledge management, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1356766711432225">Davidson and Voss (2002)</xref> suggest that it is concerned with utilising knowledge resources to create competitive advantage. Yet as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1356766711432225">Cooper and Sheldon (2010)</xref> point out, the tourism sector has largely failed to manage knowledge, in part due to the nature of the industry and in part due to the failure of tourism’s knowledge-generating communities to effectively communicate with each other. As a result, much knowledge remains tacit and implicit, residing at a micro level, often within individual organisations or with individual managers, hampering progress towards the creation of learning, innovative, and sustainable destinations.</p>
<p>This article is an analysis of how one micro knowledge DMO network reviewed its marketing evaluation framework in order to establish a more effective set of KPIs. The article captures tacit institutionally based knowledge built throughout the senior DMO managers' careers. Much of the knowledge required to be an effective manager and leader cannot be acquired from explicit documents but is gained through action, experience, and reflection and is a major source of competitive advantage and innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1356766711432225">Janson and McQueen, 2007</xref>). As the result of the multi-organisational, but in essence, interactive human-to-human collaboration analysed here, it was transformed into a macro knowledge network shared by the DMO, its agency, and its key partners. The article moves beyond the macro knowledge network already created within this learning destination in an attempt to produce explicit knowledge and build sector-wide competiveness, innovation, and sustainability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1356766711432225">Swan et al., 1999</xref>). It briefly contextualises Wales Tourist Board’s (WTB)/Visit Wales's marketing activity during 1997–2007, discusses the process by which the DMO moved from one evaluation framework to another, and presents the new evaluation framework, which incorporates seven new KPIs for destination marketing evaluation. It then briefly reviews the framework’s implementation during its pilot year of operation (2009) and outlines implications and lessons for other DMOs seeking to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their marketing evaluation practices.</p>

<p>Visit Wales is the tourism arm of the Welsh Government (WG), formed by the merger of the WTB into WG in 2006, the WTB itself having been established in 1969. Visit Wales's remit is to improve the economic and social prosperity of Wales through the effective marketing and development of tourism. Wales's main domestic United Kingdom (UK) campaign during the 1990s and the early 2000s focused on a coordinated programme of image advertising, through the media of television and posters. This was supported by direct marketing activities, centred on the targeted distribution of brochures. The aim of the advertising was to enhance awareness and improve perceptions and images of Wales as a holiday destination within the target markets. Direct marketing supplemented the image campaign to generate cost-effective brochure enquiries. Marketing activities were carefully targeted so that effort and resources were focused upon key markets, which research suggested offered the greatest potential for Wales.</p>
<p>Since 2006, Visit Wales's marketing objectives have been developed within the Business Planning Framework of the WG, and the key strategic outcomes aligned to Visit Wales are the enhancement of Wales's external reputation and the regeneration of communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1356766711432225">Visit Wales, 2010</xref>:10). Thus, although the traditional marketing priorities of Visit Wales (like many DMOs) were to stimulate preference and intention to visit, the strategic attention has now shifted to awareness raising, brand advertising, and destination advocacy in order to specifically tackle the poor perceptions of non-visitors while harnessing the positive experiences of recent visitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1356766711432225">Figure 2</xref>
). Among those who have not visited the destination, Wales has a poorer external reputation compared to other destinations within the United Kingdom. In these markets, Wales's identity premium is low, determined by traditional stereotypes, in turn ‘reinforced by a lack of awareness of the true range and quality of experiences on offer in Wales' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1356766711432225">Visit Wales, 2010</xref>). This strategic focus on building Wales's external reputation clearly leaves the destination’s regional organisations and individual business operators with the task of converting potential business into visits; as Visit Wales's (2010) latest Strategic Marketing Action Plan (S<underline>MAP</underline>) notes, one of its key priorities is ‘improving perceptions of Wales in order to create an environment of increased demand for our stakeholders'.</p>

<p>Like the WTB before it, Visit Wales is committed to providing data on the impact of its marketing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1356766711432225">Morgan et al., 2002</xref>). Traditionally, this marketing evaluation work has been used to inform future marketing strategy and demonstrate that resources are being deployed wisely, efficiently, and effectively. Both WTB and Visit Wales campaigns have long been evaluated via a mix of advertising tracking research (measuring campaign awareness) and conversion research (measuring how responses to these campaigns have ‘converted’ into business for Wales, from which an estimate is made of the value of that business to Wales). Visit Wales practice has been guided by <italic>Tourism Marketing: A Practical Guide to Evaluation</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1356766711432225">English Tourist Board, Scottish Tourist Board, Wales Tourist Board, Northern Ireland Tourist Board, 1998</xref>), produced for the four former national UK tourist boards (of which WTB was one). This provided a consistent framework for analysis, which was adopted by all the UK national tourist boards, and it has structured all subsequent marketing evaluation conducted in the United Kingdom, focusing on the following: advertising awareness/impact, response levels, cost per response, conversion of enquiries to customers, ROI, and value of business generated via response campaigns/fulfilment.</p>
<p>Significant concern over this evaluation framework first emerged during 2005/2006, some 8 years after the marketing evaluation framework had been established. Visit Wales's marketing managers were increasingly concerned that these methods of evaluation had become a simple ‘box ticking’ exercise to provide evidence that the campaigns had created a ROI and were failing to provide crucial information about the success or failure of the campaigns. In addition, they recognised that technological advances were rapidly altering the face of destination marketing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1356766711432225">Visit Wales's 2007</xref> SMAP highlighted the changes precipitated by technological advances and acknowledged that the new digital platforms have created a completely different marketing environment and, at the same time, have the potential to engage a much wider national and international audience. More significantly though, consumers can be driven much closer to a sale than ever before with direct links to tourism products that can then be purchased on or offline. As a result, the SMAP also recognised that none of the traditional measures then employed were able to evaluate the effectiveness of online marketing activity and were thus increasingly unfit for purpose.</p>

<sec id="section6-1356766711432225">
<title>Devising a new marketing evaluation framework</title>
<p>Given the concerns with extant marketing evaluation measures, Visit Wales established a task force in 2007 charged with defining relevant campaign KPIs, recommending a framework of monitoring and evaluation requirements to fill existing information gaps (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1356766711432225">Table 2</xref>
), building information-rich profiles of consumer activities, and evaluating responses to brand advertising and PR, direct response activities (offline), and online marketing activities. The first stage in this process was to review the current KPIs, identify the valued aspects of the current approach, and establish existing research costs and the likely budget for future research. Key stakeholders (senior Visit Wales marketing and research staff and senior agency account managers) were consulted to establish the limitations of extant research, factors inhibiting change, and long-term consequences of brand building. These stakeholders felt that existing evaluation methodologies were constrained by several major limitations; in particular, they were seen to be rather clumsy and hampered by historical precedent and process.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>The existing KPIs were mainly focused on assessing the immediate impact of marketing and the subsequent value generated. They failed to answer key questions such as the following: ‘How effective is advertising in changing perceptions?’; ‘Does changing perceptions lead to a change in behaviour?’ ‘How does the effectiveness of communications vary by channel?’ ‘What is the longer term impact on the Visit Wales brand?’ ‘Which messages of the marketing campaign have been effective?’ ‘Which messages are leading to action?’ and ‘Which elements of the marketing mix have had the greatest long/short-term impact?’ Above all, the key stakeholders felt that there was a lack of diagnostics in the tracking element as, while awareness could be assessed, no measure could gauge whether this awareness actually translated into positive action. In addition, many stakeholders raised doubts over the role of the existing questionnaires in the conversion research; one manager commented, ‘Nobody’s really sure why they’re doing what they’re doing’ and another was of the opinion that the ‘questionnaires had been “inherited” and not changed for fear of losing continuity’.</p>
<p>There was a general consensus that existing research was unable to effectively assess the actual value of the DMO’s marketing campaigns because they only generated an annual overall value figure. Moreover, managers felt that this figure was itself likely to be an underestimate of the overall value of the campaigns because of the timing of the fieldwork research. As this began in January or February and asked respondents about the previous year, this could be lowering results as responders could be referring to an autumn short break, not their main summer holiday. At the same time, with the changing response channels, it was felt that key audiences and marketing channels (particularly online) were not featuring at all in the existing research.</p>
<p>Despite these considerable concerns, the task force discovered that there were major barriers to change, not least of which was the desire for continuity and consistency in marketing evaluation practice. In fact, all the stakeholders described continuity as supremely important since breaking with the existing methodology would prevent year-on-year comparisons. At the same time, it would mean that a destination which broke free of the existing widely used frameworks would be isolated and unable to benchmark its performance with competitor destinations. Thus, despite all the problems with the existing evaluation methodologies, it was felt that there were too few people in the DMO or its agency with an understanding of ‘the big picture’ to initiate change without further investigation of the key issues.</p>
<p>The DMO task force was thus next charged with widening the discussion to provide a platform for the development of a new evaluation framework. With major UK public sector budget cuts on the horizon, it was vital for Visit Wales's marketing managers to understand the consequences of reducing or increasing specific marketing budgets, enabling them to justify arguments of ‘spending more to get more’. Being able to effectively balance long- and short-term marketing strategies and respond to market conditions with greater agility were seen as essential goals of the new framework. Moreover, the task force’s assessment of budget allocations to the various Visit Wales marketing evaluation programmes soon revealed that the advertising tracking work was taking the majority of resources. It emerged that two thirds of the marketing evaluation budget was devoted to this area even though it only retrospectively measured a single KPI, which was not even used to improve future marketing investment activities. In contrast, evaluation of the increasingly significant digital platforms only accounted for 5% of the total evaluation budget. It was apparent that a new evaluation framework could realign priorities and deliver a more effective, efficient evaluation of Visit Wales's marketing activities.</p>
<p>The new framework needed to provide quantifiable measures of success, defined in a way which enabled Visit Wales to measure performance against a clear and communicable set of agreed criteria (targets) and that allowed forward planning and allocation of resources. Stakeholders were consulted on their opinions of what made a good KPI, and the task force developed a profile of an effective KPI – one which was actionable, meaningful, holistic, tailored, credible, and easily understood and relevant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1356766711432225">Table 3</xref>
). A workshop session was then held with marketing and research teams, agencies, and other stakeholders involved in tourism marketing for Wales to discuss the task force’s findings. The assembled teams were asked to identify the major gaps in measuring marketing activity in order to generate a ‘shopping list’ of KPIs, which they did under the six key measures of value, sustainability, visit(ors), brand, campaign response, and campaign diagnostics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1356766711432225">Table 4</xref>
). As with the senior DMO officers, these teams were concerned that the value of the internet needed to be assessed alongside and in conjunction with traditional marketing. Visitors are influenced by a variety of sources, not just the creative campaigns; for example, visitors are attracted by tactical offers, events, advocacy, or casual web search. The teams underlined the need for the new KPIs to reflect the requirements of reporting campaign effectiveness to WG and of generating insights of value to the campaign teams.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Seven new KPIs (destination awareness, total campaign awareness, claimed and known campaign response, emotional proximity, conviction to visit, conversion throughout the decision-making process, value per respondent) were finally agreed as a series of indicators that reflect the consumer journey from awareness to advocacy as expressed in the marketing funnel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1356766711432225">Figure 3</xref>
). These new KPIs (described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1356766711432225">Table 5</xref>
) have the advantage that at a strategic level they are each an individual, understandable measure of campaign and brand performance, but at the planning level, they fit together to paint a picture of the effect of marketing interventions on different groups throughout the consumer journey. For example, the new framework enables managers to answer questions such as ‘if a campaign has a high awareness score, what impact will this have on the destination awareness, response, emotional proximity, and critically the conviction to visit?’ The ability to measure these new KPIs over time now provides Visit Wales's marketing teams with more nuanced and relevant information to evaluate the total reach and impact of their campaigns.</p>

<title>Implementing the new framework</title>
<p>The new marketing evaluation framework provides an integrated approach that recognises the linkages between the wide variety of marketing and promotional activities undertaken by DMOs. The changes proposed in Visit Wales's marketing evaluation practice required concomitant changes in methodological practice and application. In order to implement the new KPIs, a new research methodology was developed embracing four key elements: a move to web-based research, the combination of ad-tracking and conversion studies, the implementation of multi-stage interviewing and continuous surveying, and revised value calculations. Crucially, marketing performance is now continuously measured among the Great Britain (GB) population as a whole and among Visit Wales's enquirers. The sample is split over the range of campaign activities undertaken. Wales's position and performance is contextualised via an analysis of leading UK competitors, including Scotland, Ireland, the West Country, and the Lake District. The survey fieldwork (working in each case with samples reflective of the GB population) began in January 2009 and comprises four main elements, namely, a panel survey, a Visit Wales contacts survey, a re-contact survey, and a slide-in web-based survey, each of which is now summarised.</p>
<sec id="section8-1356766711432225">
<title>Panel survey</title>
<p>Members of an online panel are interviewed weekly with the aim of tracking awareness of Wales's marketing campaigns in a similar fashion to previous advertising tracking surveys. Questions are both unprompted and prompted, and the questionnaire features visuals of the Visit Wales marketing material. The survey differs from the previous tracking surveys as respondents are asked what action they took as a result of seeing marketing material and whether they intend to visit Wales in the future. This phase of the research is the principle vehicle for gathering data to feed into the evaluation of the new KPIs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1356766711432225">
<title>Visit Wales contacts survey</title>
<p>In a similar fashion to traditional conversion research, a questionnaire is sent to those who have had contact with Visit Wales via direct marketing (post, email, or press inserts), plus Visit Wales adds in a sample of users of its websites recruited through the slide-in survey (see the following). This tracks the changes between the general panel survey and those who have engaged with Visit Wales through the campaigns. This element of research also provides evidence for the KPIs and feeds the marketing funnel as it shows those responders who are, on the whole, closer to visiting Wales (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1356766711432225">Figure 3</xref>). The chief advantage this method has over traditional conversion research is that interviewing is undertaken periodically throughout the year, not just at the end.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1356766711432225">
<title>Re-contact survey</title>
<p>An online survey is conducted with a sample of those who responded to the contact survey (see above) later in the year. Short questionnaires ask whether visits were taken following initial contact with the aim of correlating actual visits with contact with Visit Wales and awareness of advertising campaigns. Questions such as those previously used in campaign evaluations to determine the effects of the marketing material on the decision to visit are used in the subsequent value calculation. In order to make this even more valuable, diagnostic questions probing why some committed visitors did not make a visit to Wales have been added.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1356766711432225">
<title>Slide in survey</title>
<p>In order to populate the contact survey with web users (a significant group Visit Wales could not reach previously), a questionnaire was set up on the main campaign website. The website intercept survey operates by providing a ‘slide-in’ invitation to the site visitor instead of the more common and increasingly blocked ‘pop-up’. Questions ask how visitors found out about the website and whether they visited it as a result of seeing marketing material; this supplements the information gathered through Google Analytics and provides a known campaign enquirer group for the website.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1356766711432225">
<title>The pilot year of operation (2009)</title>
<p>The new Visit Wales evaluation framework has been in operation since January 2009 and (at the time of writing) data are only available for the first 18 months of operation, some of which are still being analysed. Key to the new framework is the segmentation of visitor markets to provide a better understanding of the most valuable and committed visitors and how to retain them and the most uncommitted visitors and how to win them over. This is facilitated by the analysis of marketing efficiency (KPI 6) according to the marketing funnel or consumer journey through awareness, recognition, response, interest, visitation, and advocacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1356766711432225">Figure 3</xref>). This approach enables Visit Wales to better understand the various leakages (in other words people ‘lost’) between the different stages of the funnel, and therefore, the consumer groups most responsive to marketing activities. In contrast to traditional evaluation measures, the new framework provides managers with a more fine-grained and complex understanding of the respondents' emotional commitment and loyalty towards Wales and of its competitor set, as levels of brand commitment, loyalty, and openness are assessed among visitors and non-visitors alike. As outlined above, the seven new KPIs provide an integrated evaluation framework, but they are each an individual measure of campaign and brand performance, and this final section of the case study briefly reviews the impact of each new KPI in turn (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1356766711432225">Table 5</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section15-1356766711432225">
<title>KPI 1</title>
<p>This determines destination awareness, both spontaneous and prompted awareness of Wales. When respondents are asked (unprompted) which destinations in the British Isles come to mind, Wales consistently comes third out of 10, behind the West Country and Scotland for first mentions and total mentions. This ranking has remained relatively unchanged throughout the pilot year of operation and is a useful long-term measure with the ability to track weekly movements in brand position linked to marketing activity or key events such as the October 2010 Ryder Cup held in Wales.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1356766711432225">
<title>KPI 2</title>
<p>This KPI enables Visit Wales to determine the total reach and impact of its paid for marketing activity. Once again, respondents are asked an unprompted question, this time, whether they recall seeing or hearing any advertising or promotion for destinations. Significantly, Wales is ranked top of the 10 destinations in the British Isles for first mention and total mentions, with 13% of the GB population claiming to have seen advertising or promotion for Wales. By monitoring the response weekly and against key competitors, the effects of specific campaigns can clearly be demonstrated, while the measure can also be used as a diagnostic tool to analyse the other KPIs. For example, it can enable managers to see the effect campaign awareness has on the other KPIs, a very useful level of analysis for marketing teams.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1356766711432225">
<title>KPIs 3i and 3ii</title>
<p>Claimed and known campaign responses provide measures of those consumers who made a positive action towards booking a trip to Wales after being exposed to marketing material. In 2009, almost a third of campaign responders took action, a figure that rose to almost a half in the first 6 months of 2010. By segmenting the different campaign responders by the responses they took, Visit Wales can establish which media channels and which campaigns were most effective in converting a potential visitor into an actual visitor.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1356766711432225">
<title>KPI 4</title>
<p>This provides a measure of how a population feels about a destination – in other words, their emotional proximity to a place. Here, it is measured by scoring Wales and its key competitors out of 10. It provides a useful measure of how close respondents feel towards that destination and the aspirational value of a destination; it can be compared against other measures such as visitation and campaign awareness to more effectively understand those factors which improve perceptions of Wales. The key finding here is that loyal visitors to Wales are very emotionally close to Wales (scoring it 9 or 10 out of 10), whereas the GB population as a whole is less emotionally close (scoring it at 6.6 out of 10). This underlines the need for Visit Wales to focus its activities on building stronger emotional ties to the destination in order to generate more loyal consumers and more visits.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1356766711432225">
<title>KPI 5</title>
<p>This measure assesses whether people are interested in visiting Wales in the future. When respondents were asked how likely they are to visit the 10 destinations in the competitive set ‘at some point in the future’, Wales is ranked sixth; however, if they are asked about intentions to visit in the ‘next 12 months', Wales is ranked fourth. This has led Visit Wales's marketing teams to question whether the factors encouraging visits to Wales are more linked to proximity, familiarity, and convenience rather than aspiration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1356766711432225">
<title>KPI 6</title>
<p>This KPI combines the results of the previous KPIs to establish the proportion of individuals moving through the marketing funnel from awareness to advocacy. The findings from the first year of operation confirm Wales's position as one of the top four destinations in the British Isles and indicate that once on their consideration list it is very good at converting potential visitors into actual visitors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1356766711432225">
<title>KPI 7</title>
<p>This measures the expected value generated by respondents to Visit Wales's communications who attribute some of their decision to marketing activity. Using conversion-type calculations, the value of those deemed to be ‘known campaign enquirers' (those who requested a brochure, opened an email, visited the website, etc.) are compared with ‘claimed campaign enquirers' (GB population survey responders). Initial findings show that the number of claimed campaign enquirers is slightly higher than the known campaign enquirers. Claimed campaign awareness is a very new area for reporting and demonstrates the influence of campaigns in generating visitors to Wales among those who do not seek information or advice directly through Visit Wales. This includes those responders who were influenced by television campaigns to seek out information on other websites or to make bookings directly with the trade. This is a significant advance in terms of reporting the true value of marketing campaigns, and greater understanding of their wider influence on consumers will be crucial in justifying Visit Wales's role in enhancing and promoting the Wales brand.</p>

<title>The potential of the framework and future developments</title>
<p>The seven new KPIs serve as a series of indicators which both reflect and summarise the consumer journey from awareness to advocacy. At a strategic level, they are each an individual, understandable measure of campaign and brand performance, and at the planning level, they integrate to paint a picture of the effect of marketing interventions on different groups throughout the consumer journey. By comparison with the traditional KPIs, which they replaced, the new ones provide Visit Wales's marketing teams with a wealth of more nuanced and relevant information to evaluate the total reach and impact of their campaigns. In particular, integrating the campaign enquirer research and the tracking research has been immensely beneficial and addressed some of the information gaps identified by the original Visit Wales task force (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1356766711432225">Table 2</xref>). Similarly, the panel survey of GB residents is a powerful tool, which brings together the combined effect of Visit Wales's marketing campaigns; it is more effective than previous tracking studies as it attempts to identify the transition from destination awareness to booking action. It enables Visit Wales's marketing teams to more effectively assess marketing impact and to demonstrate the value of visitors who book directly with the industry as a direct result of Visit Wales's marketing. This will be increasingly important as marketing emphasis shifts from stimulating direct response towards driving awareness; the framework could for instance measure the effects and value of the Visit Wales's television campaign, although this level of detail has not yet been analysed.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most significant advantage of the new marketing evaluation framework is its ability to measure Wales's brand value in comparison to its key UK competitors. It is also now possible to have a holistic view of the impacts of different marketing activity, examine the overlap between the influences of campaigns, and reduce duplication of assessment in order to achieve a more accurate final additional value of each individual marketing campaign. Although it is not yet possible to present a great deal of detail on the level of referrals that were created from Visit Wales's marketing campaigns, marketing and research managers have been able to see how valuable word-of-mouth referrals are in the decision-making process; this will be further investigated, as will the effect of social media sites such as Facebook in driving awareness and referrals. Social media and Visit Wales's websites are now hugely significant players in the looking/booking process and in creating general awareness of destinations and individual businesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1356766711432225">Munro and Richards, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The tools used on the new Visit Wales intercept survey will be further refined to enable researchers to track where an individual web visitor has come from, that is, directly from an email sent by Visit Wales or other paid for responses. This will be used to further segment web traffic and to gain a better understanding of how the paid for online activity differs with those who visit the website through organic, natural web browsing and searches. In summary, the new marketing evaluation framework holds considerable potential for further applications and refinements. To date, while initial consumer action following campaign exposure has been the initial focus of evaluation, as this research develops it has the potential to assess the lifetime value of campaign responders and to provide understanding of the role campaigns play in maintaining repeat visitors as well as targeting new ones.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The creation and transfer of explicit knowledge is of crucial importance to the tourism industry’s ability to innovate and build competitive advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1356766711432225">Hjalager, 2002</xref>). At the same time, this capacity for innovation is dependent upon the ability of the main drivers of the knowledge-based economy (academia, industry, and government) to work collaboratively and share knowledge capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1356766711432225">Rod and Paliwoda, 2003</xref>). Ultimately, the effective development of tourism knowledge management facilitates the rise of the proactive learning destination, one which is prepared to take the initiative and commit resources to the creation of knowledge that is then utilised to effectively inform the development of policy and practice. Establishing a tourism knowledge community that includes both researchers and industry practitioners is a continuous challenge, which according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1356766711432225">Cooper (2006</xref>: 59) can be tackled by recognising the important role played by tacit knowledge in organisations, bridging the impasse between consultancy and academic research, recognising and overcoming the difficulty in knowledge transfer between the differing cultures of researchers and practitioners, and dismantling the real barriers of transferring research to operational adopters.</p>
<p>The collaboration between academe and industry, which resulted in this article, is an example of the application of knowledge management in tourism. In the article, we have seen how knowledge held within a single DMO (Visit Wales) was transformed through the process of knowledge sharing and scrutiny into a macro knowledge network encompassing the DMO and its stakeholders. With the writing of this article, however, that knowledge has become explicit knowledge available to all DMOs and now has the potential to inform marketing evaluation practise and the tourism marketing knowledgescape. In these financially straitened times, all DMOs face serious challenges – especially as a result of the digital revolution – and their cost, relevance, and value-for-money are coming under ever greater scrutiny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1356766711432225">Hildreth, 2011</xref>). DMOs are key actors in destination marketing, but their activities are threatened by the inadequacies of traditional marketing evaluation frameworks, which make it difficult for managers to demonstrate the consequences of reducing or increasing specific marketing budgets. The reality for DMOs is that place reputation is derived from a host of sources, of which tourism marketing is but one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1356766711432225">Kotler and Gertner, 2011</xref>). DMOs do not control the destination story or its image, and in our disintermediated world dominated by social media, it is the consumer who is increasingly shaping the brand and the media. Thus, while it has long been recognised that DMOs never controlled the destination product, it is increasingly clear that they can no longer even pretend to control the message (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1356766711432225">Epperson, 2009</xref>). This makes it even more vital that DMO managers are able to demonstrate the impact of their marketing interventions against a clear and communicable set of KPIs.</p>
<p>While a destination has a reputation whatever its DMO does, these organisations, their partners, and stakeholders can work to improve that reputation, build brand differentiation, and secure a competitive identity, especially if they shift their focus to promoting destination awareness and advocacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1356766711432225">Figure 2</xref>). In this sense, DMOs are less responsible for the <italic>management</italic> and more for the <italic>stewardship</italic> of destination reputations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1356766711432225">Morgan et al., 2011</xref>). But theirs is still a key role and not simply communicating with potential consumers but to the whole tourism system, establishing, nurturing, and servicing partnerships between stakeholders. In an ideal world, everything and everyone would be ‘on-brand’, but partnerships require encouragement and leadership. This is where the DMO comes into its own as the brand steward, leading, guiding, and coordinating the destination’s online and offline ‘critical promise points', all those interactions in the material and virtual world when the destination brand promise is encountered and evaluated by its key target markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1356766711432225">Baker, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The new marketing evaluation framework developed by Visit Wales has its limitations, and there are, as always, some practical difficulties, but it promises a more robust and sensitive series of measures to assess brand conversion, performance, and potential. Although its development demanded a break with existing widely used marketing evaluation practice, indications from its pilot year of operation suggest that it is an evaluation framework fit for the digital age. As a management tool, it will continue to be developed to add greater value to Visit Wales's marketing activity and to demonstrate its brand stewardship functions. Einstein has been attributed with the famous quotation, ‘Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted’. One of the lessons DMOs can learn from the explicit knowledge created in this article is that – just like Visit Wales – they are more likely to be able to demonstrate their effectiveness when they spend a greater portion of their initial resources establishing what <italic>should</italic> be counted and then a smaller portion of their subsequent resources counting it.</p>
