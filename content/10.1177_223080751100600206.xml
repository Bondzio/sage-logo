<p>Most of the studies on Islamism/political Islam/Islamic movement have been conducted on societies where Muslims are in majority. This attempt by Ahmed to enrich the debate from the site of Indian Muslims, one of the largest minority groups, should, therefore, be welcomed. Though Jamaat-e-Islami has little mass base among Muslims in India, its importance in sociopolitical dynamics of Muslim affairs in India and global discourse of Muslim politics cannot be undermined. Maulana Abul A’la Maududi (1903–79), the founder and ideologue of Jamaat, is one of the most influential Islamic thinkers in Islamic movement or <italic>Tehreek-e-Islami</italic> across the world.</p>
<p>Ahmed’s work, based on his doctoral thesis, charts the transformations of the Islamist movement, particularly those of Jamaat-e-Islami and Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI), in India, and its relationship with the secular democracy. The primary axis that Ahmed draws to map these transformations is that of ‘radicalisation’ and ‘moderation’. Where the former is seen as sharpening of the boundaries between Islam and its Other and hence becoming rigid and hostile to alternative perspectives, the latter is understood as opening the boundaries for alternative perspectives forming together two (ideal-type) templates. Traversing the distance between these two is claimed as transformation which is, a point that he continuously emphasises, not only tactical but also ideological. For him ‘transformations’ in the title stands mainly for two transformations—radicalisation of SIMI and moderation of Jamaat. The book makes a threefold argument. First, in the history of the Islamist movement in India, there has been a significant transformation not only at the level of practice but also at the level of ideology. Second, secular democracy, having a distinctive tradition in the subcontinent, played a key role in this transformation. Third, contemporaneous to the moderation of Jamaat is the radicalisation of SIMI which can be associated with the nature of secular democracy in India from the 1980s onwards.</p>
<p>In order to substantiate this argument, the book uses various kinds of documentary and ethnographic material from early days of Jamaat in 1940 to the recent past. It goes into Maududi’s writings starting from <italic>Tarjuman</italic> (a monthly that he edited and in which he articulated his initial ideas), his confrontations with the West, both at the level of ideas and institutions which connects to the much-discussed issue of Islam’s engagement with modernity or more broadly in ‘indigenous’ inhibitions to accept the Western secular. It takes into account Maududi’s criticism of what West considers as progress and his attempt to formulate an ideology having similar structure (Ahmed very convincingly contrasted Maududi’s ideological schema with that of Marxism to reveal the structural resonance) which would be total and systematic, taking into account not only the various faculties of life (Islam as a way of life), on the one hand, but also thoroughly grounded in the foundations of Islam. It goes on discussing how Maududi redrafted these foundations—by developing a methodology that works back and forth between Quran and contemporary conditions—in order to use them conveniently in his other writings on the political, social and economic issues. Ideology in Maududi’s writings is coupled in the book with the accounts of early formation of Jamaat in India to reveal other contents of it through an analysis of the practice. The book compares this ideological formulation with some of the recent developments for which Ahmed cites detailed account of the fieldwork he has done in Aligarh and Azamgarh.</p>
<p>The major elements of Islamism in India that Ahmed charts are education, engagement with electoral democracy and a stand on deploying Jihad as a means for ideological ends (associated with Jihad is also the problem of top-to-bottom vs bottom-up strategy). Ahmed tries to show that these elements have undergone significant changes and moderation. Maududi had major discontents with Western education. Jamaat, at the time of its formation, conducted experiments to evolve an alternative way of educating the future ‘Muslims’. Ahmed’s fieldwork in a school run by Jamaat in Aligarh gives a different picture. In striking contrast to the imagination with which it was initially established, it eventually got affiliated to the state body of education after many internal debates, changes occurred in the syllabus, the uniform, the mode of greeting, criteria for appointing teachers, the use of the school as ideological space and the appearance of photos of living beings in the textbooks. Similarly, whereas Jamaat had previously forbidden its cadres to participate in the elections as it considered it to be a part of idolatry system, it now actively foregrounds its stakes in the electoral democracy. The issue of participating in elections starkly divided the Jamaat members into two groups and was resolved through many heated debates into finally lifting the ban. The major factor for Ahmed behind this was the rejection of Jamaat’s ideology by larger Muslim public, especially other Muslim organisations like Jamiat-e-ulema Hind. After 1980s, when Hindutva forces became stronger Jamaat actively came in defence of secular parties. Jamaat’s stand on Jihad also underwent moderation coupled with its increasing emphasis on bottom-up strategy that envisages first to Islamise the society and then change the system to an Islamic one. Jamaat also gradually moved from ‘medieval duality’ of India being either <italic>dar al-Islam</italic> (abode of Islam) or <italic>dar al-kufr</italic> (abode of unbelief). SIMI, on the other hand, invoked jihad declaring India <italic>dar al-harb</italic> (abode of war) against the injustice, and this invocation became more radicalised in response to Hindutva. One wonders here how inclusion of other elements—<italic>dawah</italic> (proselytising<italic>), tarbiyah</italic> (training), social reform based on Islamic values, etc.—would have influenced conclusions of this research. <italic>Dawah</italic>, for example, has been given priority in almost every four-year plan—a separate department has been established for it, full- and part-time <italic>dawah</italic> activists have been trained, <italic>dawah</italic> cells function in most of the states with an emphasis on expanding its domain to tribal and Dalit populations, centres for training converted Muslims have been established.</p>
<p>Though the question whether moderation of Jamaat is tactical or ideological is relevant, it seems to be limited in capturing various textures of the transformations. The question has a particular genealogy in the case of Marxist movements when it was pitched in the form of reform vs revolution. I have three points to make here. First, the contest over radicalisation/moderation seems to be more relevant for the people inside the movement. In the discussions of the Central Advisory Committee (Shura), people resisted the change making similar arguments that it will be a compromise on ideology. I think such anthropological endeavour demands a larger question to understand this issue. Second, one has to take into account the relationship between means and end. Jamaat, for example, has made it clear from the very beginning that though its goals are ideological (unconstitutional?), its means will be through and through constitutional. If one reads it as a part of ideology, Jamaat selectively used some constitutionally permitted means in the beginning and is now using some other means while keeping the ends same, at least theoretically. Third, the object whose trajectory the book is charting seems to be constituted differently at different points of time. The book constitutes the moment, from where it is mapping the change, through writings of Maududi coupled with a few practical incidents after the formation of the Indian chapter of Jamaat. Secularism for Maududi was secularism as an idea in its classical sense (Maududi often quotes the Encyclopedia Britannica for making a point about secularism and other ‘Western’ ideas). Secularism, its Indian avatar that is, with which Jamaat has been engaging was not the object of reflection for Maududi, a point that Ahmed also seems to make. One has to ask what the methodological implications of comparing two such moments are. The book constructs and sustains a certain notion of Maudidi’s ‘Islamism’—an Islamism that is homogeneous, theoretically complete, unambiguous, consistent and somewhat static. It made the author’s work easy to demonstrate how contradictions in present ‘Islamist’ discourses and practices are moving away from it.</p>
<p>Rather than asking whether these transformations are tactical or ideological, a more productive question would be to ask about the shifts in the space within which the very question of transformation is being articulated. What do these shifts tell us about the nature of the Indian state (of course, secularism is a part of it), its relation to individuals and groups? How does a Muslim subject emerge in relation with the abstract notion of citizenship and influence it in return? How can one understand Jamaat’s transformation in relation with the negotiations with citizenship? Are these transformations specific to Jamaat or are they indicating towards the ways in which civil and political community is increasingly defined in India? Is Nehru’s ‘Indian secularism’ enough to lead to these changes or one has to take into account what colours groups, including Jamaat, have given to it to chalk out the space of contemporary politics?</p>
<p>I would like to emphasise something that is more general—emergence of a civic space which led to transformations, if one finds this term useful here, of not only Islamic movement but also in other movements—Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Marxist, etc. I doubt that the notion of ideology can give much opening to understand the changing nature of civic space. One can differentiate between two types of civic spaces—one constituted by protest politics and other by the politics of governance. Protest politics imagines state as the source of exploitation and injustice and sees no possibility of ‘liberation’ until what they call ‘structural transformation’ takes place. Various levels of society are considered to be parts of a single whole, a structure with a definite centre controlled by the ‘ruling ideology’ or ‘<italic>jahiliyah</italic>’ (in Jamaat’s parlance). Through violent or peaceful means it tries to dethrone the centre and restructure the society on an alternative scientific or true ideology. Of course there are many forms of ‘in-betweens’ that try to participate in and withdraw from the structure it is struggling with, to proceed towards its goal.</p>
<p>Contemporary emerging civic space is less constituted by politics of protest which tries to control sovereign power than by a kind of power that prefers art of government for administration of the population. What is at stake now is governing the subjects having many identities and coming from many locations. Secular democratic state does not sit above the population at the place which can be taken as the centre structuring the society. Rather it, as a relation of power, is dispersed and variously negotiated by the subjects at many levels. A politics in civic space tries to influence these negotiations by creating multiple points of action to penetrate in the logic of governance. Many instances of politics in this civic space can be considered. CPM’s (Communist Party [Marxist]) people’s campaign in Kerala in 1990s replaced its ideological category ‘class’ by ‘people’ to increase people’s participation in government. Jamaat launched its youth wing in Kerala, Solidarity, to articulate its politics in the same logic supporting ongoing people’s movement rather than working from a fixed ideological position. Clearly something more than ‘moderation’ is going on here. To be relevant in the changing civic space, Jamaat came up with newer programmes. It launched a civil rights organisation—Activists for Protection of Civil Rights, trained media personnel, came up with an ambitious project of humanitarian work, and now is launching a political party. RSS deploys similar modes with the aim to penetrate in the dispersed productions of power from multiple openings. Ahmed is right when he says that these changes in approach are not merely tactical but one has to go way beyond the ideology to locate these changes. Moreover, the state is seeking more and more participation from all kinds of groups to enlarge its domain of governance. In the case of Muslims, the state’s efforts after the Sachar Committee report to include more and more Muslim groups are unprecedented. I do not intend to say that these efforts are flawless, but what is to be noted is how the art of governance gives new definitions to the secular democracy.</p>
