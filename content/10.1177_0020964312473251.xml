<abstract>
<p>More than in other Hebrew writings, the enigmatic queries for origin, use, and theology of the small Book of Lamentations cannot easily be appeased. There are too many discrepancies in our literary, historical, and theological data of these five chapters of literature. Affinities with ancient Sumerian city laments as well as echoes of analogous experiences in modern experience open up new dimensions in the interpretation of Lamentations.</p>

<title>Difficulties</title>
<p>Ironically, a piece of the Hebrew Bible so neatly constructed, so poetically refined, and seemingly so transparent in its literary fiber is at the same time awfully renitent when determining its genre and use in real life. Sibylline answers given to painstaking inquiries oscillate between “artful poetry” and “efficient liturgy,” putting the five more-or-less acrostic chapters of Lamentations into the brackets either of pure literature in the modern sense to be savored by the wise and gifted, academic teachers, and students, or of mourning rituals performed during large commemorative popular festivals. The case for the first option can be argued on the basis of the artificial acrostic setup, as well as the lack of proper complaint elements (invocation, initial plea, affirmation of confidence, concrete petitions, vow, praise, etc., as in Psalms 44 and 89). Furthermore, there seems to linger around these texts—besides the shocks of traumatizing horrors—an air of reflection and rationalizing past experience better suited for intellectuals and academic circles than worshiping congregations. The other option leads into the communal world of regular mourning rites.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0020964312473251">1</xref></sup> The poems become elements of worship, and inopportune style and form are forgotten.</p>

<title>Sitz im Leben</title>
<p>It may be advisable, then, to discuss first some basics of the practical use of the five poems, before entering formal analyses. The attribution to the prophet Jeremiah, reluctant and lamenting commissioner of YHWH’s words (cf. Jer 15:10–21; 20:7, 18), seems to have been triggered by 2 Chron 35:25: “Jeremiah also uttered a lament for Josiah … recorded in the Laments.” Later Jewish and Christian interpretation stuck to this identification, leaving aside, however, the more general reference in that same verse to “male and female singers” (!) and the mourning customs in early Jewish communities (cf. also Zech 7:3; 8:19). Only the rise of “enlightened” critical scholarship in modern times cut the umbilical cord to the historical prophet for good, and also moved away from the date of Josiah’s death (609 <sc>b.c.e.</sc>). Instead, most specialists on the Book of Lamentations now consider it the work of various unknown poets (“singers”) who in retrospect wrestle with the dreadful collective memory of Jerusalem’s destruction and downfall in the wake of Babylonian conquest (597 to 587 <sc>b.c.e.</sc>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0020964312473251">2</xref></sup> Avoiding an exclusive focus on the siege and fall of Jerusalem, we may think of more general and long-ranging war experiences of ancient Near Eastern populations, which have been worked into poems of lament. Destructions and forced migrations, after all, were common throughout the history of that region.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0020964312473251">3</xref></sup> Development of trauma theories in recent years has fostered this kind of interpretation, which seems to be essentially correct. No matter what exact relationship may have existed between historical events, authors, and audiences, texts like Lamentations are never mere horror fiction or mythological imagination, but preserve in some way or another collective memories of “real,” man-made catastrophes. Such lamenting discourses, furthermore, should be considered as therapeutic means to overcome historical trauma, most probably in some ceremonial, commemorative practice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0020964312473251">4</xref></sup> Days of mourning and/or of victory celebrations until our own time serve the same functions. This should be the first insight to be gained from the texts. Closer analyses must follow.</p>

<title>Literary Forms and Structures</title>
<p>Studies of poetic and stylistic articulations in Lamentations are most important. Yet, they do not seem to lead very far, because they do not tell us the ways and locales of presentation.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Formally the five chapters share their predilection for the Hebrew alphabet: Lamentations 1 and 2 display 22 three-line units and Lamentations 4 an equal number of two line strophes which start out with subsequent letters. Lamentations 3 even has each individual score of its three-liners commence with the same character while Lamentations 5 contents itself by sticking to the mere number of 22 verses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0020964312473251">5</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This close entanglement with—perhaps a sort of addiction to—written media certainly points, in terms of authorship, to literary elites. But it does not preclude, in my opinion, communal use of the poems. Acrostic poems also loom fairly large in the Psalter (cf. Psalms 9/10; 25; 34; 37; 111; 112; 119; 145) and are common in ancient Near Eastern Wisdom literature. For more illumination of the mysteries involved, commentators have tried to identify speakers in the dramatic plot unfolding in Lamentations 1–5.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0020964312473251">6</xref></sup> On the whole, we meet five alternating voices: 1) a neutral speaker, mostly describing the sad state of conquered, maltreated, despised Jerusalem (cf. Lam 1:1–9; 2:1–10, 17–19; 4:1–16); 2) the desecrated “dame” Zion/Jerusalem herself<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0020964312473251">7</xref></sup>; 3) possibly God in person, deploring the misery of his “daughter” (cf. Lam 2:11–16)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0020964312473251">8</xref></sup>; 4) an individual supplicant (Lam 3:1–39, 49–66); and 5) a community or congregation, using the first person plural (cf. Lam 3:40–48; 4:17–20; 5:1–22). Some short quotations of still other “participants” may be left aside at this point. While each one of those voices demands comments, the communal “We,” it seems to me, is the most conspicuous and usually overlooked one. Possibly the author, speaker, or liturgist at given moments incorporates him- or herself into a real or imagined audience.</p>
<p>Even if the author did this only virtually, writing away at a desk and fancying a listening crowd, the fact in itself would be significant—the text of Lamentations did not come about without the real or ideal presence of community, more precisely, of a responsive congregation. In the Psalter, this phenomenon of “We” passages also has drawn scholarly attention.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0020964312473251">9</xref></sup> The numerous witnesses of ancient Near Eastern prayer ceremonies in the complaint and lamentation genres hardly provide any evidence that communal groups—whether ideal or real—by way of leading speakers or in common recitation/response took active part in religious ritual.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0020964312473251">10</xref></sup> This near-lack of “We” speech in religious literature among Israel’s neighbors certainly does not prove the absence of such patterns in real life, but it may testify to the fact that religious lay-organization on a communitarian basis has been a peculiarity in exilic/postexilic Israel. To our knowledge, the predominating way of organizing religious faith in Egypt and the ancient Near East was either in the realm of family- and clan-structures, or on an official state level. Both modes of organization offer little opportunity to use communal “We” discourse.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0020964312473251">11</xref></sup> A comparable structure of community life as found in exilic/post-exilic Israel may have existed in early Zoroastrian faith, extant in the oldest layers of the Avesta.</p>
<p>Returning to the Book of Lamentations, we may elaborate the evidence of “We” discourse by observing an interesting increase of first-person plural statements from Lamentations 3–5. The first incident of “We” speech (Lam 3:40–47) is inserted into an overwhelmingly clear-cut “complaint of the individual”—in terms of form-elements and general structure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0020964312473251">12</xref></sup> “Let us test and examine our ways, and return to Yahweh” (v. 40) abruptly opens the communitarian section (cf. Hos 6:1–3; Jer 9:18–20; 14:7–9; Isa 64:4–11; Ezra 9:6–15; Ps 106:6, 47, etc.). The very existence of the “We”-block apparently makes the whole chapter a “communal” voice, the predominant first person singular, then, representing the individual member of the congregation. That is to say, the community is speaking in the first person plural as in so many other Old Testament congregational laments and complaints. But the collective dimension also comes to the fore through the individual sufferer: “I am one who has seen affliction under the rod of God’s wrath . . .” (Lam 3:1). Every one of the afflicted community testifies to the common ordeal. The language is stereotyped, not specific to one exclusive situation, a truism for all laments and complaints, as well as for other prayers and liturgical pieces. But in the present context of “We” affirmations, the singular discourse clearly is embedded in community life becoming a communal lament. The same phenomenon transpires in Lamentations 4. The explicitly communal part of vv. 17–20 sets the parameter for the entire chapter, because first person plural discourse is the more unlikely, therefore more authentic, mode of speech revealing a social body of equals as the agents. Finally, Lamentations 5, from the first lines of invocation through lament and on to regular petition (vv. 21–22), features “We” speech throughout: “Remember, O Yahweh, what has befallen us . . .” (v. 1); “Restore us to yourself, O Yahweh, that we may be restored . . .” (v. 21). This chapter is obviously the final “song” or “prayer” in the series and beyond doubt betrays a congregational setting.</p>
<p>Grammatical and poetic devices (meter, strophes, alliteration, assonance, metaphors, etc.) are still being pondered in the exegesis of Lamentations together with structural, historical-critical, and literary analyses,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0020964312473251">13</xref></sup> to mention a few typical fields of research. The art of alphabetic and acrostic composition naturally is discussed in all recent studies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0020964312473251">14</xref></sup> Comparison with Akkadian sapiential literature is mandatory, but, as a rule, there are no social or liturgical consequences to be drawn from this artful design. The question of the <italic>qînâ</italic>-line has caught the attention of commentators ever since Marburg professor Karl Budde identified the 3 + 2 meter as a typical dirge-pattern.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0020964312473251">15</xref></sup> His thesis was almost universally accepted, with some adaptations along the way.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0020964312473251">16</xref></sup> Hedwig Jahnow links the “hobbling” meter with the mood of mourning: “The hopelessness of dirges was perfectly expressed by this irregular, limping rhythm sounding as if the female singer was unable to properly conclude the second part of the line because of her deep emotional involvement.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0020964312473251">17</xref></sup> The literary analysis of the individual chapters and in the book as a whole has been in vogue over the past decades. Literary critics from their estimation of the individual author lay open different layers of composition thus emphasizing originally independent sub-units.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0020964312473251">18</xref></sup> Structuralists, and poetologists, on the other hand, tend to discover important internal cohesions in individual chapters and in the book as a whole (inclusions, chiasms, concentricity, etc).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0020964312473251">19</xref></sup> The terminology of Lamentations is under constant scrutiny, in particular its metaphorical language of suffering and warfare. A special point of concern, also prompted by feminist readings of the Bible, is the figure of the lamenting “lady” or “daughter” Jerusalem and her progeny.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0020964312473251">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>In general, however, exegetes have shifted attention from small details of the composition to comprehensive literary themes, inherent ideas and mentalities, and, not to be underestimated, to spiritual values and theological concepts that can be connected to present-day thinking. As Adele Berlin puts it: “The focus now is on the broader aspects of the meaning of the whole rather than on its parts.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0020964312473251">21</xref></sup> She concentrates on three main concepts of Lamentations: “the paradigm of purity, the political paradigm, and the concept of mourning,” and to her, “the most central theme of Lamentations is mourning.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0020964312473251">22</xref></sup> Kathleen O’Connor stresses the poetic voices in Lamentations “bringing pain to speech”; they “are acts of survival; they express resistance to death and a resilient grasp on life.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0020964312473251">23</xref></sup> From here, she draws conclusions about the <italic>Sitz im Leben</italic> of the poems:
<disp-quote>
<p>I imagine the book as a public performance of speakers in which survivors stand up, each in turn, to tell of their particular pain and to demand God’s attention. Together the voices possess only the raw harmony of common wounds, even as they offer competing and irreconcilable opinions of the disaster.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0020964312473251">24</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Nancy C. Lee from the start of her doctoral work<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0020964312473251">25</xref></sup> has been thinking in broad terms of human suffering. In due course, she followed up her exegetical studies of Lamentations with a Society of Biblical Literature workgroup on “Ancient and Contemporary Cultural Contexts”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0020964312473251">26</xref></sup> and a moving anthology of the poetry of distress from around the world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0020964312473251">27</xref></sup> The vivid experience of recent Balkan wars and traditional Balkan oral poetry<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0020964312473251">28</xref></sup> led her to accent the strong popular affluents of unwritten laments eventually forming the Book of Lamentations. Female voices beyond that of “daughter Zion” are recognizable, she insists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0020964312473251">29</xref></sup> Carleen Mandolfo in her published dissertation<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0020964312473251">30</xref></sup> defends—on the basis of Mikhail Bakhtin’s linguistic theories—a “dialogic biblical theology”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0020964312473251">31</xref></sup> that counts on partnership with God and “makes demands on God” to the effect “that as surely as God authors us, we author God.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0020964312473251">32</xref></sup> In this fashion, the Book of Lamentations becomes a dissenting voice against prophetic condemnation of female Israel (cf. Hosea 1–3; Jeremiah 3; Ezekiel 16; 23). Now, in Lamentations, the congregation recovers its self-esteem, argues for God’s solidarity, leniency, and active support. An interesting variant of the “dissent” paradigm is Robert Williamson’s “Lament and the Arts of Resistance,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0020964312473251">33</xref></sup> building on James C. Scott’s distinction of “public” vs. “hidden” transcripts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0020964312473251">34</xref></sup> According to Williamson, Lam 5:22 is the outburst of a maltreated people contradicting “public transcripts” of submission and pretended harmony. But do the forms of collective complaint betray appeasing demeanor to begin with?</p>
<p>Given the large number of “holistic” interpretations of Lamentations, all aiming at making connections to our present world of pain and destruction, we rightly should marvel at the enduring dynamics of this age-old poetry. All the exemplary designs of a lasting lament tradition cited above laud its poetic achievement. In doing so, they acknowledge the origin and bearing of the written words in human experience. The connection of exegesis and theology with discomforting realities in and around our lives is a necessary one. It should include the awareness that much of traumatic suffering in antiquity was treated in communal ceremonies and rituals. A mere literary approach to Lamentations after all these incisive studies seems out of the question.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0020964312473251">
<title>Factual and Spiritual Issues</title>
<p>We may now try to undergird our proposition that Lamentations grew out of communal interaction with God, not primarily out of a poet’s endeavors to satisfy intellectual or aesthetic desires. Supportive evidence comes, perhaps, from different perspectives of investigation. Hermann Gunkel stressed that each genre presupposes a “common set of moods.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0020964312473251">35</xref></sup> Today, we may want to focus not so much on emotions but on agreed-upon “values, outlooks, mental and social patterns,” even “rituals” or the like, which make a given genre a recognizable, cohesive (oral or written) text. What, then, are these configurations of lament within the book? And are they compatible more with individual, communitarian, or state structures?</p>
<p>There is neither space nor time to take up all relevant items. We may concentrate on the central experience: that of physical violence, hunger, helplessness, forsakenness, etc., which the citizens of Jerusalem had to suffer at undetermined historical occasions. I repeat my contention that Lamentations does not exclusively relate to one determined defeat and sacking of the holy city, but to a cumulated ensemble of defeats and humiliations, sufferings, and frustrated hopes. In this context, hardships, misery, threatening death, with the seeming exception of Lamentations 3, are depicted in typical communal dimensions, not in the obligatory individual molds. To be more specific: “Woman” Jerusalem bewails the fate of her many “children” who fell in battle, were massacred by the invaders, or are starving to death in the aftermath of defeat. All the descriptions of violence and death relate in the first place to the group, not to individual agonies. They carry a certain statistic quality, not the horror of individual persons regardless whether standardized or not. A comparison with descriptive lament in individual complaints may immediately exhibit the difference: Psalms 22; 38; and 69 describe, although in stereotyped images, the personal suffering at the hand of brutal, unrelenting foes.</p>
<p>The enemies are crowds, too. Their disdain impacts the community as a whole, not as individual persons. Interestingly, not even the kings of Israel or Judah are mentioned by name in this cumulative lament.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0020964312473251">36</xref></sup> All citizens suffer the brunt of hostilities, repressions, and mockeries; leaders of the community being “elders,” “princes” (<italic>sarim</italic>), “counts” (<italic>nezirim</italic>), “priests,” and “prophets.” Allusions to their social ranking are vague; they have been debased.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0020964312473251">37</xref></sup> The sins, which have irritated YHWH, are the transgressions of the community, not of individuals, prominent as they once may have been. Petitions are not for the restoration of personal happiness, but for a functioning community. In short, the communal dimension prevails throughout all the chapters, even Lamentations 3. The “mood” or common sense in Lamentations is perfectly tied to an intermediate social organization (“congregation”? the terminology is missing!), not toward smaller or larger groupings. The catastrophes that hit the community are viewed and described from the outside, seemingly by eyewitnesses, sometimes personified as “virgin” or “mother” Zion/Jerusalem, in reality by the narrator or liturgist. Lamentations 3, the personal complaint of a sufferer, fits into the picture. As already indicated, the complaining “I” uses vocabulary and images of individual suffering to demonstrate human “affliction”: “He [God] has made my flesh and my skin waste away, and broken my bones . . .” (Lam 3:4, cf. Pss 22:15–16 [NRSV 14–15]; 38:6–8 [NRSV 5–7]). The sufferer, clearly a member of the congregation, takes on an almost vicarious or scapegoat role for his group: “I have become the laughingstock of all my people, the object of their taunt-songs all day long.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0020964312473251">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>It would be worthwhile to investigate related mental configurations like the concepts of locals (Zion; Jerusalem; foreign territory); history (former and actual state of affairs; transgression and punishment); social stratification; enemy constellations; etc. in order to detect specific community relations as juxtaposed to family or state organization. There is a great chance, in my opinion, that underlying orientations, i.e., patterns of thinking, evaluation, and worldview, point to that particular form of social life produced by a religious community occupying a sphere between family/clan and state organization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0020964312473251">39</xref></sup> The peculiarity of a faith organization, on the one hand, is its thoroughly spiritual dimension, and on the other, its non-political character.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0020964312473251">
<title>(Non-) Topics</title>
<p>Taking a look at the themes selected in Lamentations may supplement the investigation of “moods” and “configurations.” This traditio-historical perspective basically leads to far-reaching comparisons with Sumero-Akkadian lament literature, about which we cannot follow up at the moment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0020964312473251">40</xref></sup> But a glance at our text reveals a significant absence of military terminology and references. There are, to be sure, a few allusions to the defeat of the city’s own forces: “The Lord has rejected all my warriors in the midst of me, he proclaimed a time against me to crush my young men; the Lord has trodden as in a wine press the virgin daughter Judah” (Lam 1:15).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0020964312473251">41</xref></sup> But in general, lamenting goes on in civil ways—mother Jerusalem weeping over her children, the congregation describing its fate under foreign domination—thus, Lam 5:1–16, part of which runs like this:
<disp-quote>
<p>Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, our homes to aliens (v.2)</p>
<p>We have become orphans, fatherless; our mothers are like widows (v. 3)</p>
<p>We must pay for the water we drink; the wood we get must be bought (v. 4)</p>
<p>Our ancestors sinned; they are no more, and we bear their iniquities (v. 7)</p>
<p>Slaves rule over us; there is no one to deliver us from their hand (v. 8)</p>
<p>Our skin is black as an oven from the scorching heat of famine (v. 10)</p>
<p>Women are raped in Zion, virgins in the towns of Judah (v. 11)</p>
<p>Princes are hung up by their hands; no respect is shown to the elders (v. 12)</p>
<p>Young men are compelled to grind, and boys stagger under loads of wood (v. 13)</p>
<p>The old men have left the city gate, the young men their music … (v. 14)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The overall picture is that of a relatively small group of people, living in saddening conditions, but having no recollection of military triumph, pride in statehood and dynasty, power over neighboring peoples, etc. Even the deportations are not focused upon but mentioned in passing (cf. Lam 1:3.6–7, 18). For a contrast, we may compare the so-called victory songs (Judges 5; Psalms 18; 68; Isa 63:1–6) and even those collective laments, which seem to be closer to the times of monarchy (cf. Psalms 44; 89; 137).</p>
<p>We may follow a similar line of argument in regard to priestly influence on Lamentations. The topic of destroyed temple and destitute priests and prophets plays a large role in the book. Still, their importance is a long way off the central attention priests and purity receive in some sections of the Pentateuch. Confessions of sin do not loom large in Lamentations,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0020964312473251">42</xref></sup> and the few relevant passages do not spell out very clearly what the trespasses have been in the past. They seem to fall into Deuteronomic categories of disobedience rather than impurity (cf. Lam 1:8, 20; 3:42; 4:13) although <italic>torah</italic> is not explicitly mentioned except in Lam 2:9: “. . . her king and princes are among the nations; guidance [Hebrew: <italic>torah</italic>] is no more.” This fact brings to mind that Lamentations also does not give any hints as to the “classical” history of Israel with its God YHWH, as narrated in the Pentateuch or the histories of the monarchies, be they transmitted by Deuteronomists or Chroniclers.</p>
<p>All this means to say that the authors, transmitters, and users of the Book of Lamentations selected their own themes and materials in composing the extant texts. The five chapters concentrate on the deplorable destiny of the Jerusalem congregation after the Babylonian occupation (and in exile?), commemorating its downfall and pleading for mercy.</p>

<title>Core Theology and Community</title>
<p>It is my conviction that concepts of God—besides being results of traditional developments—also reflect in one way or another the social group and organization that bring about such theological ideas. Nomadic people, in fact, nurture different notions of the divinity than farming folks, citizens of urban centers believe in another way than villagers. Do the theological concepts in Lamentations reveal anything about the community we are trying to understand?</p>
<p>First of all, we may register those theological traits we do not find in Lamentations: YHWH here is not, as already pointed out, the God from Egypt, who liberated Israel out of bondage, gave it his ordinances, and led it into the promised land. Nor is this the God of Second Isaiah and the Babylonian congregation eagerly waiting for release from captivity. This is, most of all, the God who dwelled on Zion. Metaphorical discourse of marriage bonds between God and people (Hosea 1–3; Ezekiel 16; 23) may have had some impact on Lamentation’s theological ideas. God destroyed his temple and town, permitting his people to be shamed and taken captive.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0020964312473251">43</xref></sup> He has “poured out his wrath” (cf. Lam 4:11) over his community, utterly destroying it. YHWH himself is the agent of all evil, notwithstanding Jerusalem’s guilt that triggered the catastrophe: “From on high he sent fire . . . ” (Lam 1:13); “My transgressions were bound into a yoke. . . . They weigh on my neck. . . ” (Lam 1:14); “The Lord has trodden as in a wine press the virgin daughter Judah” (Lam 1:15; cf. 2:1–8). That enemies were involved in the downfall of the city does not counteract YHWH’s responsibility; on the contrary, it may be a synonymous expression of his brutal punishments (cf. Lam 2:17, 22).</p>
<p>Where is such a destructive Deity to be located? It certainly is not a concept of family religion we meet here. Isaiah 63:7–64:11 implores the furious deity by his familiar epithet “father” (63:16; 64:7) and by conjuring up the salvation history of Moses (63:7–14). In Psalm 44, it is the help that the people have received from God and his covenant with Israel that are the points of reference for complaint, reproach, and petition (cf. vv. 2–4, 18 [NRSV 1–3, 17). Not so in Lamentations. The concept of the furious deity punishing even his own clientele seems to be a general Mesopotamian concept extant in old city laments. There are no explicit theological configurations of alliances or generic affiliations between deity and people recognizable in Mesopotamian sources aside from the frequent claim that one determined god or goddess establishes a certain temple in a given city. Lamentations seems to presuppose, along this same line, a close (marital?) relationship of YHWH to Zion and Jerusalem, but nothing more. We have to learn, then, that Israel’s theological concepts were not uniform in the 6th to 4th centuries <sc>b.c.e.</sc> Lamentations does not draw on covenant theology nor on familial traditions to articulate its grave concerns over against the dreadful God of destruction. Therefore, the final verse, Lam 5:22, need not be a gross deviation from otherwise deferential attitudes over against YHWH. In the same vein, there is no refined theory of sin or repentance or perhaps impurity apparent in Lamentations, although such priestly or Deuteronomistic vocabulary does occur (for “sin,” cf. Lam 1:8, 14, 18; 3:42; 4:13, 22; 5:7; for “impurity,” Lam 1:9, 17; 3:45; 4:1, 14–15).</p>
<p>Secondly, the social structure of the community shines through here and there. The (Judean) king is gone (Lam 2:9, cf. vv. 2, 6). Present offices in the community include “princes” (<italic>sarim</italic>, Lam 1:6; 2:2, 9; 5:12), “prophets” (Lam 2:9, 14, 20; 4:13), “priests” (Lam 1:4, 19; 2:6, 20; 4:13, 16), and “elders” (Lam 1:19; 2:10, 21; 4:16; 5:12, 14). As <italic>sarim</italic> is a general expression for “leader” including community foremen, the terminology is not a royalist one. Rather, it betrays “civilian” traits: prophets and priests certainly belong to the pillars of the exilic/post-exilic congregation. And the “elders” fit into this spectrum (cf. Ezek 8:1, 11, 12; 14:1; 20:1). They became the most important lay instrument of community organization. Furthermore, the “people” visible in Lamentations are composed most of all of women (mothers) and children, some young females, a generic group of youngsters and elderly, with the men of valor killed in the war or deported and therefore all but missing (cf. Lam 1:15, 18; 2:21; 5:13, 14). Interestingly, some late texts of the Hebrew Bible stress the presence of women and children at Torah gatherings (cf. Neh 8:2; Deut 31:12–13; 2 Chron 34:30). So we are probably close to the first person plural voice in Lamentations indicating the contours of a religious community that wrestles with its patron God because of its dire situation of violence, hunger, discrimination, etc.</p>

<sec id="section7-0020964312473251">
<title>Practical Use and Place in Canon</title>
<p>The question of <italic>Sitz im Leben</italic> to my mind is of highest importance in biblical interpretation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0020964312473251">44</xref></sup> If we refrain from heeding it, Lamentations become a literary composition blown by the winds.</p>
<p>My general assumption is that most of biblical literature was composed or revised in the Persian period within the process of emerging Judaism. The community produced literary agendas for its various ceremonies. The material, collected into the Hebrew Canon, was part and parcel of worship services, festive celebrations, rites of passage, etc. The Canon was not created as a volume for private reading and individual edification. It came about as the book of a community of believers to be used in manifold communal rites and stayed on this track to our own days. That private reading became another option for encountering the Bible is due to various factors favoring the development of literary cultures.</p>
<p>In the case of Lamentations, we should certainly search for particular “communicative actions” or “special worship-rituals” that gave rise to such exquisite poetic texts. Fortunately, there are some traces of exilic/post-exilic mourning rites in Hebrew Scriptures. Psalm 137 mentions songs in memory of Jerusalem performed by exiles in Babylonia and denouncing the Edomites (v. 7; cf. Lam 4:21) who took part in the city’s sacking. Zechariah 7:2–7; 8:19 testify to yearly commemorations of the fall of Jerusalem. The question is raised: Should these days of mourning be continued or abolished, apparently in the light of the rebuilding of the temple (cf. Ezra 6:13–15)? Mourning in these instances goes hand in hand with fasting. Such ritualizations (implicitly a therapy against trauma suffered) seem to belong to the exilic and post-exilic period. To be sure, we do not have direct evidence for a linkage of Lamentations to those commemorations. Fasting and mourning rites are not referred to in Lamentations. But there is a certain plausibility for just this possibility. Lamentations and the fasting days of Zechariah belong into the same period; they both focus on the ill fate of Jerusalem, and they are in a broad stream of ancient Near Eastern mourning habits. Poetic artistry is no argument against the hypothesis, because public ritual certainly demands refined language.</p>
<p>The Book of Lamentations is an enigmatic pamphlet and offers sufficient points for discussion. In my view, it should be assessed primarily as a piece of liturgical art, originating in mourning rituals of old and being used to this day in synagogue worship for the Ninth of Av. The booklet has been a powerful mediator to understand modern collective trauma (and vice versa). Its position in the festive scroll of Megilloth has supported its ceremonial function, while the LXX (Septuagint)/Christian (Protestant) placement after the prophet Jeremiah fostered an individualistic and prophetic interpretation.</p>
