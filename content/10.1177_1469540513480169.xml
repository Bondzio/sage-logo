<abstract>
<p>Since the debut of the TV series <italic>Weeds</italic> in 2005, the cable network Showtime has developed a reputation for programming content based on the anti-heroine mother protagonist. This programming trend – which also includes <italic>The United States of Tara</italic>, <italic>Nurse Jackie</italic> and, most recently, <italic>The Big C</italic> – demonstrates the network’s success. In this way, Showtime pushes against the dominant trends of ‘quality television’s’ preference for male-centered programs (<italic>The Sopranos</italic>, <italic>The Wire</italic>, etc.) with narratives featuring middle-aged females and the contemporary issues that they face as women and mothers.</p>
<p>I use theorist Diane Negra’s notion of ‘time-anxiety’ trope in postfeminist representations of women, motherhood, consumerism and time. For Negra, the ‘time-anxiety’ trope is a marketing tool based on the biological categorization of essential female experiences, which include themes of motherhood, marriage and anti-aging. Turing to trade and magazine publications, I use the term ‘female problem’ to investigate Showtime’s programming and marketing based on female mental and physical illness and its relevance to a broader, postmodern female experience. Using <italic>The Big C</italic> as a case study, I am interested in the show’s depiction of cancer as a larger cultural metaphor for the failures of motherhood and anxieties around consumerism. At the same time, the show’s investment in female experience fails to account for female bodies that differ from the white, middle-class and youthful protagonist.</p>

<p>‘The world always looks brighter from behind a smile’, Cathy Jamison says in an ironic tone while addressing the audience. In the second season promotional advertisement for US premium cable channel Showtime and its show <italic>The Big C</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1469540513480169">Showtime, 2011)</xref>, actress Laura Linney plays a midlife woman who faces a stage 4 cancer diagnosis. The promo highlights the show’s premise of cancer comedy and the cultural ‘tyranny’ of happiness that often accompanies a cancer diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1469540513480169">King, 2006</xref>). The ‘tyranny’ of happiness refers to the larger cultural implications and attitudes toward cancer as part of an empowerment discourse that stresses positive thinking and support as a central component to survival. The rest of the promo features Cathy in a series of scenes that embrace the cable channel Showtime’s slogan ‘brace yourself’: she says ‘no’ to her doctor; receives a pink ‘bitch’ t-shirt, demands sex from her husband, and wields a paint gun. At the same time, the compilation addresses Cathy’s multiple roles as a wife, mother, friend and cancer patient that make up an emerging and changing postfeminist figure.</p>
<p>Since the debut of <italic>Weeds</italic> in 2005, the cable network Showtime has developed a reputation for programming content based on the anti-heroine mother protagonist. This programming trend – which also includes <italic>The United States of Tara</italic>, <italic>Nurse Jackie</italic>, and, most recently, <italic>The Big C –</italic> demonstrates the network’s investment in the quirky postfeminist figure. In this way, Showtime pushes against the dominant trends of ‘quality television’s’ preference for male-centered programs (<italic>The Sopranos</italic>, <italic>The Wire</italic>, etc.) by featuring middle-aged female-centered narratives and the contemporary issues that these characters face as women and mothers.</p>
<p>Showtime’s programming history has featured a mixture of adult content, boxing, movies and original programming. Beginning in the 1990s, Showtime began advancing its content boundaries by featuring gay and lesbian programming with shows such as <italic>Queer as Folk</italic> and <italic>The L Word</italic>. Showtime’s critical and popular success has long been positioned in second place to its premium cable rival HBO. The current President of Entertainment David Nevins explains Showtime’s success in terms of Emmy nominations and the inherent value that these awards hold in creating a network image that translates into a growing consumer base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1469540513480169">Carter, 2012</xref>). The critical response to <italic>The Big C’s</italic> first season reflected Showtime’s growing popularity and success as a premium cable channel that has cultivated a network image around taking risks with its programming content. The critical and popular success of <italic>Weeds</italic> measured in Emmy nominations and awards drew attention to the network’s rising aura of originality centered on the anti-heroine mother format. However, more than a few reviewers point to Showtime’s overused premise as a major critique of the show’s potential success and overall originality. Critic Brian Lowry from the trade journal <italic>Variety</italic> comments on Showtime’s programming trend featuring mothers with problems and Showtime’s cultivation of over-the-top female characters:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>The Big C</italic> too frequently falls into what has become a kind of Showtime trap that might be called ‘Weeds’ syndrome. Where beyond the [show’s] attention-getting premise (pot-peddling mom, multiple-personality mom, pill-popping nurse mom, now cancer mom), there’s a surplus of quirkiness for its own sake. (Lowry, 2010: 17)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Referring to Showtime’s original female-centric programming, the review calls attention to the network’s overused branding around the bad mother figure as part of a pathology within the programming that has become central to Showtime’s image. In a similar vein, <italic>New Yorker</italic> critic Nancy Franklin discusses the Showtime program as part of a larger ‘Showtime’ problem that involves the network’s freedom as a premium cable channel: ‘Plots take offbeat turns that lead into increasingly dull or absurd circles, or tonal shifts go much too far – or series last for a season or two longer than they should’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1469540513480169">Franklin, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Using <italic>The Big C</italic> as a case study, I propose that the show’s depiction of cancer is a larger cultural metaphor for the failures of a ‘perfect’ motherhood and anxieties around consumerism. However, Showtime’s reflection of postfeminist themes that include the anti-hero mother figure also highlight a deeper pathology with regards to postracial identities, disease and postfeminism. As I will discuss, Showtime’s pathological relationship with female bodies also suggests a female experience regarding race that is invoked while also being depoliticized. I draw on my own critically coined term ‘female problem’ that is reflected in trade and magazine reviews as both a theoretical tool and an object of study to investigate Showtime’s programming and marketing trends that feature female mental and physical illness and its relevance to a broader postfeminist experience. The term reflects my own and a larger critical engagement with Showtime’s branding around the anti-hero mother figure. ‘Female problem’ plays off various trade and magazine reviews that invoke this term by using similar expressions such as ‘ladies with problems’ shows and ‘Weeds syndrome’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1469540513480169">Fallon, 2010</xref>; Lowry, 2010).</p>
<sec id="sec1-1469540513480169"><title>The ‘female problem’ and quality TV</title>
<p>The historical scope of feminist criticism and television as a ‘legitimate’ object of study began with the re-evaluation of the soap opera genre beginning in the 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1469540513480169">Brunsdon et al., 1997</xref>). The study of soap opera opened up new discourses regarding gender, aesthetics, pleasure and female spectatorship as part of an emerging television criticism that had not previously focused on gender as a critical discourse. In a recent article, television scholar Michael <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1469540513480169">Kackman (2010)</xref> identifies the shortcomings of recent scholarship on quality television and the resurgence of formalist techniques that ignore a larger gendered history of television studies. Quality television debates in the USA have generally centered on premium cable channels and the their aesthetic similarities to art cinema. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1469540513480169">Kackman (2010)</xref> warns against the type of scholarship and discussion that is produced around quality television debates that reinforce television’s alliance with masculine-dominated tropes for legitimacy and evaluation at the cost of the medium’s roots in feminist media studies.</p>
<p>The ‘female problem’ genre is marketed as part of Showtime’s quality television programming. Critical and academic responses to quality television programming have centered on terms such as ‘value’, ‘high art’, ‘complex narrative structure’, star characters, and certain formal and aesthetic considerations to define ‘good’ programming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1469540513480169">McCabe and Akass, 2007</xref>). More often than not, the term ‘quality’ carries a certain set of power structures and hierarchies of taste that raise questions concerning who and what are the determiners of cultural taste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1469540513480169">McCabe and Akass</xref>, 2).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1469540513480169"><title>Quality disease TV: The Showtime pathology</title>
<p>The Showtime website promotes <italic>The Big C’s</italic> success as part of a larger industry legitimization of Showtime’s quality television and award-worthy programming. In competition with HBO, Showtime also constructs a network around cultivating and defining cultural taste. In the case of HBO, the network’s programming has often been praised by critics and theorists for its art-like status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1469540513480169">Anderson, 2008</xref>). HBO’s ‘quality’ brand is connected to the network’s status as a pay-cable channel. This status signals Showtime’s comparative level of freedom from broadcast television’s content restrictions as a premium cable channel and its ability to show graphic sex, violence and use of profanity as part of the network’s cultivation of edgy content and cultural taste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1469540513480169">McCabe and Akass, 2008</xref>). Showtime’s formation of a network identity and departure from HBO is exemplified in the reconfiguration of the sitcom and drama into the half-hour dramedy format, the ability to attract ‘brand-name leads’, and to market its product beyond the boundaries of acceptable network television content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1469540513480169">Wallenstein, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1469540513480169">Showtime’s 2011</xref> network slogan illustrates its successful brand format by focusing on the keywords ‘bold, brilliant and brave’. Literally, Showtime demands that its viewers brace themselves, which is displayed in their network slogan and promotional commercial featuring various Showtime ‘brand actors’ (Laura Linney, William H. Macy, David Duchovny), who cannot keep their balance and continuously fall over in slow motion. Showtime markets its male and female anti-heroes as part of a collective network image. Much of Showtime’s success is attributed to the network’s former president of entertainment Robert Greenblatt. Greenblatt’s background at HBO and work on the critically acclaimed series <italic>Six Feet Under</italic> has drawn attention to his move to Showtime by reinforcing his relationship to his past work on a premium cable channel and his own reinvention of HBO’s quality television strategy for the Showtime network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1469540513480169">Wallenstein 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1469540513480169"><title>Time anxiety and the ‘female problem’</title>
<p><italic>The Big C</italic> does not overtly attempt to be a ‘postfeminist’ text; however, it engages with elements of postfeminism and ambiguities of female empowerment, disease and consumerism. For a number of critics and scholars, postfeminism is more closely aligned with neoliberalism and free market ideology than with an activist feminist politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1469540513480169">Douglas, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1469540513480169">McRobbie, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1469540513480169">Negra, 2009</xref>).These scholars position postfeminism as part of a larger post-Civil Rights pop cultural, economic and social, discourse in which feminist politics are simultaneously acknowledged and silenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1469540513480169">McRobbie, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1469540513480169">Tasker and Negra, 2007</xref>). The cultural manifestations of postfeminism feature a complicated mix of feminist influences alongside repackaged images of patriarchy and sexism that are recoded into mainstream culture as silly, ironic and antifeminist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1469540513480169">Douglas, 2010</xref>). Theorist Angela <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1469540513480169">McRobbie’s (2007)</xref> notion of ‘feminism taken into account’ offers an additional framework to better understand an emerging and changing postfeminist discourse that both acknowledges a feminist history and renders it redundant and outdated.</p>
<p>The relationship between postfeminism and consumer culture plays an important role in reflecting how certain elements of feminism have been taken into account in popular discourses. Theorist Diane Negra addresses the major components of postfeminism when she argues that the postfeminist woman must confront a ‘distinct preoccupation with the temporal’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1469540513480169">Negra, 2009</xref>: 48). For Negra, postfeminist ‘time-anxiety’ is defined by how media manufactures images of women that are represented by ‘life stages’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1469540513480169">Negra, 2009</xref>: 47). What is crucial for Negra’s assessment of postfeminism’s obsession with time-anxiety is the larger media preoccupation with the ‘feminization’ of time as a way to address problems with aging, the biological clock, dieting and an investment in one’s self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1469540513480169">Negra, 2009</xref>: 48). Negra looks at a variety of media texts that depict privileged life-cycle experiences and feminine ‘rituals’ such as bridal culture, cultural oppositions between the successful career woman and the housewife, and the figure of the ‘good’ woman who returns home to celebrate her ‘choice’ to be a good mother figure.</p>
<p>To understand Showtime’s relationship to postfeminism programming, I turn to the critical cultivation of this term in the trade and popular press to better understand how postfeminism operates as part of a collective lifestyle narrative, but also how this term activates a discussion on gender and television. I use the term ‘female problem’ as a way to critically address trade journals’ and magazines’ responses to Showtime’s female-centered programming. It is a contradictory term that not only conjures up stereotypical images and depictions of Cosmo-girl culture and female empowerment (the ‘girlfriend experience’), but is also useful as a tool with which to reflect on the industry’s way of framing Showtime’s female-centered programming as part of a larger, collective postfeminist experience.</p>
<p>In her review of several recent Showtime series (<italic>United States of Tara</italic> and <italic>Weeds</italic>), critic Emily Nussbaum articulates the network’s ‘borderline personalities’ in relation to the female problem premise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1469540513480169">Nussbaum, 2009</xref>: 58–59). The article emphasizes a pathology inherent in Showtime’s original programming format, which compares Showtime to its premium cable competitor HBO. The comparison between Showtime and HBO focuses on quality TV characteristics and a gendered framework that is attached to Showtime’s female programming:<disp-quote>
<p>‘When HBO series fail, it’s most often because they are too ambitious – pretentious, arty, overreaching. For all the good writing and fabulous actresses, at their worst, Showtime can make you feel like a sucker or a cynic, someone who longed for the girlfriend experience and found instead a bag of practiced tricks. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1469540513480169">Nussbaum, 2009</xref>: 58–59).</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>HBO series fail due to a pretentious format. However, when Showtime fails as a format it is due to an experiment in exploring female relationships and a premise based on over-used, cliché narrative devices. Nussbaum describes the ‘girlfriend experience’ by looking at Showtime’s ‘fascination with femininity as a vaudeville act – a daffy exhibition of artificial selves’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1469540513480169">Nussbaum, 2009</xref>: 58–59). Nussbaum’s assessment of Showtime’s ‘mothers with problems’ premise illustrates Judith Butler’s notion of gender as a ‘stylized repetition of acts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1469540513480169">Butler, 1990</xref>: 191). In other words, the ‘girlfriend experience’ entails an inscribed performance of femininity, or as writer/creator Diablo Cody has expressed: ‘It’s about the ways a woman has to alter her personality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1469540513480169">Chozick, 2010</xref>). It is important to note that Nussbaum’s assessment is of Toni Collette’s role in the Showtime program <italic>The United States of Tara</italic>. This particular show features a woman with multiple-personality disorder and the types of identities and subjects she occupies and constructs when she experiences an alter character take-over (a male Vietnam War veteran named ‘Buck’, an animal child, a 1950s housewife, etc.). I draw attention to Nussbaum’s assessment of Showtime and her use of the term ‘girlfriend experience’ as a way to further illustrate the critical discourse that centers on Showtime’s engagement with women’s issues and constructions of femininities. Similar to Lowry’s critique of <italic>The Big C</italic> and Showtime’s larger ‘Weed’s Syndrome,’ Nussbaum’s engagement with Showtime’s female-centered narratives invokes the larger ‘female problem’ discussion that emerges in classifying Showtime’s programming and the network’s potential for failure with audiences and critics by applying an overused premise.</p>
<p>The larger umbrella term ‘female problem’ invokes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1469540513480169">McRobbie’s (2007)</xref> discussion of postfeminism’s ‘double entanglement,’ in which these female-centered shows can and do invoke a feminist experience and female empowerment while also dismantling feminism. Showtime’s use of the ‘female problem’ formula as part of their branding as a premium cable channel speaks to this entanglement with the network’s representation of strong female characters who encompass conflicting definitions of femininity and feminism. The invocation of this term also suggests a more complex analysis of the critical response to the show, the gendering of the Showtime brand, and a larger history in which women and disease have been at the core of a female television history.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1469540513480169"><title>The historical ‘female problem’</title>
<p>The pathological relationship between Showtime’s female protagonists and their fragmented lives as women with problems also points to representations of mothers within a feminist and prefeminist televisual historical discourse. Feminism’s relationship to television as an object of study is invested in a long representational and critical history that formed central questions around the legitimacy of gender and television studies. The soap opera, melodrama and sitcom genres have all been integral in featuring women’s roles as housewife figures, action stars, and single women who at times reflect the progression of the feminist movement, and at other times, embody the tension between mainstream media and second wave feminism. As part of the prefeminist era, 1950s and 1960s television shows such as <italic>I Love Lucy</italic> (1951–57) helped provide an alternative image to the traditional American housewife. Lucy engaged in a physical comedy and more general rebellion of masculine authority that challenged traditional notions of 1950s femininity. At the same time, critics point to similar housewife and family shows during this period like <italic>Leave it to Beaver</italic> (1957–63) and <italic>Father Knows Best</italic> (1954–60), which transitioned from the physically rebellious woman to the happy housewife figure as part of a cycle of female containment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1469540513480169">Mellencamp, 1997</xref>). Certain genres like the domestic sitcom integrated fantasy during the 1960s and 1970s as another way to represent gender and familial roles for female characters. A show such as ABC’s <italic>Bewitched</italic> (1964–72<italic>)</italic> often operated as a subversive text that engaged with supernatural female figures – the magical housewife witch and mother – within a 1960s cultural landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1469540513480169">Douglas, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1469540513480169">Spigel, 2001</xref>). The rebellious housewife and mother figure came into the broadcast sitcom world again with <italic>Roseanne</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1469540513480169">Rowe, 1997</xref>), who pushed the intersections between class and the role of the mother in a working-class family.</p>
<p>Certainly Showtime’s ‘female problem’ campaign illustrates a different set of issues related to a postfeminist experience of fragmented lives, especially in representing the anti-heroine mother and problems that go beyond the scope of the immediate domestic sphere. Much of Showtime’s marketing for <italic>Weeds</italic> and <italic>The Big C</italic> and the more general ‘female problem’ formula indicate the network’s recognition and invocation of the historically rebellious TV sitcom mother and housewife figure. Both Cathy and Nancy also challenge the postfeminist ideal of perfect motherhood and other dominant representations of the midlife female. However, by being non-normative and failed examples of postfeminist mothers, both characters also reflect the tension between feminist and antifeminist discourses.</p>
<p>As postfeminist subjects, both women seem to question the ‘have it all’ catchphrase that has defined earlier definitions of postfeminism and women’s roles within the public and private spheres as perfect embodiments of wives, mothers and representations of femininity. They are involved in relationships (Cathy is married) and have children, and for the most part have enough money and economic sense to afford a relatively affluent middle-class lifestyle. The ‘bring it on’ slogan for the second season promo for <italic>The Big C</italic> and the seventh season of <italic>Weeds</italic> goes further to illustrate a female empowerment theme at the center of Showtime’s postfeminist branding. The slogan conjures up the title of the playful girlhood teen cheerleading film featuring Kristen Dunst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1469540513480169">Reed, 2000</xref>). Rather than invoking the past of white-picket-fence sitcom motherhood, the promo cuts together different scenes of the two female characters in their respective worlds as mothers dealing with problems. It features Nancy’s trip to New York, her trip to jail, and her family’s life in the business of selling drugs. These scenes are juxtaposed with Cathy’s increasingly off-beat state as a cancer patient, in which she demands more life and embraces it by receiving a ‘bitch’ t-shirt from another character. The promo features both women’s physicality and aggression in calling out their children and husbands and breaking domestic objects. The children are literally juvenile delinquents (as in the case of <italic>Weeds</italic>). The ‘female problem’ premise illustrates a historically marked pathological female who must face a set of contemporary problems and choices that appear to naturalize and celebrate the genre and character’s anti-hero tendencies. In other words, the ‘female problem’ illustrates a larger spectrum of current female identity and lifestyle debates that is part of a postfeminist discussion of ‘feminism taken into account’. In a certain sense these mothers represent feminist strands as active protagonists who challenge the family institution; however, as much as these women are the anti-June Cleavers (<italic>Leave it to Beaver</italic>) of the world, the commodification of this genre as ‘ironic’ and ‘quirky’ also brings into question the subversive elements of these anti-heroines.</p>
<p>The ‘female-problem’ marketing campaign is part of Showtime’s show-to-show advertising. More specifically, we see this ‘female problem’ marketing mapped onto Laura Linney’s role in <italic>The Big C</italic> and Mary-Louise Parker’s role in <italic>Weeds</italic>. The female problem premise and Showtime’s marketing campaign engage with a feminist ideal that appears to be ironically invoked while also outdated. In the <italic>Big C</italic>’s first season promo, the relationship between the two female characters exemplifies the ‘girlfriend experience’ as part of a postfeminist discourse. The two women and their shows are shown as interacting within a larger Showtime universe. The promo features a banjo-themed musical score taken from the 1972 film <italic>Deliverance</italic>. The two women are divided by a white picket fence: on one side is Laura Linney in her representative suburban Midwest world of green grass and bright colors; on the other side is Mary-Louise Parker in her short shorts and faded desert home. Meeting at the fence, both characters recite a laundry list of problems to each other in an attempt to ‘outproblem’ the other woman. After stating their frustrations with their children, husbands and current lives, the two women are made to understand their bond with each another. In unison, Laura Linney and Mary-Louise Parker claim: ‘You get me.’ The two women solidify their sisterhood and marketing bond as mothers with problems. Both women are coded as heterosexually attractive and youthful for the 40-plus age demographic. The characters are different from their historical sitcom mother antecedents such as June Cleaver, Lucy, Alice Kramden (<italic>The Honeymooners</italic>), or even Roseanne. The promo visually references the 1950s American sitcom’s prefeminist housewife figure, who is represented by the divided white picket fence; however, these Showtime mothers are not perfect by any standard, and are presented as not having it all and having to make tough decisions and choices for their families and lives.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1469540513480169"><title>Quality disease TV</title>
<p>The obvious marketing relationship between the two shows is reiterated in a recent <italic>Variety</italic> article, ‘Prognosis Good for Showtime Pair’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469540513480169"><italic>Variety</italic>, 2010a</xref>). Besides playing upon the language of health discourses, the article argues that both shows’ success is due to the female-centered problem genre of the Showtime brand. <italic>The Big C</italic>’s more recent success is exemplified in not only representing the brand formula, but also elevating the brand alongside the cultural currency of the ‘cancer’ experience. The article’s opening line claims, ‘Cancer has been a boon to Showtime’s health’(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469540513480169"><italic>Variety,</italic> 2010a</xref>: 4). The article plays with Showtime’s risky and topical content by highlighting cancer’s ability to generate a major success for the network and its signature female-problem-centered format. In positioning the two shows in a back-to-back lineup, highlighting ‘moms dealing with difficult personal issues’, the female problem genre’s success is measured in viewership and profitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1469540513480169"><italic>Variety,</italic> 2010b</xref>). In both Showtime’s marketing and the viewer’s reception of the network’s female-driven stories, the ‘health’ of the Showtime network is entangled in depicting disease as the ultimate postfeminist product.</p>
<p>In Samantha <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1469540513480169">King’s most recent book <italic>Pink Ribbons, Inc.</italic> (2006)</xref>, she explores the embedded relationship among philanthropy, corporate interests and models of citizenship that have come to define breast cancer culture. The language describing the ‘cancer survivor’ becomes an important development in King’s linking of neoliberal consumption and subjecthood at the center of reimagining the ‘empowered patient’(2006: xxxii). As part of Showtime’s illness branding and cultivation of value, the premise of the ‘cancer experience’ reflects an embedded relationship between consumerism and philanthropy interests that extend the network’s investment in building its subscription base that reinforces Showtime’s cultural goodwill in embracing cancer survivorship and viewer support. By participating in online and social networking fundraisers with cancer organizations such as the Skin Care Foundation and the American Cancer Society, as well as gaining prestige and recognition in Hollywood via award ceremonies specifically targeting shows that focus on social issues, Showtime further combines and encourages the viewer’s active role in fighting cancer and bringing both the network and the disease more attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1469540513480169"><italic>Variety,</italic> 2011</xref>). The show itself departs from a stigmatized representation of cancer and therapeutic narratives that surround the disease. <italic>The Big C</italic> narrative allows for Cathy to reject her support group and the more typically represented institutions and images surrounding support group cancer culture. In interviews for the show, executive producer Jenny Hicks has described the <italic>Big C</italic> as a show not about cancer but ‘a show about mortality, about living and dying and the choices you make’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469540513480169">Halterman, 2011</xref>). However, as part of <italic>The Big C’s</italic> cancer marketing promo, Showtime participated in a cancer fundraiser specifically linked to the number of views that <italic>TheBig C</italic> promo received. This promotional stunt further reveals Showtime’s participation within a ‘consumer-citizen’ rhetoric that encourages private citizen interest in the representation of donations, while at the same time using the cancer narrative as a way to gain network capital via viewers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1469540513480169">King, 2006</xref>: 38). The discussion on consumerism, citizenship and corporate sponsorship, and the marketing link between Showtime and The American Cancer Society reveal a certain type of active citizen-viewer who, by watching <italic>The Big C</italic> can create a ‘world with less cancer and more birthdays’(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1469540513480169">Look to the Stars, 2010</xref>). The complex affiliation between Showtime’s marketing, the representation of postfeminism and cancer within in a larger cancer culture signals the deeper contradictions that arise between the marketing and representation of cancer, and the cultural currency of the cancer narrative in legitimizing and marking the Showtime brand as participatory in a larger collective cancer life.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1469540513480169"><title>Postfeminism and cancer</title>
<p>‘Is melanoma suddenly everywhere?’ asks an online reviewer responding to a critic preview of the Showtime show <italic>The Big C</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1469540513480169">Orr, 2011</xref>). The reviewer opens up a larger question of disease and the cultural currency of cancer across popular media formats. In a glossy billboard advertisement for Showtime’s newest programming addition, <italic>The Big C</italic>, actress Laura Linney, who plays Cathy Jamison, is shown lounging in high heels and a dress, trapped within an hourglass. The caption next to the image reads, ‘Grabbing life by the balls… <italic>The Big C</italic>… a new series about living… with cancer.’ The image and the tagline suggest the show’s investment in an empowered female cancer experience.</p>
<p>The show structures Cathy’s cancer narrative within a framework that highlights the temporal anxiety of dying alongside her desperate attempts at enjoying life. According to Negra’s ‘time-anxiety’ trope, the dying mother narrative is a popular genre in both literature and film that uses an extreme temporal crisis as a defining motif to construct the mother figure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1469540513480169">Negra, 2009</xref>). Cathy’s terminal cancer diagnosis becomes the main narrative focus of the show. Cathy is ‘empowered’ because she chooses to keep her diagnosis a secret from her friends and family, which allows for her to explore an emotionally liberating experience of selfhood. She does not openly address her cancer diagnosis with her family until the ninth episode. However, as much as the narrative focuses on Cathy’s empowerment, this secrecy trope also allows for Cathy’s life, including her marriage and role as a mother to unravel.</p>
<p>In Cathy’s search for selfhood, the show emphasizes a series of destructive or ‘bad’ behaviors (improper diet, extra-marital affair, smoking, drinking, speaking her mind) as part of Cathy’s newly acquired lifestyle. A significant component to Cathy’s lifestyle change is the larger paradox surrounding the physicality of the cancer experience and the preservation of Cathy’s ‘ideal’ body. Facing her own ‘time-anxiety’ as a stage 4-melanoma patient, Cathy participates in consumer culture, whereby she eats desserts and liquor for dinner, while maintaining her ‘ideal’ figure and status of attraction to the male gaze. After the doctor’s diagnosis, Cathy reveals her desire to forgo chemotherapy treatment. Playfully, she asserts that she wants to keep her hair, but would gladly get rid of her current nose. While visiting with her doctor, she activates a medical discourse on cancer bodies that fuses Cathy’s sick body with a postfeminist beautiful and ageless body. Cathy playfully refers to her breasts as a ‘rack’ and insists upon the younger male doctor’s evaluation of her figure. The scene acknowledges a history of doctor–patient relationships and the objectification of female bodies. At the same time, the scene allows for Cathy to knowingly choose to be looked at by her male physician (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1469540513480169">McRobbie, 2007</xref>: 32–33). ‘You can’t hurt my feelings’, Cathy quips while revealing her naked body and breasts to her doctor. Cathy’s active participation in the revelation of her cancer patient and feminine body participates in McRobbie’s notion of ‘feminism taken into account’ (2007: 33). Cathy uses ‘rack’ in a way that suggests a certain irony in her exploitation as a woman. Cathy can say ‘rack’ to her younger male doctor not only because she is in on the joke, but also because she has cancer, which thereby allows Cathy to do and say whatever she wants. Cathy is empowered by choosing to put her body on display; however, a major part of her ironic empowerment involves a critical male gaze that reaffirms Cathy as an idealized, ageless and heterosexually attractive object.</p>
<p>Cathy’s cancer experience reiterates her preoccupation with an ideal feminine and anti-aging body that has become a prevalent postfeminist trope. Theorist Susan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1469540513480169">Bordo (1993)</xref> highlights this manufacturing of the ideal female body when discussing the mass marketing of anti-aging trends that are presented as empowering for women while part of a larger consumer discourse. As much as Cathy reveals and ‘accepts’ her body as middle aged throughout the show, she also constructs her femininity around anti-aging regimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1469540513480169">Negra, 2009</xref>). There is a temporal impossibility in Cathy’s body that is presented in a way that is ‘given’ and perfectly preserved. She is thin, in shape and, despite her ‘bad’ newly acquired smoking and eating desserts habits, her body never changes or gets tired beyond slight skin rashes due to her melanoma. In the second season, Cathy begins her medical trials and the only visible physical effect the show focuses on is her brittle fingernails. She is never allowed to unravel or to physically deteriorate. In fact, the show reinforces her preservation a step further in season 3 by having her cancer go into remission. Her body is presented as a ‘natural’ and age-appropriate feminine body that is untouched by cosmetic surgery and botox, but also a body that is still ‘above average’ in its state of ideal femininity.</p>
<p>Cathy’s search for selfhood and cancer empowerment are further emphasized in Cathy’s physically fit body that structures the second season. Cathy’s impromptu decision in the second season to run a marathon becomes a major obstacle and aspirational event that propels Cathy to refocus her lifestyle priorities by racing for her dead friend Lee. Theorist Samantha <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1469540513480169">King (2006)</xref> discusses the role of ‘Cancer thons’ as part of a major philanthropic, corporate and self-help event in raising awareness for cancer-related cures and survivorship while making the politics of these intersecting interests and organizations more problematic. The marathon serves the storyline in the second season as more of a symbolic function in Cathy’s fight to stay alive. The actual marathon highlights Cathy’s struggle to make it to the finish line – she has never run a marathon in her life, but she is still able to do it despite her doctor’s and family’s concerns. The marathon plays into a lifestyle narrative that emphasizes Cathy’s postfeminist bootstrap empowerment – she is a ‘tough bitch’ just like her t-shirt says. The marathon reveals Cathy’s own body awakening and ability to push herself to the extreme despite warnings and no proper training.</p>

<sec id="sec7-1469540513480169"><title>The ‘blind side’ effect: Postracial irony</title>
<p><italic>The Big C</italic>’s ‘female problem’ up until this point has focused more closely on the dominant postfeminist framework for the white, upper-middle-class female figure; however, a crucial component to <italic>The Big C</italic>’s exploration of bodies and disease reflects a larger tension between representations of race and irony and how irony works in a similar vein to create distance between the political history and representations of black bodies. A major component to Cathy’s cancer diagnosis is the relationship she forms with her overweight student Andrea, played by African-American actress Gabourey Sidibe. As much as the show openly mocks and rejects therapeutic narratives and support groups surrounding cancer culture while simultaneously promoting a larger cancer marketing scheme, the show allows for Cathy’s newfound freedom to take form in an individualized project of body ‘improvement’ by helping her student lose weight.</p>
<p>As part of the show’s ‘ironic’ commentary on cancer and other identity-based politics, <italic>The Big C</italic> engages in a postracial discourse that pokes fun at Cathy’s relationship with Andrea while allowing for Cathy to grow as a character. Andrea becomes the wisecracking sidekick who is framed by her body size, overt sexuality and outspoken relationship with Cathy and her cancer diagnosis. Media theorist Sarah Banet-Weiser discusses postracism in a similar vein to McRobbie’s notion of postfeminism by turning to discourses on consumerism and neoliberalism (2007). For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1469540513480169">Banet-Weiser (2007</xref>: 204), the ‘undoing of feminism’ is in conversation with a commodification of race and ethnicity that raises the specter of the USA’s racist historical past that is seen as outdated. In the first episode, Cathy critically calls attention to Andrea’s ‘fat’ body by sarcastically commenting upon Andrea’s ‘mean’ pathological behavior as not a ‘correct’ correlation to her body size. Cathy states, ‘You cannot be fat and mean. Fat people are jolly for a reason. Fat repels people… you can either be fat and jolly or a skinny bitch.’ Later on in the same episode, Cathy decides to help Andrea lose weight through monetary motivation ($100 for every one pound lost). By drawing attention to the show’s critique of self-help narratives, which also include stereotypical projects by the white protagonist who saves the other (in this case the African-American student), the show emphasizes its own critique of the ‘blind side’ fantasy. At one point, Andrea’s character knowingly remarks on Cathy’s attempts to help her by invoking the recent Sandra Bullock film and larger historical narrative of the white woman saving the African-American child. The second season of the <italic>Big C</italic> features a certain un-ironic ‘blind side’ narrative in which Andrea’s character moves in with Cathy’s family to finish her high school program. Andrea’s character operates within a larger postracial discourse that celebrates African-American representation within a post-racist society; however, the show never allows for a deeper exploration of issues of obesity and body size that are embedded into problematic narratives of consumerism and the control of non-white bodies. Rather, this ambivalence towards the ‘blind side’ narrative brings up larger questions of irony and ‘quirkiness’ that define postfemenism’s entanglement in rending certain racial and sexual histories obsolete.</p>
<p>A recent blog post entitled ‘The Big C: So This is Liberating?’ by GlobalComment feature writer Allison McCarthy similarly notes the show’s ‘body policing’ project. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1469540513480169">McCarthy (2010)</xref> notes that Andrea’s body is punished for falling outside the postfeminist body standard of thin, white femininity. Andrea’s body becomes a policed project, in which Andrea undergoes weekly weigh-ins while being paid for her weight-loss progress. The disciplining and surveillance of Andrea’s body for being African-American and overweight connects to the show’s engagement of disease and identity politics. Even though the show takes into account Andrea’s racialized body, her relationship with Cathy is made visible by its non-normalcy and celebration of difference that fits in with Cathy’s larger cancer narrative. Cancer is the featured narrative in <italic>The Big C</italic>, and Andrea’s body size becomes a marked difference as a stigmatized, unhealthy and non-feminine (non-white) body. Andrea is represented as both a ‘victim’ to a capitalism system, as well as a body that embodies and invokes representations that are lazy and consumer ‘choices’ associated with marked African American and overweight bodies. By examining Andrea’s character through a postracial lens, her body is presented as a way that takes a larger racialized history of marked African-American and female bodies into account to show the irony of this history as no longer useful and outdated. Like Cathy’s cancer, Andrea’s character and body size become a metaphor for the show to illustrate and explore non-normative and ‘quirky’ representations as part of a collective ‘outsider’ experience. Andrea’s character (especially in the second season) celebrates her larger body through a discourse on difference and identity politics that ironically points to her own body as the literal and metaphorical ‘elephant in the room’. In the second season Thanksgiving episode, Andrea draws attention to her body by connecting the stigma associated with body size to that of Hugh Dancy’s gay and cancer-ridden character: ‘I’m fat and you’re gay, so we’re supposed to get along.’ The episode highlights a certain level of identity politics – almost <italic>Glee</italic>-like in the show’s address of representations of difference within a larger tolerance narrative. Andrea’s character draws attention to these differences while participating in a postfeminist and postracial commentary that ironically points to her ethnicity, gender, and weight as more in line with Showtime’s unruly postfeminism.</p>

<sec id="sec8-1469540513480169"><title>Cancer mom</title>
<p><italic>The Big C</italic>’s focus on cancer allows for Cathy to reassess her role as a mother figure. The topic of motherhood in <italic>The Big C</italic> centers on a more general cultural discussion of what Susan Douglas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1469540513480169">Douglas and Michaels, 2004</xref>) writes about postfeminism, motherhood and the rise of the ‘new momism’. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1469540513480169">Douglas (2004)</xref>, the ‘new momism’ entails a media identity shift through news stories, celebrity, film and television representations of mothers whose identity is tied to their children. This ‘new momism’ also reflects <italic>The Big C</italic> and Showtime’s marketing trend in channeling the postfeminist acronym MILF (‘Mother I would like to Fuck’) while poking fun at this representation. The MILF representation has taken shape as part of a broader postfeminist trope beginning with iconic and historical figures such as Mrs Robinson from the 1967 film <italic>The Graduate</italic> (Nichols, 1967) to the reemergence of the cougar – the older and more aggressive version of the MILF figure – in shows such as <italic>Sex and the City</italic>, <italic>Desperate Housewives</italic> and Showtime’s Mary Louise-Parker’s figure in <italic>Weeds</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1469540513480169">EM and LO, 2007</xref>). As Showtime’s original ‘female problem’ show, <italic>Weeds</italic> openly pokes fun at the MILF figure while embracing Nancy’s ‘coolness’ as a mother and pot-dealer. The MILF figure within the Showtime universe represents a conflicting relationship to female empowerment and child-rearing responsibilities that engages with a larger postfeminist trope of women failing to achieve perfect motherhood.</p>
<p>Cathy’s character in <italic>The Big C</italic> exemplifies a certain imperfection to what Susan Douglas has termed the ‘new momism’ (Douglas S and Michaels M., 2004). She is not a perfect mother and reflects this ambiguous representation in her relationship with her teenage son, Adam; however, a major development in her search for selfhood is to reconnect as a mother and role-model figure with him. The show positions Cathy as an ‘enabler’ in her son and husband’s bad habits. She identifies her problem in raising two children – her son and husband. As the ‘bad’ mother figure, Cathy repeatedly identifies her mistake in the motherhood project by not forcing her son to clean up after himself, and her unsuccessful attempts to teach him about finances. Cathy at one point claims, ‘Here I’ve been this coupon cutting saver, and I couldn’t even raise a son to get a summer job.’ Cathy resolves to return to a project of betterment by raising her son ‘right.’ As part of Cathy’s self-improvement project, she engages with her son by picking on his habits of not cleaning his room, his swearing and developing sexuality as a ‘masculine’ teenager. Catching Adam watching porn, Cathy attempts to engage with him by watching it with him and giving her ‘real world’ commentary and advice. As a mother figure, she reinserts the value of a woman’s place as an object of male attention by telling her son that ‘women like attention’. She relates the experience of womanhood through the ritual in remembering birthdays and Valentine’s Days, and the ultimate sense of a women’s self-worth through the feeling of being ‘waited for’ by a man. In her attempt to connect with her son, Cathy’s project in becoming a better mother is constructed from a place of guilt that reaffirms her place as a central figure in providing a model of femininity for her son.</p>
<p>The cancer narrative also reinforces Cathy’s motherhood project by turning to her role as an empowered consumer. In the season finale, Cathy’s presence as a ‘good’ mother is symbolized through her son’s discovery of the gift storage space. After learning about his mother’s diagnosis, Cathy’s son discovers a garage full of unopened boxes, a brand new car, and not yet delivered hand-written notes celebrating his future birthdays, graduation and other life achievements. Cathy reasserts her consumer power by creating a storage bank of gifts – a rain check for when presumably she is no longer around and no longer able to assert her purchasing power. The actual storage unit also highlights Cathy’s hyper spending habits and desire to be ‘present’ for future dates and missed celebrations. This collection reinforces Cathy’s move to be a ‘good’ mother figure, which also means a remembered mother figure.</p>
<p>The show’s focus on Cathy’s problematic and failed intersections between motherhood and the cancer experience is reinforced after her son’s contraction of a sexually transmitted infection (STI). After sleeping with a local newspaper ad call girl, Adam contracts crabs and spreads the infection to both of his parents. The episode features Cathy’s response to Adam’s lack of sexual responsibility through her own failure as a parent to communicate and to guide him. Cathy mistakenly understands the physical effects of the STI as positive side effects and reactions to her new clinical trial treatments. However, the STI becomes a public health concern once the entire school and swim team learn from Facebook about her family’s shared infection. According to the Showtime writer’s blog, the writers’ acknowledge the crab scare as a larger metaphor for Cathy’s disease (cancer) that has taken over her family’s lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1469540513480169">Hicks, 2012</xref>). The crab infection becomes another way to question Cathy’s control and surveillance of her teenage son, and her lack of control as both a parent and cancer patient. Even though Cathy does demonstrate her own empowerment by confronting a group of angry parents regarding both her cancer and crabs, the theme surrounding her state of infection reinforces her metaphorical relationship between her role as a mother and diseased figure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1469540513480169" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>By briefly outlining the Showtime network’s branding around the ‘female problem’ genre, my aim has been to critically look at constructions of postfeminism in relation to constructions of cancer, quality and motherhood. There has been a move by the network to embrace complex character portrayals as well as more difficult premises; however, the larger concern comes back to discussions of not only quality television, but also the complexities surrounding the depiction of diseased female empowerment. By turning to Showtime’s image and reception as a diseased product, and Showtime’s recognition of its repeated ‘female problem’ premises as part of its ‘quality’ success, the tensions between quality television’s complexity, and the representation of women-centered programming become more nuanced when looking at constructions of postfeminism and consumer-driven ideologies. As much as Showtime navigates a complex series of female representations that challenge historical depictions of the housewife figure, different sets of issues emerge in thinking about postfeminism, race and bodies that do not fit a white heterosexual model. The complexity of women’s health and the larger relationship to government programs and current policies is also reflected in America’s reproductive health legislation featuring women’s bodies and issues of legitimacy, choice and access. For example, the current political backlash surrounding Republican representative Todd Akin and his comments on women’s ‘illegitimate rape’ speak to a much larger debate on women’s increasingly limited access to abortion services, and also an ideological and policy discussion on the predominantly white male legislators and representatives who define ‘rape’ in relation to women’s agency and bodies. In a recent <italic>Guardian</italic> article, feminist theorist Naomi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1469540513480169">Wolf (2012)</xref> examines the wave of current policy decisions and conservative party attacks on organizations such as Planned Parenthood and abortion rights by thinking of systematic issues of control and surveillance at the center of this debate. The relationship between the premium cable channel Showtime’s female-centered programming and the larger cultural, political and economic discourses surrounding women’s rights pivots around an ongoing conversation on female representations and pathology. In addition to women’s rights issues, the larger neoliberal lifestyle narrative that has become featured in a number of postfeminist texts also speaks to issues of health and disease and the complicated terrain of surveillance and consumerism that surrounds the health industry.</p>
<p>As much as the show depicts a different cancer viewpoint by challenging a therapeutic rhetoric used by corporation and non-profit groups in defining and visualizing cancer subjects and groups, Cathy’s ‘cancer experience’ is reflected in the show’s return to family values and Cathy’s punishment for being a ‘bad’ mother. Like ‘female problem’, the use of ‘cancer’ and the ‘cancer experience’ are loaded terms when considering the metaphors and positions that the term assumes across various racial and class backgrounds. There needs to be further exploration of the ‘female problem’ premise as part of a quality discourse that is ‘complex’ and given in representing the midlife woman and mother figure. As much as Showtime has reconfigured the housewife character to encompass a series of problems both inside and outside the home, a show like <italic>The Big C</italic> also reinforces postfeminist and postracial ideals that further reproduce pathologized femininities.</p>
