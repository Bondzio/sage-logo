<abstract>
<p>Miracle fruit (<italic>Synsepalum dulcificum</italic>) contains the glycoprotein miraculin which turns a sour taste into a sweet one. Chemical analyses and sensory evaluation experiments were conducted to examine the sweetening effect of miracle fruit with regard to five different commercial sour liquids which were diluted until they were subjectively equally sour. HPLC-based analyses revealed that (1) the predominating acids in two and three of the liquids were citric acid and acetic acid, respectively and (2) all five liquids contained fructose and glucose. Healthy young adults (eight males and 10 females) in the sensory evaluation experiments were asked to chew a miracle fruit and apply their saliva to the oral mucosae. They were asked to score the sweetness elicited by the five liquids relative to a sucrose standard at 0, 15, 25 and 35 min thereafter. The citric acid-based liquids were perceived as being sweeter than the acetic acid-based liquids at all timepoints. Thus, commercial sour liquids that mainly contain citric acid are more effective than acetic acid-based liquids in eliciting a perception of sweetness after the miracle fruit application, while the sugars in the liquids seemed to play a minimal role as determinants of sweetness.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1082013212443060" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Miracle fruit, <italic>Synsepalum dulcificum</italic>, contains miraculin, which is an interesting glycoprotein that can be extracted from the fruit and that binds to the sweet receptors on the tongue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1082013212443060">Cagan, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1082013212443060">Theerasilp et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1082013212443060">Theerasilp and Kurihara, 1988</xref>). While miraculin itself is not sweet, the oral application of it causes sour foods to taste sweet. Indeed, it has been shown that the oral application of miraculin can evoke action potentials that travel along the taste nerves in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1082013212443060">Brouwer et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1082013212443060">Hellekant et al., 1998</xref>). A recent study documented that the ‘sweet effect’ of miraculin acts not only on sour foods but also on mixtures containing a sour substance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1082013212443060">Capitanio et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The tongue usually encounters complex mixtures of sapid compounds in water and rarely tastes solitary compounds outside the laboratory. When a psychophysical study examined how mixtures of compounds are perceived by normal subjects in terms of intensity, it was found that mixtures of acids applied to the tongue by using a dorsal flow method induced ‘mixture suppression’, namely the mixtures were perceived as being less intense than the simple sum of the intensities of each component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1082013212443060">Bartoshuk and Cleveland, 1977</xref>). In the absence of chemical reactions between the components of the solution, mixture suppression can arise as a result of two factors, namely (1) the components of mixtures are similar or different to each other and (2) the concentrations of mixtures are supra- or subthreshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1082013212443060">Breslin, 1996</xref>). These factors suggest that it is not easy to predict the sourness of complex sour liquids that are popular and available for use in everyday life, especially since there is generally little or no information regarding the types and concentrations of the individual components of sour liquids. In addition, the effect of miracle fruit on the sweetness of sour liquid mixtures rather than reagent-grade chemicals has not yet been examined.</p>
<p>It would be useful to develop foods containing miraculin for those people whose access to sugars is restricted yet who desire the pleasant taste of sweetness. Indeed, several food products containing miraculin have been developed for such people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1082013212443060">Dziezak, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1082013212443060">Faus, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1082013212443060">Gibbs et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1082013212443060">Giroux and Henkin, 1974</xref>). To improve the research in this direction, the effect of miracle fruit on several sour liquids such as fruit juice and vinegars was investigated. These liquids were selected from the great variety of sour foods that are available in everyday life since such liquids are probably more popular and more easily accessible to people with diabetes, obesity and other metabolic disorders. In addition, the findings of this study can be readily compared to those of previous studies that employed sour reagent-grade chemicals to stimulate the lingual sweet receptors (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1082013212443060">Brouwer et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1082013212443060">Danilova and Hellekant, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1082013212443060">Hellekant et al., 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>The present study aimed first to analyse the types and concentrations of the chemical components in the different sour liquids that were selected. Thereafter, the effectiveness (magnitude and lasting time) of the liquids in terms of eliciting a sweet sensation after miracle fruit was applied orally was assessed.</p>

<p><italic>HPLC analysis.</italic> The sugars in the five solutions were identified by an HPLC system equipped with a refractive index detector (RID-10A, Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan). Analytical separation was achieved on an amino column (Asahipak NH2P-50 4E, 4.6 mm ID × 250 mm, Showa Denko K.K., Tokyo, Japan). The mobile phase consisted of an acetonitrile/20 mM monoethanolamine solution adjusted to pH 9.62 with acetic acid (75/25 v/v) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The column temperature was maintained at 40 ℃.</p>
<p>The organic acids in the five solutions were identified by an HPLC system connected to a post-column pH-buffered electroconductivity detection system. Analytical separation was achieved on two ion exclusion columns (shim-pack SCR-102H, 8.0 mm ID × 300 mm, Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan). A solution of 5 mM <italic>p</italic>-toluenesulfonic acid dissolved in distilled water served as the mobile phase. The following three solutions served as reaction reagents: (1) 5 mM <italic>p</italic>-toluenesulfonic acid, (2) 20 mM bis (2-hydroxyethyl) iminotris (hydroxymethyl) methane and (3) 100 µM ethylenediaminetetra acetic acid disodium salt in distilled water. The flow rates of both the mobile phase and the reaction reagent were 0.8 mL/min. Detection was accomplished with a conductivity detector (CDD-10Avp, Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan). The separation temperature was 40 ℃, while the conductivity detector temperature was 43 ℃.</p>

<p>Eighteen young adults (eight males and 10 females, around 20 years of age) participated in this study. None of these subjects had participated in similar studies previously. None had special problems with regard to gustatory function. The subjects participated in the present experiment after providing informed consent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1082013212443060"><title>Standard and test solutions</title>
<p>Two standard solutions that elicited a sweet (0.20 M sucrose) and a sour (0.023 M citric acid) taste were used along with the five test solutions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1082013212443060">Table 1</xref>) in the sensory experiment. These two standard solutions were diluted with distilled water until their concentrations were about 10 times higher than the average cognition thresholds of sucrose and citric acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1082013212443060">Pfaffmann et al., 1971</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1082013212443060" sec-type="methods"><title>Procedures</title>
<p>Sensory evaluation tests were conducted in an air-conditioned room at 25 ℃ in which each subject was seated on a chair. Three different tests were performed:

<list-item><p><italic>Determining the sourness of the standard and test solutions.</italic></p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>First, each panel was asked to rinse their mouth sufficiently with 75 mL deionised water. He/she was then asked to memorise the sourness of the standard solution (0.023 M citric acid) and set it at ‘100’ on a sour scale from 0 to 200. Relative to the memory of the standard solution, each subject was then asked to score the sourness of the five test solutions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1082013212443060">Table 1</xref>), which were randomly selected. Each subject was then asked to rinse their mouth sufficiently with 75 mL deionised water.

<list-item><p><italic>Oral application of miracle fruit.</italic></p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Each subject was given a thawed freeze-dried miracle fruit (World Agri Enterprise Inc., Gunma, Japan) and asked to ingest the fruit, chew it gently and spit out the seed. The subject was then instructed to (1) chew and mix the fruit with saliva, (2) apply their saliva to the entire mucosae of their mouth for 2 min and 3) spit out the mixture and rinse their mouth with 75 mL deionised water.

<list-item><p><italic>Sensory evaluation of test food sweetness after miracle fruit application</italic>.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Just after the miracle fruit was applied to the oral mucosae, each subject was asked to taste the standard solution of sucrose (0.20 M) and memorise the sweetness of the solution as ‘100’ on the sweet scale. The sweetness of the 0.023 M citric acid standard solution was then evaluated to confirm the effect of the miracle fruit. The citric acid solution was only used in the first session (i.e. ‘0 min’ after applying the miracle fruit; see the following).</p>
<p>Each subject was then instructed to perform the following six steps to evaluate the sweetness of the five sour test solutions: (1) rinse their mouth with 75 mL deionised water, (2) take a small paper cup filled with the first solution (15 mL), (3) ingest and hold the solution in the mouth for about 3 s, (4) spit the solution out and evaluate its sweetness, (5) score the sweetness using the ‘0–200’ sweet scale and (6) rinse their mouth with 75 mL deionised water again. The five test solutions were delivered in an entirely random fashion. The trials were separated by brief rests of about 30 s. Each session consisted of five trials of each of the five sour solutions, and each subject underwent four sessions at 0, 15, 25 and 35 min after the oral application of the miracle fruit.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1082013212443060"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The distances marked by the subjects on the sweet and sour scales were measured every 1 mm and were directly converted the distances to the scores from ‘0’ to ‘200’. The scores were analysed statistically by two-way ANOVA using ‘solution’ and ‘subject’ as factors when the homogeneity of the scores’ variances was recognised by Bartlett test. The ANOVA was followed by a multiple-comparison (Tukey–Kramer) test to detect specific differences between pairs of solutions and subjects. Kruskal–Wallis tests were used for the statistical analysis when the homogeneity of the scores’ variances was not recognised. Differences were regarded as statistically significant if <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05.</p>

The sensory evaluation experiments revealed that (1) the miracle fruit effect was strongest just after the oral application of the fruit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1082013212443060">Figure 1</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1082013212443060">2</xref>) Lemon and Shek appeared more sweet than the remaining three solutions (Grain vine., Apple vine. and Wine vine.) just after the oral application of miracle fruit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1082013212443060">Figure 1</xref>). These results together suggest that miracle fruit elevates the apparent sweetness of citric acid-based sour liquids more effectively than that of acetic acid-based sour liquids.

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1082013212443060">Table 3</xref> indicates the average sweetness scores of the five test solutions and the 0.023 M citric acid standard solution 0 min after the application of miracle fruit. The average score of the sweetness elicited by the standard solution was 133.3. This was almost equal to the sweetness score of Lemon (133.2). Of the five test solutions, Lemon had the highest average score, which was 45.3% higher than the average score of Grain vine. (91.7), which had the lowest score of the five test solutions. ANOVA detected significant differences in the average scores of both the five test solutions and the 18 subjects (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Multiple-comparison tests also detected specific differences between five pairs of the test solutions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1082013212443060">Table 3</xref>): the average score of Lemon was higher than those of Grain vine., Apple vine. and Wine vine. (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01), while the average score of Shek was higher than those of Grain vine and Wine vine (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Of the 153 possible pairs of the 18 subjects, 27 pairs (17.6% of the 153 possible pairs) differed significantly in terms of the average scores of the five test solutions (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01 for 17 pairs and <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 for 10 pairs). A psychophysical study examined the effectiveness with which miracle fruit changed the perceived sweetness of several different reagent-grade sour chemicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1082013212443060">Bartoshuk et al., 1974</xref>). This study found that citric acid was the most effective chemical for induction of sweetness by miraculin and that the substance doubled the perceived sweetness of citric acid compared to its effect on acetic acid. However, in the present study, the average sweetness of the citric acid-based solutions (Lemon and Shek) just after miracle fruit application was only about 30% stronger than that of the vinegar-based solutions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1082013212443060">Table 3</xref>). This discrepancy suggests that the degree to which miracle fruit increases the perceived sweetness of an acidic solution does not simply reflect the organic acids that are contained in the solution.</p>
<p>As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1082013212443060">Figure 1</xref>, the average sweetness scores of all five test solutions declined slowly over time from 15 to 35 min timepoints after the miracle fruit application. Indeed, Kruskal–Wallis tests detected significant differences (<italic>P</italic>s &lt; 0.001) in the average scores of the five test solutions among the four timepoints (from 0 to 35 min) after the application. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1082013212443060">Table 4</xref> summarises the specific differences that were detected between test solutions pairs by multiple-comparison tests. This shows that, in general, the citric acid-based solutions, Lemon and Shek, were perceived as being sweeter than the three acetic acid-based solutions (Grain vine., Apple vine. and Wine vine.) at all three timepoints. Moreover, at the 15 min timepoint after the application, 17 subject pairs (11.1% of the 153 possible pairs,<italic> P</italic>s &lt; 0.01 for 12 pairs and <italic>P</italic>s &lt; 0.05 for five pairs) differed in terms of the average scores. At the 25 and 35 min timepoints, 44 (28.8%, <italic>P</italic>s &lt; 0.01 for 28 pairs and <italic>P</italic>s &lt; 0.05 for 16 pairs) and 51 pairs (33.3%, <italic>P</italic>s &lt; 0.01 for 41 pairs and <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 for 10 pairs) differed significantly in terms of the average scores, respectively.

<p>The present article appears to be the first to report on the effect of miracle fruit on the sweetness of sour mixtures that are available in everyday life. A recent study showed that the sweetness of a mixture of 0.037 M sucrose and 0.01 M citric acid was greater after the oral application of miraculin than the sweetness of a single solution of sucrose without oral application of miraculin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1082013212443060">Capitanio et al., 2011</xref>). We do not know whether or not the effect of miraculin on the mixture can be applicable to the test solutions used in the present study, because the organic acids and sugars detected in the foods (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1082013212443060">Table 2</xref>) were largely different from the taste substances in the mixture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1082013212443060">Capitanio et al., 2011</xref>). Since we collected no data about the sweetness of the five test solutions before miracle fruit application, we estimated the sweetness of the test solutions alone from the time course of the miracle fruit effect (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1082013212443060">Figure 1</xref>) by using a linear regression method. A previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1082013212443060">Kurihara et al., 1969</xref>) reported that the sweetening effect of miraculin lasted 2 h or more if the concentration was sufficiently high (e.g. 4.8 × 10<sup>–7</sup> M and 2.3 × 10<sup>–6</sup> M). According to this study, the sweetness scores estimated at 2 h or more may be appropriate, but the scores became negative values if we estimated at 80 min or more after the miracle fruit application, so we used the timepoint at 75 min. The sweetness scores ranged from 2 (Apple vine.) to 7 (Shek) when the sweetness of the standard solution of sucrose (0.20 M) was perceived as ‘100’ on the sweetness scale. The sugars in the test solutions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1082013212443060">Table 2</xref>) would have been responsible for the scores obtained, and the scores suggest that the sweetness of the solutions plays a minor role in the determination of sweetness after miracle fruit application (also see below).</p>
<p>It should be noted that our study involved sour solutions that contained not only organic acids but also sugars (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1082013212443060">Table 2</xref>). This could be potentially problematic since it has been shown previously that mixtures of acids applied to the tongue by using the dorsal flow method induce ‘mixture suppression’, namely the mixtures appear to be less intense than when the intensities of the components are summed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1082013212443060">Bartoshuk and Cleveland, 1977</xref>). However, we believe that the sugars in the test solutions do not contribute significantly to the sweetness after miracle fruit application because of three observations. First, Shek contained more sugars (fructose and glucose) than Lemon, the other citric acid-based solution (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1082013212443060">Table 2</xref>), yet was perceived as being slightly less sweet than Lemon just after miracle fruit application (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1082013212443060">Table 3</xref>). Second, the average sweetness of Lemon was almost equal to that of the citric acid standard solution, which lacked sugars (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1082013212443060">Table 3</xref>). Third, compared to the other two vinegar-based solutions, Apple vine. contained more fructose, which is considered to be the most sweet sugar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1082013212443060">Cameron, 1947</xref>), yet it did not differ noticeably in terms of average sweetness at any timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1082013212443060">Figure 1</xref>). These observations suggest strongly that the sugars in the test solutions are not determinants of the perceived sweetness enhancement induced by miracle fruit application that was observed in the present study.</p>
<p>The sweetness elicited by the five sour solutions declined slowly over time after miracle fruit application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1082013212443060">Figure 1</xref>). This was also observed in an electrophysiological study of the effect of miraculin on monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1082013212443060">Brouwer et al., 1983</xref>). As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1082013212443060">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1082013212443060">Table 4</xref> suggest, the average sweetness scores of the citric acid-based solutions appeared to drop faster than the scores of the vinegar-based solutions. However, it should also be noted that the absolute average scores of the citric acid-based solutions were higher than those of the vinegar-based solutions, even 35 min after miracle fruit application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1082013212443060">Figure 1</xref>). These observations suggest that citric acid-based solutions may be useful for practical applications of miracle fruit in clinical situations; they may also be useful in terms of the everyday situations of those people whose access to sugars is restricted. The concentration of miraculin is an important consideration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1082013212443060">Kurihara et al., 1969</xref>) for its practical use, but we have no available data concerning the concentration of miraculin actually provided to the subjects. A pulp of miracle fruit contains 36 mg of pure miraculin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1082013212443060">Kurihara, 1992</xref>), and concentrations of miraculin in solutions were found to range from 3 to 5 mg/mL in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1082013212443060">Brouwer et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1082013212443060">Hellekant et al., 1976</xref>). In the future, it will be necessary to measure the actual concentration of miraculin in subjects’ saliva during oral application.</p>
<p>The present study detected many significant differences between subject pairs at all timepoints (from 0 to 35 min after miracle fruit application). This could suggest individual differences in terms of sensitivity to the miracle fruit effect. However, there are two other possibilities. First, the miracle fruit that we used in this study may differ in terms of the amount of miraculin because miracle fruit is a natural product. Second, although the method and time of the miracle fruit application were sufficiently controlled, the subjects may not have been exposed to identical amounts of miraculin for various other technical reasons. In terms of the possible individual differences that could affect sensitivity to the effect of miracle fruit, it is unlikely that age is a factor in this study since all subjects were around 20 years old. The possibility that gender affects miracle fruit sensitivity could not be analysed because of the small sample number. In addition, other attributes that might affect sensitivity to miracle fruit could not be assessed because this information was not gathered. Further research involving a larger sample number and documentation of various attributes is needed to determine which individual attributes affect sensitivity to miracle fruit.</p>
