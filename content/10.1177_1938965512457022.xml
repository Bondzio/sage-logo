<abstract>
<p>The three dominant North American cruise line companies have developed an effective legal strategy that provides a strategic, competitive advantage involving any dispute or litigation with a guest. All cruise guests are required to sign a contract containing similar terms and conditions that limit the loss for personal property, death, personal injury, emotional stress, and mental anguish; require written notice of claims; require filing of lawsuits within a specified shortened period of time; provide mandatory arbitration for certain claims; and waive class actions. The terms and conditions also take advantage of and conform to legislation affecting the maritime industry. At the heart of the strategy is the <italic>identical</italic> forum selection clause requiring all guests to initiate all suits in the U.S. District Court for Southern Florida. Because most litigation takes place in the same court, corporate counsel will have the benefit of being able to modify and update their terms and conditions to reflect the court’s most recent decisions, even when they were not parties to the case. The ability of litigating in a location close to their home offices is also a huge convenience factor. Equally important, the forum may be one that is very inconvenient for the guest, a factor that may cause some cases to be settled early. The strategy of an industry-wide, comprehensive, and similar set of terms and conditions, anchored by a forum selection clause, is an effective litigation strategy that might be used as model by lodging companies as part of their online contracts.</p>

<p>The three major cruise lines have developed similar approaches to limiting passengers’ ability to seek legal remedies or damages for injuries or other untoward events occurring on board. The cruise lines’ chief method of reducing litigation risk is the requirement that passengers sign a “terms and conditions” agreement when they purchase their tickets. The three companies’ terms and conditions are essentially identical, as each line has adjusted its own terms and conditions over time based on the experience of the competitors. Common provisions include a specification for the jurisdiction for all litigation (U.S. District Court, Southern Florida), time limits for notice and filing of any litigation, and limitations on monetary damages. Supporting the cruise lines’ terms and conditions are international maritime and U.S. statutes and case law that grant the carriers substantial protections and limit passengers’ rights. Given that hotels are in many ways similar to cruise ships, it’s possible that hoteliers could also use a “terms and conditions” approach to limit litigation liability.</p>
<p>On January 13, 2012, the <italic>Costa Concordia</italic>, carrying 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members, foundered on a reef near Giglio, Italy, killing at least 28 people. In July 2012, CNN reported that the <italic>Concordia</italic>’s passengers were stunned at being given “minimum compensation” for losses in the crash (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938965512457022">CNN 2012</xref>). Those compensation amounts, reported CNN, were €11,000 for losses other than loss of life, and $71,000 for loss of life. The report pointed out, however, that these amounts are as specified in the terms and conditions of passage, to which passengers agreed before embarking. In this article, I detail the steps that cruise lines have taken to limit litigation risks from events like this, and I propose a similar approach for hotels.</p>
<p>A typical cruise provided by one of the international cruise industry companies is similar to a stay at many full-service and destination hotels, as the cruise ships provide lodging, food, beverage, and entertainment to large numbers of people who are expecting to have a carefree vacation. The cruise lines are also susceptible, like hotels, to serious litigation risks from individuals or large groups of people if an incident at sea is their responsibility or viewed as their responsibility.</p>
<p>The cruise line industry serving North America has approximately 205 boats providing approximately 311,911 guest rooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938965512457022">Cruise Lines International Association 2011</xref>). Cruise Line International reports that the cruise industry continues to grow in popularity with over 14,819,000 guests embarking on cruise ships worldwide in 2010, with more than 10,781,000 guests starting their cruise in North America. The Florida-Caribbean Cruise Association notes that cruises are the “fastest growing category in the leisure travel market, with a compound growth rate in worldwide cruise ship guests sailing since 1990 of 7.42 percent” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938965512457022">Florida-Caribbean Cruise Association 2010</xref>). It is estimated that total booking revenue worldwide in 2011 was $29.4 billion, an increase of 9.4 percent from 2010, with an average cruise length of approximately 7.2 days, and with each guest spending approximately $1,770 per week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938965512457022">Cruise Market Watch, Market Share 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The North American cruise industry is dominated by three companies, Carnival Cruise Lines, Royal Caribbean Cruise Line, and Norwegian Cruise Line, which own approximately 86 percent of the room capacity and 60 percent of the ships. Carnival Cruise Lines has 154,836 of the rooms (49.6%) and 65 (37.6%) of the ships, the Royal Caribbean Cruise Line has 87,376 (28.0%) of the rooms and 34 (16.6%) of the ships, and the Norwegian Cruise Line has 26,340 (8.4%) of the rooms and 11 (3.6%) of the ships. Because of this domination in the market, this article will focus only on these companies. The remaining 14 percent of the North American industry capacity (43,353 rooms) is provided by approximately 15 other companies with approximately 83 ships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938965512457022">Cruise Lines International Association 2011</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-1938965512457022">
<title>Overview of the Cruise Industry Legal Strategy</title>
<p>Although approximately 32 percent of all cruises are booked online with a “click wrap”–type contract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938965512457022">Florida-Caribbean Cruise Association 2012</xref>), every guest who takes a cruise is required to sign a hard copy of the company’s guest contract before boarding. A “click-wrap” contract is one in which an internet user agrees to terms and conditions as part of using a website, for instance, when the user clicks “agree” before downloading an app. Over the years, the three cruise line companies have each independently developed strong, nearly identical, comprehensive terms and conditions in their online and written guest contracts. Most notably, they all include the same forum selection clause, which requires all cases to be litigated in the U.S. District Court for Southern Florida. Because the guest contracts and terms and conditions are all so similar, and because most cases are decided in the same court, decisions involving one company provide an opportunity for the other two companies to quickly modify their contracts, providing a significant and strategic legal advantage in their dealings with their guests who claim to have been injured while on a cruise. In addition, a variety of federal statutes and treaties provide certain legal protections and obligations to the cruise industry, and these are also incorporated into the guest contracts. In this article I analyze the legal enforceability and statutory authority of the terms and conditions of these contracts, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1938965512457022">Exhibit 1</xref>. (For a complete discussion of the use and enforceability of the online terms and conditions used by the lodging industry, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1938965512457022">Wilson 2011</xref>.) The legal strategy developed by the three dominant companies in the cruise industry provides a competitive and strategic advantage against all guests commencing litigation against them. I argue that a similar strategy might be applied in the lodging industry.</p>

<title>Important Legislation and Treaties Affecting Cruise Line Litigation with Guests</title>
<sec id="section3-1938965512457022">
<title>The Athens Convention</title>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938965512457022">Athens Convention Act of 1974</xref>, called the Carriage of Passengers and Their Luggage by Sea, as amended, provides the statutory authority for guest contract terms and conditions limiting liability for death and personal injury during an international cruise, “where the place of departure and the place of destination are situated in two different States, or in a single State if, according to the contract of carriage or the scheduled itinerary, there is an intermediate port of call in another State (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938965512457022">Athens Convention 1974</xref>, Article 1 (9)). The act also includes provisions that allow for the choice of forums, limits liability for personal injury and death (Article 7), limits liability for loss or damage to property (Article 8), provides for notice for loss or damage to property (Article 15), and limits the time in which to commence suit (Article 16).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1938965512457022">
<title>The U.S. Code</title>
<p>The U.S. Code, Title 46, Subtitle III, Chapter 305—Exoneration and Limitation of Liability (sec 305, sec 30501-30509, and 30511) deals with shipping, including cruise ships, and provides much of the statutory authority for limitation of liability for emotional distress, limitation of liability for mental anguish unless accompanied by physical injury, general limitations of liability, and the limitations of consequential and punitive damages that are included in all of the guest contracts of the three major carriers. This statute affects cruises between ports in the United States or between a port in the United States and a port in a foreign country.</p>
<p>All three of the major cruise lines have provisions in their guest contract terms and conditions that attempt to limit liability for certain types of injuries according to the limitations and provisions of these statutes. While there may be situations where the Athens Convention and the U.S. Code are in conflict, the companies include in their terms and conditions provisions that provide that the carrier is entitled to all of the protections afforded by the Athens Convention for cruises that “neither embark, disembark nor call at any port in the United States” (Royal Caribbean Terms and Conditions, 11). Royal Caribbean, for example, then provides that “on all other cruises” the protections afforded by the U.S. Code will apply. I will analyze these specific provisions and any statutory authority.</p>
<sec id="section5-1938965512457022">
<title>Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act of 2010</title>
<p>The cruise line industry has been exposed over the years to widespread publicity whenever an unfavorable event occurs during a cruise, whether involving sexual crimes, norovirus infections, ship hijackings, guests falling into the sea, fires on board boats, and (as mentioned at the outset of this article) foundering on a reef. While the cruise industry denies that a crime problem or safety problem exists, and while factual data relating to the frequency of these events is limited, there appears to be at a least some public perception of a problem. It should also be noted that most cruise lines have adopted a zero tolerance policy for crime. In an interesting article titled “Sex at Sea: Sexual Crimes aboard Cruise Ships,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938965512457022">Klein and Poulston (2011)</xref> point out that “there is little question that sexual assaults and sexual harassment are a problem on cruise ships” (p. 77).</p>
<p>A recent <italic>USA Today</italic> article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1938965512457022">Sloan 2010</xref>) commented: “the nation’s largest anti-sexual assault organization, RAINN (Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network), have argued that crime on ships is a bigger problem than the industry lets on, and they’ve lobbied hard for more safety-related regulations.”</p>
<p>As a result of persistent pressure by some individuals and groups, the United States Congress enacted the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938965512457022">Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act of 2010</xref> (H.R. 3360). The findings of the statute are interesting, as they acknowledge that a problem exists relating to the cruise industry and the occurrence and reporting of crimes at sea, but they state:
<disp-quote>
<p>Obtaining reliable crime-related cruise data from governmental sources can be difficult, because multiple countries may be involved when a crime occurs on the high seas, including the flag country for the vessel, the country of citizenship of particular passengers, and any countries having special or maritime jurisdiction. (Sec 2 (9))</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The statute imposes significant new crime prevention and reporting obligations on the cruise industry to more effectively deal with crime and sexual assaults at sea. The statute requires cruise lines to maintain logs of sexual assaults, have medical staff available at all times to deal with sexual crimes, provide for confidentiality, limit crew access to guest staterooms, and provide crime scene preservation training. The law specifies criminal penalties for violations (Sec 3507, 3508).</p>
<p>In some cases, a cruise ship employee may be charged with the crime. For instance, “Federal authorities in Florida charged a Carnival Cruise Lines waiter with engaging in a sexual act with a minor during a Carnival voyage” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1938965512457022">Sloan 2011</xref>). Whether a guest alleges negligence or that the cruise line is responsible for a crime committed by an employee, the new statute now requires that specific actions be taken after the report of a sexual assault. Increased requirements for reporting and acting on reports of sexual assaults while on cruises may cause the reduction in sexual assaults and crimes or may result in more crimes being reported and acted upon. In any case, if a crime or sexual assault occurs during a cruise and the guest seeks compensation from the cruise line, the terms and conditions created in the cruise guest contracts clearly provide a strategic, legal advantage to the cruise line in the event of litigation.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1938965512457022">
<title>Cruise Guest Contracts</title>
<p>The Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act notwithstanding, the three major cruise lines’ “Terms and Conditions” or “Terms of Use” limit passengers’ litigation options. Elsewhere I stated: "If enforceable by a court, these provisions become part of the contract with the guest and may limit the choices for the disgruntled or injured guest, lower the cost to defend a suit, and improve the negotiating position” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1938965512457022">Wilson 2011</xref>, 191). The result of the effective use of the terms and conditions is to provide each company, and most of the cruise industry, with a strategic, competitive advantage in the event of legal action involving a guest.</p>
<p>Companies that seek to use this strategy might want to make part of their contracts include some or all of the following, as the cruise lines do:</p>
<list id="list1-1938965512457022" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Choice of forum provision (forum selection), where the parties agree, in advance, that any legal dispute will be heard in a named jurisdiction or location chosen by the cruise line. This jurisdiction is usually where corporate headquarters are located.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Choice of law provision, where the parties agree that the law of the named jurisdiction will be applied in deciding the dispute.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Arbitration provision, where the parties agree that any dispute will be resolved by arbitration. The provision might determine the method of selection of the arbiter(s), the location of the arbitration, how many arbiters will be used, who pays for the arbitration, and whether the arbitration is binding or nonbinding.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Limitation on the types of damages that may be awarded; for example, the parties may waive their rights to receive consequential or punitive damages.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Limitation on the time allowed to commence suit.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Waiver of the right to pursue class action suits or class action arbitration.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Liquidated damages provision, where the parties agree to limit the amount of damages that may be recovered.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Waiver of liability.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Limitation of legal fees, where the parties agree that legal fees may or may not be awarded to the opposing side. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1938965512457022">Wilson 2007</xref>, 363)</p></list-item>

<title>Specific Cruise Industry Guest Contract Terms and Conditions</title>
<p>The detailed guest contracts of Carnival, Royal Caribbean, and Norwegian Cruise Lines set out the specific legal terms that clearly favor the cruise line. In this regard, the forum selection requirement is the key element in the cruise lines’ strategy. Given that the three companies all have their corporate offices located in Miami, Florida, it is not surprising that all three require cases to be heard in the U.S. District Court of Florida for the Southern District of Florida in Miami. As a result, almost all litigation between these carriers and their guests is ultimately decided by this court, and each decision allows the cruise lines to update and revise their terms and conditions accordingly, even if they have not been a party to a specific case. Knowing that most future cases will be decided by the same U.S. District Court provides a degree of certainty as to the future interpretation and enforcement of any of their terms and conditions that would not be available if the decision were rendered by a different federal court or by a state court. The terms that are included in each one of the guest contracts are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1938965512457022">Exhibit 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Enforcement of Cruise Ship Guest Contracts</title>
<sec id="section9-1938965512457022">
<title>Forum Selection</title>
<p>The top three cruise lines all have similar forum selection clauses. For example, the Carnival Guest Contract, item 12, Section (c) states:
<disp-quote>
<p>it is agreed by and between the Guest and Carnival that all disputes and matters whatsoever arising under, in connection with or incident to this Contract or the Guest’s cruise, including travel to and from the vessel, shall be litigated, if at all, before the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida in Miami, or as to those lawsuits to which the Federal Courts of the United States lack subject matter jurisdiction, before a court located in Miami-Dade County, Florida, U.S.A. to the exclusion of the Courts of any other county, state or country.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The Norwegian Cruise Line has almost identical language in their guest contract, item 14, sec. 14, setting the jurisdiction as “before the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida in Miami, or as to those lawsuits to which the Federal Courts of the United States lack subject matter jurisdiction, before a court located in Miami-Dade County, Florida, U.S.A. to the exclusion of the Courts of any other county, state or country.”</p>
<p>Printed in capital letters as shown here, the Royal Caribbean International Cruise line document entitled Terms and Conditions, item #9 includes the language that actions “. . . SHALL BE LITIGATED, IF AT ALL, IN AND BEFORE THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA LOCATED IN MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA, U.S.A., (OR AS TO THOSE LAWSUITS TO WHICH THE FEDERAL COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES LACK SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION, BEFORE A COURT LOCATED IN MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA, U.S.A.) TO THE EXCLUSION OF THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER STATE, TERRITORY OR COUNTRY.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1938965512457022">
<title>Enforcement of Forum Selection: Cases</title>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court has held in support of these forum selection provisions. The case of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938965512457022"><italic>Carnival Cruise Lines v. Shute</italic> (1991)</xref> involved a married couple who lived in the state of Washington, and purchased their tickets for a seven-day cruise from a travel agent in Washington, and paid the agent. Carnival Cruise Lines prepared the ticket and mailed it to the Shutes in Washington. The terms and conditions included were included as part of their ticket, as the court noted:</p>
<p>The face of each ticket, at its left-hand lower corner, contained this admonition:
<disp-quote>
<p>SUBJECT TO CONDITIONS OF CONTRACT ON LAST PAGES <bold>IMPORTANT!</bold> PLEASE READ CONTRACT—ON LAST PAGES 1, 2, 3</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The following appeared on "contract page 1" of each ticket:
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PASSAGE CONTRACT TICKET</italic></p>
<p>8. It is agreed by and between the passenger and the Carrier that all disputes and matters whatsoever arising under, in connection with or incident to this Contract shall be litigated, if at all, in and before a Court located in the State of Florida, U. S. A., to the exclusion of the Courts of any other state or country (<italic>Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. v. Shute</italic>).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While on the cruise and in international waters off the Mexican coast, Eulala Shute slipped on a deck mat and was injured. The Shutes filed a negligence suit in a Washington State court, which was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The Shutes’s case, ultimately decided by the U.S. Supreme Court, approved the use of forum selection provisions and the forum of Florida, but also established that form contracts signed by cruise guests are subject to scrutiny for fundamental fairness and notice of the terms. Numerous cases have followed the <italic>Shute</italic> case, all of which supported the jurisdiction provision of the passenger contract.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1938965512457022">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Challenges to forum selection clauses have been effective only when the court is able to establish that there is evidence of the fraud, lack of notice, overreaching, or that the terms were not reasonably communicated to the passenger. “The court should take into account the clause’s physical characteristics and whether the plaintiff had the ability to become meaningfully informed of the clause and to reject its terms. . . . The conditions of a form contract may be enforceable even if not read by the challenging party, so long as that party was afforded the opportunity to do so (<italic>Wallis v. Princess Cruises, Inc. et al</italic>.)” (It should be noted that while the analysis in this article of whether forum selection clauses or other terms and conditions are enforceable in the cruise industry, the analysis and conclusions are the same for the lodging industry and other industries.)</p>
<p>Having all guest litigation handled in the same forum, close to the corporate office, is a huge convenience for the cruise company and is frequently an important inconvenience for a plaintiff. While it is difficult to measure, a distant, inconvenient forum is one factor that may encourage a plaintiff to settle instead of litigating. The cruise companies know that suits involving guests will be heard in their chosen forum. Over time, they are able to maintain a strategic advantage by knowing, in advance, how the chosen court is likely to rule and interpret their terms and conditions, allowing corporate counsel to create effective strategies for modifying terms and conditions, handling of the cases, and whether to pursue settlement options or whether to litigate.</p>

<sec id="section11-1938965512457022">
<title>Maritime Law Is Applicable</title>
<p>The U.S. Code requires that cases involving cruise ships are decided in accordance with U.S. admiralty and maritime law. “A contract for the transportation of passengers is a maritime contract within admiralty jurisdiction” (<italic>Archawski et al. v. Hanioti</italic>). “The admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States extends to and includes cases of injury or damage, to person or property, caused by a vessel on navigable waters . . . .” (Sec 30101). If the “claim asserted arises out of a maritime contract, the admiralty court has jurisdiction over it (<italic>Archawski et al. v. Hanioti</italic>).”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1938965512457022">
<title>Time Limitations on Claims and Suits</title>
<p>Generally, statutes of limitations require that different types of litigation (e.g., negligence, breach of contract, wrongful death) be filed in an appropriate court within the time limits set by statute, with time limits that may vary depending upon the applicable state or federal law. The purpose of the statutes of limitations is to provide a reasonable period of time for the injured plaintiff to bring suit, while also preventing suits after that reasonable period of time. Once again, all three of the top cruise lines have similar terms and conditions in their guest contracts in this regard. For example, all three require that they receive written notice within a specified time from the date of injury or death in order to preserve a claim for injury, illness, or death (either 185 days for Carnival and Royal Caribbean or 6 months for Norwegian). In addition to the notice requirement, suits for injury, illness, or death must be commenced within one year of the injury or death, and the claimant must have also provided the required written notice of claim. For all other claims, written notice must be given within 30 days of landing. Assuming that written notice has been properly delivered, all suits for all other claims must be commenced within six months from either the date of the guest landing (Carnival), the date of the cruise ending (Royal Caribbean), or from the date of claim (Norwegian).</p>
<p>The time limitation clauses all conform to the statutory protections included in the federal statute 46 U.S.C.S. Chapter 305, Maritime Liability and Limitations on Liability. (This statute will also be discussed in the section “Limitation of Liability and Damages.”) The statute allows cruise companies to institute time limitations that may be different (shorter) than the applicable state or federal statute. The statute USC 406 sec 30508 reads:
<disp-quote>
<p>The owner . . . of a vessel transporting passengers or property between ports in the United States, or between a port in the United States and a port in a foreign country, may not limit by regulation, contract, or otherwise the period for—</p>
<p>(1) giving notice of, or filing a claim for, personal injury or death to less than 6 months after the date of the injury or death; or</p>
<p>(2) bringing a civil action for personal injury or death to less than one year after the date of the injury or death (sec 30508 (b) 1 and 2.).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The statute also provides that, in some instances, a failure to give notice will not be a bar to suit (sec 30505 (c)) and that notice requirements will toll while a person is mentally incompetent or a minor (sec 30505 (d)).</p>
<p>In the case of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938965512457022"><italic>Crist v. Carnival Corporation</italic> (2010)</xref>, the U.S. Court of Appeals upheld a provision in the Carnival contract which required that a suit be filed within a one-year time period and also included the important forum selection provision. In this case, the plaintiff fell and injured herself while on a Carnival cruise, alleging that a stairway aboard the ship was unsafe and caused her to fall and injure herself. The court noted that the contract between Crist and Carnival required that Crist
<disp-quote>
<p>give written notice of any claims within 135 days of her injury. In addition, the ticket establishes a one-year limitation period within which any suit must be commenced. Finally, the ticket contains a forum selection clause, which specifies that the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida shall serve as the appropriate venue, assuming that the court has subject matter jurisdiction. (<italic>Crist v. Carnival Corporation</italic>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Before any litigation had been commenced and eight months after her accident, Crist’s attorney wrote to Carnival and requested insurance information. Carnival responded by stating that Carnival "expressly reserved all rights contained in the ticket contract, including the forum selection clause.” The letter also explicitly stated that “Carnival will not waive its contractual defense if a lawsuit is filed in the wrong court." On October 15, 2008, Crist filed her suit in the state court in Miami Dade County, nine days before the end of the one-year time period contained in the contract. Carnival filed a motion to dismiss the action based on improper venue stating that the contract required actions in the specified federal court. On November 12, 2008, after the expiration of the one-year time period, and while the state court case was still pending, Crist filed suit in the proper court, but the court granted Carnival’s motion for summary judgment based upon the failure to file in the correct court within the one-year time period specified in the agreement. On appeal, Crist argued that the one-year time period to sue should be extended because they had filed suit within one year, although in the incorrect court. The court noted that in some situations contractual time limitations may be tolled, but not with the present facts. The court, distinguishing this case from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938965512457022"><italic>Booth v. Carnival Corp</italic>., 522 F.3d 1148 (11th Cir. 2008)</xref>, and noted:
<disp-quote>
<p>Unlike in <italic>Booth</italic>, Carnival expressly informed Crist that all lawsuits must be filed in federal court, and that its rights contained in the ticket contract, including the forum selection clause, would not be waived. Carnival did this before the contractual limitations period expired. Therefore, unlike the plaintiff in <italic>Booth</italic>, Crist was <italic>not</italic> "entitled to believe that [her] state filing might be sufficient given the fact that defendants can, and often do, waive their defense of improper venue. (citing <italic>Booth</italic> at 1153)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It should be noted that the provisions in the guest contracts of the three major cruise lines that limit the time period to commence suit conform to the language of the USC 46 section 30508 and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938965512457022">Athens Convention of 1974</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1938965512457022">
<title>Limitations and Waiver on Liability, Limitations on the Amount of Damages That May Be Collected</title>
<p>Again, all three of the major cruise lines have similar contract provisions that limit the amount of their liability for death and personal injury and loss. As in the case of the <italic>Costa Concordia</italic>, these limitations are based on provisions in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938965512457022">Athens Convention of 1974</xref> and 1976 and reiterated in U.S. statutes (U.S.C. Title 46, Chapter 305). For example, sec 30506 includes a provision that limits the amount that a vessel owner can be ordered to pay for personal injury or death to “$420 times the tonnage of the vessel” (sec 30506 (b)). Sec 30509 provides that an owner “may not” include a provision that limits liability for personal injury or death caused by the negligence or the fault of the cruise ship owner. Limitations are allowed, however, for personal injury or death that are not caused by the negligence or fault of the cruise ship owner (sec 30509 (a)(1)). In addition, all three cruise lines include provisions that limit liability for emotional distress and mental anguish unless accompanied by physical injury.</p>
<p>Two cases involving two different cruise lines point out the benefits that the three major cruise lines receive from all having similar terms and conditions in their guest contracts that conform to the statutory provisions discussed above. That was not the situation in the <italic>Wallis</italic> case, where Bobbi Jo Wallis brought suit against Princess Cruises, Inc., and others in the Federal District Court (required as part of the forum selection clause) for damages for the death of her husband, who drowned after falling off the cruise ship somewhere off of the coast of Greece. The guest contract contained a provision that attempted to limit the amount of damages that could be collected (although they did not include a specific amount), pursuant to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938965512457022">Athens convention of 1974</xref> and 1976. The court noted that the Guest Contract contained a paragraph that read:
<disp-quote>
<p>16. LIMITATIONS ON CARRIER’S LIABILITY; INDEMNIFICATION. The sixth and seventh sentences of the paragraph read:</p>
<p>Carrier shall be entitled to any and all liability limitations, immunities and rights applicable to it under “Relating to the Carriage of Passengers and Their Luggage by Sea” of 1976 (“Athens Convention”) which limits the Carrier’s liability for death of or personal injury to a Passenger to no more than the applicable amount of Special Drawing Rights as defined therein, and all other limits for damage or loss of personal property. If the Athens Convention or such exemptions are held not to apply for any reason, then all the exemptions from and limitations of liability provided in or authorized by the laws of the United States (including Title 46 U.S. Code Sections 181-186, 188) will apply. (<italic>Wallis v. Princess Cruises, Inc. et al</italic>.)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>On appeal, Wallis argued that the limitation of liability clause did not reasonably communicate the limitation of liability to them. The court noted:
<disp-quote>
<p>a passage contract clause that merely references the “‘Convention Relating to the Carriage of Passengers and Their Luggage by Sea’ of 1976 (‘Athens Convention’)” without providing an approximate monetary limitation does not meaningfully inform a passenger of a liability limitation, and is therefore unenforceable.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As a result of the <italic>Wallis</italic> case, Carnival Cruise Lines, Royal Caribbean Cruise Line, and Norwegian Cruise Line all modified their guest contracts relating to the limitation of liability to conform to the <italic>Wallis</italic> decision. Each now contains limitations that specify an approximate monetary limitation. For example, the Norwegian guest contract reads as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>On cruises that neither embark, disembark nor call at any U.S. port, the Carrier shall be entitled to any and all limitations and immunities provided under the Athens Convention Relating to the Carriage of Passengers and Their Luggage by Sea of 1974, as amended by the Protocol to the Convention Relating to the Carriage of Passengers and Their Luggage by Sea of 1976, which limits Carrier’s liability for death or personal injury of a Guest to no more than 46,666 Special Drawing Rights as defined therein (approximately U.S. $67,000 which fluctuates depending on the daily exchange rate printed in the Wall Street Journal). (item 6)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The resulting changes by all three of the dominant cruise lines to conform their limitation of liability provisions to the <italic>Wallis</italic> decision reflects the dynamic nature of the terms and conditions but also points out how court decisions against one company enables all of the companies to modify their contracts.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1938965512457022">
<title>Arbitration, Class Actions</title>
<p>All three of the top cruise lines have provisions requiring that all disputes other than injury, illness, or death or small claims are subject to arbitration in Miami-Dade County, Florida. Guests also waive their rights to participate in class actions. Another provision found in all of the contracts provides that if the class action waiver is unenforceable, then the guest waives the right to arbitration. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938965512457022">The Federal Arbitration Act (1925)</xref> provides that compulsory and binding arbitration when included as part of a written contract “shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract” (9 U.S.C. Sections 2). (During a recent session, Congress considered an amendment to the Federal Arbitration Act that would, among other items, remove consumer disputes from being covered under the law (S. 987; H.R. 1873).) While the enforceability of a mandatory arbitration provision is beyond the scope of this article, mandatory arbitration provisions have sometimes been successfully attacked, where a consumer is also prevented from participating in a class action for small claims.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1938965512457022">2</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1938965512457022">
<title>Future Trends</title>
<p>While it is difficult to predict the future with regard to either legislation or court decisions that affect the cruise industry, it is clear that changes will occur. Changes may come from legislative changes in existing statutes, and the possibility of litigation with guests is also part of any business that provides a product or service to a consumer. The current strategy of the three dominant North American cruise companies of employing comprehensive terms and conditions, anchored by forum selection, is an effective tool for managing litigation risk with guests. The terms and conditions are easily adapted and modified to conform to court decisions and future changes in legislation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1938965512457022">
<title>Conclusion and Implications for Lodging Companies</title>
<p>Carnival Cruise Lines, Royal Caribbean Cruise Line, and the Norwegian Cruise Line dominate the cruise industry, and over the years they have each independently developed an effective legal strategy that provides each with a decided strategic, legal advantage whenever litigation with a guest occurs. The strategy requires that all guests agree to certain terms and conditions that favor the cruise company, at the time of making the contract with the cruise line (whether the contract is formed online or on paper) and before the cruise departs. At the heart of the strategy is the forum selection clause which requires that all guests who sue the cruise ship company initiate all legal actions in the U.S. District Court for Southern Florida, or if there is no federal jurisdiction, in a court in Miami Dade County, Florida. By effectively requiring almost all suits against the cruise line industry to be heard by the same U.S. District court, the cruise line companies have been able to litigate most cases in the same court, and in the convenient location of their home offices.</p>
<p>In addition, they have all promulgated similar terms and conditions as part of their online and written guest contracts. For example, the three major cruise lines have similar terms and conditions that give the cruise line the right to cancel the cruise; limit the amount of compensation for loss of personal property; limit liability for death and personal injury; limit liability for emotional stress and mental anguish; require written notice of claim and filing of lawsuits within a relatively brief, specified period of time; provide mandatory arbitration for claims other than injury, illness or death, or small claims; and waive the use of class actions.</p>
<p>While the facts of each case usually determine the outcome, the standardized terms and conditions, including the forum selection provision, provide the cruise lines a decided procedural and substantive advantage. Unless the injured guest is from Florida, they will be forced to travel to Florida to conduct their suit in the Florida courts. Injured plaintiffs may be less likely to file suit or more likely to negotiate a settlement rather than deal with the inconvenience of litigating far away from their home. In addition, whenever the courts have ruled against any one of the cruise companies, the terms and conditions of all three are usually altered to satisfy the new requirements imposed by the court. While this is not unusual, and would be expected, corporate counsel will usually know how the U.S. District Court for Southern Florida will rule in the future on a similar set of facts or on the specific wording of a term or condition. With this knowledge of the court and how the law will be applied by that court, along with their ongoing modifications of the terms and conditions, corporate counsel will start each dispute in a strategically superior position.</p>
<sec id="section17-1938965512457022">
<title>Could a Similar Legal Strategy Be Adopted by the Lodging Industry?</title>
<p>The comprehensive list of terms and conditions adopted by the three dominant cruise line companies in North America, and the legal benefits that result, might provide a useful template to companies in the lodging industry that might want to consider the advantages of a comprehensive, strong, integrated online “click wrap” guest contract. In many respects, lodging companies face litigation risks similar to those confronting the cruise industry. As I noted elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1938965512457022">Wilson 2011</xref>):
<disp-quote>
<p>The risk clearly exists for a hotel company to become involved in complex lawsuits or class action lawsuits involving numerous parties that might result if the hotel is involved in a terrorist attack, a natural disaster, a violation of state or federal statutes involving civil rights or the treatment of guests with disabilities, price fixing, or events where multiple parties assert injury for the same cause of action. With a well-designed internet click wrap reservation, the hotel company would be successful in enforcing many of the terms and conditions discussed earlier, and would have an advantage in the litigation by being able to assert more control over the litigation. Control over jurisdiction, choice of law, class action restrictions, compulsory arbitration and limitations on damages are even more important in complex litigation involving numerous parties.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Also, as previously noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1938965512457022">Wilson 2011</xref>), “Courts have continued to enforce contracts involving ‘click wrap’ agreements and the onerous terms and conditions that may be included. If the courts are able to determine that mutual assent to the terms and conditions provisions does exist, the courts will usually enforce those terms and conditions.”</p>
<p>Lodging companies could adopt and incorporate a series of strong terms and conditions included as part of their “click wrap” internet guest contracts similar to those adopted by the cruise companies, including the important forum selection provision. Many of the legal advantages now accruing to the cruise industry could also benefit lodging companies.</p>
