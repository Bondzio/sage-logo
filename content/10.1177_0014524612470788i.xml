<p>Scholars and students of the gospels have long felt the need for help in studying the special material (<italic>Sondergut</italic>) of Matthew and Luke. Now Brice C. Jones has responded to this need by bringing out <italic>Matthean and Lukan Special Material: A Brief Introduction with Texts in Greek and English</italic>, a compact book with three chapters. The first chapter provides an overview of the synoptic problem and a treatment of the special material of Matthew and Luke. The second and third chapters present the special material of Matthew and Luke in Greek with an English translation.</p>
<p>In the first chapter the author briefly surveys the current state of the discussion of the synoptic problem by outlining the positions of the three main competing solutions – the Griesbach or Two-Gospel hypothesis, the Two-Source hypothesis, and the Farrer–Goulder–Goodacre hypothesis. The discussion of each theory is brief, but Jones dutifully refers his readers to places where they can find more extensive treatments. In dealing with the special material of Matthew and Luke, Jones notes that scholars have moved away from Streeter’s position that the material goes back to two written sources (M and L); but he also shows that no consensus has emerged on whether the material derives from written sources, the oral tradition, or the redactional work of the evangelists.</p>
<p>Scholars studying the Matthean and Lukan special material grapple with three questions: (1) What is the extent of the special material?; (2) What is origin of the special material?; and (3) How does the special material function in the narrative and theological worlds of the gospels? Jones does not discuss the third question except to indicate that his book intends to facilitate the study of the special material by drawing the texts together in one volume. He devotes some attention to the second question by referring to recent post-Streeter treatments of the origin of the special material, some of them book-length. He concludes that much more work remains to be done before we can clarify this question. The first question, though, lies at the heart of Jones’ project; and it deserves a much fuller treatment than the author provides.</p>
<p>We need comprehensive lists of Matthean and Lukan special material texts in order to study the material. Jones does not provide comprehensive lists, instead relying mainly on the lists of Mark Allan Powell (<italic>Fortress Introduction to the Gospels</italic> [Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1998], pp. 62, 86). In fairness, we should note that neither Jones nor Powell claim to provide comprehensive lists. Still comprehensive lists alone can truly facilitate study of the gospels, and a work like Jones’ should provide such lists. It might seem an easy task to construct such lists, for the researcher need only move through a synopsis noting the Matthean passages without a Markan or Lukan (Q) parallel and the Lukan passages without a Markan and Matthean (Q) parallel. However, one inevitably encounters gray areas. For example, Matthew and Luke can edit their sources quite freely so that we often need to distinguish texts where Matthew and Luke freely edit Mark or Q from texts where they are not using either of their two main sources. These gray areas need not cause serious difficulties if the researcher clearly identifies the problem, exercises good judgment, and remains consistent.</p>
<p>We can illustrate the problem from Jones’ treatment of the Matthean special material. Jones includes all the longer passages like the Birth and Infancy Narratives (Matt 1:2-2:21) and the Parable of the Laborers in the Vineyard (Matt 20:1-16). However, much of the special material consists of very short texts of only a verse or two. Jones includes some of these texts like the saying on Casting Pearls before Swine (Matt 7:6), but not others like the saying on Going a Second Mile (Matt 5:41) or John’s protest at Jesus’ baptism (Matt 3:14-15). A similar problem surfaces in Jones’ treatment of Luke’s special material. Again, Jones includes most of the longer passages like the Infancy Narrative (Luke 1:1-2:52) and the Parable of the Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11-32), but he strangely omits passages like Herod’s Desire to Kill Jesus (Luke 13:31-33).</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, this book has value as the first attempt to collect all special material texts in one place; and it should stimulate further study of the special material of Matthew and Luke, a task that would move our understanding of these two gospels onto a new level.</p>
