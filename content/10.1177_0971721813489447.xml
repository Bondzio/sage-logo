<abstract>
<p>The onset of constitutional democracy in South Africa potentially marked a critical juncture in the evolution of its innovation system. At this point the Ministry responsible for science and technology adopted the innovation systems approach. This adoption followed the IDRC OECD-style review of 1993. Nineteen years later, after a full-fledged OECD Review, the extent to which the innovation system demonstrates continuity or change may be assessed. The assessment is broadly functionalist and considers the role of institutions and actors. While the polity has become more inclusive, extractive economic institutions persist. Likewise the social contract between science and society has evolved but it continues to show extractive attributes. It appears that thus far the innovation systems approach has been more of a rhetorical than a practical device with the pre-1994 and present innovation systems showing both continuity and disjuncture. It is these challenges that the current Ministerial Review of the STI Landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0971721813489447">DST 2012</xref>) has sought to address.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><sc>THE 1994 INCEPTION</sc> of constitutional democracy in South Africa marked a critical juncture for the country. Political inclusion was guaranteed and the previously outlawed African National Congress came to power under the slogan ‘a better life for all’. Nineteen years later wealth disparities, sluggish economic performance, severe health problems and services failures have not yielded that promise. GDP growth with a median value of 3.2 per cent has remained below the targeted 6 per cent and few employment opportunities have emerged for the hundreds of thousands entering the job market each year. The modernist agenda of 1994 has had to confront realities of resurgent traditionalism, racial exclusion, resource nationalism and international trade under WTO rule. Arguably the promise of 1994 has not come about even as the country has participated in the commodities super-cycle driven by the re-positioning of China on the world stage. Numerous commentators have studied the stickiness of South Africa’s growth seeking answers in economic policy (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0971721813489447">Dube et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0971721813489447">Terreblanche, 2012</xref>) and politics (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0971721813489447">Plaut and Holden, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>For its part the new Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology contributed to the policy debate through its seminal White Paper on Science and Technology that suggested that the country’s innovation policy should be framed within the innovation systems approach whereby ‘a national system of innovation can be thought of as a set of functioning institutions, organisations and policies which interact constructively in the pursuit of a common set of social and economic goals and objectives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0971721813489447">DACST, 1996</xref>, p. 20). I would suggest that in terms of this broad definition South Africa pre-1994 already had an innovation system that achieved notable successes, some of societal benefit (for example, organ transplantation) and some less so (for example, weapons of mass destruction). Given the residual competences built up over time, high expectations were placed on the inherited innovation system as a contributor to the modernising agenda of 1994 and the transformation of society. As the White paper claimed ‘the national system of innovation will be central to the empowerment of all South Africans as they seek to achieve social, political, economic and environmental goals’ (ibid., p. 8).</p>
<p>This article seeks to understand the evolution of this inherited system of innovation over the short period of democratic governance and the extent to which the objectives for the system have been realised. The White Paper provided the markers for such assessment in that
<disp-quote>
<p>…a national system of innovation can only be judged as healthy if the knowledge, technologies, products and processes produced by the national system of science, engineering and technology have been converted into increased wealth, by industry and business and into an improved quality of life for all members of society. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0971721813489447">DACST, 1996</xref>, p. 19)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It stands to reason that innovation systems are linked umbilically with the broader economic system in which they are embedded. In South Africa change in political institutions brought inclusive democracy, but the economic institutions remain extractive in the terminology of Acemoglu and Robinson (2012). This suggests that the innovation system is likely to exhibit similar lack of change. If so, what shape might a future innovation system take and what can government do to facilitate such change? It is this question that is explored in the article. To answer the question this analysis seeks to break new ground in exploring the underlying drivers responsible for the exhibited lack of change. By so doing it takes a different point of departure to that of other writers on South Africa’s innovation policy. For example Pouris (2007) uses scientometrics to seek evidence of shifts in emphasis; Mouton (2003) takes a socio-historic stance characterising the system as exhibiting three phases—amateur science from 1806 to 1948); the institutionalised science of the Apartheid era (1948–1994); and the third transition of the post-1994 period. Kaplan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0971721813489447">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0971721813489447">2008</xref>), using STI indicators works from a rationalist perspective identifying numerous instances of contradiction between the assertions of the emergent innovation policy and the facts on the ground. However whilst offering important context and observing the symptoms of the innovation system these authors stop short of diagnosis.</p>
<p>It is this gap that is explored in the article. To this end, I analyse historical context, policy intent and implementation. Attention is focused on the system institutions and actors to tease out an explanation for the status quo and the way that regulation has been used to maintain or effect social change (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0971721813489447">Burrell and Morgan, 1979</xref>). The analysis is located within the innovation systems approach as laid out by Lundvall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0971721813489447">1985</xref>), Freeman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0971721813489447">1987</xref>), Nelson and Winter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0971721813489447">1992</xref>) and more recently Lundvall et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0971721813489447">2009</xref>). Innovation entails constant interaction among the actors and institutions of the system. Their ability to effect internal change and introduce new products and processes into the market depends on economic considerations, technical know-how, the ability to learn, availability of capital and supportive regulations. The choice of the qualifier ‘approach’ is important. In his overview of the field of innovation studies Fagerberg (2006, p. 3) notes ‘no single discipline deals with all aspects of innovation’.</p>
<p>Three independent reviews that provide an objective appraisal are pivotal to the analysis. The first is the Mission Report of the IDRC review—<italic>Towards a Science and Technology Policy for a Democratic South Africa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0971721813489447">IDRC, 1993</xref>). The second is the <italic>OECD Review of South Africa’s Innovation Policy</italic> of 2006/2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0971721813489447">OECD 2007</xref>). These two Reviews willy-nilly anchor the science and innovation policy debate within an OECD economic policy framework. The third is the <italic>Report of the Ministerial Review Committee on the Science, Technology and Innovation landscape</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0971721813489447">DST, 2012</xref>), which at time of writing was awaiting Cabinet ratification.</p>
<p>This introduction is followed by seven sections. The second examines the evolution of the innovation system of the Apartheid years, the period of the ‘Apartheid developmental state’. The next covers the period from the 1980s that saw a drift toward neoliberalism. The fourth section covers the period of the three democratic administrations from 1994 to 2009. The fifth section then examines the period of policy contestation, starting with the 2007 OECD Review and moving into the early years of the present Zuma administration. The sixth section considers the recommendations of the Ministerial Review Committee and the final section offers concluding remarks and suggestions for policy.</p>

<sec id="section2-0971721813489447">
<title>The Apartheid Developmental State and Innovation System 1.0</title>
<p>From the 1870s South Africa, an agglomeration of two Crown Colonies, two Boer Republics and numerous African chieftaincies, experienced a mining-led industrial revolution. Over 1880–1910 competition for this wealth led to unification under the British Crown and the immiseration and dispossession of the indigenous peoples. Fully codified ‘Grand Apartheid’ gradually emerged as a specific means of ensuring settler hegemony and the interests of mining capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0971721813489447">Simons and Simons, 1983</xref>). This saw the construction of a form of developmental state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0971721813489447">ECA 2011</xref>) that over 1910 to 1980 placed the commanding heights of the economy in state hands. Pre-1994 South Africa shows corresponds to what Acemoglu and Robinson (2012) term extractive political and economic institutions, extractive being the antonym of inclusive.</p>
<p>In due course the Apartheid state developed the public components of the innovation system, comprising thirty-six ethnically based universities and ‘technikons,’ eight science research councils and some fifty or so other public research organisations (PROs). These worked with a host of research and development laboratories in the private sector, especially in mining and chemicals, all supported by scientific and technological services companies and trade, professional and learned associations. Apartheid rules prevailed; ‘blacks need not apply’. In 1994 for example, the Agriculture Research Council had one black graduate among its 1,000 graduate staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0971721813489447">Motala, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>At the heart of the public sector was the CSIR, founded in 1945 and closely modelled on other Commonwealth PROs. CSIR quickly diversified its activities and spun out many of the future PROs—the HSRC, Medical Research Council and Atomic Energy Commission. Its second President Meiring Naude stated its leitmotif as the principle that ‘Research cannot be dictated and organized from above; it must grow from within the organization’ (Meiring and Brown (1977, p. 79), surely a variation on the original linear model often attributed to Vannevar Bush. One measure of CSIR dominance is revealed through its history of USPTO awards and over 1980–2010 South African assignees annually gained some 100 USPTO. Over 1985 to 2004 CSIR accounted for around a quarter of all these patents.</p>
<p>Other state institutions that played a decisive role in the economy and war machine were electricity utility Eskom, iron and steel producer ISCOR, the coal-to-gasoline company SASOL, the Atomic Energy Corporation and the various companies associated with the Armaments Corporation of South Africa. These were strong institutions that worked to ensure state dominance. Links to the private sector came through the then State Security Council.</p>
<p>The innovation system associated with the Apartheid developmental state produced world-class science in catalysis, environmental science, clinical medicine, metallurgy, plant and animal sciences linked into various sectoral systems of innovation (SSI). One example of an SSI is that producing weapons, that stretched 50 km northwards from the East Rand through then Verwoerdburg and Lyttleton to Pretoria, comprising missile, aircraft, chemical and biological warfare, torpedoes, artillery and vehicle systems in various laboratories, companies, the CSIR, secret PROs and the universities.</p>
<p>Indeed the 1993 IDRC Mission declared that it was ‘struck by the extensive capability of South Africa’s science and technology system…it constitutes a major asset which a new government will need both to nurture and mobilize’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0971721813489447">IDRC 1993</xref>, p. viii). One thus is justified in describing this system as Innovation System 1.0.</p>
<p>To maintain morale in the face of the international academic boycott the state in the mid 1980s introduced two innovations: a system for rating individual scientists who would receive personal funding according to their prowess and a journal subsidy system to reward publication in domestic and international peer reviewed journals. Innovation System 1.0 might be seen as resting on a social contract between scientists and the Apartheid developmental state: on one hand to deliver the technological means to support the economy and Apartheid’s warfare state; on the hand to enjoy freedom to conduct open-ended scientific inquiry.</p>
<p>This focus on individuals goes some way towards explaining why it is that over time South Africa has consistently devoted 20 per cent of gross expenditure on R&amp;D (GERD) to basic research. It also explains how it is that the country has succoured four Nobel Laureates in the sciences and achieved notable scientific, medical and technological successes including the world’s first human heart transplant and significant work on early hominids, astronomy and astrophysics. As such Innovation System 1.0 fits the Acemoglu–Robinson parameters of an extractive set of institutions, collectively and individually. (White) scientists were admired and feted by Government; the Black majority was excluded. There was an implicit belief that innovation relied on the work of individuals, much as what is termed ‘Schumpeter Mark I’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0971721813489447">Fagerberg, 2006</xref>, p. 9).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0971721813489447">
<title>The Slide to Neo-liberalism</title>
<p>There is a belief that that it was the post-1994 ANC that introduced the neo-liberal economic agenda to South Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0971721813489447">Antentas, 2006</xref>). This is not the case. South Africa c.1980 displayed high concentrations of power: nationalised industries of the public sector; and the mining finance houses of the private sector. The latter, that operated under strict capital controls, diversified first vertically into energy, forestry and engineering and then horizontally into automobiles, banking, insurance and leisure industries even as they were constrained by import substitution imperatives. The Apartheid developmental state combined market liberalism with a large public sector, administered pricing regimes, state marketing boards and many laws intended to ensure racial privilege.</p>
<p>By 1979 the pressure of sanctions, the internal civil war and wars in Angola and Mozambique, the cost of Apartheid’s own Balkan states (the ‘Bantustans’) and rising labour costs led to financial stringency. The first consequence was the privatisation of SASOL. This was the apogee of the Apartheid developmental state that then began to yield to pragmatic political change and structural adjustment. In 1981 the railways and ports were corporatised into SA Transport Services; 1983 saw the failed experiment of the Tri-Cameral Parliament; 1989 the sale of state iron and steel conglomerate ISCOR; agriculture was deregulated in 1992. The commanding heights were levelled.</p>
<p>In parallel was a shift in the economic thinking of the liberation movement. Its neo-Keynesian Reconstruction and Development Programme was to be the mainstay of electoral campaigning, but another position was forming. The neo-liberalism of the late Apartheid years segued into that of the successor democratic state.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0971721813489447">
<title>From IDRC Review to Innovation System 1.1</title>
<p>The democratic order that Archbishop Tutu termed the ‘Rainbow Nation,’ inherited the largest economy in Africa complete with the only innovation system on the continent worthy of that name. The 1994 Government of National Unity duly retained the principles of a mixed economy and continued with limited privatisation of state assets. By this point in time the economy was strongly services-led with the primary sector at 13 per cent, secondary at 24 per cent and services 63 per cent of GDP. Mining and agriculture had steadily shed jobs from their 1980s highs, shrinking by 25 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively.</p>
<p>This political change occurred in a rapidly changing geo-political environment. Already in 1992 the moribund National Party government had relaxed its foreign investment rules so that leading firms could expand abroad. Then on 1 January 1995 South Africa, a long-standing GATT member acceded to the newly established World Trade Organization and industry, already deprived of the large military contracts of the Apartheid years faced the elimination of protective tariffs and was encouraged to surge northwards. Today’s market leaders on the Johannesburg bourse now generate close to fifty percent of their revenues abroad.</p>
<p>The emphasis on continuity laid down in the new politically inclusive Constitution naturally shaped participation in the economy. While retaining its underlying structure, business was to be open to all who had the means to find a way in. The economy would be ‘inclusive.’ An innovation, ‘black economic empowerment’ later enshrined in law, entailed the preferential purchase by previously disadvantaged individuals<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0971721813489447">1</xref></sup> of equity stakes in companies at reduced prices that were funded with loan capital to be repaid through expected dividend flows. This concession on the part of capital has earlier precedence. In 1963 Anglo American, as a strategy to promote Afrikaner capital sold General Mining Union Corporation (Gencor) to Federale Mynbou. In due course Gencor became a component of BHP Billiton, by revenue now the second largest mining company in the world after Glencore.</p>
<p>Arguably the economy continued as a set of extractive institutions—profits increasingly flowed abroad; driven by skills shortages senior management was able to extract super salaries; labour unions, not to be outdone, restricted the growth of formal employment and raised their wages. Employment equity law provided the means for ‘previously disadvantaged individuals’ to enter the workplace. While quotas were illegal, they operated under the radar, with few legal challenges being raised. Fundamentally however the economic structure remained unchanged and the new state was unable to drive growth beyond an average of 3 per cent so that unemployment remained stuck at around 25 per cent. Inflexible labour law saw to it that the cost of labour rose; the cost of doing business remained high. To mitigate the effects of economic exclusion, the warfare state became a welfare state with some 15 million persons receiving state benefits.</p>
<p>What then the post Apartheid Innovation System? The 1993 IDRC Mission had adopted the standard OECD innovation system review methodology—a country self-review, an inward visit of experts and the presentation of the Mission Report for country response. The Mission found ‘a highly fragmented group of institutions…frequently described by officials…as dysfunctional…(with) a leadership vacuum on S&amp;T at ministerial level’ (idem: 22). Resource allocations were frozen, priorities were skewed away from the challenges facing the country, its institutions were racially biased and there was ‘a crisis in the educational system at all levels’ (idem: 23). A particular concern was that the boards of statutory bodies should in future be representative of the full range of interests and be demographically representative and have hiring and firing powers. The Review also suggested a number of social missions for S&amp;T—housing, electrification, water and education and that foresight methods be used to set research priorities.</p>
<p>The Mission carried out its deliberations even as the Interim Constitution of 1993 was being finalised. In response to the IDRC Mission and other policy processes, notably the Science and Technology Initiative (STI), the new Department crafted a Green Paper on S&amp;T, followed by a White Paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0971721813489447">DACST 1996</xref>). Alongside came the planning for a Research and Technology foresight study. CSIR staff played strong roles in the STI, the Green and White Papers and the Foresight, with many others from organised labour, political formations, industry and academia being drawn into what were highly consultative processes. The White Paper then made the seminal proposal to adopt the innovation systems approach. This was in keeping with a government-wide attempt to distance the new dispensation from the Apartheid past. This distancing naturally involved both symbols (new national flag, national anthem, national crests) and rhetorical devices. So for example Treasury came forward with ‘zero-based budgeting’, Health declared an ‘essential national health agenda’ and Education introduced ‘outcomes-based education’. The White Paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0971721813489447">DACST, 1996</xref>, p. 19) asserted that the use of the concept of a national system of innovation as a framework for policy is an attempt to signal a radical departure from the current situation and understanding in South Africa, introducing a new view of the role and status of the sciences, engineering and technology in national development’ and went on to assert that ‘A well-managed and properly functioning national system of innovation will make it possible for all South Africans to enjoy the economic, socio-political and intellectual benefits of science and technology.’</p>
<p>Such use of rhetoric has of course occurred elsewhere. Sharif (2009, p. 410) writing on the innovation policy of Hong Kong noted that ‘Instead of establishing policies that incorporate principal elements of the IS approach into their content, Hong Kong has traded on the growing prestige of the approach to enhance the perception that its development policies leverage the latest trends in academic research’. The problem of policy rhetoric is far from unique to South Africa.</p>
<p>The White Paper declared that Government (ibid., p. 20) would host a well-functioning innovation system by ensuring the following:
<list id="list1-0971721813489447" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>South Africa has in place a set of institutions, organisations and policies which give effect to the various functions of a national system of innovation;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There is a constructive set of interactions among those institutions, organisations and policies; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There is in place an agreed upon set of goals and objectives which are consonant with an articulated vision of the future which is being sought.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>This would be achieved by government addressing:
<list id="list2-0971721813489447" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Policy formulation and resource allocation at the national level;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Regulatory policy-making;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Performance-level financing of innovation-related activities;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Performance of innovation-related activities;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Human resource development and capacity building;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Provision of infrastructure;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Performance measurement and evaluation;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Knowledge transfer.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The White Paper recommendations were then implemented with new statutes introduced to create a National Advisory Council on Innovation (NACI) and consolidation of grant making in a National Research Foundation. Other instruments included: introduction of competitive grants; review of the Science Councils; establishing a system of performance measurement and monitoring. Competitive grants were housed in an Innovation Fund that held out the promise of steering the system. After incubating in DACST for two years the Innovation Fund moved to the new National Research Foundation. The subsequent Science, Engineering and Technology Institutions reviews of 1997 then brought a first round of external, independent scrutiny to bear on the Science Councils, but did not alter the size and shape of the institutional landscape.</p>
<p>The Foresight Study of 1995–1999 was already underway when the White Paper was adopted. It drew on the experience of foresight studies of the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands, adopting an eclectic mix of the UK panel and German Delphi methods. Key differences were that three of the South African panels had social goals and panel members were not only younger, but displayed a good gender and group balance. Generally, the Foresight offered few surprises other than its abrupt end after the tabling of its final report in 1999. Its main legacy was in opening of careers in government for the younger panel coordinators and members.</p>
<p>Next came the 2001 Biotechnology Strategy that sought to build competences in third generation biotechnologies. Its authors also urged that efforts be made to face up to the AIDS pandemic. In the event neither of these intentions were realised. Instead the Biotechnology Strategy was used to create four Biotechnology Regional Innovation Centres that signaled the desire of DACST to stretch its mandate to the provincial level beyond its national constraints.</p>
<p>This was followed by the National Research and Development Strategy (DST, 2002) that coincided with the formation of a separate Department of Science and Technology. The Strategy takes as starting point six issues: the ending of Apartheid’s military technology missions; a set of security concerns; the claim that the science workforce was overwhelmingly white, male and ageing; the claimed reduction in business sector R&amp;D; the need for additional intellectual property law; and fragmented governance structures. To bridge the apparent technology vacuum it declared five ‘new’ supply-side technology missions—ICT, biotechnology, technology for manufacturing, exploitation of natural resources and technology for poverty reduction.</p>
<p>At least three of the six factors underpinning the Strategy reflect a disjuncture between fact and the opinions of its drafters. For a start the reduction in military R&amp;D began in 1988 with the withdrawal from Angola. Secondly the 2001/02 R&amp;D Survey shows that for the system as a whole white male researchers over forty-five years of age made up but 20 per cent of the total number of researchers—ageing white males might characterise the universities but not the whole system. Also business R&amp;D was up, not down. These factual disjunctures are odd given the claim of the Strategy to be ‘indicator based.’ One may take this critique yet further in questioning whether the claimed leakage of intellectual property that necessitated new legislation was real or imagined.</p>
<p>Central to the thinking of the Strategy was the schematic of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0971721813489447">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0971721813489447-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The upward arrows from R&amp;D activity toward the central block ‘technical progress—improvement and innovation,’ amount to endorsement of the linear model of innovation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0971721813489447">Fagerberg, 2006</xref>). This formulation is consistent with the earlier White Paper emphasis on the importance of technology diffusion, especially of ‘available knowledge’ for technological change. This is surprising, coming but six years after the adoption of the ‘innovation systems approach’ and shows the continued dominance of a science-led approach to innovation, an approach that was dominant in Western economies in the 1960s and 1970s, but that gave way in the 1980s to the formulation of the interactive system model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0971721813489447">World Bank, 2010</xref>). The rhetoric of the innovation systems approach and policy implementation was found wanting.</p>
<p>The R&amp;D Strategy boldly set the target of GERD: GDP of 1 per cent for financial year 2008–2009 to be accompanied by a doubling (in current Rands) of state funding for R&amp;D. This was achieved ahead of schedule, but was accompanied by equivalent rises in BERD and HERD as well as a rise in GDP, so that GERD: GDP peaked at 0.95 per cent in 2007–2008. The attainment of the targeted 1 per cent still eluded the innovation system out to 2009–2010.</p>
<p>Many observers concur that the innovation system continues to show fragmentation (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0971721813489447">CHE, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0971721813489447">Kaplan, 2004</xref>). Then again, such fragmentation is an international phenomenon as Edler and Kuhlmann (2008) show for Germany and Melo (2001) for Latin America. To deal with fragmentation the Strategy surprisingly advocated the termination of the Science Vote, with Science Council budgets to come from line departments thereafter. NACI had since 1997 attended to the allocation of the Science Vote, so that there was some central oversight, if not actual coordination regarding this source of public funds. To replace the weak coordination of the Science Vote the DST proposed a new three level ‘New Strategic Management Model’ whereby DST would be responsible for cross-cutting S&amp;T, sector-specific S&amp;T would be the task of the various science councils (Agriculture, Health, Mining) whilst S&amp;T services would be attended to in relevant Departments and other PROs, including science councils. Cross-cutting S&amp;T included early stage R&amp;D and new generic technology platforms. In line with this thinking CSIR was moved from the Department of Trade and Industry to DST. In the event, the dismantling of the Science Vote saw the Science Council budgets fall under their respective line departments with predictable loss of coordination.</p>
<p>DST also sought and was given the mandate to monitor government R&amp;D budgets and expenditure and table an annual report on this money to the National Assembly. However compilation proved to be impossible and the attempt to gather R&amp;D data was abandoned in favour of monitoring scientific and technological activities. That proved to be as difficult a call, with four years of trial and error needed to obtain a reasonably comprehensive estimate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0971721813489447">DST, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>As to the provision of human resources for the innovation system, one found stasis in higher education and slow growth in the Science Councils. The near doubling of researchers in the business sector reflected organic growth and improved R&amp;D Survey coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0971721813489447">HSRC, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>South Africa’s is a tragic story of the damage that racial exclusion brings with it. The 1950s destruction of the few avenues of quality education for the majority has consequences into the present, two generation later. For a variety of reasons the education system still fails to generate enough school completers for the science-based careers that must be part of a growing economy. The Global Competitiveness Indices for South Africa tell their own story: on the one hand the country was 4th for Financial Market Development; it was 131st for Health and Primary Education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0971721813489447">WEF, 2010</xref>). Only one other country in the GCI shows such disparities in its GCI scores and ‘basic requirements’ (health, basic education) and that is the United States. South Africa is an outlier with its huge Gini coefficient and class and racially stratified life indicators. Its school system though absorbing funds in line with international norms, lags behind in terms of outputs. The 2002 TIMSS ranked South African grade 8 and grade 12 students last for science achievement among the fifty participating countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0971721813489447">Reddy, 2006</xref>). The reasons for this poor performance go beyond the scope of this article.</p>
<p>Regarding demographics, in 1994 but 5 per cent of graduate staff in the Science Councils were persons of colour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0971721813489447">Motala, 1994</xref>). Today, drawing on the data offered in Science Council annual reports, one finds that upwards of 50 per cent of researchers are black. This is a profound shift in a relatively short time and points to the power of state institutions to pursue the new racial agenda of redress. Measured by the production of PhD graduates the initial upward trend saturated at 1,300 a year, a quarter of whom were foreign students that were in any case required to exit the country upon completion of their studies.</p>
<p>What of higher education research? Kahn (2010) examined change in the higher education research agenda by considering World of Science publication counts by subject area. This showed the persistence of traditional areas of competence in plant sciences and medicine and the environment, corresponding to the continuation of the ‘bi-environmental model’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0971721813489447">Glanzel, 2000</xref>). The volume of scientific publication rose and the country world share of scientific publications remained fairly steady. What was notable was the response of the health sciences to the HIV epidemic that saw publications on infectious diseases, public, environmental &amp; occupational health and immunology leap in prominence. This shift occurred in spite of, not because of government policy that then exhibited ‘AIDS denialism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0971721813489447">Nattrass, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Innovation policy instruments impacting on the business sector include an enhanced tax incentive for R&amp;D the regulation of benefit sharing of intellectual property arising from public funds. The impact of this law is as yet unclear. Considerable policy attention was also given to indigenous knowledge to protect local knowledge and biodiversity. A thread common to these laws is a fear that something intangible is being lost, or spirited away, what might be termed intangible resource nationalism that parallels the resource nationalism associated with natural resource rent seeking. A case may also be made that the prowess of South African companies to gain international market share draws upon the ‘home-based research’ of the innovation system, with its world class research universities, competent Science Councils and extensive international networks, as found in high levels of participation in the EU Framework Programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0971721813489447">DST, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Until 2009 DST was not led by an ANC Minister, which made it a policy follower, rather than a policy leader. A rare exception to this occurred in 2005 when President Mbeki, as Chairperson of his annual meeting with Vice Chancellors invited the Minister of Science and Technology and the Minister of Public Enterprises (‘owner’ of various R&amp;D performing state owned enterprises R&amp;D) jointly to address his perceived detection of a failure of the universities to generate the high level skills needed by the economy. For a brief moment in time DST was now a policy driver and even though this intruded on the terrain of the Department of Education, it used the chance to set up the South African Research Chairs Initiative (SARChI). With Treasury support SARChI got off to a good start in 2006, but over the next two years stumbled as President Mbeki’s star waned and the global financial meltdown struck. Even so SARChI is the most innovative effort by DST to address the human resources nexus. By design SARChI focuses on individuals, many of whom were already research leaders, rather than on research groups and by design, if not default amounts to a continuation of individualistic science. Despite the injection of SARChI the total FTE of research personnel across the innovation system showed but slight growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0971721813489447">Kahn, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>It has been shown that small changes aside, the post-1994 innovation system demonstrates institutional continuity with its predecessor. The same set of public research organisations remain; the underlying thrust of innovation policy remains squarely on supply side measures through which scientists decide on priorities and are funded accordingly. The main change has been demographic. Where the IDRC Review had castigated Innovation System 1.0 as uncoordinated and fragmented, Innovation System 1.1 might be criticised for being even more so. Nor did the ‘new’ innovation system directly address the housing, energy, electrification needs that IDRC had identified. The innovation system did not generate major innovations that captured public attention, aside from numerous products for the mobile telephony and digital TV industries. Patenting remained at around 100 per year, reflecting the lack of growth in high-tech exports, while SASOL displaced CSIR as the leading institutional patentee. Cumulative investments in the order of ZAR 3 billion made through the Innovation Fund and Biotechnology Regional Innovation Centres gave rise to no major breakthroughs. The attempt to enter the electric vehicle market with the Joule battery-powered car yielded a comely body, but no market interest. The ZAR300 million investment came to nothing. An unsung achievement was that the country retained its standing in the top fifteen of countries registering plant varieties. Considerable skill was evident in the building of the SA Large Telescope and in preparing a bid for the USD 2 billion Square Kilometre Array. In May 2012 South Africa and Australia became joint awardees of the project. In effect the large pre-1994 military missions were replaced with ‘big science’.</p>
<p>It is for these reasons that the post-1994 innovation system might well be labelled Innovation System 1.1. In particular it did not exhibit a shift toward social needs. This was the situation when the OECD was invited to undertake a formal review of innovation policy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0971721813489447">
<title>Policy Contestation</title>
<p>The 2007 OECD innovation policy review followed the standard three-stage process, with NACI preparing the self assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0971721813489447">NACI, 2006</xref>). Again a number of CSIR personnel were central to this process. The Review itself was tabled in March 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0971721813489447">OECD, 2007</xref>) and acknowledged that ‘the most striking achievement of South Africa has simply been to defy the extremely poor framework conditions facing the innovation system in the early 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0971721813489447">OECD, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The Review noted that there was a small core of technologically strong innovation-performing business enterprises, coupled with a well-performing university and research institute system but of a scale suited to a much smaller population (idem., p. 5). Moreover, despite the desire for knowledge-based development and growth and state-of-art policy instruments, there were large problems that called for significant reshaping of the system. Besides lacking a holistic governance structure, the diagnosis was that the country was held back by its weak school system and the innovation system was running down through natural ageing. What was needed was a rethink of the role of the state in the innovation system, along with serious attention to address what was termed the ‘engineering gap’ involving weaknesses in design, engineering, entrepreneurship, R&amp;D capacity and R&amp;D management. The Review identified the need to review declared priorities; define some missions by sectors and according to user problems (demand-side) and to use innovation to develop the ‘second economy’.</p>
<p>In essence, without explicitly so stating, the 2007 OECD Review was declaring that the imperatives of the 1993 IDRC Mission had not been met. The Mandela administration Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology (DACST) and its successor Department of Science and Technology (DST) might have introduced best of breed innovation policy instruments similar to those found in OECD countries, yet there was little evidence of change. To repeat: the contention that the label Innovation System 1.1 is appropriate.</p>
<p>Unintentionally echoing the IDRC Mission the major governance recommendations of the OECD Review were for the establishment of a cabinet level body to generate holistic research and innovation policy; to re-think the structure and role of NACI; to improve cross-government coordination; to re-think the range and function of the Science Councils; and to improve mechanisms for strategic intelligence gathering. In the event the tabling of the OECD Review was eclipsed by the near simultaneous launch of the Ten-year Plan for Innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0971721813489447">DST, 2008</xref>), a document that had been in preparation since late 2006. The main response of DST was to use the Review recommendation to establish a TEKES-like intermediary organisation to advance the creation of the Foundation for Technological Innovation (FTI). No other DST response was forthcoming.</p>
<p>In due course the Foundation for Technological Innovation, first suggested in the 2002 R&amp;D Strategy, was established as the Technological Innovation Agency (TIA), but without significant new funding. This was achieved by bundling together the Innovation Fund, the BRICs, technology incubators and the advanced manufacturing facility at CSIR. One might speculate that creating FTI/TIA was an overarching goal of DST and that it naturally used the OECD Review to garner support. A response to the OECD Review could wait.</p>
<p>The TIA came about through institutional re-arrangement, not a green field process. This migration of organisations seems to be a regular feature in the public sector of the innovation system. There are numerous examples of such migrations over the period 1994 to 2008.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0971721813489447">2</xref></sup> These mergers and acquisitions show one overarching commonalty: they involved very little new money.</p>
<p>Returning to the Ten Year Plan, this continued with linear model thinking in arguing that wealth creation depended on increasing R&amp;D expenditure and knowledge outputs, with a target of GERD: GDP of 2 per cent by 2018. The Plan saw progress being driven by four elements:
<list id="list3-0971721813489447" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Human capital development</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Knowledge generation and exploitation (R&amp;D).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Knowledge infrastructure.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Enablers to address the ‘innovation chasm’ between research results and socioeconomic outcomes.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The second and fourth bullets are classic linear model thinking. As is known from innovation survey evidence, most firms do not conduct in-house R&amp;D; most firms gain their ideas for innovation from other firms; and non-technological innovation is as important as technological innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0971721813489447">Blankley and Moses, 2009</xref>). These perspectives, all available from the National Innovation Survey 2002–2004, are absent from the ‘Innovation’ Plan.</p>
<p>The Plan, constructed internally by DST, aligns itself with the theme of Grand Challenges found for example in the plans of India, Brazil and the United States. The Plan advocates five Grand Challenges—biotechnology, energy, space science and technology, climate change and ‘human and social dynamics’ that are intended ‘to drive the transformation of the South African economy to a knowledge economy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0971721813489447">DST, 2008</xref>, p. 4). According to the World Economic Forum global competitiveness indicators, South Africa is presently a ‘stage 2’ efficiency driven economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0971721813489447">WEF, 2010</xref>) by contrast with Brazil that is in transition to ‘stage 3’, the innovation economy.</p>
<p>The tenor of the Plan is more of a vision statement than a nuts and bolts plan and is avowedly supply side driven. So far no budgets have been declared in public.</p>
<p>On the economic front the Mbeki administration (1999–2008) faced with low growth and high unemployment sought the resources of the Harvard Centre for International Development. Their recommendations came after two years of work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0971721813489447">Hausmann, 2007</xref>)—sustained economic growth with job creation required re-orientation toward the export of manufactured goods in the mode of Korea, Taiwan and Singapore. Shortages of high-level skills were a binding constraint, whose absence restricted the utilisation of unskilled labour. A rise in manufactured exports would automatically lead to a rise in employment across the board. The deeper problem lay in labour market inflexibility and the low level of training of the workforce.</p>
<p>Trade union resistance lay in the path of dealing with both of these binding constraints. Capital for its part was making use of global opportunities and seemed reluctant to commit to local expansion. Comparisons with Malaysia over the period of its New Economic Policy are warranted: that country expanded the state role and offered generous tax and race policy exemptions to foreign capital and attracted some of the highest rates of FDI yet seen. South Africa took a cautious neo-liberal approach and insisted that all parties accord with employment equity and capital equity regulations. FDI was modest and mainly flowed to acquisitions rather than green field investment, the exceptions being in the automotive industry that benefited from the subsidies of the Automotive Industries Development Plan.</p>
<p>Such was the situation in 2008 when a palace coup led to the election of Jacob Zuma as ANC President who in the 2009 parliamentary elections succeeded his former nemesis, Thabo Mbeki, as President of the Republic. This ushered in a shift in economic policy, with the ascent to cabinet of additional representatives from the trades unions and the Communist Party. Moreover the new Minister of Finance, though a Communist Party stalwart, was not a member of the ANC National Executive Committee, so that the political role of the National Treasury in guarding macro-economic stability was weakened. The shift in political fortunes saw the new Economic Development Department (EDD) now propose the <italic>New Growth Path</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0971721813489447">EDD, 2010</xref>) that called for the establishment of a developmental state. The former Minister of Finance remained in cabinet but was sidelined to head a new National Planning Commission. The Commission duly commenced work with the preparation of a <italic>National Diagnostic</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0971721813489447">NPC, 2010</xref>) and then tabled the first National Development Plan, <italic>Vision for 2030</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0971721813489447">NPC, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Most importantly for our discussion, for the first time, the DST came under the direction of an ANC Minister, the former Minister of Education, who was also a member of the ANC National Executive Committee.</p>
<p>Over at the Department of Trade and Industry, also under a Communist Party Minister, the <italic>Industrial Policy Action Plan</italic> (DTI, 2011) was fine-tuned to address the priorities of the new administration. Interestingly, the CSIR is the only Science Council mentioned in IPAP. Why similar roles are not extended to the other Science Councils is not immediately obvious. One explanation is that IPAP is a product of the DTI; until 2005 CSIR reported to DTI; therefore DTI bureaucrats ‘understand’ CSIR.</p>
<p>The <italic>New Growth Path</italic> shows a mélange of interests at work. It calls for focus and is thus at odds with IPAP’s broad-brush style. EDD (2010) was created without any significant new funds and must thus use the resources it gained at birth namely the Competition Commission and the behemoth Industrial Development Corporation. It is thus no surprise that the <italic>New Growth Path</italic> makes strong appeals for the elimination of cartels and other forms of unfair competition.</p>
<p>To add to the complexity of interests the Zuma Administration created a new Department for Performance Monitoring, Evaluation and Administration within the Presidency. This Department seeks to demonstrate government accountability through the signature of performance agreements between Ministers and the President. Unfortunately some of these agreements include targets that are inconsistent with pre-existing targets of cognate departments.</p>
<p>For its part the National Planning Commission (NPC) <italic>National Diagnostic</italic> said little about innovation, R&amp;D and technology, being content to repeat the indicators of the Ten Year Innovation Plan even though these were now jeopardised by the inconsistent targets in the performance agreements.</p>
<p>Having carried out its diagnosis the NPC <italic>Vision for 2030</italic> then set out to describe a future inclusive society that would offer improved standards of living and societal wellbeing. The Vision seeks to modernise and transform the economy and society and build a ‘capable state’. This is reminiscent of the ‘intelligent regime’ that Raul Prebisch advocated more than a half century ago. Fundamentally ‘The national development plan proposes to invigorate and expand the economic opportunity through investment in infrastructure, more innovation, private investment and entrepreneurialism. The economy will absorb more labour—especially of new work seekers—and wage moderation at all levels will contribute to rising employment’ and further ‘revolutionary developments in science and technology that will transform opportunities, introduce new risks and drive wider social integration’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0971721813489447">NPC, 2011</xref>, p. 1).</p>
<p>What is encouraging is that the <italic>Vision</italic> places innovation central to the development process. This is a bold move, albeit somewhat confused in the detail. The reasons for this confusion are easy to point to, but more difficult to correct. So while it is important that <italic>Vision for 2030</italic> recognises that ‘science and technology are key to development’ and that ‘innovation is the primary driver of technological growth’ the <italic>Vision</italic> would benefit from a clear statement as to what is meant by the concepts of innovation and an innovation system. Moreover it avers ‘The investment climate is crucial, as are the right incentive structures, to guide the allocation of resources and to encourage research and development’ that in turn calls for an ‘increase in the size and effectiveness of the innovation system and closer alignment with companies that operate in sectors consistent with the growth strategy’. Massive investments in infrastructure will be needed, along with a shift toward a low carbon economy and this in a country that is currently one of the highest per capita carbon dioxide producers in the world.</p>
<p>While the <italic>Vision</italic> also shows elements of supply side and linear model thinking, it shows a keen appreciation of the importance of organisational learning and competence building. But there is one statement that requires serious reconsideration. Perhaps fearing the creative destruction associated with a shift toward export led manufacturing it argues that
<disp-quote>
<p>[t]he best solution is for the state to play an active role both in funding research and development and in guiding the type of research and development that the private and public sectors conduct. Despite an excellent set of science institutions, research priorities are not always consistent with South Africa’s competitive advantage or growth strategy. Often we are looking far afield, when the base for innovation and new product development are linked to existing industries and firms.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This assumes that the state alone is truly capable of making such well-informed choices.</p>
<p>The picture that emerges is of an administration riven with conflicting views. Treasury has fought a rearguard action to maintain macro-economic stability while labour has extracted wage settlements running at double the CPI. In the midst of these centrifugal forces the Ten Year Innovation Plan has achieved wide endorsement and the <italic>New Growth Path,</italic> IPAP and <italic>Vision 2030</italic> all defer to it. This capture of the innovation policy space might have arisen through the fact that DST chairs the Economic Cluster comprising the Departments of Trade and Industry, Energy, Minerals, Economic Development, Treasury and Public Enterprises. This gives DST potential leverage to advance the interests of the innovation system.</p>

<p>The new Minister of Science and Technology took office in May 2009 and immediately launched a policy review by appointing a senior level Ministerial Review Committee to determine ‘The degree to which the recommendations of the OECD Review have been acted upon’ (and to make recommendations on the steps) ‘to strengthen the national System of Science, Technology and Innovation’ and to enhance the country’s innovation capabilities, with particular reference to the following:

<p>The terms of reference of the Committee make it clear that the Minister was concerned about the silence regarding the recommendations of the OECD Review.</p>
<p>The Ministerial Review Committee its Report was in circulation for public comment in May 2012. In essence the Committee, based on its own inquiries and commissioned research, found itself in overall agreement with the OECD Review findings, noting that there had been limited if any follow-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0971721813489447">DST, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The Committee detected a lack of common understanding of the concept of an innovation system; that DST had been unable to exercise a coordinating role; that attempts to enter into collaborative agreement even with the Department of Education had been stillborn; there was no evidence of system-wide planning; NACI was constrained to advise on a very narrow range of activities; supply-side thinking remained dominant with emphasis on the linear model. Moreover there was no common purpose among business, government, higher education and civil society regarding decision-making and an agenda for economic investment and development.</p>
<p>In other words the reviews of IDRC, OECD and the Ministerial Committee spread over nearly two decades of time, were in broad agreement. The system had barely changed.</p>

<p>This represents a wide sweep intended to re-orient the innovation system away from supply-side, linear model thinking, to a growing, demand-led, interactive system, Innovation System 2.0 in the making. To arrive at a strong expression of demand that minimises sectional interests the proposed high level body, the NCRI would be constituted to carry out this determination. This is the sentinel recommendation of the Ministerial Review Committee.</p>
<p>The proposals are the work of a Committee; how these are to be implemented is unknown, the more so as the economic policy environment is so strongly contested.</p>

<title>Summative Assessment and Concluding Remarks</title>
<p>This article has argued that the extractive economic institutions of the past have continued into the present. Whilst the polity is more inclusive, the economy remains extractive. The innovation system, as a small sub-system of the economy inevitably mirrors the overarching polity and economic forms. It was argued that Innovation System 1.0 ‘worked’ for apartheid. In effect the continuity prescribed in the 1996 Constitution saw to it that that innovation system continued in largely unchanged orientation and approach. Hence its designation as Innovation System 1.1.</p>
<p>Despite rhetorical adherence to the innovation systems approach policy remained fixed on supply side measures consistent with the linear model of innovation. The CSIR, one of the loci of linear model thinking has remained a core institution of the innovation system and continues to exercise strong influence on policy formulation and implementation.</p>
<p>Much institutional change in the innovation system has been superficial and involved reconfiguration rather than change of focus. The IDRC Review of 1993, the 2007 OECD Review and the Ministerial Committee of 2012 agree on this continuity and the lock in of linear model thinking. In addition the focus on the individual scientist rather than research group inadvertently promotes extractive behaviours. These are the underlying reasons that explain the continuity.</p>
<p>This unintended continuity was very neatly revealed in a training workshop conducted for DST policy staff in May 2010. Asked to provide a back-of-business card description of the main features of the innovation system, the staff compiled a list of attributes virtually identical with the IDRC diagnosis of 1993. Addressing the facilitator a staffer lamented, ‘You’re saying nothing has changed.’ The facilitator replied: ‘No, you are saying that.’ The systemic failures are available to those that wish to see.</p>
<p>A summative assessment of the functioning of the innovation system may be carried out with reference to the White Paper’s own criteria. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0971721813489447">Table 1</xref> lists these criteria (adjusted for conciseness) with a summative assessment of each. This summative assessment indicates the strengths and weaknesses of the system as is. As assessed each attribute shows some evidence of success and even failure.</p>

<p>A case in point is the level of international patenting. The economy has continued in extractive mode and has shifted attention abroad, using home-based R&amp;D and innovation to capture and retain markets. The emphasis on commodity exports and non-tradables, with parallel falls in the volume of high technology exports resonates in the continuing low level of international patenting. There are both gains and losses in such industrial strategy.</p>
<p>Under Apartheid the social contract of science involved support for the war effort along with the pursuit of ‘own science,’ an activity of modernity supported by the taxpayer.</p>
<p>The social contract of science of the democratic era has yet to gel, but this much is clear: the Republic of Science is alive and well. It responded bravely to the HIV–TB pandemic.</p>
<p>South Africa’s small innovation system previously yielded heart transplants, nuclear weapons, guided missiles, catalysis, the Rooivalk attack helicopter, major palaeo-archeological finds, the G5 and G6 howitzers and electronic detonators. The post 1994 system has yielded Thawte Internet security, Ubuntu open source software, the South African Large Telescope, Karoo Array telescope and finally the Square Kilometre Array (SKA).</p>
<p>The space in which scientists supported the apartheid war has also seen occupancy by pet projects—the massive and now discontinued Pebble Bed Modular Reactor and the Joule electric vehicle, that attracted many of the researchers from the state defence industries. It is possible that the lack of clear direction from government has allowed pet projects to flourish, in the hope that something grand with commercial value will emerge.</p>
<p>The media frenzy that greeted the award of the SKA was akin to that associated with South Africa hosting the 2010 FIFA World Cup, this despite no obvious future economic return from the huge investment in infrastructure. That Africa, through South Africa, would gain the lion’s share of the multi-billion dollar SKA international science project was a delight to government. It is undeniable that SKA will gather staggering volumes of data that will far exceed today’s global computing power, implying that new data processing techniques will be needed. This is a similar challenge to what CERN faced and as one knows, an outcome of that challenge was http, the basis of today’s World Wide Web. No one can predict what the technological benefits of SKA will be.</p>
<p>In terms of economic benefit it is an open question whether a large international project can spur local industry since its procurement processes will have to be open to all players and cost is likely to be the main factor determining the award of contracts. SKA is thus unlikely seriously to impact on job creation. It is big science, not the socially oriented science that the IDRC Mission or OECD Review envisaged.</p>
<p>It may be too much to expect that the future National Council on Research and Innovation will apply its mind to the wisdom of the Grand Challenges of the Ten Year Innovation Plan. After all, the Plan already enjoys wide political s upport.</p>
<p>This analysis suggests that many of the post democracy expectations for S&amp;T and innovation remain to be addressed: how will priorities for S&amp;T and innovation be set in an accountable manner; what coordination mechanism is appropriate and workable; how can CEOs of the PRIs be held to account; given the persistence of linear model thinking is the idea of an innovation system mere rhetoric or of substance? And will <italic>Vision for 2030</italic> gain traction?</p>
