<abstract>
<p>Acute aortocaval fistula (ACF) is a rare, life-threatening condition with a complex clinical presentation, making prompt diagnosis challenging. Primary ACF is believed to be associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture in 80% of the cases. Thrombotic complications following endovascular repair for acute ACF are rare and less widely recognized. A high index of suspicion is required for diagnosis of this postoperative complication. We describe a novel, staged management approach using endovascular aortic stent grafts (Gore Excluder; Flagstaff, CA) in both the abdominal aorta and the inferior vena cava (IVC) in a patient with a ruptured AAA and acute ACF with subsequent acute IVC thrombosis.</p>

</sup> Thrombotic complications following endovascular repair for acute ACF are rare and less widely recognized. We describe a novel, staged management approach using endovascular aortic stent grafts (Gore Excluder; Flagstaff, CA) in both the abdominal aorta and the inferior vena cava (IVC) in a patient with a ruptured AAA, acute ACF, and acute IVC thrombosis.</p>

<title>Case Presentation</title>
<p>An 80-year-old male with a history of a known AAA presented to the emergency department with a 3-day history of lower extremity weakness, oliguria, hematuria, and lower extremity mottling. Computed tomography demonstrated a 6.1-cm infrarenal AAA that grew 1 cm in the month prior to presentation and demonstrated loss of a normal tissue plane between the aorta and the IVC. Rapid contrast filling into the venous system was also noted. The patient was taken urgently to the interventional suite where aortography confirmed the presence of ACF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574413490839">Figure 1</xref>). Subsequent bilateral femoral exposures revealed the presence of pulsatile common femoral veins bilaterally. Endovascular repair was performed with a Gore Excluder bifurcated endograft (Trunk ipsilateral limb: 26 mm × 14 mm × 14 cm, left contralateral limb: 14 mm × 9.5 cm and 20 mm × 9.5 cm; and right iliac extender: 27 mm × 9.5 cm flared and 14 mm × 13.5 cm limbs). Following the initial repair, the patient was noted to have a persistent distal type I endoleak from the right hypogastric artery. Coil embolization of the right hypogastric artery and placement of a distal extension limb into the right external iliac artery resulted in resolution of the endoleak and no further ACF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574413490839">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit where he demonstrated worsening massive lower extremity edema, elevated bladder pressures, oliguria, and lactic acidosis overnight. The patient was returned to the endovascular suite in the morning, and venography demonstrated an near-complete IVC occlusion due to extensive intraluminal thrombus at the level of the prior ACF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1538574413490839">Figure 3</xref>). The left common and external iliac veins were also occluded. Access was obtained through bilateral common femoral veins via proximal saphenous vein exposure, and endovascular recanalization of the IVC and left iliac veins was performed</p>

</fig>
<p>Endovascular reconstruction of the left common iliac vein was performed with a 23-mm × 13.5-cm Gore Excluder prosthesis and an 18 mm x 9.5 cm Excluder proximal extension into the IVC. The right iliac vein and vena cava reconstruction was performed with a 21- to 26-mm flared (10 cm length) Gore TAG thoracic endoprosthesis placed in a “kissing” configuration within the IVC. Completion angiogram demonstrated restored patency of the IVC and bilateral iliac veins following endovascular stent graft deployment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1538574413490839">Figure 4</xref>). The patient was heparinized intraoperatively, and subcutaneous heparin was continued in the postoperative period.</p>

<p>The patient demonstrated rapid improvement in his lower extremity edema and oliguria. On postoperative day 4, the patient required left hemicolectomy with transverse colostomy and Harmann’s pouch for ischemic colitis and transmural necrosis of his splenic flexure and descending colon. The patient demonstrated clinical improvement with resolution of his renal failure and was subsequently extubated.</p>
<p>The postoperative course was marked by resolution of his lower extremity edema, significant reduction of in his high-output congestive heart failure, and resolution of the abdominal compartment syndrome. His renal function steadily improved and returned to normal. He was extubated on postoperative day 10 and made steady clinical improvement. Postoperative computed tomography (CT) scans of the abdomen and pelvis confirmed luminal patency of all arterial and venous endograft components without evidence of endoleak or extravasation. The patient developed subsequent nosocomial pneumonia and required reintubation secondary to late respiratory failure. Despite maximal ventilatory support and intravenous antibiotics, the patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome. Discussions were held with the family, and the decision was made to withdraw mechanical ventilation on postoperative day 35. The patient subsequently expired following removal of life support.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Aortic stent grafts and endovascular techniques have expanded the options available for repair of acute ACF and its complications. Improved clinical outcomes have been reported in the recent peer-reviewed literature following endovascular repair in contrast to the 40% to 50% mortality traditionally reported in older studies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574413490839">2</xref>
</sup> Antoniou and colleagues performed a review of the English language literature papers and found 23 patients treated with stent graft repair.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574413490839">3</xref>
</sup> The technical success rate was 96% in this review, and no perioperative or 30-day deaths were noted. Despite these excellent results, the true rates of technical success and mortality following endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for ACF are not known and likely underreported.</p>
<p>Thrombotic complications following ACF are less widely recognized but can be life-threatening clinical emergencies despite successful endovascular ACF repair. A high index of suspicion is required to diagnosis this postoperative complication. In our patient, acute IVC occlusion resulted in persistence of severe lower extremity swelling and continued clinical deterioration, which prompted further evaluation with venography and IVC recanalization. Compression of the IVC by the aortic aneurysmal sac may result in intraluminal thrombus formation, even after the high flow through the fistula has been excluded. Paradoxical pulmonary embolism associated with ACF has been reported and may occur prior to, during, or following endovascular repair.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574413490839">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574413490839">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first reported case describing endovascular management of IVC thrombosis and occlusion following EVAR for acute ACF. Because both aortic mural thrombus and luminal compression of the IVC by the aneurysm sac are risk factors for thrombotic complications in these patients, routine radiographic surveillance of the IVC with CT or magnetic resonance venography should be performed in these patients following EVAR. A high index of clinical suspicion for IVC thrombosis should also be maintained, as the true incidence of thrombotic complications following ACF repair is likely higher than reported in the current, peer-reviewed literature.</p>
