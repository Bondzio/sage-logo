<abstract>
<p>The aim of the study was to determine if preschool children perceive overweight children to have more negative characteristics than non-overweight children. Children from 32 to 70 months old (<italic>N</italic> = 42) listened to four stories about an interaction between two children, in which one child demonstrated socially unacceptable behaviour and one child demonstrated pro-social behaviour. Stories were presented along with two target figures (overweight, non-overweight). Results showed that children perceived overweight target figures as ‘mean’ more often than ‘nice’. By understanding children’s negative perceptions towards overweight peers, the findings can inform the development of programs to prevent or decrease body stigmatization in order to create inclusive learning and social environments where all children are accepted, included, and gain a sense of belonging regardless of their body shape or size.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Thinness has become the ideal standard of beauty in North American society, and obesity has acquired many negative connotations. It is estimated that in 2010, worldwide there are approximately 42 million children under the age of five who are overweight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1476718X11407411">World Health Organization, 2010</xref>). In Canada, approximately 26 percent of children between the ages of two and 17 are considered overweight or obese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1476718X11407411">Shields, 2005</xref>). In the past several decades, perceptions of body shape and weight have changed dramatically in Western society. Overweight individuals were once viewed as a ‘symbol within a system of prestige’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1476718X11407411">MacDermott, 2007</xref>: 21) and associated with wealth and the abilities to bear children and survive famine. In the visual arts, representations of slightly overweight female forms were the norm throughout the ages, and are amongst some of the earliest known cultural artifacts from European and Mediterranean societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1476718X11407411">MacDermott, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1476718X11407411">Pitman and Kaufman, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, today’s overweight individuals are associated with many negative characteristics, and in fact even young children hold strong views about what it means to be thin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476718X11407411">Powdermarker, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1476718X11407411">Tillman, 2003</xref>). As a result of society’s negative perceptions, children who are overweight often face societal prejudices attributed to their weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476718X11407411">Latner and Stunkard, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1476718X11407411">Tiggemann and Anesbury, 2000</xref>). Their peers also often attribute negative characteristics to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476718X11407411">Jansen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1476718X11407411">Kostanski and Gullone, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1476718X11407411">Neumark-Sztainer et al., 1999</xref>). Children of all ages, even as young as three years old, perceive overweight children as being lazy, unattractive, unhappy, unpopular, unfriendly, or sloppy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1476718X11407411">Kraig and Keel, 2001</xref>; Tiggeman and Anesbury, 2000; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1476718X11407411">Turnbull et al., 2000</xref>) and as having lower intelligence than their average-weight counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1476718X11407411">Kraig and Keel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1476718X11407411">Schwartz et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, children rate their overweight peers as being the least desirable playmates and least well liked peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1476718X11407411">Strauss et al., 1985</xref>). Studies have consistently demonstrated that when children are asked to attribute characteristics to figures of overweight and non-overweight children, overweight figures are labelled with less favourable attributes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476718X11407411">Cramer and Steinwert, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1476718X11407411">Latner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1476718X11407411">Tillman et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1476718X11407411">Richardson et al.’s (1961)</xref> classic study investigated children’s preferences for play partners. The researchers found that children between the ages of 10 and 11 favoured pictures of children who had one of four disabilities (i.e. crutches, wheelchair, facial disfigurement and missing hand) over the picture of an obese child. Replications of the study conducted with children of different ages, gender, and ethnicities have also demonstrated that in relation to physical disabilities, obesity is highly stigmatized (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476718X11407411">Goodman et al., 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1476718X11407411">Latner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1476718X11407411">Sigelman et al., 1986</xref>). Researchers have speculated that children who are obese may be stigmatized partially because they are blamed for their weight (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1476718X11407411">Musher-Eizenmann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1476718X11407411">Tiggemann and Anesbury, 2000</xref>). Such studies suggest that children with disabilities are not seen as being responsible for their disability but rather as victims, whereas overweight individuals are deemed responsible for their condition (e.g. lack of exercise, poor eating habits). Studies also show that children label overweight figures of children as being ‘mean’ and non-overweight figures of children as being ‘nice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476718X11407411">Cramer and Steinwert, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1476718X11407411">Tillman et al., 2007</xref>). Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1476718X11407411">Birbeck and Drummond (2005)</xref> showed five- and six-year-old children nine images of figures depicting various body sizes, from which they were to select three figures to invite to their birthday party. The authors’ findings indicate that the children did not want to invite the larger figures and offered various reasons for their choice (e.g. nasty, mean, bullies).</p>
<p>Given that obesity is on the on the rise and widespread, one might assume that intolerance and stigmatization towards overweight individuals would decrease, when in fact this does not appear to be the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476718X11407411">Latner and Stunkard, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476718X11407411">Latner and Stunkard (2002)</xref> replicated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1476718X11407411">Richardson et al.’s 1961</xref> study in which fourth and fifth grade children were asked to rank their preference between six child figures (normal weight, obese, facial disfigurement, wheelchair, crutches and missing hand). Results were consistent with previous studies that showed the obese child being liked least. Interestingly, the obese child figure was liked significantly less than the obese child figure in Richardson et al.’s study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476718X11407411">Latner and Stunkard, 2002</xref>). This finding suggests that obesity stigmatization has increased throughout the years perhaps since obesity is no longer associated with privilege and optimum survival. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1476718X11407411">Stunkard and Sobal (1995)</xref> suggested that ‘obesity remains the last socially acceptable form of prejudice, and obese persons remain perhaps the only group toward whom social derogation can be directed with impunity’ (p. 417).</p>
<p>Overweight stigmatization has far reaching consequences. Research has shown that overweight children are socially marginalized or discriminated against and face psychological problems such as lower self-esteem and depression, and they experience more shame, humiliation, and teasing than their non-overweight peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476718X11407411">Latner and Stunkard, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1476718X11407411">Mullen and Shield, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476718X11407411">Raine, 2004</xref>). Indeed, as adults, overweight individuals continue to experience weight stigmatization in different facets of their lives including social health and well-being, education, and career opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476718X11407411">Raine, 2004</xref>). Given the complex issues overweight individuals are likely to face throughout their life span, it is imperative that researchers examine when, why, and how stigmatization occurs in order to create strategies to prevent and combat it.</p>
<sec id="section2-1476718X11407411">
<title>Prevention programs</title>
<p>To diminish weight-based harassment and body esteem issues in children, many researchers have advocated for universal prevention programs that target relatively asymptomatic populations and emphasize increasing resilience to body image issues rather than working towards changing attitudes that already exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1476718X11407411">Clark and Tiggemann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476718X11407411">Smolak, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476718X11407411">Smolak and Levine, 2001</xref>). Universal prevention programs may be more beneficial than intervention programs since it may be easier to instil positive values than to eliminate negative attitudes that have already been formed. Studies have identified that stigmatization of children who are overweight increases with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476718X11407411">Cramer and Steinwert, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1476718X11407411">Jarvie, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1476718X11407411">Musher-Eizenmann et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, universal prevention programs would be more beneficial if they target very young children instead of older ones, and in addition it is essential for researchers to uncover when potential body size biases begin.</p>
<p>To date, research examining preschool children’s perceptions of body image is sparse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476718X11407411">Cramer and Steinwert, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476718X11407411">Smolak, 2004</xref>). Since research has documented that children as young as five years old already possess negative attitudes towards overweight children, it would thus be valuable to understand even younger children’s perceptions about body image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1476718X11407411">Birbeck and Drummond, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476718X11407411">Pine, 2001</xref>). The current study was conducted to address this gap in research. Building upon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476718X11407411">Cramer and Steinwert’s (1998)</xref> work with preschool children and Tillman et al.’s (2007) study of elementary school children, this study aimed to examine preschool children’s perceptions of overweight children. The research questions were: 1) would preschool children identify overweight children as being ‘mean’ more often than they would non-overweight children?; 2) what are children’s rationales for identifying a child as being ‘mean’ or ‘nice’? The findings are important for informing program development with the aims of preventing or decreasing negative body image attitudes and body stigmatization, and of creating inclusive learning and social environments where all children feel accepted regardless of body shape or size.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section4-1476718X11407411">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Opportunity sampling was used to recruit participants from amongst preschool children between the ages of 32 to 70 months who attended early learning and childcare centres (ELCC) across the Greater Toronto Area.</p>
<p>Power calculations indicated that for a Type I error rate of 0.05, a sample size of 34 was more than adequate to obtain a power of 0.80 (based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1476718X11407411">Tillman’s, 2003</xref>, calculation). Forty-five children received voluntary parental consent to participate in the activity. Two children did not want to participate in the activity and declined the invitation from the researcher, and one child was on vacation on the day of the activity. One male participant’s data were not considered in the analysis because he did not understand the procedure or follow the directions of the activity. Therefore, the final sample consisted of 41 children, 21 males (<italic>M</italic> age = 48.5 months) and 20 females (<italic>M</italic> age = 50.3 months).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1476718X11407411">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>A list of ELCC centres was found through an online search. Directors or supervisors (hereinafter referred to as supervisor) of the centres were contacted by telephone and were informed about the study. Thirty-four supervisors were contacted and eight supervisors agreed to allow research to be conducted at their site. Those who agreed to participate in the study received information letters and consent forms to be forwarded to the board of directors or owner/operator. After approval from the board of directors or owner/operators, the parental information letters and consent forms were distributed. Although eight supervisors had agreed to have their centres participate in the study, a total of only five were used as research sites because of summer scheduling.</p>
<p>Parents who gave written consent for their children to participate in the study also completed and returned a brief demographic questionnaire. It consisted of three questions asking for the gender and birth date of the child, and the ethnicity of both the mother and father of the child. On the consent form, parents were also given the option of allowing or not allowing the activity with their child to be tape recorded. All parents who gave consent for their child to participate in the study also gave consent for the activity to be tape recorded. In total, from the five centres, 150 information letters and consent forms were distributed, and 45 were returned. Therefore the response rate for this study was 30 percent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1476718X11407411">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>Data were collected between June and July 2008. They were gathered in the morning in order to keep data collection times consistent and to account for differences that time of day may have.</p>
<p>Once in the ELCC centre’s classroom, children who received parental consent were introduced to the researcher by the early childhood educator and invited to participate in an activity with stories and pictures. All children, except for one, who were invited to participate in the activity gave verbal assent. The child who did not give verbal assent did not participate in the study. The researcher also explained individually to the children that their voices would be recorded. All children who assented to participate in the activity agreed to the audio-taping. Each child participated in the activity individually.</p>
<p>Once seated and before beginning the activity, children were told that they could stop the activity at any time and did not have to answer questions they did not want to. This was done in order to ‘contribute to their wellbeing, through giving respect for their sense of control’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1476718X11407411">Hill, 2005</xref>: 68). In addition, the researcher and the child engaged in a short conversation in order to gain rapport.</p>
<p>Each child listened to the four stories, two about boys and two about girls, where one child in the story says or does something ‘nice’ and the other child does or says something ‘mean’. Stories were told in a different order so that stories would be counterbalanced. During each story, the child was shown the accompanying target figures, which were counterbalanced (left side, right side). Following each story, children were then asked, ‘Which of these two boys (girls) is ___ (name of character), the mean one who _____ (action or verbal)? Which of these two boys (girls) is _____ (name of character), the nice one who _____ (action or words said)?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476718X11407411">Cramer and Steinwert, 1998</xref>: 432). The two questions were also counterbalanced to ensure that children did not pick the ‘mean’ or ‘nice’ child based on the order of the question. Counterbalancing was all done randomly prior to the interviews, where each child was assigned an order for the stories, appearance of pictures, and question presentation order.</p>
<p>Using a semi-structured open-ended interview, children were asked follow-up questions to explain why they matched ‘mean’ or ‘nice’ with a figure. For example, for one of the scenarios, a participant chose the overweight child as the ‘mean child’. The child was then asked why, and he responded ‘cuz he’s fatter’. The researcher continued to probe further by asking additional questions depending on responses. Children’s selection of the ‘mean’ and the ‘nice’ child were recorded manually and children’s responses to the follow-up questions were audio-taped.</p>
<p>In total, the activity lasted an average of four minutes (minimum = 2.48 minutes, maximum = 7.08 minutes). At the completion of the activity, the children were each thanked for their participation in the study and then returned to their normal program activities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1476718X11407411">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>Many body size stigmatization studies have used adjective attribution tasks where children were shown figures, given adjectives (e.g. smart, funny, mean), and asked to select which figure possessed the characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476718X11407411">Cramer and Steinwert, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476718X11407411">Cramer and Steinwert (1998)</xref> questioned whether this task is appropriate for children since ‘the request to assign abstract personality constructs to pictorial target figures and to make differential ratings of intensity may be too difficult for some young children’ (p. 431). They argued that the story telling method was more age appropriate. Therefore, for the current study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1476718X11407411">Tillman’s (2003)</xref> four stories, pictures, and story telling activity were used with the author’s permission.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1476718X11407411">
<title>Four stories</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1476718X11407411">Tillman’s (2003)</xref> stories are very short, consisting of a few sentences each. Two of the stories depict male children and two, female children. In addition, for each gender, one realistic and one fantasy story were created. Realistic stories were created in order to ‘elicit the children’s attitudes about people they might actually encounter’, whereas the fantasy story was created for the purpose of ‘reduc[ing] the likelihood that children were responding on the basis of a personal past experience, rather than on the basis of a generalized stereotype’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476718X11407411">Cramer and Steinwert, 1998</xref>: 432). Each story is about two same-gendered characters. One character does or says something ‘nice’, whereas the other character does or says something ‘mean’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476718X11407411">Heyman and Gelman (1999)</xref> indicated that children ‘may use the term “nice” as an indication of their positive feelings about someone rather than as a description of what that person is generally like’ (p. 605). Therefore using the terms ‘nice’ and ‘mean’ was appropriate since ‘young children’s trait assignments may be based on overall evaluations of a character’s likeability’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1476718X11407411">Tillman et al., 2007</xref>: 71).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1476718X11407411">
<title>Target figures</title>
<p>For each story, two same-gendered target figures are used, with one figure being overweight and the other figure being non-overweight. Figures are black and white line drawings of non-specific ethnicity. In total, eight figures are used. To control for confounding factors, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1476718X11407411">Tillman’s (2003)</xref> two target figures for each story are identical in height, clothing, and hairstyle; the only difference is weight and face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476718X11407411">Cramer and Steinwert, 1998</xref>). Research has indicated that facial attractiveness could potentially be a confounding factor when measuring for body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1476718X11407411">Jarvie et al., 1983</xref>). Therefore, slight alterations were made to Tillman’s figures for this study, with the faces of all target figures replaced with blank ovals, since one face may have been interpreted as more attractive than the other. Also, figures were computer drawn to avoid any confounding factors that hand drawn figures may have created (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1476718X11407411">Tillman, 2003</xref>). Since the only difference between the two figures in the current study is body size, the child’s identification of ‘nice’ and ‘mean’ would be based solely on body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476718X11407411">Cramer and Steinwert, 1998</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The research question sought to examine if preschool children identified overweight children as being ‘mean’ more often than ‘nice’. Overweight target figures were assigned a code (0 = nice, 1 = mean). A higher score would indicate children chose overweight target figures as being ‘mean’ more often.</p>
<p>Frequencies were calculated to answer the research question. Each participant heard four stories; therefore, each participant could rate the overweight child as ‘mean’ for no stories, some stories, or all stories. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1476718X11407411">Table 1</xref> shows the frequencies and percentages for how the overweight target figure was perceived. The results indicate that 43.9 percent of the participating children perceived the overweight target figure to be ‘mean’ in all four stories, whereas only 2.4 percent of the children perceived the overweight target figure to be ‘nice’ in all four stories.</p>

<p>To determine if there was a statistically significant difference between the number of times children labelled overweight target figures as ‘mean’ or ‘nice’, chi-square tests were completed for each story individually, and then for all four stories combined.</p>
<p>Children’s explanations for their choice of identifying a target figure as being ‘mean’ or ‘nice’ were analysed for emerging themes. Three main themes related to perceptions of overweight children emerged: 1) physical attributes; 2) emotional attributes; and 3) behavioural attributes.</p>
<sec id="section11-1476718X11407411">
<title>Story 1: Male fantasy story</title>
<p>A one-sample chi-square test was conducted to assess whether overweight target figures in Story 1 were rated as ‘mean’ or ‘nice’ more often. The results of the test were significant, χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 41) = 5.49, <italic>p</italic> = .02. The proportion of children who rated the overweight target figure as ‘mean’ (<italic>p</italic> = 0.68) indicates that more children labelled the overweight target figure as ‘mean’ (<italic>M</italic> = 0.68) than ‘nice’ (<italic>M</italic> = 0.31).</p>
<p>The children’s rationale for choosing the overweight target figure as ‘mean’ more often was frequently correlated directly with weight. Children indicated that the overweight target figure was the ‘mean’ child because he was ‘fatter’, ‘bigger’ and ‘too fat’. Other children noted that the overweight target figure was the ‘mean’ child because of physical characteristics such as having shorter arms, a rounder stomach, and being stronger, or because of emotional attributions such as being jealous. Another child mentioned that the overweight target figure ‘eat[s] more’ in order to be ‘stronger’ to ‘fight good guys’. Clothing was also mentioned, as some children indicated that the overweight target figure was ‘mean’ because he was wearing ‘underpants’ while the non-overweight target figure was wearing ‘shorts’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1476718X11407411">
<title>Story 2: Male realistic story</title>
<p>The results of a one-sample chi-square test conducted for Story 2 were also significant, χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 41) = 7.05, <italic>p</italic> = .01. The proportion of children who rated the overweight target figure as ‘mean’ (<italic>p</italic> = 0.71) suggests that more children labelled the overweight target figure as ‘mean’ (<italic>M</italic> = 0.71) than ‘nice’ (<italic>M</italic> = 0.29).</p>
<p>Children explained that they chose the overweight target figure as the ‘mean’ child because he was ‘big’ or ‘fat’, whereas they explained that the non-overweight target figure was nicer since he was ‘thinner’. One child described the overweight target figure as being ‘mean’ because he wore ‘bigger shorts’, while another child indicated that the overweight target figure’s ‘face doesn’t look nice’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1476718X11407411">
<title>Story 3: Female fantasy story</title>
<p>When a one-sample chi-square test was similarly conducted for Story 3, the results were significant, χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 41) = 10.76, <italic>p</italic> = .001. The proportion of children who rated the overweight target figure as ‘mean’ (<italic>p</italic> = 0.76) indicates that more children labelled the overweight target figure as ‘mean’ (<italic>M</italic> = 0.76) than ‘nice’ (<italic>M</italic> = 0.24).</p>
<p>Children offered many reasons why they chose the overweight target figure as being the ‘mean’ child more often. They rationalized that the overweight target figure was ‘mean’ because she was ‘fatter’, ‘bigger’, and was ‘wide’. One child indicated that the overweight target figure had a ‘bigger belly’ and ‘eat[s] more than good people’. Furthermore, a few children also commented that the overweight target figure was ‘mean’ since she wore a ‘bigger dress’ or ‘not a nice dress’, whereas the non-overweight figure was said to be ‘nice’ since her dress was ‘small’. In addition, some children mentioned that the non-overweight target figure was ‘nice’ because she was ‘taller’, ‘skinnier’, ‘littler’ and had ‘longer arms’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1476718X11407411">
<title>Story 4: Female realistic story</title>
<p>The one-sample chi-square test conducted for Story 4 yielded results that were significant, χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 41) = 17.78, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. The proportion of children who rated the overweight target figure as ‘mean’ (<italic>p</italic> = 0.83) highlights that more children labelled the overweight target figure as ‘mean’ (<italic>M</italic> = 0.83) than ‘nice’ (<italic>M</italic> = 0.17).</p>
<p>Children provided rationales for their selection and indicated that the overweight target figure was ‘mean’ because she was ‘bigger’ and ‘fatter’. Many children also indicated that the overweight figure ‘looks really really mean’, and some children also explained that the overweight figure looked ‘mad’. One child described the overweight figure as ‘mean’ because she was being selfish. Children indicated that the non-overweight target figure was the ‘nice’ child because she was ‘skinny’. In addition, the non-overweight figure looked ‘happy’ and ‘nice’. A child indicated that the ‘nice’ child had a ‘skinnier belly’, unlike the ‘fat belly’ that eats a lot.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1476718X11407411">
<title>Overall story effect</title>
<p>A one-sample chi-square test was conducted to assess whether overweight target figures in all four stories were rated as ‘mean’ or ‘nice’ more often. Since four stories were told, each story where participants rated the overweight child as ‘mean’ was assigned a score of 0.25. If a child indicated that the overweight child was ‘mean’ in all four stories, a score of 1.0 was assigned. Each story was given a proportion of 0.25 in order for the chi-square test to recognize that the sample size is 41. If each story was given a score of 1.0, then it would seem as if 164 participants were involved instead of 41, since each story was told four times. The results of the test were significant, χ<sup>2</sup>(4, <italic>N</italic> = 41) = 20.59, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. The proportion of children who rated the overweight target figure as ‘mean’ (<italic>p</italic> = 0.75) shows that more children labelled the overweight target figure as ‘mean’ than ‘nice’. Therefore children perceived overweight children as ‘mean’ more than ‘nice’.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to examine preschool children’s perceptions of overweight children. The findings indicate that for all four stories, children rated the overweight target figure as ‘mean’ more often than ‘nice’. This finding shows that among preschool children, obesity is highly stigmatized. Results are consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476718X11407411">Cramer and Steinwert’s (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1476718X11407411">Tillman’s (2003)</xref> studies that found that overweight target figures were labelled ‘mean’ more often than ‘nice’. Results are also consistent with many previous studies which have demonstrated that older children have shown more negative associations towards overweight figures than non-overweight figures (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1476718X11407411">Birbeck and Drummond, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1476718X11407411">Counts et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1476718X11407411">Kraig and Keel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1476718X11407411">Latner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1476718X11407411">Lerner and Korn, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476718X11407411">Pine, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1476718X11407411">Staffieri, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1476718X11407411">Tiggemann and Anesbury, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1476718X11407411">Turnbull et al., 2000</xref>). This result is highly alarming because the prevalence of overweight children is on the rise. Therefore, more overweight children may be stigmatized and face the negative psychological and emotional consequences of weight-based bias. The result highlights that preschool-aged children have already formed negative perceptions of children who are overweight. This is a significant finding because few studies have looked at very young children’s perceptions of weight. Since young preschool children have formed negative perceptions of weight, research must continue to explore when these perceptions first begin to form. It will be imperative to uncover the origins of weight-based stigmatization in order to understand when and where prevention programs to decrease weight bias should be provided to children.</p>
<sec id="section17-1476718X11407411">
<title>Children’s rationale for their perceptions</title>
<p>When children in the current study were asked to explain their rationale for choosing target figures as ‘mean’ or ‘nice’, many of them justified their choice of ‘mean’ by pointing out aspects of target figures’ physical attributes, behavioural attributes and emotional attributes. Their rationales associated with physical attributes included observing that the overweight child was ‘bigger’ or ‘fatter’ and pointing out body parts such as ‘a fatter belly’ or ‘shorter arms’ and overweight target figures’ ‘bigger’ clothing. Although these are physical attributes, children associated them with being ‘mean’. This finding is consistent with research that has shown that young children tend to focus on external attributes of people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476718X11407411">Powlishta et al., 1994</xref>). Based on these findings, overweight children may be greatly stigmatized due to their physical attributes. As preschool children in the current study have associated being fat with being mean, children should be taught that size, body parts, and clothing do not determine an individual’s worth. Preschool curricula, which emphasize inclusion of all children as a goal, should afford children opportunities to learn that although overweight children may be different in terms of body size, that does not mean that they differ from non-overweight children in other dimensions such as being nice.</p>
<p>Another common rationale children used for choosing target figures as ‘mean’ or ‘nice’ was based on behavioural attributes that they ascribed to the target figures. The majority of children justified choosing the overweight child as the ‘mean’ child by saying that overweight figures treated others badly, were often bullies, and were selfish individuals. These are very negative stereotypes of overweight children that preschool children already possess. Therefore, even preschool children must be educated and be made aware that not all overweight children are mean, bullies, or selfish. Perhaps the media can portray overweight characters as protagonists more often in story books, movies and television to decrease the negative stereotypes held about overweight children.</p>
<p>Finally, children rationalized their choice by pointing out emotional attributes of overweight children. They were chosen as ‘mean’ more often than ‘nice’ because they were perceived to look angrier than non-overweight target figures who looked happy. This was a very interesting finding since no facial features were present on target figures. Therefore, children in the study used body size as their cue to predict happiness or anger in an individual. Other children stated that overweight children were ‘mean’ because they were often jealous. Interestingly, one child noted that the overweight child was the ‘nice’ child because the non-overweight child was teasing the overweight child for being ‘fat’. This example illustrates that this preschool child was aware of the stigmatization that overweight children face. Also, perhaps overweight children were seen as ‘angry’, ‘mad’, and ‘jealous’ due to being stigmatized by society. Therefore, children should be educated about the negative effects of stigmatization, thereby potentially deterring them from exhibiting negative weight-based biases towards overweight children.</p>
<p>To date, very few studies have examined size stigmatization with preschool children; therefore, the results of this study build on previous quantitative studies which have confirmed the existence of negative perceptions against older overweight children. By understanding more about why overweight children are perceived negatively through the eyes of other children, researchers can develop a greater comprehension of how to change these negative perceptions. Since this study has shown that preschool children perceive overweight children differently from how they perceive non-overweight children due to the physical, behavioural and emotional attributes that they ascribe to both size categories of children, these areas can be explored further and may inform preschool and early elementary school curricula.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1476718X11407411">
<title>Recommendations for weight acceptance</title>
<p>The findings of this study may help us to understand and influence children’s environments to decrease weight-based stigmatization. In order to do so, educators of young children, curricula developers, school policy-makers, and parents must first be informed by evidence-based research on the consequences of weight-based stigmatization and on ways to prevent or decrease weight-based biases. Adults can create changes in their children’s environments and teach them about body size acceptance in order to decrease the negative emotional and psychological consequences that overweight children suffer due to stigmatization.
</p>
<p>The results of the study have shown that preschool children already hold negative perceptions of overweight children. The literature has shown that early childhood educators and teachers can provide protective factors for children’s perceptions of weight by interacting with their students constructively and offering corrective information regarding negative body weight and body shape attitudes. In order to function as a protective factor, early childhood educators and teachers have to develop knowledge by critically evaluating perspectives and misconceptions, countering misconceptions and prejudices, and applying strategies and actions in the classroom to deter stigmatization. By critically evaluating school or preschool environments, student interactions, and classroom behaviours, early childhood educators and teachers can implement policies and intervene against stereotypical norms associated with different body sizes to create more inclusive schools. In order for classrooms to be inclusive learning settings for children, educators need to be aware of their own prejudices. Since there are no strong pressures in society to eliminate anti-fat attitudes, when overweight children are stigmatized, in many cases adults do not intervene. Educators should decrease negative weight-based stigmatization amongst students by intervening when weight-based teasing occurs.</p>
<p>Programs that emphasize positive body image, self-esteem, and weight-based acceptance should be centred on children, families, schools and ELCC centres in order to promote lasting attitude changes. In addition, building on the findings from this study and previous literature, differences in weight-based stigmatization due to gender should be more thoroughly examined. Offering both boys and girls prevention or intervention weight stigmatization programs may aid in decreasing or eliminating their negative attributes associated with weight. Children should receive support both at school and at home to help them develop positive and healthy body images and acceptance of those with different body sizes. If early childhood educators, teachers, parents and school boards work together to increase weight acceptance, children’s perceptions and negative opinions towards overweight children may decrease.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1476718X11407411">
<title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>The study has a number of limitations. First, due to the limited time frame of the study, opportunity sampling was used. Therefore, the results are not generalizable to other populations. The children who participated in the study attended ELCC centres within the Greater Toronto Area; therefore, the results may not be representative of preschool children outside of the city.</p>
<p>Also, due to ethical considerations, all data were collected within the classroom. The activity was completed with the children during free play time, since this was the most convenient time for early childhood educators. However, this procedure sometimes created a distraction for children participating in the activity. For example, in some instances, other children not involved in the study would come over to the child participating in the activity and watch as the child answered questions. This may have made children participating in the study feel uncomfortable or scrutinized and also may have influenced children to answer questions a certain way to increase their social desirability amongst their peers. In addition, in one centre, the teacher was present throughout the activity with the children, which also may have affected how the participants answered the questions.</p>
<p>Although, previous research has shown that socioeconomic status is correlated with perceptions of obesity and may be a confounding factor, this variable was not explored in this study. In future research, socioeconomic status should be included as a variable to understand how preschool children’s socioeconomic status could be associated with their perceptions of overweight children.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this study cannot be directly compared to other similar studies since different measures were used. Although this study used Tillman et al.’s (2007) stories and pictures, the research instrument was slightly altered, so that the target figures’ faces were replaced with blank ovals. Therefore, a direct comparison can not be made with Tillman’s study due to potential differences in the research instrument’s effect.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1476718X11407411">
<title>Recommendations for future research</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1476718X11407411">Latner et al. (2007)</xref> suggest that in order to make comparisons among different populations, ‘a measure standardized for more widespread use would permit investigations and comparisons of weight stigma across countries and cultures’ (p. 3079). Therefore, it is recommended that in order for studies to be directly compared to understand how age, gender, culture, geographical location, or socioeconomic status are correlated with children’s perceptions of weight, standardized measures need to be used to further inform our knowledge regarding weight stigmatization.</p>
<p>Additionally, researchers have previously questioned whether measures of children’s perceptions really provide information about children’s actual behaviour towards overweight individuals. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1476718X11407411">Kraig and Keel (2001)</xref> indicate that it is unknown how perceptions or attitudes may be manifested in behaviours. Therefore, although children have negative perceptions of overweight children, it is not known if these same children are stigmatizing overweight children. Research has shown that overweight children are stigmatized by their peers; however, the proportion of children with negative perceptions who actually behave negatively towards overweight children is not known. Research examining perceptions could benefit from using observational measures to better understand how, or if, children’s negative perceptions manifest themselves as negative outward actions towards overweight children.</p>
<p>Finally, this study looked solely at how weight contributes to perceptions, since both target figures were identical except for weight. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1476718X11407411">Kraig and Keel (2001)</xref> argue that asking participants to label target figures different only in weight ‘does not reflect how social evaluations naturally occur or how weight status may interact with other information to influence social evaluations’ (p. 1665). For example, facial attractiveness may play a role in how children perceive overweight individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1476718X11407411">Counts et al., 1986</xref>). Future studies should explore how or if facial attractiveness or clothing style is associated with perceptions about overweight children.</p>
<p>There are still a plethora of unanswered questions regarding children’s perceptions of overweight children. Researchers have highlighted that universal prevention programs to decrease weight-based stigmatization may be more beneficial than intervention programs, since it may be easier to encourage children to respect others regardless of weight than to change negative attitudes about weight that they may already have. Therefore, researchers should continue to investigate the origins of weight-based stigmatization in order to understand how it begins and develops, so that they can devise ways of preventing negative associations with overweight individuals from forming.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1476718X11407411">
<title>Contributions of the study</title>
<p>The current study has contributed to the literature by examining young children’s perceptions of overweight children. This is an important step in determining an effective age to introduce universal prevention programs to children in order to prevent weight-based biases from developing. As well, there have been few studies regarding body size stigmatization conducted with very young children; therefore, the current study has provided more information regarding preschool children’s perceptions of weight. The study is significant because it shows the necessity for programming to combat weight-based stigmatization that begins in the early years.</p>
<p>In addition, many studies have been based solely on asking children to associate character traits or choose between overweight and non-overweight target figures; however, few studies have examined children’s rationales. This study has contributed to the literature because it has used children’s input to help illuminate why children perceived overweight children negatively. Thus, children’s voices will be involved in creating programming targeted towards body size acceptance, since children have highlighted some factors that affect their perceptions of obesity. Therefore implementing programs which focus on the areas that children have outlined through their rationales may decrease weight-based stigmatization. Studies in the future can continue to document children’s voices in order to understand more factors which influence children’s perceptions of obesity.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Body size acceptance is essential for children because body size stigmatization is related to many serious problems. The lessons learned from this study will help early childhood educators, teachers, and parents create better strategies to address body size issues in early childhood programs, schools, and home environments. With more research and the development and evaluation of programs, children can be positively influenced. By creating environments where all educators, parents, and children are accepting of each other regardless of race, culture, religion, gender, sexuality, disability, and body size, an atmosphere of inclusion, acceptance and belongingness can be achieved for each child.</p>
