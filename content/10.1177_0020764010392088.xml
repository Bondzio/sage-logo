<title>Background</title>
<p>Several interventions for children of mentally ill parents have been developed in recent years with the aim of preventing mental disorders and promoting mental health and resilience for this group of children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020764010392088">World Health Organization (WHO), 2004</xref>) with well-known elevated risk for psychiatric problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020764010392088">Parnas et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020764010392088">Weissman et al., 2006</xref>). Most of the interventions target the children’s/adolescents’ coping strategies in groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020764010392088">Fraser et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020764010392088">Horowitz and Garber, 2006</xref>). Beardslee’s family intervention is one of the few family-based interventions for children who have yet to exhibit symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020764010392088">National Research Council and Institute of Medicine, 2009</xref>). In psychiatric services, family-based interventions could be seen as the most natural approach because the parents with mental illness often are concerned about their children and want to know if the situation has harmed them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020764010392088">Beardslee, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>There is a growing trend that strengthens the status of the children as relatives when parents suffer from serious illness. This is in agreement with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and appears in recent supplements in legislations in Nordic countries, for example, in the Swedish Health and Medical Service Act. This obligates the professionals in psychiatric services to take patients’ children into consideration; this includes meeting with their need for information and support, and discussing issues of parenthood and the children’s well-being with patients. However, mental illness is often surrounded by silence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020764010392088">Focht and Beardslee, 1996</xref>) and stigma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020764010392088">Östman and Kjellin, 2002</xref>) and these issues are delicate when a parent suffers from mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020764010392088">Pihkala and Johansson, 2008</xref>). It is, therefore, important to pay attention to the parents’ experiences when promotive/preventive interventions for the children are practised in psychiatric services.</p>

<title>Description of the method</title>
<p>Beardslees’s family intervention (FI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020764010392088">Beardslee et al., 2003</xref>) was developed by Beardslee and colleagues. It is called family talk intervention or clinician-based cognitive psycho-educational intervention for families in the USA. FI is not a therapeutic intervention for any of the family members but is designed to prevent depressive symptoms and to promote resilience in the children of affectively ill parents by opening up communication about the parent’s illness within the family and by helping parents to recognize and support the protective factors for their children. Openness about the illness within the family enhances children’s understanding of the parent’s illness and the family’s and the child’s own situation. Resilient adolescents are characterized by self-understanding, together with a commitment to relationships, school and other activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020764010392088">Beardslee and Podorefsky, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020764010392088">Werner and Smith, 1992</xref>). Hence, the communication about parental illness is one of the main targets of FI.</p>
<p>The theoretical foundation of FI is eclectic; narrative, cognitive, psychoeducational and dialogical elements are included. An open and collaborative way of working characterizes FI. It is a manualized method consisting of five sessions: two meetings with the parents, individual interviews with the children, another meeting with the parents, and finally a family session. In the first two sessions both parents are given an opportunity to talk about the illness, its consequences for the parent him/herself, for the partner and for the children, while the other parent listens. Psychoeducational material about the parent’s illness and the protective factors for the children, linked to the family’s own experiences, is provided in order to reduce feelings of guilt and shame. Each child’s situation is discussed, along with the parents’ concerns about the child and any questions parents want to ask him/her.</p>
<p>The parents are asked to prepare the child before being interviewed, usually at home. The focus of the interview is to explore protective and risk factors for the child and to listen to the child’s experiences of the parental illness. In the next step the parents are given feedback from the interview. The parents receive information about how they can promote the protective factors for their children and how to talk about the illness with them. The parents and the professionals then plan together for the family meeting, with the children’s experiences and questions as a base but also bringing all family members’ perspectives together to the session. The ill parent by him/herself and both parents together will tell the children about the illness, in order to start a process in the family. Follow-up is offered after one and six months and, when possible, professionals are available to see parents in the interim or after follow-up.</p>

<title>Research and adaptations</title>
<p>There is evidence of positive change for both children and within the families in long-term follow-up studies. Positive outcomes were found in a 4.5-year follow-up study concerning parental child-related behaviours and attitudes, child-reported understanding of parental illness, children’s internalizing symptoms and family functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020764010392088">Beardslee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020764010392088">SAMHSA, 2006</xref>). A recent randomized controlled study from Finland shows reduction in children’s emotional symptoms and improvement in their pro-social behaviour in 1.5-year follow-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020764010392088">Solantaus et al., 2010</xref>). Successful cultural adaptations of Beardslee’s preventive family intervention programme in a high-risk urban sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020764010392088">Podorefsky et al., 2001</xref>) and in low-income Latino families have been presented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020764010392088">d’Angelo et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Implementation of FI on a national level has been supported by the public health authorities in Finland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020764010392088">Solantaus and Toikka, 2006</xref>) and in Sweden. In both countries, the use of FI soon expanded to other diagnostic categories than affective disorders. The expansion has been considered reasonable because the basic ideas of FI also apply to families with parental mental illness other than affective disorder: the silence that often surrounds the illness and the children’s need of knowledge and understanding. It is the parents’ insight of their illness and understanding that it might affect the children that determines the success of FI, rather than the diagnosis. The concrete adaptations needed are adjustments in the psychoeducational part of the FI, which is always adapted individually, and more generous use of extra sessions.</p>
<p>Two recent studies from Nordic countries have shown that FI is a safe and feasible method to use in general psychiatry for families with parental depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020764010392088">Solantaus et al., 2009</xref>) and also possibly for parents with a variety of diagnoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020764010392088">Pihkala et al., 2010</xref>). Both studies showed a high degree of parental satisfaction and positively experienced effects of FI. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020764010392088">Pihkala et al. (2010)</xref> found that 93% of the parents answered positively to questions concerning general satisfaction, such as the atmosphere in the sessions, if the timing was right or if they would recommend FI to others. Concerning perceived impact of FI, 74% of the answers indicated a positive impact on parents’ understanding of their children, feelings of shame and guilt, concerns about the children and the well-being of the parent.</p>
<p>The aim of the present study was to explore parents’ experiences of the process of FI.</p>

<title>Settings and participants</title>
<p>Participants were recruited by professionals who conducted FIs in Sweden during 2007. The interviewees in this study had participated in FIs conducted by a total of 26 professionals from general psychiatric services who had participated in the first FI training groups in Sweden. All but one of the FIs were carried out by pairs of professionals.</p>
<p>Twenty four of 70 families who had responded to the questionnaire in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020764010392088">Pihkala et al., 2010</xref>) were requested to participate in the interviews and at least one member from each of 18 families accepted to take part. The selection was strategic in order to gain variation in the IP-parents’ (patient) diagnosis, in the clinical setting and in the professionals. Reasons for declining to participate in the study were not requested. The families were from nine clinics, ranging from northern to southern Sweden.</p>
<p>Members from 18 families were interviewed and a total of 39 interviews were carried out. Fourteen of these family members were children from nine families. Six complete families were interviewed. In seven families, only one member accepted to be interviewed; in six cases this was the IP-parent, in one case the NIP-parent (non-patient). These parents stated that the other family members had not wanted to participate. The biological parents were living together in 10 of these 18 families. In one case the interviewed NIP-parent was a step-parent. Two families had an ethnic background other than Nordic. One of the FIs was conducted with an interpreter by phone.</p>
<p>In 11 families the IP-parents’ clinical diagnosis was depression. Two parents were diagnosed with personality disorder, one with bipolar syndrome, one with both generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), one with psychosis NUD and one with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In the family where only the NIP-parent was interviewed, the IP-parent’s diagnosis was bipolar syndrome. All but one of the IP-parents had continuous contact with a psychiatric clinic and were on medication at the time for the interview. Half of them had been hospitalized at least once (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020764010392088">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The 14 children were interviewed individually; there was an equal number of boys and girls and the age range was 6–17 (median 12 years). Three pairs of siblings and three siblings in one family were interviewed. None of the children had a psychiatric diagnosis. (The children’s experiences will be presented in a future paper.)</p>
<p>This study was approved by the local ethics committee of Umeå University (Dnr 07-002M).</p>

<title>Data collection and analysis</title>
<p>Data was collected via qualitative interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020764010392088">Kvale, 1996</xref>) carried out by the first and third authors during 2007–2008. Both are engaged in the implementation of FI in Sweden but did not conduct the FIs for the interviewees.</p>
<p>The families decided on where the interview was to take place; 10 families chose to be interviewed at home, five at a clinic, one at a primary healthcare centre and two interviews were conducted by phone due to long distance or lack of time for the parent. Two parents from one family were interviewed through an interpreter.</p>
<p>The interviews were as open ended as possible. The parents were initially invited to talk about the FI, with the interviewer reminding them about the different phases if necessary. Topics covered included what the parent thought about the set-up of the FI, the child interviews, communication within the family, difficulties faced, what the other family members thought, and the role of the professionals. The interviews lasted 40–50 minutes. They were recorded and then transcribed by an assistant; the transcripts were validated against the recordings.</p>
<p>The interviews, transcriptions and analysis were carried out on a parallel basis. Grounded theory (GT) was chosen as it is an inductive method, appropriate for an unprejudiced examination of the parents’ experiences. First, the researchers coded the transcripts line by line independently, then compared the codes. A number of categories and subcategories were established, which were used to establish one central category. The criteria for the central category were that there were indicators pointing towards it in almost all cases and that all other categories could be related to it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020764010392088">Strauss and Corbin, 1998</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0020764010392088">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Parents’ perception of the professionals</title>
<p>The following are typical statements from the parents:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think there is such a caring spirit in this concept. (family 15, IP-mother, psychosis)</p>
<p>They were so professional, really skilled at their job. (family 3, NIP-mother)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The professionals’ <italic>attitude</italic> towards the parents was perceived as positive. The parents said that it was easy to talk with the professionals, who were just ordinary people, like ‘fellow human beings’. They were straightforward and did not complicate matters, and treated the parents in a fair, non-controlling way. The professionals were also perceived as supportive, empathic and caring and the atmosphere in the sessions was informal. Many parents described that, after the two first sessions, they already felt a confidence in the professionals and it made them feel secure in the FI process.</p>
<p>Professionalism and the ability to talk with the children and to express matters in an appropriate way were valuable to the parents because they were confused about how they themselves should talk to them about the illness. Many parents pointed out how pleased, relieved or astonished they had been that their children had talked openly with the professionals. They stated that the children also gained confidence in the professionals. The parents had not had high expectations before the FI, but their views soon turned positive. <italic>Competence</italic> was used in the description of the professionals, who were perceived as experienced and skilled by the parents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0020764010392088">
<title>FI as a method from the parents’ perspective</title>
<p><italic>The structure of the FI</italic> was described as well-thought-out, solid, educational and ‘ordinary’. The parents said that they received information about what was going to happen next and their sense of control increased.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It was so solid in some way…you had their back-up if problems were to occur with the children. If you start something like this on your own, you don’t know where it can end.’ (family 2, NIP-mother)</p>
<p>It was good that we did not dig in so deeply, it’s more like a normal conversation about these matters, what it means having the illness. (family 15, IP-mother, psychosis)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Being able to meet the professionals twice before the children were interviewed was especially appreciated by the parents. They were able to talk about their experiences of the mental illness in the family and about their concerns for their children. The parents were prepared and felt confident before moving to the next step in the process, because they had got to know the professionals.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I was able to get a sense of security in myself. (family 2, IP-father, depression)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The two sessions also gave the parents an opportunity to listen to each other. For some IP-mothers it was an important experience that their partner was open and could share his worries and thoughts for the first time. The parents described that they gained greater understanding and came closer to each other in their views about their children.</p>
<p>The possibility to follow-up and to contact the professionals if concerns about the children arose gave the parents a sense of security. They now had someone who already knew both the children’s and the family’s situation so they would not have to start again from the beginning with new people.</p>
<p>In summary, the structure of the FI was experienced positively, as solid, logical and predictable, providing a sense of security and control for the parents. It also gave them an opportunity to talk about their situation.</p>
<p>The flexibility of the FI was spoken about by the parents. It included the option of home visits, which were seen in many cases to be a prerequisite for the children’s participation.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think it was very good to have those sessions at home, it was more relaxed. Because this is so emotional, it feels safe being at home. In the psychiatric clinic you feel so small.’ (family 6, IP-mother, depression)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In some cases the parents preferred to have the sessions at a clinic, in order to prevent conflicts during the family session and in order to have more concrete framework and rules for the session. This seemed to be the case in the families who experienced many conflicts.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It was good not to be at home, nobody could get angry and just leave. (family 4, NIP-father)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It was also possible to have extra sessions when needed and parents could influence the pace of the FI, which thus contributed to the sense of control.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We had an extra session because we had so much to talk about, that was good. (family 15, NIP-father)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>On the whole, the FI gave the parents the opportunity, the time, the place and a framework to begin to talk about such a difficult issue with their children. The parents did not believe that they would have been able to talk in this way within the family by themselves; there was a need for someone who could be in charge of the discussion.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It may not have become so big, so serious if they [professionals] had not been with us.’ (family 5, IP-mother, depression)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0020764010392088">
<title>Getting help in starting to talk about mental illness</title>

<p>It was a bit hard when they talked about my son…the judgement in black and white…how you have been as a parent, but it was good to get to know it…’ (family 10, IP-father, depression)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><italic>Listening to the children’s experiences</italic> was a challenge for many parents. All the parents had been concerned about their children’s well-being before the FI, which had been the main reason for their participation. Feelings of guilt were connected with the issue of the children’s well-being for all the IP-parents. Feelings of shame were also associated with the children’s experiences. Thus, the moment when the children were about to be interviewed or when the parents got feedback from these interviews could be charged with anxiety. The confidence they had in the professionals made it easier for parents to let their children be interviewed and to receive the feedback.</p>

<p>The issues of guilt and shame were not present in the interviews with the NIP-parents.</p>
<p>For several parents it was crucial to get concrete help with finding the words and formulations that were appropriate for the children: on the right level, not too complicated, short enough, not too emotional or abstract. This help could be very concrete, the professionals suggesting suitable words for the parent after the parent had explained what he/she wanted to say. Some parents wrote down what they wanted to say in the family session.</p>

<p>I got the opportunity to learn how to explain to my son that now I am tired, you don’t need to worry about me. I didn’t know what to do before. (family 7, IP-mother, depression)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The atmosphere in the family meeting could also be charged with a lot of tension and emotions. Even if the parents knew what to say, the presence of and <italic>the support from the professionals</italic> was perceived as a security. Many parents stated that they could not have started to talk about the illness without the support.</p>

<p>It was so hard to talk with the children. Being a father who was supposed to be the stable man of the house and crying there in the family session. It was good that we had met him [the professional] before the family meeting so he knew what I wanted to say, so he could help me if I needed it. (family 11, IP-father, bipolar)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In summary, initiating communication about the mental illness was in some respects a demanding task for most of the parents, partly because of the feelings of guilt and shame and partly because of the difficulty of finding appropriate words and formulations to describe the illness to their children. The role of the professionals was emphasized and the confidence gained in them earlier in the process was an important facilitating factor, helping the parents to overcome the fear of being judged as parents.</p>

<title>Confidence and security – central category</title>
<p>Confidence and security was determined as the central category from the parents’ perception of the professionals and the FI as a method. It was crucial to further process, when parents started to talk about the mental illness with their children. Listening to the children’s experiences, finding the words and formulations for telling the children about the illness, and finally being able to start to talk about the illness in the family session required that there was a foundation of confidence and security for the parent. In several cases it could be seen how each step in this process strengthened the parent’s confidence and security and facilitated the next step. For example, a parent who doubted if his child would say anything in the interview felt pleased when the child had spoken openly and could receive the feedback from the professionals in a constructive way, even if some concerns about the child were presented. Evolving confidence and security were described by all parents except one, who had a diagnosis of a personality disorder. That parent had no positive experience of the method or the professionals and there was no further process of opening up communication within the family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0020764010392088">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A central finding was the parents’ experience of confidence and security in the professionals and in the FI. It was the foundation of the parents’ process towards initiating communication about their mental illness with their children.</p>
<p>The families in the present study were heterogeneous in terms of the parents’ diagnosis. The FIs were conducted by many different professionals. Thus, the results of this study describe the parents’ experiences in the FI when the method is applied to a naturalistic clinical context.</p>
<sec id="section14-0020764010392088">
<title>Confidence and security – the alliance</title>
<p>The phenomenon of the parents’ confidence and security in the professionals and in the method appears to be close to the concept of therapeutic alliance, as used in the field of psychotherapy. The FI is not itself a psychotherapeutic intervention, but the setting resembles that used in short-term psychotherapy. Studies have also shown the importance of an alliance in general psychiatric care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020764010392088">Johansson, 2006</xref>) and the concept of alliance has become pan-theoretical. It thus appears to be reasonable to use the term alliance in this context.</p>
<p>The concept of alliance includes the client’s affective relationship with the therapist, the client’s motivation and ability to accomplish work collaboratively with the therapist, the therapist’s empathic responding to and involvement with the client, and the client’s and the therapist’s agreement about goals and tasks of therapy. The alliance is the most important single common factor in all psychotherapy, having a strong correlation to treatment outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020764010392088">Wampold, 2001</xref>). The severity of the problems and diagnostic group have no clear correlation to the establishment of alliance, even if there is a tendency for patients with borderline or other personality disorders to have more difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020764010392088">Johansson and Eklund, 2006</xref>), probably due to interpersonal problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020764010392088">Kernberg, 1993</xref>). This corresponds to the results of the present study with informants having varying diagnoses but a strong alliance emerging. The only exception was a parent with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder.</p>
<p>The professionals’ contribution to the alliance has greater relative importance than that of the patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020764010392088">Baldwin et al., 2007</xref>). Attributes such as being flexible, honest, respectful, trustworthy, confident, warm, interested and open were found to contribute to the alliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020764010392088">Ackerman and Hilsenroth, 2003</xref>). In the present study the professionals were perceived as competent, but also as fellow human beings with a warm and supporting attitude, and the parents gained confidence in them. As mentioned before, respect for the parent is one of the principles in the FI. Elements such as transparency, adaptation to the family’s language and respecting the parents’ expertise are emphasized in the training of the professionals in order to contribute to a respectful attitude towards the parents.</p>
<p>The definition of alliance also includes agreement about the treatment goals and the means with which to reach the goals. A characteristic of the FI is a clear statement about the goal: it is the parents who in collaboration with the professionals define their specific goals. The goal of the FI is often basically obvious for the parents and they are provided a structured procedure for reaching that goal.</p>
<p>The structure and properties of the FI were perceived as very positive and well thought-out by the parents. They emphasized the importance of the two first sessions, when each parent had a session when it was their turn to be listened to. This corresponds to studies where clients report that the opportunity to talk about oneself and to be listened to and understood are helpful factors in their psychotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020764010392088">Lilliengren and Werbart, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020764010392088">Werbart et al., 2008</xref>). Listening to each others’ perspectives and getting an increased feeling of security before the interviews with the children during those two first sessions were important elements for the parents. Home visits, when children are included in the sessions, is a property of the FI that almost seemed to be a prerequisite for the further process, similar to previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020764010392088">Pihkala and Johansson, 2008</xref>). The clear structure together with the flexibility of the FI contributed to a sense of control for the parents. Thus, the structure and properties of the FI appear to provide favourable conditions for collaboration between the parents and the professionals.</p>
<p>In summary, when assessing the FI from the perspective of alliance research, several features that enhance the positive alliance could be found. The strong alliance perceived by the parents may also be a partial explanation for the high degree of satisfaction with the FI expressed in the questionnaire-based studies about the method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020764010392088">Pihkala et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020764010392088">Solantaus et al., 2009</xref>). This possible explanation is also mentioned in the study of the cultural adaptation of the method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020764010392088">d’Angelo et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>As noted above, mental illness is surrounded by silence and stigma. It is especially difficult for a parent to start to talk about it with their children due to feelings of guilt. It is nevertheless striking how demanding it was for the parents to initiate communication about the illness. Studying the children of psychiatric patients has until now been a neglected area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020764010392088">Knutsson-Medin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020764010392088">Östman et al., 2005</xref>). One reason for this may have been the professionals’ perception that the issue of parenthood is too delicate for the parents. Because the FI seems to give a solid base of confidence and security for the parents, it might be a practicable method for psychiatric services when the needs of the patients’ children are to be met.</p>
<p>The codes found in the interviews of the IP- parents and NIP-parents were similar apart from those belonging to the subcategory ‘listening to the children’s experiences’, which were not found in the NIP-parent interviews. This indicates that the NIP-parents had fewer feelings of guilt and shame towards the children, which was also found in the questionnaire study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020764010392088">Pihkala et al., 2010</xref>), and that both had similar concerns about their children and difficulties in talking about the illness. The codes in the interviews of parents with different parental diagnoses in the family did not show any considerable variation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0020764010392088">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study has several limitations. A considerable number of families invited to the study declined to participate and due to attrition within the families, the number of interviewed NIP-parents remained low. Also the total number of the interviewed parents is relatively small, which limits the transferability of the results. The low number of other diagnoses than depression may account for the similarity in the results across parents. A possible preconceptual bias because of the authors’ engagement in the method should also be kept in mind, but the interviewees perceived the interviewers as non-dependent from the professionals who had conducted the FI. In order to reduce the risk of bias, the interviews were held using dialogue that was as open and non-directive as possible and a conscious effort was made to perceive any negative aspects of the FI in the transcripts.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The present study indicates that a parent’s confidence and security in the professionals and in the FI as a method is a prerequisite for the process when the parent is about to start to talk about their mental illness with their children. The FI as a structured, but at the same time, flexible method seems to provide a solid base for the establishment of an alliance with the parent and might be a practicable method for psychiatric services, considering the trend that the issues of parenthood and children are to be discussed more frequently.</p>
