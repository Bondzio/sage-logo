<p>Good research does not mean good policy, but policy or legal conclusions that rely on false assumptions are certain to be bad. When the rights of U.S. students of color are at stake, the Supreme Courts need the best research findings the country can offer. The U.S. Constitution contains sweeping and undefined terms. Reaching a conclusion about the meaning of the great 14th Amendment guarantee of “equal protection of the laws” depends on the Court’s understanding of complex facts about complex universities and the extraordinary role they play in contemporary society. Today, the Courts must determine what rights created after the Civil War mean in a society now far more diverse than during the first two centuries of U.S. history. No one disputes that there were severe policies of mandated segregation in higher education systems in 17 states and discriminatory practices in many institutions outside the South for long periods of time. Even where there was no discrimination, or after explicit exclusion ended in elite universities, little was done to integrate leading campuses until the 1960s. How should courts assess whether the effects of those practices have been overcome?</p>
<p>Should courts interpret “equal protection” as being about color blindness toward individuals or rule that it was intended to ensure fair treatment of historically excluded peoples? How should they weigh the strong academic evidence on the educational power of diverse classes as a benefit for students of all races, evidence that has been affirmed as a compelling legal argument by the Supreme Court in its two earlier affirmative action decisions, against the claim of a White student who says that she was discriminated against? How should they assess the impacts of a decision that might make colleges abandon a set of practices that were voluntarily implemented for the last half century by almost all selective universities (except public universities in a few states where they are forbidden by state law)? Are underrepresented minorities fungible, or are they distinct groups whose contributions must each be considered separately and whose rights must each be protected? How much damage would be done to students and the educational process by reducing minorities to token status within classes?</p>
<p>These are among the questions the <italic>Fisher</italic> case brings to the Supreme Court. During the civil rights era, there was a solid majority on the Court who believed that a history of discrimination and inequality meant that race-conscious action was essential if we were to achieve genuine equal opportunity in a society where Black and Latino students have always had unequal preparation. Conservative governments, however, insisted that affirmative policies were no longer needed and were unfair to Whites, and their judicial appointments led the courts to give much more attention to this issue.</p>
<p>When the highest court in the land is seriously considering overturning its precedents by reinterpreting the facts about a number of these issues just a decade after it supposedly settled the question of affirmative action, it is critical to try to put what we have learned in research before the judges who decide the issue.</p>
<p>A half-century ago, the courts, many policymakers, researchers, and universities concluded that race-conscious plans were the only way to equalize opportunity. This was true in school desegregation, in voting rights, in affirmative action, in employment and, of course, in college admissions. In college admissions, the 19 states (including Texas) that had a history of separate public colleges for Black students had a clear constitutional obligation to take action to overcome the effects of that history. However, there was no consensus about what those actions needed to be, how they should be assessed, or how long they should last. In the rest of the country, affirmative action in selective campuses was voluntary and colleges were limited by the 1978 <italic>Bakke</italic> decision to considering race as only a “plus factor” in a multidimensional admissions process. There was a great battle over the legitimacy of even doing that in the University of Michigan cases, which ended with the Supreme Court affirming the <italic>Bakke</italic> process in the 2003 <italic>Grutter</italic> decision. Both were 5-4 decisions, with the Court profoundly divided in its understanding of both the law and the realities of society. As the Supreme Court became even more conservative with two appointments by President George W. Bush, the stage was set for another challenge. It was not surprising that the challenge came at the University of Texas (UT) because UT-Austin had the most extensive and publicized alternative to affirmative action, the 10-percent plan. The <italic>Fisher</italic> lawsuit claimed that affirmative action was unneeded to achieve diversity, and discriminatory against a White student.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court since the later 1980s has powerfully pushed the country backwards and on several basic issues of racial justice, reinterpreting legal standards and reaching conclusions that positive policies are unnecessary and unfair. Some scholars see a repeat of the Court decisions undermining the Reconstruction civil rights laws that culminated in the 1896 <italic>Plessy v. Ferguson</italic> “separate but equal” decision, which made segregation legal and legitimized segregation laws in all aspects of Southern life. The Court decisions of the Warren Court in the 1950s and 1960s were enormously important in stimulating the civil rights movement, which led the struggle to enact and enforce the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which powerfully dismantled many forms of segregation by law in the South. Since the late 1980s, however, the Supreme Court has been narrowing and reversing civil rights law. Six years ago, the Supreme Court in the extraordinary <italic>Parents Involved</italic> decision outlawed the major forms of voluntary desegregation supported by educators and school boards who valued diversity in public schools, suddenly forbidding practices that had been praised and supported by courts for a half century. School segregation has increased sharply and consistently since the Supreme Court began to end desegregation plans in the 1990s. The <italic>Fisher</italic> case threatens the resegregation of our colleges.</p>
<p>When the Court decided to hear the <italic>Fisher</italic> case, the Civil Rights Project’s 15 years of working with scholars across the country on these issues was immediately relevant. The project was created at Harvard in 1996 in response to the sudden ending of affirmative action in the two largest states, California and Texas. Higher education, in particular, has been a central interest of the Project. We quickly learned that the social science research community had had few connections with the legal community and that it had failed to produce adequate research on the issues coming before the courts and the public in affirmative action and a range of other basic civil rights questions. We also learned that the civil rights lawyers and officials had little connection with researchers, except in using a small number of them in expert testimony in some major cases. Because the federal government had largely stopped funding major research on issues of racial equity and there was little private funding for such work, we often asked leading experts to donate work to produce important studies relating to real legal and policy issues and face peer review both from scholars and legal experts. This effort helped create an active network of interdisciplinary researchers engaged in cutting-edge ongoing research. When the Supreme Court upheld affirmative action in 2003, the Project’s edited book, <italic>Diversity Challenged</italic>, and a brief written by Project Attorney Angelo Ancheta for the American Educational Research Association (AERA) were both cited in the decision as bases for several key conclusions by the Supreme Court’s majority.</p>
<p>The deficiencies that the judicial process can face, however, are particularly obvious in the Texas case. In the American judicial system, higher courts do not receive new factual evidence, do not hear any testimony from experts, and neither the judges nor their small staffs of recent law school graduates who serve as clerks typically have training in understanding statistics or social science research. Yet, they exercise vast power to determine the meaning of fundamental laws and change the operations of basic institutions. The University of Michigan in the 2003 <italic>Grutter</italic> case invested heavily in creating and presenting compelling research evidence, both working with researchers on their campus and coordinating with groups and experts across the country. The UT did not do this because it was only a case about a single student that they had found ineligible in any case. Unlike in the Michigan case, the lower courts did not allow civil rights lawyers representing the students of color to intervene in the case to create a broader factual record. The UT’s interest, of course, was to present evidence to defend its practices, not to consider the feasibility of those practices in other kinds of institutions and regions or in graduate and professional schools. The Michigan cases had provided the Court with a record that considered the issues broadly and in depth. In the <italic>Fisher</italic> case, the interests of many groups and institutions that will be affected deeply by any decision were not reflected in the case record before the Court.</p>
<p>With a weak record, the only way to submit new information for possible consideration by the Court is to submit an <italic>amicus</italic> (friend of the court) brief, a complicated process in which all the arguments, evidence, and documentation need to be presented to judges without technical training and related to the pending legal questions in a maximum of 9,000 words. The Civil Rights Project had worked closely with AERA on both the Michigan case and the <italic>Parents Involved</italic> school desegregation case. It quickly became apparent in the Texas case that a single major social science brief could not possibly deal with research analyzing both the educational value of diversity in colleges and the degree to which any alternative approach ignoring race could produce campus diversity. AERA decided to take on a social science brief on the benefits of diversity under the leadership of Professor Angelo Ancheta, who had previously worked with the organization on the University of Michigan brief and a number of prominent scholars. The Civil Rights Project convened a group of researchers to create a brief on the issue of whether any nonracial alternative, such as socioeconomic status, could produce diverse campuses. Because the majority of the Court had affirmed the educational and social value of integrated education, this was likely to be the central question in a decision. The brief was developed in an ongoing intellectual exchange of a group of leading researchers identifying the most important research and data to place before the Court.</p>
<p>There were, of course, many briefs submitted by different higher education associations and universities, civil rights groups and others, and a much smaller number opposing affirmative action. The Supreme Court does not have to pay attention to any of them, but they are there as a possible basis for the decision. Hundreds of researchers supported the conclusions in the social scientists’ briefs and a number of the most important national scholarly associations joined the AERA brief. Justices may or may not pay any attention now. Recent cases have shown 5-4 divisions reflecting deeply divergent understandings of American society on the high court. In a closely divided Court where the replacement of one justice can lead to a new definition of constitutional rights, however, these debates will continue long after this case and it is the responsibility of the research community to provide the best evidence it can find to help inform the discussion. The experience in preparing the social science briefs showed that there is a critical mass of scholars who have done serious work in this area who were prepared to immediately drop other things and contribute by identifying and summarizing the most significant related research across lines of disciplines and research fields. It showed that there were large numbers of scholars in many institutions and research centers in all parts of the country who wanted to be part of this effort. In a time of dramatic growth of diversity and deep social and educational inequality, it showed a substantial reservoir of knowledge and commitment that is a valuable national asset now and for the nation’s future.</p>
