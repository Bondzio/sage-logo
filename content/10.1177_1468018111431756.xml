<abstract>
<p>Based on the Dominican Republic’s economic and political institutional characteristics, we would expect social spending there to be at least average for Latin America. Yet in reality this country ranks at or near the bottom of the region in educational, health, pension and overall social spending, alongside significantly poorer, slower growing and less democratic countries. This article argues that the underdevelopment of Dominican social policies reflects the political impact of international migration flows, including both Dominican emigration to the United States and the immigration into the Dominican Republic from neighboring Haiti. These flows have inhibited the development of progressive political actors, including the partisan left and organized labor, and facilitated the adoption of an economic production model that erects additional obstacles to the expansion of the country’s social policies. Although the Dominican case is rather anomalous within Latin America, it holds important implications for countries outside the region.</p>

<p><italic>Migrations internationales et faiblesse des politiques sociales en République dominicaine</italic></p>
<p>Si l’on se base sur les caractéristiques institutionnelles économiques et politiques de la République dominicaine, l’on s’attendrait à des dépenses sociales au moins de la même envergure que celles de l’Amérique latine. Dans la réalité cependant, ce pays se classe à un niveau inférieur ou égal à celui de la région en matière d’éducation, de santé, de retraite et de l’ensemble des dépenses sociales, au même titre que des pays nettement plus pauvres, à croissance plus lente, et moins démocratiques. Cet article soutient que le sous-développement des politiques sociales dominicaines reflète l’impact politique des flux migratoires internationaux, y compris de l’émigration dominicaine aux États-Unis et de l’immigration en provenance du voisin haïtien vers la République dominicaine. Ces flux ont empêché le développement d’acteurs politiques progressistes, y compris la gauche partisane et les travaillistes. Ces flux ont également facilité l’adoption d’un modèle de production économique qui érige des obstacles supplémentaires à l’expansion des politiques sociales du pays. Bien que la situation dominicaine soit pour le moins anormale en Amérique latine, elle est porteuse d’importantes implications pour les pays en dehors de la région.</p>

<p><italic>Migración Internacional y Subdesarrollo de las Políticas Sociales en la República Dominicana</italic></p>
<p>Dadas las características económicas y político-institucionales de la República Dominicana sería esperable que el nivel de gasto social fuera igual o superior al promedio latinoamericano. Sin embargo, el nivel de gasto social total, y desagregado por sector (educación, salud y pensiones), es similar o incluso inferior al de países más pobres, de crecimiento más lento y menos democráticos de la región. Este artículo argumenta que el subdesarrollo de las políticas sociales dominicanas refleja el impacto político de los flujos de migración internacional, incluyendo la emigración dominicana a los Estados Unidos y la inmigración haitiana a la República Dominicana. Estos flujos han inhibido el desarrollo de actores políticos progresistas, incluyendo los partidos de izquierda y el sindicalismo, y facilitado la adopción de un modelo de producción económico que genera obstáculos adicionales a la expansión de políticas sociales. Si bien el caso dominicano es algo anómalo en América Latina, tiene implicancias importantes para países fuera de la región.</p>

<p>Analyses of social policy development often stress its positive relationship to economic variables such as per capita income and the rate of economic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468018111431756">Haggard and Kaufman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1468018111431756">Sandbrook et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1468018111431756">Wilensky, 1975</xref>). These associations would seem to augur well for social policy in the Dominican Republic, at least by regional standards. The Dominican Republic enjoyed the fastest economic growth of any Latin American country from 1960 to 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1468018111431756">Jaramillo and Sancak, 2007</xref>) and is now classified by the World Bank as an upper middle income country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1468018111431756">World Bank, 2010a</xref>). Institutional conditions would also seem to favor social policy expansion in the case of the Dominican Republic. The country’s transition to democracy in 1978 was the earliest of the Third Wave transitions in the region and its democratic institutions offer precious few ‘veto points’ at which opponents of social reform could hope to block it. Nevertheless, in core areas such as education, health care and pensions, the Dominican Republic is actually one of the worst performers in Latin America, ranking alongside poorer and often less democratic countries, such as Honduras, Nicaragua and Paraguay.</p>
<p>In this paper I examine the contrast between, on the one hand, the Dominican Republic’s exceptional economic performance and seemingly favorable political institutional structures and, on the other, its markedly underdeveloped social policies. In addressing this question I also contribute to the broader theoretical debate on the origins of social policy and the democratic welfare state and, in particular, I underscore the relevance of a causal variable that has attracted very little attention in this debate – international migration.</p>
<p>At one level, my analysis of the Dominican case is consistent with some key ideas from the literature on the welfare state in advanced industrialized countries. It echoes quite clearly the emphasis of power resources theory on the role of political organizations representing the economic interests of lower-class people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1468018111431756">Korpi, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1468018111431756">Stephens, 1979</xref>). The underdevelopment of Dominican social policies, I argue, has much to do with the striking absence of any electorally significant left-of-center party and the weakness of popular civil society. My interpretation also has affinities with the newer theoretical focus on economic production regimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468018111431756">Huber and Stephens, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1468018111431756">Iverson, 2005</xref>). Specifically, I make the case that the country’s heavy reliance on export-processing zones (EPZs) and tourism in recent decades has tended to discourage deeper redistribution by the state.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, rather than portraying lower-class organization and production regime as independent variables, my analysis emphasizes their role as mediating variables. I argue that the observed outcome on these variables is deeply influenced by another force – international migration flows. Although several Latin American countries have high emigration rates, the Dominican Republic is the only one at or near the top of the regional rankings with regard to both emigration and immigration. It has the second highest emigration rate in the region and, at the same time, it also receives a large influx of poor, undocumented immigrants from Haiti, which shares with it the island of Hispaniola. Both of these flows have limited the growth of social spending, albeit in different ways.</p>
<p>Although the welfare state literature largely ignores cross-border population flow, migration specialists have argued that emigration relieves pressure for domestic change by allowing ambitious non-elites to seek economic advancement outside of their country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1468018111431756">Portes and Walton, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1468018111431756">Sassen-Koob, 1978</xref>). In the Dominican case, the impact of outmigration is amplified by a seldom-noted difference relative to most other Latin American countries: that Dominicans have easier legal access to the United States and thus can usually work in the formal economy and come and go as they wish. The relative ease with which Dominican families make use of emigration to boost their incomes arguably enhances the transmission of market-oriented US values and the perception of social mobility among young people.</p>
<p>The impact of Haitian immigration works through a number of channels. As scholars have pointed out, Dominican leaders regularly use the Haitian population as a scapegoat for a range of social problems, thereby deflecting attention from the lack of effective policies to address these issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468018111431756">Baud, 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1468018111431756">Sagás (2000)</xref> also suggests that the Haitian presence inhibits the emergence of class consciousness among poorer Dominicans by giving them a group of people they can feel superior to. These arguments help to explain the weakness of progressive forces in Dominican politics, but at least equally important is a causal connection not emphasized: the debilitating impact of Haitian immigration on labor organization. The Haitian presence has not only divided the work force along ethnic lines but also created a large contingent of workers lacking virtually any legal protection. An underdeveloped labor movement, in turn, has deprived left-leaning parties of a crucial source of potential support and facilitated the EPZ-oriented development path.</p>
<p>I develop these arguments in six sections. The first synthesizes the scholarly research on social policy development. The second examines Dominican social policies within a broader regional perspective. The third analyzes Dominican social policy underdevelopment in light of existing theory, arguing that power resources and, to a lesser extent, production regime theory, explain it most effectively. The fourth and fifth discuss the roles of emigration and immigration, respectively, in shaping the variables emphasized by power resources and production regime theory. Finally, the conclusion summarizes the arguments and underscores their relevance beyond the Dominican Republic.</p>
<sec id="section1-1468018111431756">
<title>Theories of social policy development</title>
<p>There is an extensive body of research on the determinants of social policy and the related issue of income redistribution, which I synthesize below. I parse it into three categories – economic, institutional and civil society-based – according to the kind of independent variables stressed. As I emphasize, although this literature is in some ways quite rich, it pays virtually no attention to the influence of international migration.</p>
<p>Economic variables have a prominent place in analyses of social policy. One of the major themes is the impact of economic development. Early analyses of the welfare state emphasized the strong correlation between a country’s level of development and the proportion of national income devoted to public social programs, with some attributing it to rising labor productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1468018111431756">Rimlinger, 1966</xref>) and others to demographic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1468018111431756">Wilensky, 1975</xref>). Although subsequent studies tended to emphasize the differences in social spending among the rich countries, they did not deny the existence of a correlation between prosperity and social policy development. Students of social policy in developing countries have also stressed the role of economic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1468018111431756">Sandbrook et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1468018111431756">Segura-Ubiergo, 2007</xref>). For example, Sandbrook et al. argue that a certain level of capitalist development is a necessary condition for the emergence of social democracy in ‘peripheral’ countries because of its impact on resource availability, state strength and class structure.</p>
<p>A related, but distinct, argument is that economic growth shapes the extent of social spending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468018111431756">Friedman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468018111431756">Haggard and Kaufman, 2008</xref>). Rapid growth loosens fiscal constraints and also tends to make the electorate more disposed to support programs that benefit the disadvantaged and promote social mobility. Conversely, stagnation not only limits the resources available for social policy directly, but also tilts public attitudes toward a zero-sum view of public spending, in which resources channeled to poorer citizens represent a direct deduction from already tight family budgets. ‘Robust growth directly reduces poverty but also influences the way the disadvantaged are viewed and the way societies respond to their plight. Where growth is robust, the social contract is likely to be more expansive as well’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468018111431756">Haggard and Kaufman, 2008</xref>: 355).</p>
<p>Another influential economics-based argument is that the extent of redistribution achieved through taxation and spending is a function of income inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468018111431756">Acemoglu and Robinson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468018111431756">Boix, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1468018111431756">Meltzer and Richard, 1981</xref>). The greater the inequality, the more the crucial median voter will demand that the state redistribute downward. For the state to respond to this preference, however, it must operate according to democratic, universal suffrage principles. Thus, in the ‘Meltzer-Richard model’ inequality interacts with another variable, political democracy, which I discuss below.</p>
<p>Recent research on social policy has also stressed the impact of the economic growth model, or ‘production regime’ on social policies, the idea being that certain approaches to organizing an economy are more compatible with generous social policies than others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468018111431756">Huber and Stephens, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1468018111431756">Iversen, 2005</xref>). In particular, these studies emphasize that extensive welfare states are associated with ‘high road’ production models focused on skill-intensive manufacturing. Such an approach facilitates a compromise in which businesses accept higher taxes in order to fund generous social and job-training programs, while workers refrain from militancy in order to keep wages at a manageable level. Although this school of thought grew out of research on wealthy countries, it has adherents among students of developing societies as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468018111431756">Haggard and Kaufman, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Political institutions are also viewed as shaping social policy outcomes in crucial ways. Perhaps the broadest institutional theory is the notion that democracy promotes the adoption of more generous and redistributive social policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468018111431756">Haggard and Kaufman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468018111431756">Huber et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1468018111431756">Lenski, 1966</xref>). It does so mainly by giving lower-class people a degree of influence – through the vote and accompanying freedoms – that they tend to lack under authoritarian regimes. Even within the category of democracies, however, institutions can be designed in a wide variety of ways, and scholars of the welfare state have argued that this variation helps explain differences in social spending.</p>
<p>Probably the most influential of these arguments emphasizes the number of points in the political decision-making process at which opponents of social reform have the opportunity to block or water down reform proposals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1468018111431756">Immergut, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1468018111431756">Tsebelis, 2002</xref>). Such ‘veto points’ are particularly numerous in political systems in which authority is dispersed among different national institutions (for example, the separation of powers in presidential systems) or between national and sub-national levels of government (that is, federalism), or where the party system is highly fragmented, making it difficult to construct broad legislative coalitions.</p>
<p>A final theory stresses the nature of civil society and organized political groups. One of the longest standing ideas in the research on the welfare state in advanced industrialized countries is that the amount and character of social spending are a reflection of the degree of influence wielded by groups representing the interests of the lower classes, especially industrial labor unions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1468018111431756">Korpi, 1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1468018111431756">1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1468018111431756">Stephens, 1979</xref>). According to this ‘power resources’ perspective, where union density is high and labor organization centralized, labor parties are electorally successful and worker preferences are also expressed through corporatist bargaining. Contemporary versions emphasize control of the state by leftist parties per se, weakening the earlier assumption that leftist electoral success directly reflects the strength of labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468018111431756">Huber and Stephens, 2001</xref>). Recent studies of social policy in developing countries have also embraced the key ideas of power resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468018111431756">Haggard and Kaufman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1468018111431756">Sandbrook et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1468018111431756">Segura-Ubiergo, 2007</xref>), although Sandbrook et al. stress the political role of small, market-oriented farmers, rather than the industrial proletariat.</p>
<p>As this discussion suggests, international migration has not played a substantial role in debates about social policy formation. Some analyses have argued that ethnic diversity impedes welfare state expansion by undermining labor unity or diminishing general social trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1468018111431756">Stephens, 1979</xref>). Immigration is one possible source of such diversity but for the most part these analyses emphasize long-standing ethnic divisions. It is only recently that some scholars have begun to explore the impact of immigration on welfare states, with mixed findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468018111431756">Banting and Kymlicka, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468018111431756">Crepaz, 2008</xref>). These studies, moreover, focus on developed countries and mainly deal with cases in which immigration flows have been largely authorized. Scholars of migration, meanwhile, have broached the idea that emigration may reduce pressure for social reform by providing an alternative means for fulfilling the needs and aspirations of non-elites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1468018111431756">Portes and Walton, 1981</xref>). Surprisingly, however, this idea receives little attention in the literature on social policy. The Dominican case, as I argue below, illustrates how both immigration and emigration can act as powerful brakes on welfare state expansion, through their impact on the variables stressed by power resources and production regime theories.</p>

<title>Social policy in the Dominican Republic</title>
<p>Although rapid economic growth and foreign remittances have boosted the welfare of Dominicans in recent decades, social policy has developed slowly. With the exception of conditional cash transfers (CCTs), the Dominican Republic is at or near the bottom of the regional rankings of spending in all the major social policy areas (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468018111431756">Table 1</xref>). Below I briefly examine the country’s social programs, focusing mainly on the volume of spending as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP), but also looking at indicators of how spending is distributed across income groups, where available.</p>

<p>Since 2005, the Dominican Republic has been part of a region-wide trend of implementing CCT programs, which give monthly cash payments to poor families on the condition that they engage in some desired behavior, usually (as in the Dominican case) consistent school attendance and visits to public health clinics. Spending on CCTs is about 0.3 percent of GDP. Although this figure is somewhat above the regional average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468018111431756">ECLAC, 2009</xref>: 106–107) it is nevertheless a relatively small item in the national budget. Moreover, in more traditional social policy areas, such as education, health and pensions, the Dominican Republic lags far behind much of the region.</p>
<p>Public education is typically seen as one of the most important vehicles for advancing social equity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468018111431756">Huber et al., 2006</xref>), but the Dominican Republic’s performance in this area has been poor. With the exception of the late 1980s and early 1990s, when it plummeted to only 1 percent of GDP, public spending on education has hovered at around 2 percent of GDP since at least the 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1468018111431756">UNDP, 2010</xref>: 189). This may be the lowest figure in the whole of Latin America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468018111431756">Cortés and Giacometti, 2010</xref>: 80) and is less than half the regional average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1468018111431756">Lizardo, 2008</xref>: 3). With regard to spending on primary education, the level that tends to have the strongest redistributive impact, as of 2000 the Dominican Republic ranked behind only Ecuador (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1468018111431756">Wolff and Gurría, 2005</xref>: 22).</p>
<p>Healthcare is also typically one of the more redistributive policies. Here again, however, the country’s performance is weak. When the Dominican Republic made its transition to democracy there were two public health systems: a fully contributory social security system with limited coverage and a network of hospitals providing free treatment to the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1468018111431756">Santana and Rathe, 1992</xref>). A 2001 law overhauling social security promised a new healthcare system with three tiers: one for formal sector wage workers, funded exclusively by private contributions; a second for the non-poor self-employed, partially subsidized by the state; and a third for the poor and disabled fully subsidized by the state. Nevertheless, implementation has advanced slowly. The subsidized system has thus far reached only 40 percent of its target population and the partially subsidized component has not even been initiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1468018111431756">UNDP, 2010</xref>: 177–180). In the last decade, public healthcare spending has averaged about 1.4 percent of GDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1468018111431756">UNDP, 2010</xref>: 292). This is one of the lowest figures in the region, below those of countries including Bolivia, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1468018111431756">United Nations, 2008</xref>: 97).</p>
<p>Pensions systems have been seen as a blunt instrument for fighting poverty in Latin America, since they typically deliver the bulk of their benefits to relatively well-off groups. This is partly because coverage is often restricted to formal sector workers. However, even in some countries where the pension system is criticized on equity grounds, such as Brazil, payments are distributed more equitably than primary income.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1468018111431756">1</xref></sup> Moreover, at least seven countries (including some poorer ones such as Bolivia and Ecuador) now have non-contributory pension programs, which are strongly redistributive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1468018111431756">Rofman et al., 2008</xref>: 17).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in the Dominican Republic the pension system is underdeveloped both in its coverage and its adherence to the contributory principle. In 1980, 11.6 percent of the economically active population (EAP) was covered by the pension regime, which operated on a wholly contributory basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468018111431756">Actis, 2002</xref>: 47). This system remained unchanged until 2001, when the new social security law nominally created a three-tier pension system similar to the healthcare system described above. Almost a decade later, only the fully contributive program has begun to be implemented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1468018111431756">UNDP, 2010</xref>). Pension coverage has increased to about 20 percent of the EAP but is still toward the bottom of the regional rankings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1468018111431756">Rofman et al., 2008</xref>: 9). Of the five countries with lower coverage, all have a lower per capita income. Due to the tardy expansion of coverage, as of 2006 only 10 percent of older Dominicans received pensions, the second lowest rate after Honduras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1468018111431756">Rofman et al., 2008</xref>: 17). A study of eight Latin American countries at varying levels of development found that the Dominican Republic had the lowest public pension spending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1468018111431756">Lindert et al., 2006</xref>: 63).</p>
<p>Given the country’s poor performance in key policy areas, it is not surprising that the Dominican Republic also ranks third from the bottom of the regional ranking in overall social spending, surpassing only Ecuador and Guatemala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468018111431756">ECLAC, 2009</xref>: 89).</p>

<sec id="section3-1468018111431756">
<title>The Dominican case and existing theory</title>
<p>As the previous section suggests, the Dominican Republic has lagged behind Latin America as a whole with regard to social spending. This outcome, as I explain below, is quite paradoxical in relation to a number of influential theories of redistribution. However, it is roughly consistent with some others, especially the power resources model.</p>
<p>The economic variables stressed by the literature would seem to predict substantial redistribution in the Dominican case by regional standards. As discussed above, scholars have noted a correlation between a country’s level of development and the extent of its welfare state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1468018111431756">Sandbrook et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1468018111431756">Wilensky, 1975</xref>). Based on this variable, we would expect the Dominican Republic to be in the middle of the pack in Latin America, since its 2009 per capita gross national income of $4530 is about average for the region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1468018111431756">World Bank, 2010b</xref>). The contrast between theory and reality is even greater with regard to economic growth, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468018111431756">Haggard and Kaufman (2008)</xref> argue has a positive impact on social policy. From 1981 to 2002 the Dominican economy grew faster than that of any other country in Latin America except Chile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1468018111431756">Solimano and Soto, 2005</xref>: 10) and from 1990 to 2008 it was surpassed only by Panama (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468018111431756">ECLAC 2010</xref>: 53). From 1960 to 2005, the Dominican Republic was the single top performer in the region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1468018111431756">Jaramillo and Sancak, 2007</xref>: 4).</p>
<p>The Dominican case is equally paradoxical in relation to institutional theories. Dominican political institutions offer few ‘veto points.’ The state structure is unitary: provincial governors are appointed by the president and municipalities have limited power. Although the presidency’s formal powers are not great, its informal powers are ‘vast’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468018111431756">Hartlyn, 1998</xref>: 157) creating an executive-dominant system. Finally, the Dominican party system is among the most consolidated in the region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1468018111431756">Morgan et al., 2011</xref>), with the top two parties regularly capturing around 80 percent of the vote in legislative and presidential elections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468018111431756">Georgetown University, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>One might potentially argue that a broader institutional perspective emphasizing the importance of democracy sheds light on the Dominican case. Although the country made a transition from relatively overt authoritarianism in 1978, its elections have sometimes been troubled by suspicions of fraud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468018111431756">Espinal, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468018111431756">Hartlyn, 1998</xref>). In particular, in both 1990 and 1994 former dictator Joaquin Balaguer captured the presidency in elections marred by such accusations. Are these breaches of democratic practice behind the lack of social policy progress? In my view, this is unconvincing. It is by no means clear that fraud determined the winner of the 1990 election (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468018111431756">Espinal, 2000</xref>) and the result of the 1994 contest was partially reversed through a pact that curtailed Balaguer’s term by half. Moreover, on the whole, the Dominican Republic has been one of the more democratic countries in Latin America in recent decades. Its democratic transition was arguably the earliest of the Third Wave transitions in the region and most of its elections, especially since 1996, have widely been viewed as free and fair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468018111431756">Hartlyn and Espinal, 2009</xref>). In the last decade, Dominican democracy has enjoyed some of the highest Freedom House ratings in Latin America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468018111431756">Freedom House, 2002–2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Income inequality, the key explanatory variable in the Meltzer-Richard model, also does not offer a convincing account of Dominican social policy underdevelopment. Between 1978 and 2007, the Gini coefficient, a standard measure of income inequality, averaged .504, which is below the regional average of .516, but not exceptionally low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1468018111431756">Solt, 2008–09</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1468018111431756">2</xref></sup> Moreover, most of the countries with unusually generous welfare regimes, such as Costa Rica and Uruguay, are even more equitable. In contrast, the Dominican case fits comfortably with the ideas of power resources theorists. Their emphasis on left party control of government resonates especially strongly because of the striking weakness of the left (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1468018111431756">Morgan et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>At the time of the 1978 transition, the Dominican Republic had three main parties: Balaguer’s conservative Revolutionary Social Christian Party (PRSC), the center-left Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) and the somewhat more leftist Party of Dominican Liberation (PLD). The PRD captured the presidency in 1978 and 1982 then lost to Balaguer in 1986. Balaguer was reelected in 1990 and 1994, but was forced to accept an abbreviated term after the latter contest. The PLD governed from 1997 to 2000 and again from 2004 to the present. The PRD returned to the presidency from 2000 to 2003. Most presidents have enjoyed working majorities in the legislature for at least part of their tenure. This account suggests that left-of-center parties have wielded substantial power, but that is not the case. During the course of the 1980s and early 1990s both the PRD and PLD migrated to the ideological center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1468018111431756">Morgan et al., 2011</xref>). Beginning in the 1996 election campaign, the PLD moved even farther rightward, allying itself with Balaguer to secure victory for its presidential candidate, Leonel Fernandez. Since then the PLD has absorbed much of the PRSC’s electoral base, helping Fernandez triumph in 2004 and 2008.</p>
<p>Power resources theory posits a causal connection between left party strength and trade union organization. Although union debility is by no means unusual in Latin America, Dominican labor ranks with the weaker movements in the region. In the early 1980s, the unionization rate of 12.2 percent was the fifth lowest in Latin America, well below the average of 19.5 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468018111431756">Blanchflower, 2006</xref>: 30). Recent estimates suggest an even lower level of unionization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1468018111431756">ITUC, 2008</xref>). Although in certain regions small farmers – the group identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1468018111431756">Sandbrook et al. (2007)</xref> as the key to social democracy in developing countries – have played an important role in the economy, in national politics they have been overshadowed by sugarcane producers and industrialists.</p>
<p>The theoretical perspective that emphasizes economic production regimes also seems to shed some light on the Dominican case. Since the 1980s, the country’s economic growth has been driven largely by light manufacturing in EPZs and tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1468018111431756">Lizardo and Guzman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1468018111431756">Schrank, 2005</xref>). The Dominican EPZ sector is the largest of any Latin American country relative to the overall economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1468018111431756">Milberg and Amengual, 2008</xref>: 6). EPZ production has suffered recently, but overall these sectors have been more dynamic than the traditional core sectors – sugar and import-substitution manufacturing. Although it has fueled robust growth, from the point of view of promoting equity this pattern of development is not ideal, considering its implications for labor organization and taxation.</p>
<p>EPZs rely on low production costs to attract investors and this translates into light taxation and resistance to unionization. Manufacturing operations located in EPZs are exempt from a number of taxes, including the income and value-added taxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1468018111431756">IMF, 2001</xref>: 17). A nominally progressive 1992 labor reform notwithstanding, Dominican authorities seem to have condoned business practices aimed at discouraging union formation and collective bargaining in EPZ firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1468018111431756">ITUC, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1468018111431756">Milberg and Amengual, 2008</xref>). Hotels and restaurants, the core of the tourism industry, have also historically been hard for unions to organize because of high job turnover rates and small workforces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468018111431756">Anner, 2008</xref>: 36). Reliance on EPZ production and tourism to fuel economic growth is not the root cause of social policy underdevelopment in the Dominican Republic, since the latter precedes their emergence as major sectors. However, it has helped to perpetuate a system based on weak unions, low taxation and a small welfare state.</p>
<p>The power resources and production regimes perspectives thus provide a solid foundation for understanding the Dominican Republic’s weak social policy performance. Nevertheless, they leave key questions unanswered. In particular, why is the partisan left so weak? A weak labor movement is certainly part of the answer, but this begs the question of why labor itself is underdeveloped. Furthermore, given the general debility of labor across Latin America today, labor weakness seems insufficient to explain the almost complete lack of an electoral left in the Dominican Republic during a period of leftist resurgence in the region. In addition, if the development path adopted since the 1980s has discouraged deeper redistribution, as I argued above, then it would be useful to examine why this path was taken.</p>
<p>In my view, international migration, a variable for the most part absent from analyses of welfare state development, is an important factor behind these outcomes. Below, I discuss the impact of Dominican emigration before turning to the role of Haitian immigration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1468018111431756">
<title>Dominican emigration</title>
<p>Dominican emigration to the USA intensified greatly in the 1960s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468018111431756">Aristy, 2008</xref>). Rafael Trujillo’s assassination in 1961 played a role, since the long-time dictator had restricted travel out of the country. Equally important, however, was a combination of domestic turmoil and change in US immigration policy. Trujillo’s death brought a period of upheaval culminating in a US military invasion aimed at preventing ‘another Cuba.’ A measure of stability was restored only in 1966 with the election of former Trujillo loyalist Balaguer. Part of the US response to the crisis was to facilitate immigration by Dominicans to the USA, under the notion that helping those who feared political persecution to leave would promote the restoration of order.</p>
<p>The relatively accommodating US policy persisted in subsequent decades, facilitating the movement of hundreds of thousands of Dominicans to the USA. Unlike many of those who left the country during the 1960s, Dominican emigrants of later decades were motivated largely by economic goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468018111431756">Grasmuck and Pessar, 1991</xref>). By 2005, an estimated 815,319 people born in the Dominican Republic were residing in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468018111431756">Aristy, 2008</xref>: 396–397). The latter country was the destination of close to 90 percent of Dominican émigrés (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1468018111431756">Solimano and Allendes, 2008</xref>: 40). In 2000, the number of native-born Dominicans living abroad was equal to 11.1 percent of the country’s population, a rate surpassed by only one other Latin American country, El Salvador (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468018111431756">Hanson and McIntosh, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>As is the case with most other Latin American countries, first-time Dominican emigrants tend to be young adults and somewhat more educated than the population as a whole, but not highly-trained professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468018111431756">Grasmuck and Pessar, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1468018111431756">Solimano and Allendes, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1468018111431756">Morgan et al. (2011)</xref> characterize them as ‘lower middle class.’ Remittances from Dominicans living abroad play a vital role in the economy: in 2002, they contributed the equivalent of 11 percent of GDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1468018111431756">Solimano and Allendes, 2008</xref>: 64). This was almost four times the corresponding figure in Mexico (3 percent), but lower than in poorer countries such as Nicaragua (29 percent) and El Salvador (18 percent). Close to a quarter of the population lives in a household that receives remittances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1468018111431756">World Bank, 2006</xref>: 170). This is almost five times the figure for social security pensions and almost eight times higher than that for social security health care! Moreover, the average remittance is nearly three times the average pension payment.</p>
<p>The idea that emigration can act as an escape valve, reducing pressure for domestic change by allowing young, ambitious people to seek their fortunes elsewhere, is well established in the literature on migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468018111431756">Castells, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1468018111431756">Portes and Walton, 1981</xref>). Scholars have also seen this phenomenon at work in the specific case of the Dominican Republic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468018111431756">Grasmuck and Pessar, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1468018111431756">Morgan et al., 2011</xref>). Emigration acts as an outlet for people who might otherwise be frustrated with the educational and job opportunities available to them within the Dominican Republic, reduces the competition for the opportunities that exist, and acts as a source of cash transfers that boost the welfare of many families without placing a burden on public finances. According to Grasmuck and Pessar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468018111431756">1991</xref>: 95):</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>From the perspective of the state bureaucracy and the dominant class, migration has permitted thousands to acquire the sociocultural trappings of upward mobility without the wrenching transformations that such mobility would have required if it had been generated locally. Furthermore, the state has been absolved of some of the responsibility of helping this new middle class maintain its comfortable standard of living, since in many cases this life-style is subsidized by transfer payments from abroad and by the circulation of household members between the Dominican Republic and the United States.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>A study of Dominican migration to Boston suggests that emigration also depresses demand for education in the Dominican Republic, either because young people are lulled into a sense of security by the steady flow of remittances into their household, or because they themselves plan to move to the USA, where they can earn a substantial (by Dominican standards) income working in a low-skill job (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1468018111431756">Levitt, 2001</xref>). Emigration, in other words, ‘lends credence to the notion that a Dominican education – and in some cases education in general – is superfluous’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1468018111431756">Levitt, 2001</xref>: 85).</p>
<p>It is true that the poorest Dominican families do not usually benefit directly from emigration, since they emigrate at a relatively low rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468018111431756">Grasmuck and Pessar, 1991</xref>). However, a party or coalition capable of implementing major redistributive policy change would presumably need to attract substantial support from people somewhat higher up in the social hierarchy, especially in a society in which the industrial working class, often seen as the key group behind social policy expansion, is relatively small.</p>
<p>Of course, some Latin American countries with emigration rates similar to the Dominican Republic’s, including Mexico and El Salvador, nevertheless have relatively strong electoral lefts. This fact suggests that even large-scale emigration is not an absolute obstacle to the growth of redistribution-oriented parties. However, in my view, it does not disqualify the idea that massive emigration has discouraged the emergence of a strong Dominican left. For one thing, electoral trends in these countries are not, on closer inspection, fundamentally adverse to the notion that emigration is an obstacle to the growth of the left. For example, although Mexico’s left-of-center Party of the Democratic Revolution is a major force, its support is strongly concentrated in southern Mexico and the Federal District, regions not greatly affected by emigration. El Salvador’s Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front, for its part, now controls the Salvadoran presidency. However, its victory, coming in 2009, was late in relation to others in the wave of leftist electoral successes in the region since about 1999.</p>
<p>In addition, there is an aspect of Dominican emigration that sets it apart from migration flows from most other Latin American countries and may serve to accentuate its conservatizing influence on the electorate. That is the fact that the vast majority of Dominican immigrants possess legal documentation to enter and work in the USA, easily the most common destination of Latin American emigrants.</p>
<p>Between 1960 and 2009, 829,914 US immigrant visas were granted to Dominican nationals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1468018111431756">Mitchell, 1992</xref>: 2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1468018111431756">US Department of State, 2010</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1468018111431756">3</xref></sup> In absolute terms, more visas were issued to citizens of two other Latin American countries – Mexico and Cuba – but the ratio of visas to the national population was far higher in the Dominican case than in that of any other country in the region (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1468018111431756">Table 2</xref>). At least partly due to the ease of obtaining a visa, in 2000 only about 13 percent of the Dominicans living in the USA were undocumented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468018111431756">Aristy, 2008</xref>: 39).

<p>This difference is significant. Although Mexico, for example, is physically closer to the USA than the Dominican Republic and not separated by an ocean, this advantage is offset by a variety of costs that undocumented immigrants must bear, especially since the tightening of US border security beginning in 1993. Crossing the Mexican border into the USA is not only risky from both a physical and legal standpoint, but also expensive. Human smugglers charge fees ranging from US$800 to $5000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468018111431756">Fuentes and García, 2009</xref>: 85). In comparison, a roundtrip Santo Domingo-New York airline ticket costs roughly US$400. Undocumented immigrants from Central America are even worse off, since they must cross more than one national border, often illegally. Once they are in the USA, undocumented immigrants face additional challenges related to poor working conditions, the risk of deportation and limited access to public services.</p>
<p>It is perhaps because of this difference that Dominicans have an unusually positive view of the immigrant experience. Dominicans are more likely to say that they would like to live abroad than the citizens of any other Latin American country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468018111431756">Gallup, 2008</xref>). More than half of Dominicans age 18–25 say they plan to live abroad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1468018111431756">Morgan and Espinal, 2006</xref>),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1468018111431756">5</xref></sup> although fewer probably end up doing so.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1468018111431756">6</xref></sup> These findings are striking in light of the country’s superior economic performance and lack of political instability and violence relative to other countries in the region, all of which would presumably tend to discourage emigration.</p>
<p>Because Dominicans can live, work and make use of public services more freely in the USA than most other Latin American immigrant groups, they may ultimately be more disposed to embrace US political values, which generally prize the market and reject the notion of a nurturing state. Whatever values they acquire in the USA, moreover, they presumably take with them when they return to the Dominican Republic. Even if they never move back for good, their values are diffused through interactions with family and friends, which typically are frequent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1468018111431756">Levitt, 2001</xref>). In addition, the relative ease with which Dominicans can make use of US immigration to bolster their income may engender a sense of social mobility, even among those who do not end up availing themselves of this opportunity. A belief in the possibility of individual social mobility, moreover, has been argued to work against the emergence of a strong left (Lipset and Bendix, 1992).</p>
<p>This account is consistent with the findings of cross-national opinion research. Recent polls asking respondents to place themselves on a left–right scale suggest that the Dominican Republic is the most ideologically conservative country in Latin America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1468018111431756">Morgan and Espinal, 2009</xref>: 155; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1468018111431756">World Public Opinion, 2007</xref>). Another study, which asked respondents whether they considered themselves more ‘socialist’ or ‘capitalist,’ also found the Dominican public to be about twice as conservative as the regional average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468018111431756">Gallup, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Haitian immigration</title>
<p>Haitians have been migrating to the Dominican Republic in large numbers since the 1920s, when sugar production expanded under the influence of the US military occupation of 1916–1924, increasing demand for wage labor. Dominicans have generally held the more skilled jobs in the industry, but the cane cutting is done primarily by Haitians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468018111431756">Baud, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1468018111431756">Martínez, 1995</xref>). Between the 1950s and the mid-1980s the Dominican and Haitian governments periodically signed guest worker agreements to supply Dominican producers with cheap labor, but even during this period many Haitians crossed the border illegally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468018111431756">Baud, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>The Dominican sugar industry has declined in recent decades, but this has not stemmed the migratory flow. If anything, it has intensified because of the political turmoil and economic stagnation in Haiti and the robust growth on the other side of Hispaniola. Since no guest worker agreement has existed since 1986, virtually all the migrants are undocumented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468018111431756">Ferguson, 2006</xref>). Haitians still dominate sugar, but the decline of sugar production has led them into other areas, especially construction, a key driver of job creation in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468018111431756">Fanelli and Guzmán, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Over the years many Haitians have settled permanently in the Dominican Republic. There are no official data on the Haitian population in the country, and unofficial estimates range widely, from 500,000 to 1.5 million, or roughly 5–15 percent of the total population. People born in the Dominican Republic of Haitian parents form another substantial contingent, which a 2001 estimate put at 280,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468018111431756">Ferguson, 2006</xref>: 309). This group has been systematically denied citizenship, in the past through a tendentious interpretation of the old Dominican constitution and since January 2010 through a new constitution that states that children born to illegal immigrants are not automatically citizens.</p>
<p>The lack of legal documentation among Haitian immigrants and their children reflects the impact of widespread anti-Haitian sentiment. Dominican national identity has been constructed in contradistinction to the country’s neighbor: in an important sense, to be Dominican means to not be Haitian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468018111431756">Dore Cabral, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468018111431756">Howard, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1468018111431756">Sagás, 2000</xref>). Anti-Haitian sentiment is rooted in racial and cultural prejudice against a people with stronger ties to Africa, as well as historical memory of Haiti’s 1822–1844 occupation of the Dominican Republic. Dominican leaders dating back at least to Trujillo have both exploited this sentiment and deepened it by using anti-Haitian rhetoric and policies to curry political support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1468018111431756">Sagás, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Haitian migration to the Dominican Republic appears to be a fairly exceptional phenomenon within the region. Few countries in Latin America currently receive large numbers of immigrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1468018111431756">Solimano and Allendes, 2008</xref>). Although reliable data are lacking, it is likely that the only country in the region with an immigrant population comparable to the Dominican Republic’s as a proportion of its total population is Costa Rica, which in recent decades has received a large inflow of migrants from Nicaragua (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468018111431756">Gindling, 2009</xref>). Concerns have also been expressed about the treatment of Nicaraguan immigrants in Costa Rica, but they appear to suffer somewhat less discrimination than their Haitian counterparts in the Dominican Republic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1468018111431756">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is an extensive literature on Haitian immigration, Haitian labor and anti-Haitian sentiment in the Dominican Republic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468018111431756">Baud, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468018111431756">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468018111431756">Dore Cabral, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468018111431756">Howard, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1468018111431756">Lozano, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1468018111431756">Martínez, 1995</xref>) but to my knowledge the only works that seek to causally link these phenomena to the general weakness of progressive forces are <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1468018111431756">Morgan et al. (2011)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1468018111431756">Sagás (2000)</xref>.</p>
<p>The core of the argument offered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1468018111431756">Morgan et al. (2011)</xref> is that Haitian immigration has inhibited the consolidation of a strong left because the presence of so many Haitian immigrants and their (non-citizen) descendents has brought about a Dominican lower class consisting to a substantial degree of people lacking political rights. The country’s popular sector is thus divided between a native component that enjoys voting rights and another that is denied such rights. The problem with this perspective, in my view, is that the only way that a contingent of undocumented residents could influence election outcomes is by changing the preferences of those who actually do enjoy the suffrage. A satisfying explanation of how Haitian immigration has affected Dominican elections must thus specify how it has affected the attitudes and behavior of Dominican citizens, an issue that the authors do not substantially address.</p>
<p>Sagás’ study of anti-Haitianism in the Dominican Republic provides some relevant arguments in this sense, two of which are particularly convincing. First, he argues that Haitian immigrants have provided a handy scapegoat for the problems experienced by the Dominican poor, allowing elites to deflect attention from social inequality and the lack of state initiatives to address it. Second, he maintains that the Haitian immigrant presence in the Dominican Republic boosts the sense of social status of the Dominican poor, since it gives them a group of people that they can feel superior to. It ‘helps soften their everyday struggle’ by reassuring them that they are not ‘at the bottom of the social pyramid’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1468018111431756">Sagás, 2000</xref>: 94).</p>
<p>That Haitians have been blamed by influential people in Dominican society for a variety of problems – from low wages, to food shortages, to the spread of AIDS – is well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468018111431756">Baud, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468018111431756">Howard, 2001</xref>). It is similarly plausible that the Haitian presence boosts the sense of social status of poor Dominicans, or at least those who have some day-to-day contact with Haitians, helping to short-circuit the formation of a working-class consciousness. Nevertheless, it is difficult to assess just how important these two mechanisms are in shaping Dominican political culture because we lack the appropriate data. Sagás’ conclusions are based mainly on textual analysis and elite interviews but it would probably require detailed public opinion data to adequately evaluate them. I suspect that both are at least somewhat significant, but I would put at least equal emphasis on a more concrete connection that Sagás does not discuss: the role of Haitian immigration in thwarting the emergence of a strong labor movement, especially in the crucial sugar sector.</p>
<p>For most of the 20th century, sugar was the core of the Dominican economy and the major source of wage labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468018111431756">Betances, 1995</xref>). Nevertheless, a substantial union movement failed to develop there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468018111431756">Cassá, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468018111431756">Faxas, 2007</xref>). This outcome contrasts with that of some other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, where the sugar sector became a major locus of labor activism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1468018111431756">Paige, 1975</xref>: 50). A key reason was the fact that by the 1930s Haitian laborers comprised much of the work force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468018111431756">Baud, 1992</xref>). Their presence divided workers along ethnic lines, since Haitian workers spoke a foreign language and were discriminated against by their Dominican counterparts. Just as important, as foreigners and members of a disliked ethnic group, they had virtually no ability to petition state authorities for better treatment by employers. The fact that many of them were in the country illegally deepened their isolation. This state of affairs was viewed by union activists as a major impediment to the organization of the labor force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468018111431756">Baud, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468018111431756">Cassá, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>With the decline of the market for sugar in the 1980s, Haitians spread to other sectors. Nevertheless, the situation of Haitian workers in the Dominican Republic has not changed greatly. The current labor code nominally extends to all those working within the national territory, regardless of citizenship, but Haitians have been unable to take advantage of its provisions for unionization. They are easily cowed by the threat of deportation, and anti-Haitian sentiment in Dominican society makes it difficult to find support for their cause in the state, media or civic entities. A recent survey of construction workers of Haitian origin or descent found a population subject to frequent abuses, including illegally low pay and long hours, debt peonage, and arbitrary imprisonment and theft of their wages by police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468018111431756">CNUS, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The lack of significant union activity in what was for many years the key wage-earning sector of the economy helps to explain why Dominican democracy inherited a weak labor movement, incapable of serving as the societal anchor of a significant left-of-center political party. Although the PRD initially courted unionized workers when it came to office in the late 1970s and early 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468018111431756">Espinal, 1987</xref>), this group was not strong enough to provide it with a dependable source of votes or financing. The party thus soon drifted away from its pro-labor policies, even though the economic crisis confronting the country – and thus the pressure to adopt market reforms – was mild by regional standards.</p>
<p>The weakness of labor, furthermore, is among the factors that have helped the Dominican Republic to successfully pursue EPZ-led growth. Since investors seek out EPZs because of low production costs, a vibrant labor movement is not amenable to this kind of development. At least within Latin America, none of the countries with a tradition of strong, autonomous unionism have developed major EPZ sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1468018111431756">Milberg and Amengual, 2008</xref>: 6). EPZ production has flourished, rather, in countries such as Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico, where union density has been low or unions have been under the thumb of authorities.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Analyses of social policy have emphasized the impact of domestic variables such as economic structures, political institutions and organized political actors. When they consider international factors at all, it is mainly to debate the potential constraining effects of cross-border flows of goods and capital (Huber and Stephens, 2009). This paper has shown that another type of cross-border flow, that of human beings, can also exert a powerful influence on social policy development. More specifically, I have argued that the remarkable lack of redistributive social reform in the contemporary Dominican Republic, despite the presence of a number of conditions that would seem to favor such reform, is in large measure a byproduct of migration into and out of the country. Migration has undermined the labor movement and the partisan left and facilitated the adoption of a development model that further impedes deeper redistribution. It has, in other words, acted as crucial independent variable shaping the mediating variables emphasized by power resources and production regimes theory.</p>
<p>As I have suggested here, the Dominican Republic is something of an outlier with regard to migration. It is probably the only country in Latin America that is both a major source of immigrants to other countries and an important recipient of émigrés from abroad. Both of these population movements, furthermore, possess distinctive characteristics, at least in the regional context. Nevertheless, it would be rash to dismiss the Dominican case as irrelevant to other countries. Rough parallels to either the emigration or the immigration experience of the Dominican Republic can be found fairly readily outside Latin America.</p>
<p>With regard to emigration, the Dominican Republic is a case in which the citizens of one country benefit from relatively easy access to a neighboring country with a substantially higher standard of living. Analogous situations include migration to the oil-producing countries of the Persian Gulf from other Middle Eastern countries; from the poorer members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) to Russia; and from some of the new European Union (EU) member states in Central and Eastern Europe to the older members in Western Europe. While the first of these flows is well established, the other two are in formation. After a period of restrictions, Russia has recently taken measures to open its labor market to the citizens of fellow CIS members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1468018111431756">Ivakhnyuk, 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1468018111431756">8</xref></sup> Meanwhile, EU rules grant older members the right to open their labor markets to citizens of new members gradually, so full liberalization is still a few years off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1468018111431756">Kahanec and Zimmerman, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>With regard to immigration, the Dominican case is one in which the domestic labor market is affected by a large supply of unauthorized foreign workers who are ethnically distinct from the native population and suffer discrimination. For a rough parallel, we need look no farther than the USA, where undocumented immigrants, more than three-quarters of whom are from Latin America, make up more than 5 percent of the workforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1468018111431756">Passel and Cohn, 2009</xref>: 12). Although prejudice against Hispanics in the USA is arguably not on the level of anti-Haitian sentiment in the Dominican Republic, it is certainly not insignificant. Other cases include Spain and Italy, which receive substantial streams of illegal migrants from North Africa and some other developing regions.</p>
<p>Thus, although Dominican international migration is rather exceptional within the Latin America context, the causal arguments I have outlined in this paper are potentially very relevant to a wide variety of cases outside the region where conditions are in some ways quite similar to those of the Dominican Republic. These arguments, therefore, merit some attention as we continue to craft and test theoretical models of social policy development. More broadly, international migration needs to be brought into the mainstream of social policy research. Despite the persistence of substantial barriers to transnational population movements, migration is a major phenomenon involving more than 215 million people, or 3.2 percent of the global population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1468018111431756">World Bank, 2010c</xref>). Given this overall magnitude and the crucial impact it clearly has on certain countries, both rich and poor, migration should not be ignored by scholars as a variable affecting domestic social policies.</p>
