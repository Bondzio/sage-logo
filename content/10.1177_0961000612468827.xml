<p>In <italic>Information 2.0: New Models of Information Production, Distribution and Consumption</italic>, Martin de Saulles, Principal Lecturer at the University of Brighton, provides an overview of the contemporary digital information landscape. The implications of the significant technological changes of the last 20 years on those who create information, the professionals who manage it, and the people who consume it are immense and are still being discovered. As De Saulles writes, ‘Never have so many people had access to so much information at their fingertips and the impact of this on societies around the world has hardly begun to be felt’ (p. 4).</p>
<p>The information revolution, created from cheap computing devices, mass adoption of Internet access in homes, and a transition to digitized formats is comparable to the invention of the movable type printing press in the 15th century when the availability of information to the public democratized knowledge. However, the Internet’s egalitarian access to information production and consumption was unplanned, and De Saulles raises the point that it was ‘not originally designed as a mass communications system … Early proponents … envisaged far more centralized information networks controlled by a combination of the state and private enterprises rather than the almost anarchic network that is the internet’ (p. 3). Emerging models of information production, distribution, and consumption may continue to lead societies to an age of openness, but powerful political and economic interests view the digital revolution as another way to control markets and citizens. In light of the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), the Protect IP Act (PIPA), and other laws that could affect free speech, a more restricted and controlled information network may materialize in the future.</p>
<p>The book’s four chapters follow the information lifecycle, covering new models of production, storage, distribution, and consumption, demonstrating how these stages are closely intertwined within a global information ecosystem. De Saulles writes that while the ‘comprehensive archives of mainstream printed materials [has] given us a series of modern-day equivalents of the Great Library of Alexandria … the rise of digital forms of information have presented challenges to these endeavours’ (p. 39). He summarizes the broader implications by demonstrating how Amazon, Apple, and Google have blurred traditional lines of corporate responsibility and provides case studies of innovative organizations, such as the Huffington Post, GigaOm, Walmart, and the Khan Academy.</p>
<p>As we move from an era of information scarcity to one of abundance, new models of information publishing—blogs, wikis, podcasts, search engines, and social networking sites—are challenging established business sectors such as publishing and broadcasting, yet present new opportunities for innovation and business creation. New forms of information abound, raising issues regarding information storage, which encompasses digital preservation, data mining, cloud computing, privacy issues, and legal requirements for keeping data. De Saulles notes that while the amount of information being created and stored has never been so large, it has also never been so vulnerable to loss and destruction. This is complicated further by the fact that, as a global society, we are moving from a centralized broadcast model of information distribution to a more dispersed, open model that leads to the disintermediation of established information gatekeepers. Perceptive information professionals are transitioning into facilitators, teaching information literacy skills to others in an environment of data overload, as the increase of computing devices and the information ecosystems that surround them are changing how information is consumed.</p>
<p>De Saulles comments: ‘In a world where most people’s starting point for finding information is no longer the library but an internet search engine, the relevance of information professionals to modern life is under question’ (p. 5). While information for education, entertainment, and commerce ‘has never been more abundant and accessible so those who know how to manage it for the benefit of others in the digital age will be in great demand,’ the author also notes that ‘it seems strange that at a time when the wealth of developed economies is increasingly dependent on information industries, the jobs of many information professionals are under increasing pressure and, in some sectors, under threat’ (pp. x, 111). Why is this so? Perhaps it is still too early to examine if and why this disparity exists, yet it is distressing to read about nonetheless.</p>
<p>Whilst De Saulles explores the implications of technological changes for publishers and society, as an information professional I wanted a deeper conversation on how these changes will affect my livelihood and future career prospects beyond the discussion questions at the end of the chapters—for example: ‘Are the traditional skills of the library and information professional relevant in this emerging world of digital information?’(p. 35) and ‘How real is the threat of disintermediation of library and information professionals by the internet?’ (p. 83). The role of technology in organizational and societal change will lead indubitably to new opportunities for information professionals, the traditional guardians of data, to capitalize on their skills as they have no choice, lest they face extinction.</p>
<p>Overall, this book provides a succinct overview of the last 20 years of technological development and would be a suitable read for information science students or young professionals. It explores how the landscape has changed, what the driving factors are, and how this transformation has influenced information providers, creators, and users.</p>
