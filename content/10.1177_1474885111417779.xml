<abstract>
<p>There is a wide consensus that politics should not be considered as an end in itself, being instead instrumentally valuable, provided it is capable of producing good outcomes, however defined. Even when some intrinsic value is accorded to politics, it is thought to be dependent on some broader instrumental character. I shall argue for the reverse: that politics ought to be considered autotelic, and that the very possibility of any good outcomes depends on that. I will begin with a brief summary of how deep and widespread this rejection of the autotelic character of politics is. Then, mainly drawing on Arendt, I shall argue for a restatement of the question, which will clarify why and how a meaningful and coherent concept of politics should be autotelic. Eventually, I will sketch some of the implications for normative political theory.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1474885111417779" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The aim of this article is to introduce, explain, and defend the idea that politics should be conceptualised as an autotelic activity, that is: a context of action which has its end in itself.</p>
<p>The opposite idea, that politics is a means to ends coming from elsewhere, is a usual assumption in political studies – be they philosophical or scientific, normative or descriptive – and, most important, in nearly all common political talk. However, this article will be focused on normative political theory, on the assumption that it is only on that ground that an autotelic concept of politics could be construed. Accordingly, I will offer a brief overview of the rejection of the autotelic character of politics within the more common modern and contemporary political theories. The example of republicanism will be used also to introduce an important distinction between the quality of having intrinsic value and that of being autotelic.</p>
<p>Then the proposed autotelic concept of politics will be introduced, mainly via reference to Hannah Arendt's thought. My first concern will be to show that her consideration of politics was twofold: she not only substantively praised the existential meaning of political action (which might be just another way of saying that it is intrinsically valuable), but she also had a distinct formal account of it, which usually does not receive enough consideration. This formal account corresponds to the autotelic concept of politics, which has to be further articulated in two aspects. In fact, ‘autotelic’ could be read either as ‘including its own end’ or ‘setting its own end’, and I will argue that the two senses should intertwine in the proper meaning of the term. To construct a meaningful concept of politics, the two formal aspects of the concept of ‘autotelic’, along with politics’ intrinsic value, should be considered in their role as conditions for actualising power (I shall discuss but very briefly Arendt's specific concept of power here, which is clearly presupposed). A tentative schematisation of these relations, which must be considered together for actions to have meaning, will be offered.</p>
<p>It is quite commonsensical that a political theory is either non-normative or morally oriented. I will try to show how a proper consideration of the autotelic character of politics would change this. First, I shall briefly analyse what it means for such a concept to be normative. Then, I will discuss how the theories of Rawls and Habermas implicitly require the priority of an autotelic conception of politics, even though they explicitly reject it. The examples of Rawls and Habermas are relevant not only for the wide influence they exercised, but also because they well represent the general tendency to think normatively of politics in moral terms. Thus, showing that these theories hint towards an autotelic concept of politics is good evidence for its plausibility, despite its widespread rejection.</p>
<p>I shall then conclude with just a brief consideration about what it would practically mean to think of politics in autotelic terms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1474885111417779"><title>Sketching the state of the art</title>
<p>The common belief that politics is not autotelic may be pushed to extreme consequences, as in Nozick's words:
<disp-quote>
<p>The possible ways of understanding the political realm are as follows: (1) to fully explain it in terms of the nonpolitical; (2) to view it as emerging from the nonpolitical but irreducible to it, a mode of organization of nonpolitical factors understandable only in terms of novel political principles; or (3) to view it as a completely autonomous realm. Since only the first promises full understanding of the whole political realm, it stands as the most desirable theoretical alternative, to be abandoned only if known to be impossible.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1474885111417779">1</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>If one reads through his masterpiece, it becomes quite clear that Nozick could see politics only as a pragmatic necessity, a realm in which means can be found to some valuable ends – in his case guaranteeing a few individual rights. Details may vary to a great extent for other theorists, but the assumption that politics consists of means to achieve an end – be it maximising primary goods or capabilities, or avoiding primary evils – which immediately lead to Nozick's option 1, is broadly shared through the modern and contemporary liberal tradition,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1474885111417779">2</xref></sup> at least ever since the abstraction of a state of nature was employed by Hobbes in justifying political authority, alongside coercion, against the shadowy background of fear, violence and misery.</p>
<p>The historically fiercest rival of liberalism, socialism, shared the same instrumental conception of politics, viewing it as a struggle to acquire economic resources – or, better said, control the means of production. This is even truer for the theoretically dominant strand of socialism, Marxism, which would have fully endorsed the claim of Nozick to understand actual politics in terms of the non-political, in this case via its reduction to economic relations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1474885111417779">3</xref></sup> Despite its having provoked some of the greatest deeds in modern history – above all, the progressive inclusion of workers in the political sphere – there is very little theoretical space within socialism for politics as an autotelic activity.</p>
<p><italic>Mutatis mutandis</italic>, the same is true for the last serious heir of Marxism: critical theory. First-generation Frankfurt School thinking is well-known for its pessimistic conclusions,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1474885111417779">4</xref></sup> which basically entailed a rejection of any significance for political action – or any action whatsoever. But even Habermas, Apel and later critical theorists, though being able to articulate a more positive conception via their discursivist philosophy, mainly see politics, and democracy, as being good for the goods they promote, namely justice within society, not as ends in themselves. In the beginning (institutional) politics was altogether considered a part of the ‘system’, characterised by strategic (i.e. instrumental) rationality, as opposed to the ‘life-world’ (<italic>Lebenswelt</italic>), which was the proper background for communicative action.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1474885111417779">5</xref></sup> Eventually, Habermas developed a more nuanced conception of politics,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1474885111417779">6</xref></sup> strongly defending democratic politics per se. Nonetheless, there is much evidence that, while coming to understand politics in political terms (Nozick's option 2), discursivism still sees it mainly as a means to first refine and then fulfil the claims for justice springing from communication within society – or the ambiguous ‘life-world’ – and not as an end in itself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1474885111417779">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Deliberative democracy – which in a historical perspective could well represent a point of contact between critical theory and liberal-democratic political theory<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1474885111417779">8</xref></sup> – shows (or ought to) a great deal of commitment to being deeply democratic,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1474885111417779">9</xref></sup> but still falls short of declaring politics an end in itself. Rather, while the transformative effects of political deliberation are strongly praised, both in moral and cognitive terms, usually politics is not considered autonomously valuable. The rationale for this stance seems quite compelling: even assuming that public deliberation implies some intrinsic goods, would anyone engage in it, if not to pursue some other ends? No,“deliberation must be about something”.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1474885111417779">10</xref></sup> So, those inherent goods of political deliberation are still owing to a broader instrumental account of politics. While the means-end category may be pushed towards moral goals, this does not change things much and deliberative politics – let alone that portion of politics which is not deliberative at all – remains a means to certain ends: “Deliberation is not only a means to an end, but also a means for deciding what means are morally required to pursue our common ends”.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1474885111417779">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>For similar reasons, authors even more radically committed to democracy and participation reject the idea that politics could be an end in itself. Usually, they seem to do so as part of a defence strategy against the charge of being vainly utopian. Whatever the motive, the result is that works filled with enthusiasm for democracy and political participation stop just short of recognising them as ends in themselves. This is the case, for example, with Benjamin Barber's <italic>Strong Democracy</italic>, a work that, with its praise for participation and,“politics as a way of living”,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1474885111417779">12</xref></sup> seems to rank as high as possible on the scale of appreciation for political action. In fact, while the book advances an outright rejection of mainstream liberalism as unpolitical, it still articulates politics mainly through the grammar of needs, and means for other ends. Politics, for all its goods, is a matter of necessity because the isolated man is not the fiery individual depicted by classical liberalism, but a lone and weak human being:
<disp-quote>
<p>It is the self-governing people who most need moderation, for they have nothing but moderation to remind them of the weakness and infirmities on which their self-government relies, and by which it is justified.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1474885111417779">13</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>But surely there is at least one prominent strand of thought – one, indeed, that is often used as the straw man in the debate – which does consider politics as an end in itself: republicanism! Well, not quite. True, republicanism is frequently depicted as praising the intrinsic value of politics, in the form of civic virtue or,“the reciprocal power of nondomination”,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1474885111417779">14</xref></sup> which would be both fostered by, and expressed in, political participation. But there are two decisive problems in presenting this as an autotelic conception of politics.</p>
<p>First, Pericles, Cicero or Machiavelli could have agreed (maybe)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1474885111417779">15</xref></sup> in considering politics as an end in itself, but that is not the case for most contemporary republican theorists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1474885111417779">16</xref></sup> They are so well aware that praising civic virtue in politics is not equivalent to thinking that politics is, or should be, an end in itself, that while endorsing the former they may explicitly reject the latter.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1474885111417779">17</xref></sup> Sometimes, a republican theorist shows so little concern for politics in itself as to argue squarely in favour of “depoliticization”.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1474885111417779">18</xref></sup> If virtue within government, a condition of non-domination, or whatever it may be, could be promoted by limiting political activity or entirely writing it off from some areas, well… so much the worse for politics.</p>
<p>Second, notwithstanding what some theorists think, ‘intrinsic’ is not the opposite of ‘instrumental’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1474885111417779">19</xref></sup> Being ‘intrinsically valuable’ is not logically equivalent to being ‘not instrumental’ and thus ‘an end in itself’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1474885111417779">20</xref></sup> It is sometimes said that politics is valued as intrinsically good when it is judged by the values embedded in its procedures, and not by its outcomes. But, while it is true that judging an activity solely by its outcomes prevents considering it as autotelic, this does not imply that if some values are inherently achieved by engaging in an activity, then that activity is an end in itself. Indeed, such an activity might be considered instrumental precisely to those intrinsic values, as long as they may be theoretically separated from the activity itself – i.e. if things were different and those same values could be attained otherwise, that would be just as good. Moreover, there are activities which are ends in themselves but have no intrinsic value whatsoever, or even a negative one. For example, most games have little or no intrinsic value attached to them – they may even be morally condemnable in some cases – but still they (usually) are ends in themselves, having no purpose other than playing the game itself (it is easy to think of other examples). Republicanism, as commonly constructed, actually values politics as good because it (intrinsically) fosters civic virtue and non-domination among citizens,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1474885111417779">21</xref></sup> and that is equivalent to saying: politics is instrumental to the end of spreading virtue,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1474885111417779">22</xref></sup> securing non-domination or realising the ideal of a good community (the case is somewhat analogous for Rawls: political liberty seems to be desirable for its own moral value, thus it is intrinsically valuable, but instrumentally to moral ends).</p>
<p>While contemporary republicanism may sometimes be close to Nozick's option 3 – considering politics as an autonomous realm – clearly it does not conceive politics as an end in itself. So, who really ever did?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1474885111417779"><title>Making sense of an end in itself</title>
<p>The spectre haunting this discourse is the work of Hannah Arendt, the only major modern political theorist who forcefully advocated the autotelic character of politics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1474885111417779">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Arendt's provocative characterisation of political action has represented, indeed, a sort of mark of naiveté, which most theorists, including some of those more enthusiastic about politics, appeared eager to shrug off.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1474885111417779">24</xref></sup> A specific pattern of rejection was established early on, along two intertwined lines of stereotypes. First, Arendt was naïve, because she praised politics for the joy which could be experienced in the light of public life, but politics is about grim institutionalised coercion, isn't it?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1474885111417779">25</xref></sup> Secondly, her account of an autotelic politics was blatantly unreal: who would ever engage in political action if not to attain certain ends external to politics?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1474885111417779">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>To be sure, Arendt herself noticed the paradoxical nature of the ‘end in itself’ which political action is.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1474885111417779">27</xref></sup> Avoiding the misunderstandings fostered by this ‘paradox’, which may lead to strange and unworldly concepts of action, is one reason why it is necessary to unpack the complex meaning of the autotelic character of politics. Such misunderstandings of Arendt's works have been corrected many times, in order to clarify that her point was not to deny that political actions may have ends, but rather to assert that politics transcends them:
<disp-quote>
<p>In fact, her profound insight is that it is the expression of principles of human association in politics that gives meaning to the intentions and goals of the actor, rescuing them from mere instrumentality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1474885111417779">28</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Nonetheless – and notwithstanding the widespread interest in Arendt's works – the notion of politics as autotelic have not become particularly popular, as we have seen. Indeed, while by now the fact that the Arendtian concept of politics is not incompatible with pragmatic concerns should be promptly acceptable,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1474885111417779">29</xref></sup> the reasons for this concept's being autotelic are still mostly unrecognised. Sadly, many would not even be afraid to ask what is wrong with ‘mere instrumentality’.</p>
<p>Seeing politics as an end in itself is crucial for actualising freedom and power. So, the topic is relevant for more than just hermeneutics’ sake. Accordingly, within Arendt's thinking I want to differentiate between the expressive/existential element (which has drawn most of the attention), and the more formal autotelic concept of politics per se.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1474885111417779">30</xref></sup> The former, which may also be labelled ‘substantive’, may be agreed with or not, provided it is comprehended, while the latter (‘formal’ or ‘grammatical’) should be more generally compelling, albeit on a more abstract level. These two aspects are clearly intertwined within Arendt's works, I shall not try to deny this, but they are not mutually deducible on a purely logical basis; thus, conceding that my primary purpose here is not strictly exegetical, they may be usefully distinguished.</p>
<p>The expressive/existential aspect is more apparent in the characteristic joy that, according to Arendt, goes with action; that ‘public happiness'<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1474885111417779">31</xref></sup> which can be experienced in revealing oneself to the judgements of others under public light. Action alone renders possible the expression of ‘who’ we are; this is the root of the (mis)appropriation of Arendt on the side of so-called identity politics. The inherent connection between aesthetic judgement and the narrative of action leads to postmodernist interpretations of Arendt,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1474885111417779">32</xref></sup> which may somehow recognise action as an end in itself, but tend to push it away from actual politics and power,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1474885111417779">33</xref></sup> sometimes even hinting at a sort of anti-social hero model (that is, according to Arendt, the ‘ancestor’ of politics, but does not represent it altogether).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1474885111417779">34</xref></sup> Under these views, the non-instrumental concept of action resolves itself into the aesthetic of either individual or group identity. In doing so, it is exposed precisely to the aforementioned critiques of practical irrelevance; moreover, it is also incoherently non-political in Arendtian terms.</p>
<p>Transcending the <italic>querelle</italic> between the interpreters of Arendt's thought, we should see that what is relevant is that the substantive facet of the appreciation of politics as an end in itself is both value-driven and empirically contingent. I am more optimistic than most about public happiness, simply because nearly nothing of the political participation experienced in our times could be explained without considering how many people enjoy diverse facets of political involvement: voting, participating in demonstrations, speaking in public, joining a political party and so on (this may concern a minority of the population, but it is such a minority that, for better or worse, actually keeps politics going). Still, I recognise – as Arendt herself did<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1474885111417779">35</xref></sup> – that both the joy of political action, and the revelation of ‘who’ one is through it, may or may not be appreciated by others. The value accorded to such things relies on an aesthetic judgement which – in the Kantian conception as embraced by Arendt<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1474885111417779">36</xref></sup> – is not merely idiosyncratic, and so can be communicated and discussed, but is not absolute either, and so cannot be imposed nor considered fixed once and for all. Coherently, all those praises of public happiness should be taken for what they are: narratives<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1474885111417779">37</xref></sup> supporting the opinion that politics could be (not necessarily always is<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1474885111417779">38</xref></sup>) a good way to live (part of) one's life. This sort of existential appreciation for politics per se, merely stating an aesthetic possibility, does not entail any normative consequence unless one agrees in judging politics as substantively valuable in itself.</p>
<p>However, this substantive and contingent facet of the autotelic concept of politics is mirrored by a more formal and structural one. Arendt emphasised more than once her attention to the very structure of political action, comparing it to ‘grammar’ and ‘syntax’ in a somewhat ‘Wittgensteinian’ way:
<disp-quote>
<p>The grammar of action: that action is the only human faculty that demands a plurality of men; and the syntax of power: that power is the only human attribute which applies solely to the worldly in-between space by which men are mutually related, combine in the act of foundation by virtue of the making and keeping of promises, which, in the realm of politics, may well be the highest human faculty.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1474885111417779">39</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Along these lines, I will argue that politics ought to be considered autotelic also in such a ‘grammatical’ way, that is neither contingent nor value-driven, but rather relative to the structure of action. In order to do that, a broader two-tier consideration of the meaning of ‘autotelic’ should be introduced.</p>
<sec id="sec4-1474885111417779"><title>What ‘autotelic’ should mean</title>
<p>As suggested by the example of games, the quality of being an end in itself may be considered apart from its substantive value, whatever this could be. This statement may seem simple or even trivial, but its application to politics is quite tricky, as we noticed in the confusion between being ‘intrinsically good’ and being ‘an end in itself’. Probably, most of the difficulties in discerning these two concepts originated in Aristotle's account of politics and action. On the one hand, Aristotle characterised <italic>praxis</italic> as an autotelic activity,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1474885111417779">40</xref></sup> on the other hand, in harmony with Hellenic common sense, he praised political life as ‘potentially the best’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1474885111417779">41</xref></sup> within the frame of his teleological ethics. This seemingly twofold conception has influenced republican thought, and political thinkers in general, ever since. Unquestionably, in the absence of an appropriate number of people considering politics as intrinsically valuable, and practising it accordingly (which is a contingent fact), no autotelic concept of political action would make sense. Nonetheless, were we unable to disentangle the quality of being autotelic from its own value, we would remain caught within a substantive account of politics which in principle could not be shareable by those holding different values.</p>
<p>This is exactly what happened to some strands of modern republicanism,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1474885111417779">42</xref></sup> incapable of appropriately coping with the fact of pluralism, and eventually unrealistic because of their ‘ethical overload’, which Habermas and others aptly criticised.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1474885111417779">43</xref></sup> What the critics of such republicanism usually do not realise is that, rejecting the autotelic character of politics, they are caught in exactly the same web. For if politics is instrumental to other ends, then sharing those ends is a necessary condition for accepting the proposed teleological conception of politics, along with its normative implications.</p>
<p>Of course, the fact that considering politics as an end in itself is the only rational (in the very basic sense of ‘non-violent’) way to be consistent with the fact of pluralism does not prove that it ought to be considered that way. On cold logical grounds, one could still prefer to reserve politics for the like-minded, and separation (or worse) for everyone else – to some extent, this is what usually happens, regardless of philosophers’ preferences on the matter. Moreover, it would be strangely self-defeating to advocate an autotelic concept of politics as instrumental to the good result of coping peacefully with the pluralism of our societies. Instead, it is within the second facet of the meaning of ‘autotelic’ that the first one could be grounded.</p>
<p>By its Greek root, ‘autotelic’ could be read either as ‘having an end, or purpose, in itself’ or, similarly to the term ‘autonomous’ – something, ‘we the people’ or the faculty of reason, is autonomous if it gives itself (<italic>autos</italic>) its own norms/laws (<italic>nomos</italic>) – as ‘free to define its end, or purpose’. Here I am not suggesting an arbitrary revision of our dictionary; rather, I want to emphasise that the two meanings are intertwined. For if some activity has ends defined outside of its conceptual boundaries, this means that the end cannot be chosen within that activity. Thus, to be autotelic in the second sense, an activity must be an end in itself in the first sense too (but the reverse does not necessarily hold). This is true not only of activities, but of actors too. For Arendt, alike Kant, to be free and to be an end in itself are correlative qualities of the actor in the world, and these qualities touch each other precisely in the revelatory character of action.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1474885111417779">44</xref></sup> These two aspects are indeed intertwined in the meaning of ‘autotelic’, but commonly the first sense (having an end in itself) is predominant – this partially explains the confusion with the quality of having intrinsic value, since if the end is within an activity which ought to be performed the emphasis will naturally fall on that end being substantively valuable. Thus, it is the sense of ‘being free to set its own ends’ that requires more explanation.</p>
<p>The concept may be clarified with a couple of simple examples – besides the obvious recollection of the Arendtian distinction of labour, work and action. If we look at economic enterprise as a form of human activity which is clearly different from politics, we see that its ends and purposes are defined (even empirically discovered on some accounts) outside of its sphere. Whether the ultimate goal of economy is considered to be a fair distribution of primary goods, or optimising production, or maximising profits, nothing changes in that these definitions are not formulated within economic activity itself. Were they so formulated (e.g. corporate money bribing scientific/philosophical research) we ought to disqualify their credibility. Accordingly, economic enterprises are means to an end, be it profit, a certain distribution of goods or their efficient production. If a businessman ceases to pursue profit, and tries something else, we may approve of him or not, but we should agree that he is no longer acting purely as a businessman – maybe he is doing something philanthropic, artistic or political. Analogous examples are valid for, among others, ships captains, teachers or physicians.</p>
<p>This argument does not imply that such activities cannot have an intrinsic value on any account: one could well enjoy her work, but it is work and not play precisely because it is not autotelic. It should also be underscored that all these labels for different activities are prescriptive (though not moral) definitions, as are labour, work and action in Arendt's terms. In fact, on a descriptive basis, no one has ever been a pure <italic>homo oeconomicus</italic> nor purely political, and not even a single act is always reducible to a single category<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-1474885111417779">45</xref></sup> – yet the inherent logic of such different activities may still be distinguished. Interpreting these concepts as if there were objects or independent phenomena such as ‘labour’, ‘politics’ or ‘power’, that we could observe as we observe an ant colony, simply leads to the departure of meaning from human activities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-1474885111417779">46</xref></sup> Thus, I think we should not interpret Arendt's <italic>Vita Activa</italic> as “a factual-seeming description of the human condition”.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-1474885111417779">47</xref></sup> Arendt tried to describe human possibilities, neither facts nor ‘fact-seemings’ – indeed, she was consistently opposed to any reification of concepts, both in the practical and in the theoretical sphere.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-1474885111417779">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>So, unlike other activities, politics does not have a predefined end, it is a matter of discussion and/or decision within the same language-game – this is also the reason why political theory, in spite of every effort, is not separable from actual politics as economic theory is from economic activities. The very scope of the ends of politics may not be defined prior to actual political action; these ends may concern specific questions, for example a single decision in foreign or domestic affairs, or very broad ones, like what constitution we should bind ourselves to for an indefinite future. This does not mean that any single political action is, could or should be totally unconstrained by any descriptive or ‘ontological’ account; this would even be logically impossible, since any determination whatever would delimit the object described (even its autotelic character is for politics a sort of limit: if not autotelic, an activity should not count as politics at all). There always will be pragmatic constraints on the possibility of choosing some outcomes over others, but none of them in principle – i.e. not within the very grammar of political action. For example, if someone tries to convince people to do something that is impractical or even impossible, we would not say – at least, not only for that reason – that he is not practising politics, but just that he is a somewhat bad politician: too idealistic perhaps, lacking <italic>phronesis</italic>, or simply ignorant of the actual situation. On the other hand, the all too familiar situation in which people believe that the end of their endeavour is already fully determined, be it by economical/historical/natural forces or whatever, is distinctly anti-political, regardless of whether or not those beliefs are correct in the specific case.</p>
<p>Now, that politics may, in principle, decide its own ends depends on the fact that its <italic>telos</italic> is not defined before political action itself. If we dared to assert that political action has one or more ends<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-1474885111417779">49</xref></sup> determined outside and prior to it – i.e. to deny that it is autotelic – we would deprive politics of its own defining character, and thus of meaning. Needless to say, this very <italic>telos</italic> has been the single most relevant topic of political philosophy from Plato onwards. This is why Arendt was right in speaking of the incapacity of philosophers to understand politics. Her famous formula, affirming plurality against the philosophical tradition, “men, not Man, live on the earth and inhabit the world”,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-1474885111417779">50</xref></sup> is equivalent to saying that a definite <italic>telos</italic> cannot define politics, a direct implication of the human condition of plurality, which in turn is a condition for power,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-1474885111417779">51</xref></sup> and without power no concept of politics or action would ever make sense. This is not to say that we, as scholars and theorists, cannot express our political ideas, just that our definitions of politics should not be teleologically linked – though they nearly always have been – to the goals we deem good or desirable. Doing so would be self-defeating, because it would deny an intrinsic condition for politics, and thus hinder the power to realise whatever was the chosen end.</p>
<p>In fact, being autotelic, in this second sense of being free to define its own end, is a formal condition for power, for only freedom, in the political form of joint autotelic action, can generate power. Any unfree ‘action’ presupposes power created elsewhere, either in the form of material incentives, organised coercion or cultural imposition of unquestionable values. For example, using money to obtain obedience presupposes the capacity to procure money first, which is grounded either in uncoerced or coerced interactions; in the latter case, the ability to exert coercion presupposes the power to keep together a group capable of amassing more potential violence than its competitors. Besides, while this is true for any material incentive, the specific use of money presupposes also a legal structure which can be maintained either with power or through traditional value imposition. The latter is the kind of limit that binds (sometimes destroys) the power of the dominating and the dominated alike. The sheer inefficiency of despotic regimes, once traditional and religious justifications are lost, is due to lack of power in this sense.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-1474885111417779">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>The pragmatic correlative of this formal condition is the substantive requisite that people act accordingly, and this is possible only if enough people deem politics an end in itself in the first sense. Otherwise, instances in which any given substantive good would be promptly preferred over the principle of freedom would be so numerous that soon politics, and thus the power to pursue meaningful goals, would be endangered or vanquished – the extreme case is that of totalitarianism, where action tends to disappear, substituted by a strict “law of development”, without margins for freedom, hence power, not even for the dictator.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-1474885111417779">53</xref></sup> This returns us to the question of a substantive appreciation of politics (i.e. its intrinsic value) of which the expressive/existential aspect emphasised by Arendt is only one possibility, thus closing a full circle.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1474885111417779"><title>Schematising action–end relations</title>
<p>Now that an articulation of the relation between an activity and its ends has been sketched, I will recall and schematise it for better clarity. I shall use some, very basic, logical symbolism only for a convenient abbreviation, without any ambition for mathematical rigour. The application of a quasi-logical consequentiality to Arendt's themes involves a bit of irony, and should be read accordingly.</p>
<p>Four possible characters of action may be ordered by their being external (e) or internal (i) to the action – if they directly imply something outside the action itself, or if they do not, respectively – and by being formal (F) or substantive (S) in the sense already explained. Thus we have the character of being intrinsically valuable, which is substantive and internal (Si); that of being instrumentally valuable, which is substantive and external (Se); that of having an end in itself, which is formal and internal (Fi); and finally, that of being free to define its end, which is formal and external (Fe). See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1474885111417779">Table 1</xref>.

<p>None of these qualities is exactly coextensive with any of the others, but they are somewhat mutually implied along a specific pattern. Fi, Fe and Si are those usually conflated under the concept of being ‘an end in itself’ or ‘autotelic’, but I deem this label more appropriate for Fi and Fe only. Si and Se are not directly linked: something can be both intrinsically and instrumentally valuable, but may also have only one of these qualities (maybe the latter possibility is more common than the former). Fi is required by Fe, because if some activity has a definite end outside itself (that is, ¬Fi), then it cannot define its own purpose, so: Fe → Fi. As we have seen, if something is only instrumentally valuable,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-1474885111417779">54</xref></sup> it cannot have its end within itself, so: (Se ∧ ¬Si) → ¬Fi.</p>
<p>There are also a couple of relations which are not strictly logical, because they involve the contingency of a substantive judgement, but (with this <italic>caveat</italic>) may still be represented as implications. The relation between Fi and Si is of this kind. For if an autotelic activity has to be performed by large numbers of people (usually not so reliably motivated either by categorical imperatives or by the forceless force of the better argument), then it is a contingent requirement that such an activity be experienced as intrinsically valuable by those that perform it. This is especially true for politics that, in contrast with most games, may involve severe risks and difficulties, besides occasional intense boredom. So: Fi → Si. This is the reason why all those praises for public happiness, though not logically required, are relevant on a systematic level too – it should also be noticed that the introduction of substantive elements limits the validity of these assertions to the sphere of political action (i.e. action properly so called, if we accept Arendt's conceptualisation), excluding other forms of behaviour.</p>
<p>The relation between Se and Fe is analogous if more complex. For an activity to be instrumentally valuable, it must be compatible with the presence of the power to realise whatever end it had. But the presence of power, in Arendtian terms, requires Fe: single coerced acts may well be instrumentally valuable, but they still depend on a broader capacity of defining ends freely. So: Se → Fe. Now, the set of these relations reads as follow:
<disp-quote>
<p>Se → Fe → Fi → Si</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This constitutes a concatenation that defines the condition for meaning in action – i.e. power, for without power any action (if an action at all) is futile. Since (Se ∧¬Si) → ¬Fi, it should be clear in what sense <italic>mere</italic> instrumentality is truly meaningless. For it prevents a necessary condition for power, it breaks the chain, thus hindering (though, usually, not immediately preventing) the realisation of its own instrumental purpose. Any instrumentally meaningful act is thinkable only within a context that includes the conditions for power – i.e. the autotelic concept of politics so neglected by modern and contemporary political theory. In Arendt's own words: “power, far from being the means to an end, is actually the very condition enabling a group of people to think and act in terms of the means-end category”.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-1474885111417779">55</xref></sup></p>

</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1474885111417779"><title>Considerations on politics and normativeness</title>
<p>I argued that the aspect of the autotelic concept of politics that should be generally compelling is not the substantive but the formal one. I repeat that this is not to deny the importance of substantive aspects of politics. On the contrary, their consideration is intrinsically involved, but they should not overwhelm the formal principle of freedom; were they to do so, hindering power, this would eventually lead to their own meaninglessness. Accordingly, the first implication of an autotelic concept of politics is not the dismissal of substantive questions, but their sharp separation from formal ones. Arguably, this is very problematic, because we can no longer (if anyone ever really could) rely on a categorial metaphysics to separate form from matters. Nonetheless, the very possibility of addressing political questions – if we wish to avoid unleashed violence – depends on our capacity to enact this distinction.</p>
<p>Here I will sketch some implications of the proposed approach. I shall again focus on normative political theory not only for lack of space – even within this constraint it is plainly impossible to assess the entire matter here – but also because it is on this ground (broadly) that political definitions may be crafted, thus indirectly influencing (possibly) political science and empirical approaches. Trying to start abruptly from an empirical assessment would be meaningless, not only because empirical political science would be even more averse to an autotelic consideration of politics, but also because it lacks the theoretical space to define such a concept and its implications.</p>
<sec id="sec7-1474885111417779"><title>About the (minimalist) priority of norms</title>
<p>The priority of a normative orientation over a descriptive one might be defended, in a rather strong version, from a number of points of view. For example, the opposite approaches of postmodernism and discursivism may converge on the assertion that any factual description is framed by validity claims, thus involving a moral/ethical orientation. While a discursivist ought to ground that orientation in pragmatic rationality,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-1474885111417779">56</xref></sup> an ideal-typical postmodernist would deconstruct the metaphysics lurking under those normative assumptions, possibly tracing them back to an arbitrary power relation. Still both might well agree that a norm-free factual description is chimeric.</p>
<p>On a less demanding ground, nowadays even a positivist could agree with Max Weber who, while praising value-free descriptions in his sociological works, thought of politics as inherently value-ridden.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-1474885111417779">57</xref></sup> To simplify this sort of view, any description of politics must include its non-descriptive orientation – and this is precisely because politics has to do with ‘acts', not only with ‘facts’.</p>
<p>I shall argue for a similar but more deflationary conception. First of all, here I am uninterested in general epistemological assumptions, I am concerned only with politics and political action. Moreover, for the reasons already given, I want to detach the formal quality of a normative orientation from substantive judgements concerning ethical/moral values. This is to say that, while the concept of politics involves normativeness, its own substantive value is not prejudged – it may be unjust or evil, if either justice or goodness are concerned. For example, the basic political maxim, <italic>pacta sunt servanda</italic>, does not say anything substantive, such pacts might be horrendously immoral; still, that pacts and agreements are (more often than not) honoured is an inescapable condition for both politics and morality.</p>
<p>An adequate concept of politics should be normative in this way. Politics being a composite activity, and not a single object or fact, it would not exist if not defined by intersubjectively valid norms of meaning. This is true of all activities – someone is studying, or playing football, or giving a lecture, if she is performing within the boundaries of certain formal and informal norms (which may be contested), and so on; otherwise, she would be doing something else, or nothing at all – and even truer of politics which, in contrast with other activities, brings directly to the fore the question of its own normative definition. Following Arendt, I claimed that, to count as political, actions must be autotelic, with the intertwined meanings of being free to define their ends and of being ends in themselves. This defines a normative principle, which is nonetheless devoid of any moral or teleological content.</p>
<p>On this ground, an autotelic conception of politics ought to distance itself both from those traditions that deny or downplay normativeness – such as political realism and most empirical approaches – and from those that subordinate politics to morality – as in most modern and contemporary political philosophy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-1474885111417779">58</xref></sup> Admittedly, this comes at the cost of foregoing any idea of explaining away politics, be it via moral philosophy or empirical studies. Like any anti-reductionist stance, this must leave us somewhat unsatisfied, with more, not less, practical and theoretical questions to address. Nonetheless, if Arendt's account of power is right, an autotelic concept of politics is not only descriptively useful, but also intrinsically related to the very possibility of articulating both instrumental and moral rationality. For without a space for power, which is something neither ‘natural’ nor ever-present, no action could ever have a distinct meaning. This has interesting consequences, an example of which will be presented in the next section.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1474885111417779"><title>Public reason, proceduralism and the quest for neutrality</title>
<p>A common problem in normative theories is that, since they are committed to freedom and autonomy, it is theoretically difficult to define anything substantive as a duty. Moving from morality towards politics, things get even worse, for even if an objectively true and just political ideal could be defined, one which no reasonable person could object to, such an ideal would still be politically suspect.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-1474885111417779">59</xref></sup> For there will always be actual unreasonable persons who won't agree with it, on whom it could only be imposed, thus violating their autonomy and freedom.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-1474885111417779">60</xref></sup> Moreover, for any reasonable definition of ‘reasonable’, there are plenty of reasonable people who can't find an agreement on any true and just political ideal – not to mention that the correct definition of ‘reasonable’ is always controversial.</p>
<p>Among contemporary philosophers, Habermas and Rawls have been particularly concerned with a normative grounding for a workable political ideal in the face of the fact of pluralism. They pursued the same goal through somewhat opposite strategies. Rawls defined his political liberalism as autonomous from comprehensive doctrines, and yet compatible with all reasonable ones. Such a result he tried to attain by strictly limiting the substantive content of his theory, thus minimising both the required philosophical grounding and the possibility of conflicts. By contrast, Habermas's discursive philosophy is comprehensive, grounded in a theory of linguistic competence, touching epistemology, social psychology, moral philosophy and eventually culminating in a procedural theory of law and democracy that eschews the provision of substantive norms.</p>
<p>It has been interesting observing Habermas’s and Rawls’s arguing, without a definite outcome, about which theory was more ‘neutral’ and less ‘substantive’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-1474885111417779">61</xref></sup> for their mutual criticisms shed light on problems faced by any theory which tries to mingle politics with moral foundations. Habermas's most relevant remark has been that Rawls could not assume substantive contents within his theory, because they would be experienced as impositions by actual citizens. Moreover, were these contents so minimal as to be truly acceptable by all reasonable citizens, they would not be sufficient to shape an ideal of just coexistence, nor to define the very idea of reasonableness. Rawls countered, by observing that Habermas's claim to have avoided substantive norms was illusory,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-1474885111417779">62</xref></sup> while on the other hand the complex Habermasian theory, being comprehensive, could not be accepted by all reasonable citizens, even if true, and as such it could not represent a workable political ideal.</p>
<p>Both Habermas and Rawls had answers to the other. Interestingly their responses, as different as they were, may be rendered as attempts to ‘neutralise’ normative assumptions, grounding them in some sort of factuality. Such a move they had to make, because within the boundaries of a moral-oriented political theory it is the only way to avoid making substantive contents count as coercion and violation of autonomy. Thus, against Habermas's charges, Rawls argues that his minimal substantive assumptions are harmless, being already embedded, at least as general principles, in our best political culture; whereas Habermas's answer to Rawls is that, yes, discursivism is a comprehensive theory, but precisely because it is, it may present itself as true, thus founding procedural norms on a (quasi-transcendental) ground which is indeed literally unquestionable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-1474885111417779">63</xref></sup> Whether these argumentative strategies could succeed, I shall not try to assess here. But merely stating them is sufficient to expose how, for all their efforts to link politics and morality, they both point towards the priority of an autotelic concept of politics – and ironically, this occurs precisely in the form of the two historical examples Arendt's appreciation for which has been so often criticised: the American revolution and the Greek <italic>polis</italic>.</p>
<p>In fact, Rawls finds his factual exit point in the ‘liberal political culture’ that he has to take as a given – without such a concrete grounding, the criterion of reasonableness would be empty and useless<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-1474885111417779">64</xref></sup> – while Habermas relies on a reconstruction of the quasi-transcendental conditions of practical discourse. The political culture to which Rawl refers is expressed mainly in the Constitution, which is not a ‘natural’ – let alone neutral – product of anonymous historic forces, but rather a deed of men whose conscious purpose was to (re)establish freedom, understood as the capacity to act in concert<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-1474885111417779">65</xref></sup> – i.e. the power of pursuing ends not imposed but freely chosen. On the other hand, the <italic>Diskurs</italic>, on which all genuine normative claims ought to be grounded, may well be embedded (‘always already’) in the very conditions of language and communication, and yet actual critical and reflexive discourses did not spring but from the context of ancient <italic>poleis</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-1474885111417779">66</xref></sup> a <italic>polis</italic> being a stage consciously constructed for politics. Those Greeks were indeed the first to perform that self-reflexive <italic>logos</italic>, which was, and is, inherently intertwined with the
<disp-quote>
<p>… <italic>bios politikos</italic>, namely action (<italic>praxis</italic>) and speech (<italic>lexis</italic>), out of which rises the realm of human affairs (<italic>ta ton anthropon pragmata</italic>, as Plato used to call it) from which everything merely necessary or useful is strictly excluded.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-1474885111417779">67</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>As Westerners, we may be as self-critical as we want about such a ‘Greek exceptionalism’, but here the question is not about our sinful ethnocentrism. Rather, the point is that, whether in Greece or anywhere, the three basic validity claims that discursivism identified (truth, rightness, sincerity) may be made explicit and questioned only within the context of an autotelic concept of action. For to participate in a dialogue speakers must recognise each other as ends in themselves, at a minimum in the sense of autonomous sources of meaning and validity claims; since “a linguistic utterance is itself a form of action”,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-1474885111417779">68</xref></sup> this would not be thinkable without a concept (vague, if you like) of an autotelic activity, which is, indeed, politics. In fact, the lack of political freedom is as hostile to moral discourses, and thinking in general, as it is to action, and perhaps even more so.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-1474885111417779">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>The examples of Habermas and Rawls are particularly relevant, because they are the contemporary philosophers who have thought more thoroughly the links between politics and morality. Yet, their theories require the priority of politics over morality, because otherwise morality itself could not be meaningfully articulated. This concept of politics has to be normative (as we saw, that is the only way to define such an object) but since it is presupposed by moral theory, it cannot include moral content, thus it must be the autotelic concept of politics described, which basically coincides with the purely formal principle of political freedom. Even if we want to articulate the content, for example, of a political theory of justice in light of a moral orientation – something I would not necessarily object to – we still have to recognise that politics requires a normative definition which is independent from, and prior to, morality.</p>
<p>This is indeed unsurprising. It is quite clear, at least since Kant, that freedom is necessary to articulate a meaningful morality (one that is not merely a heteronomous set of <italic>mores</italic>). Since we cannot rely any longer on an essentialist/metaphysical idea of freedom – at least I cannot, nor can Rawls, Habermas and most contemporary political theorists – we have to turn to the practical conception of it, as fragile and uncertain as it is, which does not exist anywhere as a fixed property of humankind, but rather is a potentiality which may be actualised only within politics as an autotelic activity.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1474885111417779" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Recognising the autotelic character of politics would imply a reconsideration of our theoretical and practical approaches to political matters, something I have neither strength nor space to do here. Fortunately a good deal of the task was completed by Arendt herself. I refer to her work, claiming that it should be read in the light of a proper autotelic concept of politics, which is different from the current liberal, socialist, deliberative or republican conceptions. I think that it is on this understanding – and not on hopeless attempts to render Arendt consistent with divergent intellectual enterprises – that both fruitful developments and insightful critiques of her ideas could be grounded.</p>
<p>However, I want to conclude with just a few words about the most general practical consequence of a proper autotelic consideration of politics. This consequence would be a shift in our approach to law and institutional design. For if politics ought to be considered an end in itself, clearly no pragmatic consideration about wealth redistribution, national security, cultural or religious values, racial or gender identities, nor any desired substantive outcome, should trump the principle of freedom in informing institutions and laws we choose to create. The reason for this is not only that political freedom is in itself desirable – while it actually is, this could still be dismissed as a republican and/or philhellenic nostalgia – but also that it is an intrinsic condition for actualising power. We should re-apprehend how to think in the grammar of principles, for within politics it is the only way to act effectively, even in terms of means-end.</p>
<p>If we looked at the language of political discourse, we would see that more often than not, and nearly always outside the United States, the opposite is true: single institutions and laws are justified for specific goals, electoral systems are discussed and chosen for their effects in favouring certain social groups or parties, rather than their consistency with the exercise of freedom, even judicial sentences are instrumentally interpreted, and so on, in every sphere that ought to be political. I am not saying that substantive concerns should be alien to politics. Quite to the contrary, it is the refusal to recognise the autotelic character of politics that hinders the creation of power, thus jeopardising the realisation of any thinkable collective goal, including those aforementioned. An autotelic understanding of politics, however abstract and remote it may seem, is the very cornerstone of any meaningful political effort, however concrete and worldly it may be.</p>
<p>Obviously, it is rather difficult, often painful, to reconcile abstract principles with pragmatic concerns. Yet the alternative of yielding the space for action altogether does not strike me as particularly desirable.</p>

It is important to recall that this passage, where action is even characterised as, “<italic>atelic</italic>” that is ‘without ends’, is located in the paragraph devoted to, “Power and the Space of Appearance” ‘power’ being no less, as we shall see, than the condition enabling the use of the means-end category. Thus, a sensible interpretation of Arendt’s concept of action lies not in completely divorcing it, and all of its actual instances, from means and ends, but rather in understanding how conceptualising political action outside of mere instrumentality is a necessary condition for actors to pursue their goals, different and often conflictual as they are, in a meaningful way.</p></fn>
