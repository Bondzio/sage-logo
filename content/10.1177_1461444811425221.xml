<abstract>
<p>Pro-suicide websites are topping search engine result lists, raising fears about the internet’s detrimental influence on behaviour and attitudes related to suicide. Based on a qualitative analysis, this article argues that the production of pro-suicide content on the internet should be seen as a counter-discourse, directed against socially dominant perceptions of suicide. On pro-suicide websites, the description of technical, chemical and anatomic details, the expression of honourable and clearly individualistic ideals, the depictions of morbid bodily violence, together with the absence of emotional content could all be said to represent a kind of constructed Western masculinity. Furthermore, because of its potential for identity gain and the acting out of aggressive impulses, it is crucial – although this may seem somewhat paradoxical – to understand the production of the pro-suicide content as a manifestation of what is, for the participants, a meaningful practice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>While much of what is said about suicide and its causes in most contemporary societies is surrounded by an aura of taboo, internet websites and discussion forums have become an important and controversial source of information on the subject. A great deal of ambivalence can be discerned as to whether online communications about suicide should be seen primarily as an opportunity, or as a serious threat (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461444811425221">Alao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1461444811425221">D’Hulster and Van Heeringen, 2006</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-1461444811425221">
<title>Dominance and opposition</title>
<p>In earlier Western societies, the issue of suicide was a question reserved mainly for religion and law. In the Middle Ages, suicide was strictly forbidden, regarded as a crime worse than murder. Consequently, in <italic>Inferno</italic>, Dante placed suicides in the seventh circle of Hell, below heretics and murderers. As the dominance of religious ideologies subsided, a discursive uncertainty arose, still evident today in social and cultural taboos, including ambivalence towards suicide: for example, whether it is a question for the individual, or for society. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1461444811425221">Giddens (1991</xref>: 159) suggests that suicide remains an anomaly and, unlike many other culturally and historically ‘deviant’ phenomena, one that has yet to be incorporated into society.</p>
<p>Ideas about suicide familiar to us today began to develop during the Enlightenment. Processes of decriminalization of suicide would not have taken place in the 19th and 20th centuries without the liberal view that individuals are free to do as they wish – as long as this does not harm others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1461444811425221">Mäkinen, 1997</xref>: 14). A shift takes place from an attitude of legal-religious condemnation and punishment to one that is morally evaluative. Later, during the 20th century, the discourse on suicide was further transformed by the burgeoning fields of medicine and psychiatry, which today have become the dominant institutions for explaining and dealing with suicidal behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461444811425221">Beskow, 2000</xref>: 102). Suicide was defined as a manifestation of psychic disorder, and therefore to be treated according to the knowledge and methods belonging to those fields. Responsibility shifted from the person committing suicide, to social institutions.</p>
<p>Since the decriminalization of completed suicides, no clear legal grounds remain for obstructing a person from taking their own life, which, however, does not mean that society has begun to accept the act.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1461444811425221">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The strongly preventive attitude towards suicide is still prevalent, and in some ways has even been strengthened in the modern and late modern era (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461444811425221">Beskow, 2000</xref>: 102). What has changed, however, is the discursive explanation for suicidal behaviour, in addition to the forms of care and treatment for those who develop suicidal tendencies. The paradox is that although individuals have a legal ‘right’ to take their own life, actually doing so is not socially accepted. And it is this ambiguity which provides the basis for the opposition expressed by the pro-suicide discourse.</p>
<p>The Western origins of the pro-suicide approach can be traced back to the tolerant Stoic view on suicide, which reappeared during the Enlightenment’s liberal and individualistic influence. The narrow hierarchies and religious prejudices of the Church were criticized in the work of philosophers like Hume and Voltaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461444811425221">Alvarez, 1977</xref>: 38). According to this counter-discourse, suicide could be an acceptable, even honourable and desirable solution to the difficulties and conflicts facing an individual. And, most importantly, it was considered to be an individual free choice which nobody else had the right to interfere with.</p>
<p>In the Romantic literature of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, death and suicide acted as an important source of inspiration and became the discursive subject of a great many poems, novels and plays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461444811425221">Alvarez, 1977</xref>). Not infrequently, the act of suicide was glorified as something beautiful and honourable, often performed by a handsome young male, such as in Goethe’s <italic>The Sorrows of Young Werther</italic>. Spontaneous and powerful outpourings of emotion were celebrated; suicide was considered an act of rebellion credited to ‘the young genius’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461444811425221">Alvarez, 1977</xref>: 44). The suicidal mode, or ‘death ideal’ waned towards the middle and end of the 19th century, and was replaced in part by the challenge of sexuality. However, the glorification of suicide – suicide as rebellion and opposition against the dominant values of society – may also be found in popular culture in the 20th and 21st century, such as rock music and film. The glorification of individual resistance communicated by pro-suicide messages on the internet today may be traced back to Stoicism and Romanticism, albeit in new forms and with new adversaries.</p>

<sec id="section3-1461444811425221">
<title>Pro-suicide websites</title>
<p>Some researchers have reflected on the emergence of large numbers of pro-suicide websites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461444811425221">Baume et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1461444811425221">Thompson, 1999</xref>). These appear to be topping search engine result lists, making them highly visible and accessible for those searching for suicide-related content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1461444811425221">Recupero et al., 2008</xref>). A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1461444811425221">Biddle et al. (2008)</xref> indicated that nearly 30 percent of search results for suicide-related words using different search engines consist of web pages whose content was dominated by information about suicide methods, and whose messages about suicidal acts ranged from incitement or clear encouragement to non-rejection. Recommending suicide as a solution to life’s problems, pro-suicide websites contain detailed descriptions of methods for achieving maximum effect, as well as suicide notes and pictures of people who have already committed suicide. Using persuasion and peer pressure to encourage suicide plans, they glorify those who succeed, giving rise to a new form of suicide pact: ‘net suicide’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1461444811425221">Lee, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1461444811425221">Naito, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1461444811425221">Rajagopal, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1461444811425221">Ozawa-De Silva (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1461444811425221">2010</xref>) points to the role of sociality in the internet-based suicide pacts: in meeting, planning and carrying out suicide plans together, people can experience a sense of relationship and community. For those trying to establish suicide pacts on the internet, dying together seems more comforting than dying alone.</p>
<p>A number of case studies have shown that individuals have committed suicide or carried out serious attempts after receiving information about suicide methods from the internet (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461444811425221">Adekola et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461444811425221">Becker et al., 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1461444811425221">D’Hulster and Van Heeringen (2006)</xref> refer to two serious suicide attempts that were planned and carried out using information gathered from the internet. The authors argue that access to pro-suicide information on the internet can lower thresholds and increase the chances of suicidal behaviour in individuals at risk. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461444811425221">Baume et al. (1997)</xref> followed three cases where people had left messages on a pro-suicide website saying that they were considering taking their own lives. Two of the three cases apparently led to completed suicides after the subjects had received detailed instructions concerning suicide methods and had also been encouraged to carry out their plans.</p>
<p>These developments raise fears about the internet’s detrimental influence on attitudes and behaviour regarding suicide. Some authors argue that the internet has a stronger ‘Werther effect’ – a greater potential influence on suicidal acts – than other forms of mediated communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461444811425221">Baume et al., 1997</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1461444811425221">2</xref></sup> Others point to a clear ‘anti-psychiatric’ attitude behind the production of the pro-suicide message (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1461444811425221">Becker and Schmidt, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, the internet can be seen as a key resource and powerful communications tool for understanding and supporting suicidal individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1461444811425221">Baker and Fortune, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461444811425221">Gilat and Shahar, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1461444811425221">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). For example, it may be used to identify people in the risk zone, and then to communicate with them, thereby preventing such acts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1461444811425221">Barak, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Ambivalence about the role of the internet in the issue of suicide raises questions of control and power: every dominant discourse attempts, through different methods – for example, by exclusion or incorporation – to retain dominance within its sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1461444811425221">Fairclough, 1995</xref>: 56; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1461444811425221">Hall, 1997</xref>: 44–49). This is also the case for the suicide-preventive approach. Defensive strategies include, among other things, the establishment of specific recommendations on how information and communication concerning suicide should take place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461444811425221">Becker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1461444811425221">Coombes, 2008</xref>), as well as demands for legislation and regulations regarding what should be permitted on websites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1461444811425221">Dobson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1461444811425221">Thompson, 1999</xref>).</p>

<title>Method and material</title>
<p>This article presents the analysis of only one pro-suicide website; however, it should be noted that such websites show many similarities, suggesting a degree of exchange between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1461444811425221">Westerlund and Wasserman, 2009</xref>). The similarities consist not only of shared subject matter, but also in a common counter-discourse against current values and beliefs about suicide. Many provide links to each other, which gives the impression of a loosely connected virtual cluster of pro-suicide websites whose contents and messages are shared both by visitors and producers.</p>
<p>The Swedish Suicide Guide is a website in Swedish that has been on the internet since May 2005. An individual producer is responsible for the website’s design and material. Its popularity has increased steadily; since 2008 it appears as number one on Google’s Swedish result list (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1461444811425221">2008, 2009, 2010</xref>) for searches using the word ‘självmord’ (suicide). For a Swedish speaker looking for suicide-related content via a search engine, the probability of finding the suicide guide is extremely high. In 2007 there was an average of 1214 ‘unique’ visitors per week. In 2009, the number had increased to 2098 visitors per week. About 95 percent of these visitors consisted of Swedish internet users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1461444811425221">Extremetracking, 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1461444811425221">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The present analysis is based primarily on the content of two archived versions of the Swedish Suicide Guide. The first version was saved in PDF-format in September 2007, consisting of 101 pages. The second version was saved in January 2010, consisting of 146 pages. These two versions are very similar, except that the suicide methods described in 2010 were more numerous. In general, the site gives the impression of forming a digital catalogue in which most of the space is allocated to descriptions of a wide variety of suicide methods, together with evaluations of their usefulness. The texts in the Swedish Suicide Guide are structured in different chapters and sections, with headings like ‘Poisons’ and ‘Sharp blades’. Generally, these headings refer to different suicide methods. In the Result and discussion part, I use these headings after quotations to refer to these different chapters and sections.</p>
<p>The Swedish Suicide Guide is almost exclusively characterized by a text-based, monological form of communication, but in April 2008 the chat room SUIGUI CHAT was established on the Guide, allowing visitors to log on and talk about things connected with suicide. The present analysis, however, is based only on the non-interactive content on the website.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1461444811425221">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The approach to the analysis of the Swedish Suicide Guide’s textual content is qualitative and analogous with semiotics: the process of identifying the signs, codes and themes occupying a central position, placing them within a broader context (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461444811425221">Fiske, 1990</xref>). The analysis also uses key elements from Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1461444811425221">Fairclough, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1461444811425221">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1461444811425221">Fairclough and Wodak, 1997</xref>). CDA extends the semiotic method by more specifically placing the mediated text in its socio-cultural context. By studying details within the linguistic structure, in terms of the text’s social and historical situation, the researcher can reveal the values and patterns of representation encoded in the language. This approach can be considered critical in the sense that the analysis determines how texts construct discursive knowledge about what is right and wrong, true and untrue, natural and unnatural.</p>
<p>The discursive analytical perspective indicates that two or more discourses in the same domain commonly compete in providing explanations and meanings for a certain subject or phenomenon – in this study, the management of, and beliefs about, suicide. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1461444811425221">Fairclough (1992</xref>: 219, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1461444811425221">1995</xref>: 55) uses the concept <italic>order of discourse</italic> to describe this phenomenon. If one assumes an order of discourse within a social field, the dynamic between discourses becomes of central importance. The orders of discourse constitute an area for the exercise of <italic>cultural hegemony</italic>, where dominant groups strive to retain certain prevailing structures, and freeze the meaning of a certain area in a specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1461444811425221">Fairclough, 1995</xref>: 56). Whenever a discourse on a certain subject is prominent, there will be areas where its dominance is almost total, and others where it is questioned by competing discourses, or <italic>counter-discourses</italic>.</p>

<title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>After reading and re-reading the archived versions of the Swedish Suicide Guide, certain thematic modes emerged, allowing significant aspects of the website’s content to be understood:</p>
<list id="list2-1461444811425221" list-type="bullet">

<p>In the following, I will draw on these thematic modes.</p>
<sec id="section7-1461444811425221">
<title>‘Social criticism at its best’</title>
<p>On the front page of the Swedish Suicide Guide, visitors are met by a grinning skull.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1461444811425221">5</xref></sup> This iconic symbol of the human cranium reminds us of our mortality; what will remain of us, after life. Directly and explicitly, the website tells us that the space we are about to enter concerns death. The skull warns of danger; a globally recognized sign for dangerous chemicals or places. The symbol is also strongly associated with subversive and illegal activities, from pirates to criminal motorcycle gangs. This is further enhanced by the website’s slogan: ‘Social criticism at its best!’</p>

<p>After an extensive ‘List of Contents’ covering the guide’s methods of committing suicide, there is a short dedication: ‘This guide is dedicated to all the defects of Sweden, their defenders and supporters. And to everyone who has had the courage to flee from this hell by killing themselves.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1461444811425221">6</xref></sup> In this way, the Swedish Suicide Guide is dedicated to the outsiders, those living their lives on the edge of established society, who are part of its ‘defects’. The words ‘defenders’ and ‘supporters’ also indicate that a conscious choice is being made, a choice based on a counter-cultural worldview whose ideals are to be defended and propagated. Furthermore, we understand from this statement that the producer is aware that the content on the website is, according to majority opinion, suspect and beyond the limits of what is considered ‘normal’. The production and dissemination of what is obscure and abnormal thus becomes a way of taking a stance. The second sentence in the ‘Dedication’ presents acts of suicide as heroic ways of dealing with life’s problems, capturing an important aspect of the pro-suicide approach: once an individual, for various reasons, no longer can cope with life, suicide is not only a reasonable alternative, but also one that is honourable and ought not be questioned or obstructed by fellow human beings or social institutions. This critical approach and opposition to established society is evident throughout the guide, illustrated in the following example of how to get hold of medication in order to poison oneself:
<disp-quote>
<p>You call a psychiater [sic] and say you’re applying for a job, but because of extreme anxiety you can’t sleep at night before the interview, which means you won’t get the job. You say you’ve already tried mild sedatives, but they don’t help, so you need something stronger so you can get some sleep before the next interview … The key here is to not reveal any clues about your ulterior motives, you have to present yourself as someone without any real psychological problems, except short-term situational anxiety. When you’ve collected a big enough pile of tablets from different doctors, then you’re ready. (Medication)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is possible to deduce a clear, anti-psychiatric attitude in the quote above, an ‘us-against-them’ stance where the ‘psychiater’ is not someone one turns to for help at a time of psychological need, but is a representative of authority that has to be deceived and cheated in order to reach one’s goal. The anti-psychiatric standpoint becomes part of a general opposition to established social laws, norms and values, which is expressed in sentences such as ‘It’s a method that politicians cannot ever legislate against …’ (Asphyxiation) and ‘Anyway, it’s difficult to lay your hands on them in a country like Sweden, which refuses to allow its citizens to acquire any weapons at all for self-defence’ (Weapons).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1461444811425221">
<title>Scientificity</title>
<p>Many of the methods described include sections normally associated with scientific fields. Detailed descriptions of chemical substances, plants, animals, human organs and technical apparatuses are provided, their construction and their function.</p>
<p>The following can be found regarding plants:
<disp-quote>
<p>Oleander, or rose bay as it is also known, is a toxic plant with similar poison to that of the foxglove. It is used as a decorative garden shrub and has yellow, trumpet-like flowers, and a fruit as large as a chestnut, in which is found a single seed. (Poisons)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The style here is familiar from the way plants are described in a botanical Flora: clear and concise. Both the Latin name and the habitat are included: ‘Rosary pea (Arbus precatorius) is a common plant in the form of a climbing vine found in most tropical areas of the world’ (Poisons). The style of the writing in these sections, then, could be described as ‘scientific’, largely factual and lacking in overtly subjective judgements.</p>
<p>The objective, scientific style can also be found in the sections about chemical substances. Chlorine, for example is mentioned in the following manner: ‘Chlorine is a chemical gaseous element, one of the halogens, with a greenish yellow colour and powerful odour. It is extremely poisonous in high concentrations, and is used as a powerful oxidising agent, bleach and disinfectant’ (Chemicals). This description could quite easily be found in a Chemistry textbook, and in many cases, provides a kind of ‘surplus information’. If, for example, one wants to experiment with carbon monoxide, one learns that ‘CaCO3 + Zn -&gt; CaO + ZnO + CO’ (Asphyxiation). In addition, we see an almost manic cataloguing and categorization, resulting in long lists and tables. For example, 38 different insecticides are collected under the heading ‘Chemicals’. These are neatly listed in alphabetical order according to their chemical names, which, I assume, would be incomprehensible to many readers: ‘Acephate, Aldicarb, Amitraz, Azinphos-methyl, Bendicard, Carbaryl …’.</p>
<p>The guide also contains descriptions from the field of medicine, often full of technical jargon, in all likelihood making the text difficult for a non-medical reader. Among other things, we learn:

<p>As the cardiac hypoxia increases, the pupils dilate and finally do not react at all to light. Blood pressure falls and the pulse becomes weak and irregular. Seizures can sometimes occur. Cheyne-Stoke respiration is common in cases of cerebral hypoxia, faster breathing being broken by longer and longer periods of apnoea. (Biology)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Most of the medical content concerns dosage and reaction times, effects, symptoms and bodily changes in various life-threatening situations. It should be noted that these not only concern conscious attempts at suicide, but illnesses are also described in some detail, such as blood-poisoning and hepatitis. The above mentioned aspects often follow each other in the same sentence or paragraph, such as in this example on sarin:
<disp-quote>
<p>Symptoms following ingestion through the skin, mouth or lungs of only 0.01 mg/kg body weight are: runny nose, chest constriction, dilation of the pupils followed by breathlessness, nausea and drooling. The victim then loses control over all bodily functions. This phase ends with spasms, leading finally to unconsciousness, and the victim suffocates as a result of seizures, all within one minute. Those who survive risk permanent neurological damage. (Poisons)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The above description indicates a situation of exposure to sarin by accident or aggression rather than through one’s own deliberate action. Twice, the subject is termed the ‘victim’. The account could be taken from a manual written for personnel involved in disasters or war zones.</p>
<p>The guide also contains descriptions and drawings of various technical apparatuses, such as the guillotine:
<disp-quote>
<p>… tool for execution by decapitation, introduced in France in 1792 during the French Revolution. A guillotine is composed of two vertical runners and an angled blade. The blade is released from its highest position and it falls to decapitate the restrained (by a shackle about the neck) victim. (Sharp Blades)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This functional description, with elements of historical fact, is also accompanied by a simple sketch of a guillotine. One wonders why they are included at all, since it does not seem very realistic that a suicidal individual would attempt to acquire or build a guillotine in order to take his or her life.</p>
<p>Although parts of the above-quoted passage can be linked to the methods of suicide, many of the detailed and precise descriptions of plants, animals, chemical formulas and technical devices are probably of no help at all to an individual looking for useful information about how to go about killing themselves. So why are they included? A more direct interpretation is to point to the counter-culture status that may be generated by constructing a detailed and comprehensive suicide manual, which distinguishes itself from other more simplistic and amateurish productions on the subject. The website accrues a kind of subversive expertise and authority in the field. In a broader sense, these detailed descriptions, lists and tables can be interpreted as contemporary manifestations of a masculine popular science culture, which, during the 1900s, gave rise to chemistry and physics kits, Meccano, model trains, miniature steam engines and countless popular science magazines. Thus, an interest in constructing, organizing, cataloguing, and mixing substances, although transferred to a new area, is nevertheless recognizable. Linked to a Western, masculine, scientific ideal, its roots can be found in the Enlightenment’s growing disenchantment with metaphysical explanations. The scientific mode, therefore, largely appears to be both a masculine construction, and a construction of masculinity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1461444811425221">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, the instrumental, scientific style of presenting different suicide methods appears to provide a way of avoiding strong emotions – such as fear, sadness, anger and regret – which otherwise are so closely related to suicide. I will return to this discussion under the heading Absence.</p>

<sec id="section9-1461444811425221">
<title>Morbidness</title>
<p>Morbid and brutal descriptions are so common in the Swedish Suicide Guide that they, in themselves, form a theme concerning the lacerated body. After a successful suicide, there is a dead body to take care of, and after a suicide attempt there are more or less serious internal and external injuries to treat, but this does not explain the excesses in blood and injured body parts found on the Swedish Suicide Guide. This must represent something else. The recurring anatomical descriptions testify to an obsession with the body, its organs and fluids. They often provide intimate and detailed observations:
<disp-quote>
<p>a human head can probably see for 20 seconds after decapitation. Just after the sword, guillotine, car accident or whatever it was severed your head, you feel slightly nauseous. Then you see stars or black spots. The sounds you hear seem to be higher pitched. As the blood leaves your head, you feel cold around your jaws and tongue. If you try to talk, all that comes out is blood because your larynx and neck are gone. Then a slowly creeping feeling of icy darkness comes over you, and you die. (Sharp blades)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Further on, we learn that if we throw ourselves in front of a train, it means that ‘… a trash bag will be used to collect your body parts and ripped up organs’ (Throwing Yourself In Front of a Vehicle). And drinking bleach will ‘… eat away your stomach lining and intestines, and you’ll die of internal bleeding’ (Chemicals).</p>
<p>Readers are also invited to turn their voluntary death into a pure, artistic act, as is made clear in the following quote:
<disp-quote>
<p>This method is a variation of jumping off a bridge, but more on the artistic side. You need a high bridge, rope, and piano wire.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<list id="list3-1461444811425221" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Cut the rope and piano wires into various lengths. Each length must not exceed the height of the bridge.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Tie one end of the ropes and piano wires to the bridge.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Tie the other ends of the ropes to different parts of your body, such as thighs, calves, torso, etc.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>After that, tie the piano wires around your joints. (Do not forget your genitals …).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>When you then jump from the bridge, different parts of your body will be cut off because of the loops of piano wire, and your body parts will be left dangling in mid-air, suspended by the ropes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If you do it right, you’ll end up with just your torso hanging from the neck over the sea, highway or ground.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If you are lucky, someone will photograph you, and you’ll be immortalised as a work of art. (Jumping From Heights)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Morbid violence can be understood in the context of a modern tradition of horror-based media content, a ‘… dark, negative reaction to modern society’s official, optimistic depiction of itself’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1461444811425221">Gripsrud, 1993</xref>: 227, 228). Gothic literature in the 1700s and 1800s, early horror movies from the first half of the 20th century, and splatter and gore films from the 1960s onwards, can all be seen as protests against the modern project, where individual drives, both aggressive and sexual, must be disciplined and sublimated for the survival of civilized, rational bourgeois society.</p>
<p>In a similar manner, the morbid methods described in the Swedish Suicide Guide express what the dominant culture attempts to suppress and prohibit. And it is precisely here that the challenge lies, both on an individual level, and socially and culturally. In the construction and interpretation of morbid and violent imagery, aggressive (and perhaps sexual) impulses can be allowed to find release, the ‘prohibited’ drives find, so to speak, an outlet in fiction, and the boundaries of cultural and moral forbidden territory may be breached. In general, the expressions of violence and morbidity can be seen as a total rejection of cultural and societal demands for the discipline and sublimation of instincts, opposing everything the dominant culture finds sacred.</p>
<p>Morbidity in the form of a fascination for body parts, blood and other body fluids can also be understood in terms of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1461444811425221">Kristeva’s (1982)</xref> descriptions of the concept <italic>abject</italic>: that which once belonged to the body, but has been cast off into the world. The abject exists, then, in the gap between subject and object, something that once belonged to the living but no longer does so. The idea of the abject should be considered in the light of the creation of the subject, a process whereby we must separate, and dispose of, a part of ourselves; namely, the mother,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1461444811425221">8</xref></sup> in order to construct an identity and a separate self. What we cast off can also be something we wish to retain, which gives an indication of the ambivalence of the process of abjection. The abject, therefore, is frightening and traumatic to us because it has been cast out of the symbolic order, that which was once familiar and recognizable, but has now become alien and unfamiliar. For example, the dead body is perceived as repulsive, alien and frightening, the once living subject having been violently cast out of the cultural world, thus raising thoughts and feelings about our own mortality. Dead bodies, severed limbs, blood, decay and bodily secretions are experienced as alien, repugnant and disgusting, constituting in this way the subject as a living being in the symbolic order. The abject can still exert an attraction because it awakens fantasies about the limitless, fluid state of symbiosis with the mother, a state of complete relaxation and satisfaction, far beyond the responsibilities we are forced to take as subjects. This sheds light on why morbid and repulsive depictions can also exert an attraction: they awaken an original desire, original pleasure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1461444811425221">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>In summary, the descriptions of suicide and death are thus tools for distinguishing the self and the group from the worldview of the dominant culture. Although construction of the pro-suicide approach can in many ways be seen as a destructive activity, it does, at the same time, constitute a meaningful and sense-making activity for its protagonists.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1461444811425221">
<title>Irony</title>
<p>The Swedish Suicide Guide is characterized by recurring ironic passages, for example, attempting suicide by drinking one’s own urine: ‘The method is as effective as it sounds. Not at all. … You are just as likely to die from drinking your own urine as getting high from dried and powdered banana peels and coffee’ (Myths). This is obviously in stark contrast to the usual way of discussing suicide, where irony and humour are rarely appropriate. Another example is uranium: ‘There’s nothing to recommend it, unless you’re lucky and there’s a Third World War and we all die from nuclear bombardment’ (Metals). As for the descriptions linked to drugs, ironic comments are frequent, such as whether or not to drink methanol: ‘At least you can get drunk during the attempt …’ (Narcotics/Drugs).</p>
<p>In the present context, the use of irony probably serves two primary purposes. The first is to create a distance ‘outwards’, to distinguish oneself from the authoritarian and ‘serious’ approach to suicide based on dominant social values. The second is to create a distance ‘inwards’, to distance oneself from the often strong feelings associated with suicide, which otherwise might threaten to take over. Expressed slightly differently, irony is being used to ‘laugh off’ the otherwise serious and problematic atmosphere surrounding the subject.</p>
<p>Using irony and humour to talk about suicide becomes part of a process by which those who know the codes and can ‘read’ the style are bound together in a counter-discursive context, while ‘the others’ are left out by what is perceived as a repulsive and outlawed way of describing acts of suicide.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1461444811425221">
<title>Reversal</title>
<p>An additional theme that can be detected in the Swedish Suicide Guide is the use of words and expressions linked with death, whose meaning is the reversal of current language use. For example, the word ‘chance’ is given a reverse meaning in: ‘… the chance of dying is small … increasing your chances of dying …’ (Animals). On the whole, survival is perceived as something negative, contradicting common cultural beliefs about life and death. Under the heading ‘Poisons’, ‘surviving more than 3–5 days usually means a recovery’ will, based on the logic of the Guide, be seen as a failure. Similarly, it is bad if someone ‘attempts to resuscitate you’ (Oxygen Loss). If one survives a fall or jump from a height, one has ‘very bad luck’ (Jumping From Heights). Warnings are given, not for what we can die from, but, on the contrary, what cannot kill us: ‘LSD … is NOT fatal!’ (Narcotics/Drugs).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ‘never waking up again’ (Oxygen Loss) is judged as highly desirable. It is also positive when ‘the chances of dying are 100 per cent’ (Suicide That Looks Accidental/Parachuting), and firearms should ‘hopefully blow away the back of your head’ (Weapons). To ‘hope for the best’ (Poisons) when we find ourselves in dangerous situations or conditions usually means a reassurance of continued life and health, but here ‘hoping for the best’ is synonymous with death. Most of us, when ill or badly wounded, would like to be cared for by medical professionals, but contrary to this we find the following reasoning: ‘Mortality is 100 per cent if you manage to keep the doctor away’ (Food and Drink).</p>
<p>By the reverse use of language, the Swedish Suicide Guide positions itself as deviating from socially and culturally dominant ways of communicating about suicide and death.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1461444811425221">
<title>Absence</title>
<p>When a central aspect of a subject matter is clearly subordinated or completely absent, analysing what this absence might stand for can be enlightening. There are two key aspects that I intend to touch on briefly. The first is that the Swedish Suicide Guide’s extensive content only incidentally addresses the question of <italic>why</italic> people commit suicide; that is, what the <italic>causal relationships</italic> are. This issue is often central in other contexts where suicide is discussed. So why neglect this in a publication entirely dedicated to suicide? Again, it is probably due to its oppositional stance. Research and debate about the causes of suicidal acts are considered to belong to the dominant preventive approach, which is why the Swedish Suicide Guide simply refrains from addressing them. Rather, the focus is entirely on individuals’ right to kill themselves. The motive behind any suicidal act is seen as something very private, which no psychiatrist, psychologist, politician, scientist or neighbour has the right to interfere with. If, for one reason or another, a person decides to commit suicide, then this is seen as a human right, not a problem. Explicit discussions and explanations about possible underlying causes, such as depression, substance abuse, social exclusion or bullying, might puncture the individualistic and non-problematized explanatory model of suicide on which the Swedish Suicide Guide is based.</p>
<p>The second question is the notable absence of emotional aspects. Almost all conversations and discussions regarding suicide, both intimately private and public, contain a more or less central emotional dimension. But this is missing in the Swedish Suicide Guide. There are, of course, descriptions of how difficult it can be to carry out a certain method, such as steeling oneself against the discomfort and pain of cutting oneself deep enough, or how to avoid panicking when you no longer have air to breathe, but this is an expression of an instrumentalist approach rather than an emotional one. The guide does not touch on the extremely strong feelings of sadness, anger, shame, despair and self-hatred that are so closely associated with suicidal ideas, plans, and ultimately, suicidal acts. Often it is exactly the desire to escape from these overwhelming destructive and emotional experiences that lies behind the acts being carried out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461444811425221">Baumeister, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>The absence of emotional issues can be interpreted in terms of what was previously noted about causes; focus on emotional aspects would threaten to destroy the largely non-problem-oriented approach to suicide displayed by the guide. Furthermore, this absence can be seen as an expression of the masculinity that the Swedish Suicide Guide in many ways represents. In Western culture, intimacy, emotion and dependency are often associated with femininity; this threatens the masculine order and must be avoided. Instead, as we have seen, the texts in the Swedish Suicide Guide use imagery that is individualistic, instrumental, scientific, technological and violent; namely properties highly associated with masculinity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1461444811425221">10</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section13-1461444811425221" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The pro-suicide content on the Swedish Suicide Guide is produced in opposition to socially dominant attitudes on the subject of suicide. It can even be extended as a critique of the whole of society and its institutions. The view put forward is that social institutions pose a threat to what are considered absolute rights of the individual. The individual has few, if any, responsibilities towards others; he or she answers only to themselves. All forms of legislation, regulation or other institutional involvement in people’s lives are solely evil. These strongly individualist, anti-social currents have their roots in Western cultural and civilizational history; they have been incorporated into, and, to an extent, reformulated in the pro-suicide counter-discourse on the internet. It is still a loaded issue in our society to question the primacy or sanctity of life. To advocate the individual’s ‘right’ to take matters into their own hands and end their life is used by those representing the pro-suicide view as an effective weapon in the struggle against society’s established morals and values.</p>
<p>In the analysis, I also argued that the contents should be seen as a masculine construction, and as a construction of masculinity. The repetition of technical, chemical and anatomic details, the expression of honourable and clearly individualistic ideals, the descriptions of morbid violence towards the body, the absence of emotions – all this could be said to represent a kind of constructed Western masculinity (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1461444811425221">Jensen, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>On a social and cultural level, the morbid depictions of the lacerated body in the Swedish Suicide Guide reflect an increasingly radicalized preoccupation with our bodies, which mainly stems from a kind of late modernity death fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1461444811425221">Gripsrud, 1993</xref>: 242). We are surrounded by instructions about how to transform our imperfect bodies through diet and weight-loss, exercise, medications, make-up and, ultimately, surgery. Ideally, our bodies should look eternally young: we are <italic>not allowed</italic> to grow old; we are <italic>not allowed</italic> to die. The trend focusing on the body, and health, represents an extension of modernity’s endeavour to rationalize: to exercise dominion over Nature – and thus over the body –through control and manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1461444811425221">Gripsrud, 1993</xref>: 244). Even strongly self-destructive behaviour, like anorexia and self-harm, can be said to be part of this process of mastery over the body. From what was previously something that <italic>is</italic>, the body has now been transformed into something that <italic>becomes</italic>, something we ourselves possess and can re-make, leading to an (extreme) contemporary belief in what can best be termed as <italic>the procedural body</italic>, ever ready to be changed, or preserved, depending on current trends, requirements and ideals. Expressions of morbidity – the wounded, the dissolved – are emerging as a violent comment on this obsession with the body, where suicide can be said to represent the final destruction.</p>
<p>Death has increasingly become a taboo subject, in addition to, <italic>de facto</italic>, constituting an absolute existential limit. In the modern age, the treatment of death and the dead has been transferred from intimate everyday life to become an instrumental activity undertaken by social institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1461444811425221">Bauman, 1992</xref>). Death is now more diffuse and absent for most people. This distancing may perhaps be interpreted as an era’s difficulty in accepting the ultimate conditions of being <italic>human-in-the-world</italic>. The preoccupation with death and suicide in the Swedish Suicide Guide exceeds the limits of the taboos of our time, challenging the boundaries both of society and the self.</p>
<p>So why, in a broader sense, do people produce and publish content about the ‘best’ ways to take one’s own life? What are the underlying motivations? I suggest that the preoccupation with mediated violence, mutilation and death on websites like Swedish Suicide Guide can be said to fulfil at least two, partly linked, purposes:</p>
<list id="list4-1461444811425221" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Identity gain</italic>: identity is forged both exclusively (what I am not, and don’t wish to be – where I don’t belong) and inclusively (what I am, or want to be – where I belong). By reacting against the values and views of the dominant culture on the subject of suicide, and producing alternative ones, the websites position themselves as something distinguishably ‘different’. This difference assists in the construction of a special, recognisable identity.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Acting-out of aggressive impulses</italic>: notions of violence, physical self-harm, suicide and death also enable individuals to release and act out impulses of an aggressive nature, which are suppressed in our culture.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>It is crucial to understand the production of the pro-suicide content as a manifestation of what, for the producer, is a meaningful process. This may seem contradictory when it concerns a fundamentally (symbolic) violent activity, with possibly serious consequences for vulnerable individuals who seek out these kinds of websites and are offered information about suicide methods, along with the message that suicide is an acceptable solution to life’s problems. Likewise, the reasons why the pro-suicide content is produced and made publicly available may be found in the meaning and identity-constructive role it fulfils for the producers. The understanding of what is ‘reasonable’ does not presuppose that an act needs to contribute something good or constructive to the socio-cultural environment. So, paradoxically, this production and preoccupation with violence, death and suicide ultimately concerns the aspiration to create meaning and purpose in life.</p>
<p>Through the expansion of the internet, people with a pro-suicide agenda have found new ways of formulating and reformulating their messages, new ways of reaching out to different audiences. Thereby, the struggle between the pro-suicide and the suicide preventive discourses could be said to have intensified. In the longer term, this could lead to a certain loosening of the power and control of social institutions over the subject of suicide.</p>
<p>A limitation with this study is that it only discusses the production of pro-suicide content on one website on the internet. However, as mentioned in the Method and Material section, pro-suicide websites show many similarities in their descriptions of suicide methods and their opposition against dominant values and beliefs about suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1461444811425221">Westerlund and Wasserman, 2009</xref>). Another limitation is that this study exclusively analyses the unidirectional, monological form of communication. On interactive internet forums where discussions about suicide take place, different voices and different views may be heard on this problematical, taboo subject. Studies with this focus can expand understanding in this complex and challenging field (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1461444811425221">Ozawa-De Silva, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1461444811425221">2010</xref>).</p>

<p>In Sweden, as in most contemporary societies, suicide is still a taboo subject. However, awareness of the topic, as well as suicide prevention measures, is relatively widespread and well-developed. After an increase in suicide rates during the 1960s and 1970s, the number of deaths by suicide has steadily decreased. Today, Swedish suicide rates can be described as medium–high in a European perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1461444811425221">NASP, 2011</xref>).</p>

In order to answer this, one first needs to distinguish between ‘male’ and ‘masculine’. ‘Violence’, a social category, is more or less automatically linked to ‘male’, which is a biological category, and this hides the fact that violence is a social and historical construction. In this way, violence appears to be something ‘natural’ that men as biological beings do; violence is thus reified. Of great importance, therefore, is to distinguish between the biological category of ‘male’ and the socio-culturally created category of ‘masculine’.</p>
