<p>Patrick Devine-Wright’s <italic>Renewable Energy and the Public: From NIMBY to Participation</italic> takes a broad, multidisciplinary approach to the issue of public engagement for renewable energy projects. A multitude of contributors offer a variety of theoretical and empirical analyses of the issue, all of which support Devine-Wright’s core argument that traditional means of conceptualizing public and stakeholder positions on renewable energy are overly simplistic, and public engagement processes based on these depictions are insufficient for pursuing the goal of increased renewable energy use in a fair and democratic way.</p>
<p>Devine-Wright’s introduction discusses the importance of renewable energy in the context of the growing threat of global climate change and notes that while public support for renewable energy in the abstract is typically quite high, specific renewable energy projects are often met with staunch local opposition. This paradox is often attributed to NIMBY (“not in my backyard”) responses by those who would be affected by the proposed projects, which Devine-Wright considers to be an inaccurate depiction of the complex nature of public response to renewable energy projects. He argues that traditional technocratic planning approaches (the “decide-announce-defend” model) can be blamed for much of the public resistance to renewable energy projects, and advocates alternative “analytic-deliberative methods” that engage the public much earlier in the decision-making process to reduce “public skepticism, mistrust, and opposition” (p. xxiii). He then segues into the body of the book by suggesting that further social science research is needed to both enhance our understanding of public responses to renewable energy projects and inform industry leaders and policy-makers on the proper use of public participation to increase community acceptance.</p>
<p>The book is divided into two distinct sections, the first of which includes five conceptual analyses of the public engagement issue. Walker et al. (chapter 1) begin by arguing that the actions of the public in the engagement process are far more complex than mere NIMBY-ism and are shaped by a combination of factors including the nature of their interactions with renewable energy technology actors, preexisting expectations about the proposed technology and/or approval process, national and subnational policy contexts, and the applicable business and economic context. Likewise, they argue, the actions of renewable energy technology actors—project proponents and public sector stakeholders—are also influenced by their interactions with the public and their expectations of the public’s response. Walker and Cass (chapter 4) also challenge the traditional understanding of the role of local communities in the engagement process, noting that given the dramatic range of scales, physical locations, and types of technology involved, it is increasingly difficult to classify individuals or the public at large as having a concise, easily defined viewpoint on renewable energy. Barry and Ellis (chapter 3) go a step farther by arguing that the traditional depiction of the public response to renewable energy projects as involving two oppositional factions is overly simplistic, antidemocratic, and counterproductive to the goal of increasing the use of those technologies. They characterize the range of public opinions as falling into a continuum between absolute rejection and complete acceptance, and suggest that public engagement processes should accept this plurality of different views while encouraging conflicting parties to recognize the legitimacy of their opponents’ views.</p>
<p>Among the chapters in this first section, Haggett (chapter 2) provides the most specific detail on the role of public engagement in planning practice. She describes three types of engagement that occur in the United Kingdom: “information provision,” as part of the traditional “decide-announce-defend” approach to public engagement; “consultation” or dialogue between the public and project developers; and “deliberation,” in which the public participates in making plans and/or policies in the first place (pp. 17-18). Devine-Wright concludes this section by arguing against the traditional conceptualization of proposed project locations as either “sites” for development or “backyards” for project opponents. As an alternative, he proposes that public engagement should seek to identify and define the community’s sense of place, including the specific attachments made to different parts of the region, so that project developers, community members, and other stakeholders can work together to “emplace” renewable energy projects in a way that is sensitive to local understandings of the history and culture of the area (p. 66).</p>
<p>The second section of the book includes fifteen empirical studies of various aspects of public engagement for renewable energy development. The first four (chapters 6-9) describe how these engagement processes are depicted by the media, how they are conceptualized by project proponents, and how they are evaluated and interpreted by the stakeholders who participate in them. The remaining eleven chapters analyze public responses to a variety of proposed renewable energy projects or programs, from large wind and wave energy facilities to building-scale photovoltaic systems, focusing primarily on the United Kingdom but also including examples from the Netherlands, Australia, the United States, and Brazil. Several of these chapters explore dimensions of the “renewable energy and the public” theme, such as how citizens perceive and interact with different renewable energy technologies, that are interesting and informative but less directly relevant to planning procedures or associated public engagement practices. An exception that may be of particular interest to planners is Pasqualetti and Schartz’s review of the public engagement process for the permitting of the Solana Generating Plant concentrated solar power (CSP) project in Arizona (chapter 12), which they characterize as a public value failure because of the lack of engagement of rural residents from the affected community, transparency in the initial stages of project development, and opportunity for the public to influence long-term planning for the role of CSP in Arizona’s future power portfolio.</p>
<p>In his conclusions, Devine-Wright discusses the two roles that social science can play in assisting the transition to increased renewable energy use: to monitor and evaluate actual engagement processes and propose improvements in future practice and to critique current understandings of and approaches to community engagement. The book performs well in this latter role, as several chapters eloquently and persuasively challenge the prevailing assumption of public opposition to renewable energy projects as NIMBY-ism and the underlying deficit model of public knowledge with respect to energy issues. However, the resulting recommendations for practice often lack specificity, and the book stops shorts of identifying the policy changes needed to effectively implement these recommendations.</p>
<p>Devine-Wright warns against the streamlining of permitting processes, which he argues could increase public mistrust and opposition and thus slow down or halt the approval of projects. Instead, he recommends a more analytical, deliberative approach to participation that involves the public in decisions about the “<italic>where</italic>” of renewable energy development, not just a discussion of “<italic>what</italic> is developed and <italic>how</italic> it is deployed” (p. 58). Another recommendation, which appears throughout the book, is for planning practices that reflect sensitivity to local communities’ attachment to place, including the value and meaning attached to local topographical features. Another prevailing theme is that local renewable energy proposals should be framed in the context of global energy supply and climate change problems, and pitched to local communities as their contribution to a larger energy transition. Along those lines, Barry and Ellis (chapter 3) suggest that local communities should be able to choose their own manner of contribution from an array of efficiency, conservation, and renewable energy options.</p>
<p>But how exactly can these recommendations be carried out? What specific engagement practices would accomplish these objectives, and how can renewable energy policy or spatial planning and permitting procedures be adjusted to allow this type of engagement? Some of the book’s specific suggestions are already fairly common in planning practice, such as Ashworth et al.’s recommendation for scenario-based group discussions (chapter 10). Others are delivered in rather general terms, such as Haggett’s (chapter 2) recommendations for planning processes that place a value on local knowledge, account for the importance of local identity and sense of place, and engage the full range of interests within the community. In Chapter 5, Devine-Wright does describe some specific techniques for “public engagement with place attachments and place identifies in mind” (p. 67) but does not identify the policies needed to allow or require this type of engagement. Only Haggett (chapter 2) and Upham(chapter 20) provide detailed discussions of the policy implications of their findings, both noting that United Kingdom’s 2008 Planning Act moved away from local decision making for large-scale energy and other infrastructure projects, with uncertain consequences for public engagement.</p>
<p>Ultimately, many of the book’s recommendations may not be possible under existing policies, which in many countries leave the “where” part of large-scale renewable energy siting decisions to the private sector. In current practice, private corporations identify proposed locations based on their profit potential and then undertake a “decide-announce-defend” public engagement model to obtain the necessary permits. This book identifies many problems with that model, and planners and policy makers will find value in its critiques of the current approach to public engagement for renewable energy and in the concepts of improved public engagement that it promotes. To put these recommendations into practice, planners and policy makers will have to devise comprehensive planning strategies for renewable energy development that involve the public in broader decisions about the types of areas where large-scale renewable energy projects should or should not be allowed, the criteria that should be applied when reviewing permit applications for such facilities, and the types of mitigation measures that should be taken to minimize the negative impacts of these facilities on neighboring communities.</p>
