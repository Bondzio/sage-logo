<abstract>
<p>The racial profiling controversy is now about a decade and a half old and has developed into a bona fide research agenda. Hundreds of police departments have conducted studies and scores of researchers have written articles and books on the topic. The controversy came to prominence during a high-profile litigation involving the New Jersey State Police. Since then, with the exception of a few local cases, the courts have been relatively silent at the national level. Even so, a litigation pattern is beginning to emerge. This article documents this pattern and provides evidence that racial profiling litigation is likely to increase in the very near future.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Within the past 15 years, the racial profiling controversy has developed into a distinct research agenda, and continues to capture the attention of social commentators, politicians, advocacy groups, scholars, policing practitioners, and of course attorneys. Hundreds of police agencies have conducted racial profiling studies. More than half the states require police departments to routinely record information about the stops they make, most notably information about the race and ethnicity of the drivers. The racial profiling controversy, which began within the context of traffic stops, is encroaching into other areas like, transportation security, shoplifting, immigration and quality of life enforcement.</p>
<p>It was inevitable that racial profiling allegations would eventually become a central issue in litigation. Initially, the controversy found its voice and place in the American lexicon when a New Jersey judge commissioned a study to determine whether state troopers working on the New Jersey Turnpike were guilty of racial profiling (<italic>State of New Jersey v. Pedro Soto</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1043986211425731">1996</xref>). Although similar cases have arisen in other states, the most common racial profiling litigant today is a criminal defendant who alleges racial profiling (e.g., a violation of the 14th Amendment) as the motivation for a traffic stop that led to a search and seizure of contraband (see for example, <italic>United States v. Alcaraz-Arellano</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1043986211425731">2004</xref>; <italic>United States v. Lindsey</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1043986211425731">2003</xref>; and <italic>United States v. Mesa-Roche</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1043986211425731">2003</xref>). The central legal issue in most of these cases is whether the police enforced the law “to the benefit of all members of society” or placed racial minorities at a “special disadvantage” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043986211425731">Tomaskovic-Devey, Mason, &amp; Zingraff, 2004</xref>, p. 4). This body of litigation has not yet produced a consistent pattern on which future litigants can rely, however, there is enough of an emerging pattern to reveal several important trends.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to evaluate the effectiveness of racial profiling litigation. By “effectiveness,” we mean from the plaintiff’s perspective. In general, we ask to what extent are individuals or groups alleging racial profiling successful in the courthouse? The article begins with an instructive typology offered as means to organize the rather robust racial and ethnic discrimination litigation history that is relevant to the racial profiling controversy. Although there has been considerable litigation on racial discrimination, much of this is only tangentially related to the racial profiling controversy. Following this, our analysis is organized with respect to the laws or regulations that either have been or most likely could be the basis of a racial profiling lawsuit. Within each section we discuss: (a) what this body of law or regulation allows and/or requires a litigant to claim; (b) how this particular body of law or regulation might be used as the basis of a racial profiling claim; (c) the outcome of litigation (so far) based on this law or regulation; and (d) the challenges the litigants either overcame or failed to overcome when making their claims. In the next to last section, we summarize the factors that appear to differentiate between “successful” and “unsuccessful” racial profiling cases, from the plaintiff’s perspective. This section also includes a brief discussion on the litigation trends that might improve a plaintiff’s success. We conclude with some predictions relating to the future of racial profiling litigation within the context of the Obama Administration’s desire to focus the attention of the U.S. Department of Justice on this important controversy.</p>

<title>Analysis of Prior Litigation Related to the Racial Profiling Controversy</title>
<p>There has been considerable litigation over the past half century relating to racial and ethnic discrimination. Within the contexts of hiring, education, housing, lending, and many others, plaintiffs have attempted to prove they were discriminated against, either purposively or disparately, because of their race or ethnicity. Although this body of law is undeniably robust, it is only tangentially relevant to the racial profiling controversy. Here are the most relevant cases.</p>
<p>From the case law prior to the advent of the racial profiling controversy (circa 1996) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043986211425731">Smith and Alpert (2002)</xref> found and categorized several cases that are the most relevant to racial profiling litigation. First, the courts have consistently ruled that the police may not stop individuals on the basis of race or ethnicity alone. In <italic>United States v. Brignoni-Ponce</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1043986211425731">1975</xref>) the supreme court ruled that Hispanic-looking men driving near the border did not by itself provide the legal grounds for a traffic stop. Later in <italic>United States v. Jones</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1043986211425731">2001</xref>) the Court ruled that the police did not have the legal grounds to stop a car occupied by four Black men on the basis of an anonymous tip that four Black men were drinking and acting disorderly in an area near where the stop occurred. Second, the courts generally allow officers to consider race if used in combination with other factors to establish probable cause for a stop. The supreme court in <italic>Brown v. City of Oneonta</italic> (1999) and <italic>United States v Martinez-Fuente</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1043986211425731">1976</xref>) ruled that the police may use race as one of several physical descriptors when searching for a known suspect. In the absence of a known suspect, court decisions are mixed on whether race can be used as part of a series of probable indicators of criminal activity. In <italic>United States v. Montero-Camaro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1043986211425731">2000</xref>) the court upheld a stop involving Hispanics because they <italic>also</italic> turned around to avoid a stationary U.S. Border Patrol check station. Finally, the police may not use race alone as a basis for conducting, or attempting to conduct, consensual interviews and searches. The courts allow officers to consider race if other factors can be articulated to establish reasonable suspicion (<italic>United States v. Travis</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1043986211425731">1995</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1043986211425731">
<title>Analysis of Actual and Potential Litigation Within the Context of the Racial Profiling Controversy</title>
<p>From the plaintiff’s perspective, the most successful racial profiling cases are <italic>State of New Jersey v. Pedro Soto</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1043986211425731">1996</xref>) and <italic>Maryland State Conference of NAACP Branches v. Maryland State Police Department</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043986211425731">2008</xref>). The <italic>Soto</italic> case is discussed more completely in a later section. The Maryland case involved William Berry, a North Carolina National Guardsman pulled over in 1996, and five other plaintiffs, including the American Civil Liberties Union. This case was settled out of court in 2008, with Maryland agreeing to pay the six plaintiffs US$400,000. The plaintiffs in both cases were successful at proving that their race or ethnicity influenced the police officer’s decision to stop them. Because these cases were class actions, they resulted in sweeping procedural changes within the affected department. For the most part, however, litigants claiming to be victims of racial profiling are much less successful. As discussed in the following sections, most litigants are hampered by their inability to measure the comparative context within which they are stopped (thereby unable to prove they were disparately treated) and/or prove the extent to which their race or ethnicity influenced a police officer’s decision.</p>
<sec id="section4-1043986211425731">
<title>Challenges Based on the Fourth Amendment</title>
<p>The Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. The Amendment stipulates that, “no Warrants shall issue, but on probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be searched.” Plaintiffs alleging a violation of their Fourth Amendment right must prove that the police conducted the search or seizure unreasonably or without probable cause.</p>
<p>It is not inherently clear whether the Fourth Amendment can be an effective legal remedy for racial profiling litigants. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043986211425731">Oliver (2000)</xref> argues that the Fourth Amendment could be appropriate for limiting suspicionless searches if the courts required officers to (a) inform citizens of their right to refuse consent to conduct a search, and (b) articulate their reasonable suspicion for requesting a consent search. The first requirement would effectively <italic>Mirandize</italic> the consent search process. The second requirement might deter police officers’ “fishing expeditions” predicated on the consent exception. So far, no court has adopted such requirements.</p>
<p>Writing 2 years prior to the <italic>Whren</italic> decision (<italic>Whren et al. v. United States</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1043986211425731">1996</xref>, the leading decision in the racial profiling controversy), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043986211425731">Magee (1994)</xref> noted the inadequacy of the Fourth Amendment and its corollary exclusionary rule to protect minorities against unreasonable searches. Briefly, the exclusionary rule “provides that any evidence obtained by the government in violation of the Fourth Amendment guarantee against unreasonable search and seizure is not admissible in a criminal prosecution to prove guilt.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043986211425731">del Carmen, 1998</xref>, p. 81). This rule provides substantial motivation for police officers to adhere to the Constitution. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043986211425731">Magee (1994)</xref> argues that the supreme court is deliberately blind to how race affects a police officer’s motivation and is therefore not willing to expand the Fourth Amendment’s protections to include searches based on race.</p>
<p>The <italic>Whren</italic> decision effectively closed the door to a Fourth Amendment remedy for racial profiling victims. The supreme court held that the temporary detention of a motorist based on an officer’s probable cause to believe that he violated the traffic law does not violate the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures, even if a reasonable officer would not have stopped the motorist in the absence of an additional law enforcement objective. In effect, the court applied an objective test and ruled that as long as the officer had an objective and bona fide reason to stop a motorist, even if the reason was a pretext, then any subsequent search or seizure does not violate the Fourth Amendment, assuming of course the officer does not offend the Constitution in some other objective way subsequent to the initial contact. It does not make any difference whether the officers, by virtue of their assignment, would have, might have, or should have stopped the motorist; the fact is—they could have. An ulterior or even pretextual motive for the stop does not make it illegal under the Fourth Amendment.</p>
<p>The court’s application of an objective or reasonable officer standard is critical to the racial profiling controversy. When applying this test, the court needed only to establish whether the officers had the legal justification to stop the car. In this case, they did because the driver violated two traffic laws. This objective test was first applied in <italic>United States v. Smith</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1043986211425731">1986</xref>). The use of the objective standard is quite advantageous to police officers. Because traffic laws are so numerous and frequently violated, a potential legal justification for a stop is as broad and varied as the traffic code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043986211425731">Bast, 1997</xref>). Second, the level of coercion used by officers during a stop to conduct a more thorough search is not relevant when the objective standard is applied. This may effectively negate the Fourth Amendment protection, particularly for minorities, because the test does not account for the different perceptions of the police between racial groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043986211425731">Cole, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The supreme court in <italic>Whren</italic> could have applied a subjective test to determine the legality of the stop and subsequent search. Using this test, the court would have more comprehensively questioned the officers’ motives. For example, using this test the Court in <italic>Whren</italic> might have asked the officers why they, as vice officers, felt it was so necessary to conduct a traffic stop. Had the court applied a subjective test, then it is likely that it would have likely ruled in favor of the plaintiffs because the officers freely admitted that they had no probable cause to initiate the stop and subsequent search based on a narcotics violation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043986211425731">O’Reilly, 2002</xref>). Unfortunately, there is really no way to know. Furthermore, it may very well be true that the totality of events surrounding a police/citizen contact have a way of sharpening an officer’s ability to articulate reasonable suspicion and probable cause. In other words, the ability to separate what the officer was thinking prior to the stop from what the officer may have learned during the stop may often be limited.</p>
<p>Although the <italic>Whren</italic> decision may have removed the possibility for a Fourth Amendment challenge to pretextual stops, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1043986211425731">Thompson (1999)</xref> argues that it may be too soon to dismiss it as a source of relief for racial profiling victims. In <italic>Whren</italic>, the court declared that the racial motivation of an officer is “categorically irrelevant to Fourth Amendment analysis” (p. 981), effectively preventing a future court from considering how an officer’s racial bias affects his perception of an individual’s tendency for criminal behavior. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1043986211425731">Thompson (1999)</xref> argues this decision ignores the social science evidence suggesting police officers perceive race differently and that racial stereotypes are deeply ingrained in the police subculture.</p>
<p>Post-<italic>Whren</italic>, the adjudication primarily hinges on the objective test of whether the officer had reasonable suspicion to make the traffic stop and/or probable cause for an arrest and search incident to that arrest. The courts consistency rule that searches subsequent to the initial stop are legal if the individual was stopped for a legitimate reason (e.g., a traffic violation). This, of course, assumes the absence of a separate Constitutional violation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043986211425731"><italic>Arkansas v. Sullivan</italic>, 2001</xref>; <italic>Atwater v. Lago Vista</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043986211425731">2001</xref>; <italic>United States v. Franklin</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1043986211425731">2008</xref>; <italic>United States v. Ross</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1043986211425731">2008</xref>; <italic>Virginia v. Moore</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1043986211425731">2008</xref>). The rulings I these cases suggest that the courts have no wish to revisit the <italic>Whren</italic> decision.</p>

<sec id="section5-1043986211425731">
<title>Terry Rule Searches</title>
<p>In 1968, the supreme court provided the police with an important enforcement tool—the stop and frisk. The <italic>Terry</italic> rule allows officers to conduct warrantless searches in the absence of probable cause for the narrow purpose of officer safety. The leading case is <italic>Terry v. Ohio</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1043986211425731">1968</xref>). Briefly, here are the facts. At 2:30 am on October 31, 1963, a police detective noticed two men in downtown Cleveland who appeared to be “casing” a store. Several times, each of the two men independently looked into the store’s window and returned to the corner to confer. The detective confronted the men and asked for identification. Receiving none, he conducted a cursory “pat-down” search, or frisk, and whereupon found both men to be carrying handguns illegally. The men were convicted of the weapons violations. On appeal, the defendants argued that the search was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. Specifically, they alleged that the detectives did not have probable cause to believe a crime had been or was about to occur. There was no way the detective could have suspected, much less had probable cause, that the men possessed weapons. The court disagreed and ruled that an investigatory stop such as this is not equivalent to an arrest. Furthermore the Court ruled that the police need only a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity to conduct a cursory search. Specifically, the court allowed such searches in situations wherein the officer feels they are necessary to insure his safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043986211425731">Davis 1997</xref>). This means that the search must be limited to items that could threaten an officer’s safety, like a handgun or knife. In a later case (<italic>Minnesota v. Dickerson</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1043986211425731">1993</xref>), the court ruled against the police when their frisk went beyond that allowed by the <italic>Terry</italic> decision. In this case, the officer conducted a pat-down search. Rather than finding a weapon, the officer felt a small lump in the suspect’s jacket, whereupon he thrust his hand into the pocket and seized a plastic bag containing cocaine. The court ruled the evidence inadmissible because the search went beyond the scope allowed in <italic>Terry</italic>.</p>
<p>Although it may seem that the <italic>Dickerson</italic> decision effectively limits an officer’s authority to search an individual, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043986211425731">Harris (1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043986211425731">2002</xref>) argues that a long line of legal rulings have vastly expanded a police officer’s authority to conduct searches without probable cause. The courts he proposes have “gradually required less and less evidence for a stop and frisk.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043986211425731">Harris, 1994</xref>, p. 660). Harris is particularly critical of the use of factors relating to the location of the search and an officer’s subjective perceptions of “evasive behavior” as justification for stop and frisk searches. The courts tend to defer to the judgment and experience of police officers and allow stop and frisk searches in historically high crime or violent locations. The supreme court has not specifically ruled on whether qualitative factors relating to the location of the search, by themselves, justify a <italic>Terry</italic> search. There are, however, numerous situations in which lower courts have allowed such searches based solely on the justification that they were conducted in a high crime area where the police have ample justification to fear for their safety. Furthermore, the courts tend to defer to an officer’s subjective perception that the suspect engaged in suspicious or evasive behaviors when he became aware of the police presence. At least four courts have ruled that merely avoiding the police is enough justification for a cursory search under the <italic>Terry</italic> rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043986211425731">Harris, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the apparent deference the courts tend to allow police officers in these cases, it does not appear that this particular body of law would be an appropriate basis for a legal challenge of racial profiling. Even so, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043986211425731">Harris (1994)</xref> argues that there are three reasons legally permissible stop and frisk procedures may be particularly harmful to racial and ethnic minorities. First, <italic>Terry</italic> is most often used in pedestrian stops, a predominantly urban issue. Neighborhoods with high population densities within the urban core often have more foot traffic than sparsely populated areas or suburbs. The urban core is also more likely to be disproportionately populated by racial and ethnic minorities. As a result, minorities may be more at risk of being subjected to <italic>Terry</italic> stops. Second, many of the neighborhoods officially characterized as “high crime” are populated primarily by minorities. The police are justifiably deployed in greater numbers in these communities and appear to have more reason to conduct routine stop and frisk searches to insure their personal safety. As a result, residents of these neighborhoods are subjected to more intense police observation and ultimately are more likely to be stopped and frisked. Third, allowing the police to base a cursory search on a subjective perception of “evasive behavior” ignores the reality of the minority experience with the police. Because race is so pervasive an issue in the criminal justice system, minorities as a general rule are more fearful of the police and are more likely to avoid contact with them than nonminorities (see also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043986211425731">Susskind, 1994</xref>). Ultimately, the location and evasion standard results in the disproportionate application of stops and frisks and adversely affects the minority community. “This begins and perpetuates a cycle of mistrust and suspicion, a feeling that law enforcement harasses African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans with <italic>Terry</italic> stops as a way of controlling their communities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043986211425731">Harris, 1994</xref>, p. 660).</p>
<p>The deference that courts give police officers, in terms of subjectively making the determination of suspects’ evasiveness, makes this a relatively difficult basis for attempting to prove racial bias. There are two general types of cases, based on the claim of illegal <italic>Terry</italic> pat-down and frisk defenses. One type occurs in (relatively) high-crime areas, in which the officers are not only disproportionately stationed, but also more cognizant of possible danger. The other occurs in “normal” areas, when an officer, on a routine patrol, notices something “different” about a suspect and investigates. Two recent cases illustrate this point. In <italic>United States v. Lewis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1043986211425731">2000</xref>) the suspect was spotted in the company of other minority juveniles, by two undercover police officers working narcotics in a “problem area” of Lexington, Kentucky. According to later court testimony, the officers thought the African American males were “acting suspiciously” and “looked nervous and frightened.” The officers approached, suspecting drug activity. One of the detectives approached Lewis, standing on the driver’s side of the car with the door open. The detective asked Lewis if he were armed and asked Lewis to show his hands. Lewis kept his hands to his side, and the officer proceeded to pat him down, having concern for his as well as his partner’s safety. The detective found a concealed gun, with ammunition, and informed him he was under arrest. Continuing the search, the detective also found a small amount of crack cocaine and marijuana. The suspect made a motion to suppress based on an illegal search, but the district court found the motion to be without merit, that the officer’s actions were based on reasonable suspicion, and that the pat-down of Lewis was justified based on <italic>Terry</italic></p>
<p>A similar ruling was the result in <italic>Illinois v. Wardlow</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043986211425731">2000</xref>). Wardlow was confronted by a Chicago police officer after he had left an area known for “heavy narcotics trafficking.” The officers stopped Wardlow and then conducted a <italic>Terry</italic>-style pat-down. The officers found a weapon and some ammunition on Wardlow. The court found “no error in the district court’s conclusion that under the <italic>Terry</italic> rationale, the officers in a heavy drug trafficking area . . . had a right, under the circumstances, to conduct a brief, investigatory stop when there was a reasonable, articulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot” (<italic>Wardlow</italic>, 120 S.Ct. at 675 citing <italic>Terry</italic>, 392 U.S. at 30). As previously noted, “high crime areas” are often inadvertently populated primarily by racial or ethnic minority residents. As a result, these residents are subjected to a higher level of police supervision. The police assigned to those areas, cognizant of the dangers associated with working in a high-crime area are more likely to conduct <italic>Terry</italic>-style stop and frisks. Apparently, the “reasonable suspicion” bar necessary for the <italic>Terry</italic> stop and frisk is area dependent, and situated much lower in perceived “drug” or “high-crime” areas.</p>

<p>The Equal Protection Clause of 14th Amendment may be the most likely foundation for a legal remedy to racial profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043986211425731">Garrett, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043986211425731">Kennedy, 1999</xref>). This Amendment states:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This Amendment, ratified after the Civil War, was designed to thwart any attempt by state or local authorities to deny civil rights and protections to certain residents, namely recently freed slaves. Today, the Amendment acts as a conduit through which the civil protections enumerated in the Bill of Rights of the U.S. Constitution are applied equally to all residents of the nation, regardless of the state in which they happen to reside.</p>
<p>The 14th Amendment prohibits any state action (e.g., a police stop, search, or arrest) that discriminates against an individual or group on the basis of race. Police stops that are based solely on race are subject to the strict scrutiny of the court. To survive this scrutiny, the state must demonstrate that the use of race in deciding whom to stop serves a compelling state interest. Furthermore, the state must show that the practice is narrowly tailored to advance that objective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043986211425731">Kennedy, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043986211425731">Susskind, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the court in <italic>Whren</italic> effectively slammed the door on a racial profiling challenge based on the Fourth Amendment, in nearly the same breath, it raised hope that it might consider a challenge to the practice of racial profiling based on the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. To be successful in this challenge, the plaintiff must demonstrate the discriminatory effect of a practice as well as its discriminatory intent. This is not an easy threshold to cross. The legal standard was established in <italic>United States v. Armstrong</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1043986211425731">1966</xref>). In <italic>Armstrong</italic>, a selective prosecution case, the court ruled that the plaintiff has to prove that similarly situated individuals of another race could have been prosecuted, but were not. In a racial profiling case the plaintiff would likely be able to demonstrate the discriminatory effect of police stops based on a comparison between police stop data and an acceptable benchmark. Police stop data, despite their potential for inaccuracy and incompleteness, may be the most accurate measures of who gets stopped, but unless and until the research can accurately measure who doesn’t get stopped, an Equal Protection cause will not likely be successful. The current sophistication of the research simply cannot measure the similarly situated individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043986211425731">Davis, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043986211425731">O’Reilly, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043986211425731">Smith &amp; Alpert, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043986211425731">Susskind, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>The police are likely unwilling to admit that they intentionally target persons because of their race or nationality. Neither is there likely to be a formal written policy encouraging discrimination. As a result, plaintiffs must rely on circumstantial evidence, often in the form of statistical analyses to prove their cases. For example, in <italic>McClesky v. Kemp</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043986211425731">1987</xref>) the court considered the results of a logistical regression of Georgia death penalty cases finding that Black murderers are more likely to receive the death penalty when their victims are White. The court, however, found the evidence insufficient to make a <italic>prima facie</italic> case for racial discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043986211425731">Smith &amp; Alpert, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>No court has yet considered whether or not a profile that includes race as an indicator of potential criminal activity warrants its strict scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043986211425731">Banks, 2001</xref>). In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043986211425731">Harris (1997)</xref> argues that the courts are typically hostile to the use of statistical analyses to demonstrate Constitutional violations. One case however, came very close to meeting the legal and evidentiary requirements of the Equal Protection Clause. Operation Valkyrie was an effort by the Illinois State Police, funded by a federal grant, to identify and interdict drug couriers on the interstate highway system in Illinois. The program became quite effective at seizing large quantities of drugs and assets. In 1994, a class action suit was filed against the state police after the American Civil Liberties Union received numerous complaints from Black and Hispanic motorists alleging the Illinois State Police singled them out for enforcement. The plaintiff’s allegations were based in part on the fact that even though Hispanics represent only 8% of the population and only 3% of the personal car trips, they represent 30% of the motorists stopped on the highways. Furthermore, the plaintiffs alleged that most of the stops were for very minor violations like failing to signal lane changes and speeding from one to four miles over the limit. The plaintiffs alleged that troopers assigned to Operation Valkyrie were two to three times more likely to stop Hispanic motorists than other generally assigned troopers, even on the same highway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043986211425731">Oliver, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The plaintiffs in <italic>Chavez v. Illinois State Police</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043986211425731">2001</xref>) based their equal protection case on two primary databases maintained by the Illinois State Police. The first included information on citations and warnings, and the second included information from field reports completed by troopers (albeit inconsistently) pursuant to contraband seizures, custodial arrests, trooper injuries, and damage to department property. The second database included information on the race and ethnicity of individuals, the first did not. The proportion of Hispanics represented in the citations and warnings database was estimated by searching the name fields for Spanish surnames.</p>
<p>Ultimately the court ruled that the statistical evidence was insufficient to support the first prong (discriminatory effect) of an equal protection case. The data in the citations and warnings database were found to be flawed in that they contained no reliable information on the race or ethnicity of similarly situated individuals. The court specifically discounted the accuracy of using Spanish surnames to estimate the proportion of Hispanic motorists in the database. The field report database did not fare any better. The court found that because the reporting procedures were inconsistent, the field report database was not a representative sample. Even more damaging to this case and others like it, the court found that the benchmark used to estimate the population of individuals subjected to police observation, that is, similarly situated, was based on nearly a decade-old U.S. Census and amended using a broad range study conducted several years prior by the Federal Highway Administration.</p>
<p>The standard which must be met to sustain a winning case is based on equal protection. The plaintiff must demonstrate both the discriminatory <italic>effect</italic> as well as the discriminatory <italic>intent</italic> of a practice. A few later cases have come close to meeting this evidentiary hurdle. The most instructive case is <italic>United States v. Dugue-Nava</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1043986211425731">2004</xref>) Mr. Duque-Nava, a Hispanic, was indicted on various narcotics charges. The defendant moved to suppress the evidence against him basing his argument on an allegation of racial profiling. He had been stopped by a deputy for a traffic violation and a subsequent consent search revealed the illegal narcotics. Duque-Nava’s attorneys used a recently published statewide racial profiling study to compare the deputy’s stops by race against stops made by highway patrol officers working on the same interstate highway. This sufficed, according to the court, to establish the discriminatory effect element required to prove race-based selective enforcement. The court ruled, however, that the statistical study could not be used to establish the second element, discriminatory intent. The statewide study showed that approximately 34% of the deputy’s stops involved Hispanic drivers, whereas only 7% of the stops made by similarly situated<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1043986211425731">1</xref></sup> highway patrol officers involved Hispanic drivers. The court decided that the study was designed to and did measure actual race or ethnicity of motorists stopped, not the officer’s perception of race prior to the stop. In other words, Mr. Duque-Nava could not establish that the deputy knew or could have known the driver’s race or ethnicity prior to the stop.</p>

<sec id="section7-1043986211425731">
<title>Challenges Based on Title 42, U.S.C., Section 1983</title>
<p>The Civil Rights Act of 1871 was passed by the U.S. Congress after the Civil War to deter state-sanctioned racial discrimination and abuse. It was passed during the same political climate that produced the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The provisions of the act relevant to racial profiling are found in Title 42, Section 1983.</p>
<p>Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress, except that in any action brought against a judicial officer for an act or omission taken in such officer’s judicial capacity, injunctive relief shall not be granted unless a declaratory decree was violated or declaratory relief was unavailable. For the purposes of this section, any Act of Congress applicable exclusively to the District of Columbia shall be considered to be a statute of the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>Often referred to as “Section 1983,” the law provides a mechanism for aggrieved parties to receive compensation from state officials and agencies who, within their official capacity, violate their civil rights regardless of whether the actions are sanctioned by statute, policy, or custom. For example, a police officer may be held personally liable if he denies an individual his civil liberties even if he is required to do so in accordance with a bona fide statute or department policy.</p>
<p>This statute may be appropriate for a legal challenge of racial profiling. Plaintiffs could file a Section 1983 case alleging a violation of the Equal Protection Clause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043986211425731">Davis, 1997</xref>) or on the basis of deliberate indifference which is often used when departments fail to properly train officers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043986211425731">O’Reilly, 2002</xref>). In this situation, the plaintiff must prove that the actions of the police caused substantial injury or damage. Certainly traffic stops predicated on nothing more than an officer’s racial prejudice would be enough to prevail in an action of this sort. Unfortunately, even if the plaintiff prevailed, an appropriate compensation would be difficult to establish. The courts generally regard traffic stops as minor inconveniences and have yet to consider the cumulative effect of numerous or frequent stops. A judgment requiring a police officer to stop searching without probable cause would hardly be considered just compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043986211425731">Davis, 1997</xref>). Even in cases where a police officer admits using race in a profile as an indicator of potential criminal behavior and will likely continue to do so, the courts may not necessarily be sympathetic to plaintiffs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1043986211425731">Trende, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, it is unlikely that a police department will promulgate a written policy that explicitly encourages its officers to use race as an indicator of criminal suspiciousness. Instead, the incidence of profiling is more likely the result of “informal” policy, custom, or practice. In this case, the importance of a well executed and interpreted racial profiling study cannot be overstated. Herein may be the answer to why some police chiefs are resistant to voluntarily conducting studies within their jurisdictions. Why collect information that may one day be used against the department?</p>

<sec id="section8-1043986211425731">
<title>Challenges Based on Title 42, U.S.C., Section 14141—Pattern and Practice</title>
<p>The Crime Control Act of 1994 includes a provision making it:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Unlawful for any governmental authority, or agent thereof, or any person acting on behalf of a governmental authority, to engage in a pattern or practice of conduct by law enforcement officers or by officials or employees of any governmental agency with responsibility for the administration of juvenile justice or the incarceration of juveniles that deprives persons of rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The U.S. Attorney General has the exclusive authority to, when given reasonable cause to believe a violation has occurred, initiate a civil action against a police department to obtain appropriate equitable and declaratory relief to eliminate the pattern or practice that offends the Constitution. The types of activities actionable under this statute include, but are not limited to, excessive force, harassment, false arrest, coercive sexual conduct, and unlawful stops, searches, or arrests. Some legal experts propose that Section 14141 may be the most likely manner in which to launch a successful legal challenge of racial profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043986211425731">Huemann &amp; Cassak, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043986211425731">O’Reilly, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Section 14141 cases are different than Section 1983 cases for several reasons. First, Section 14141 cases focus on the entire pattern and practice of an enforcement program and not a single event. As a result, more attention is given to the disparate effects of the department’s policy and procedures. Second, Section 14141 cases must be filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, thereby, eliminating the need to find an individual defendant with an egregious complaint. Third, unlike a suit based on Section 1983, a suit based on Section 14141 can only result in equitable or declaratory relief. This means that actual damages (e.g., cash awards) cannot be awarded to individuals allegedly harmed by the police department’s behavior. Finally, Section 14141 cases are, by statute, heard before a single federal judge. Section 1983 cases can be heard by juries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043986211425731">O’Reilly, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Although it appears that Section 14141 may be the best option for a legal challenge of racial profiling, there are some lingering concerns. First, because of a lack of legislative intent and litigation history some questions exist on the exact meanings of some of the Section’s terms. For example, it is unclear whether an officer that uses a profile based on his personal experience is acting on behalf of his agency. Second, the law specifically uses the plural term <italic>officers</italic>. It is not clear how many officers engaging in such acts would constitute a pattern or practice. For example, would a department be subject to scrutiny under this Section if a few rogue officers engaged in an illegal pattern or practice? How many officers constitute a pattern or practice? Third, and most importantly, it is not yet known how federal judges will interpret the Section. Exactly, who has the burden of proof and what level of proof is required? More ominously, what evidence may be necessary to demonstrate the discriminatory intent of the pattern and practice? Unless and until these questions are resolved, the police “should be more alarmed by local media . . . than by the threat of an actual litigated 14141 case” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043986211425731">O’Reilly, 2002</xref>, p. 103).</p>
<p>The most extensive application of Section 14141 occurred in the mid-1990s in New Jersey. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, minority drivers along the New Jersey Turnpike complained bitterly that they were subjected to more frequent stops, searches, and arrests than nonminority drivers. Criminal defense attorneys consistently complained that the actions of troopers assigned to the Turnpike appeared to be racially motivated. The term <italic>racial profiling</italic> had not yet entered the common language. By 1990, a group of these lawyers representing 17 defendants initiated what was to become the most significant racial profiling case and effectively launching one of the most significant controversies facing American policing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043986211425731">Harris, 2002</xref>). The New Jersey case “stands permanently on the books as the most important judicial decision to date on racial profiling” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043986211425731">MacDonald, 2003</xref>, p. 26).</p>
<p>The plaintiff’s attorneys sought to dismiss the drug trafficking charges based on the premise that their clients were improperly selected for enforcement on the basis of their race or ethnicity (<italic>State of New Jersey v. Pedro Soto</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1043986211425731">1996</xref>). The state trial judge agreed finding that the State Police had profiled minorities as probable couriers and therefore stopped a disproportionately higher number of minority motorists. He then summarily dismissed the charges. The state attorney general appealed the case. While on appeal, the U.S. Department of Justice found enough evidence to open an inquiry under Section 14141. Eventually the state withdrew its appeal, dismissed the charges, paid nearly US$14,000,000 in damages, and accepted a massive consent decree that established an unprecedented level of external control over the state police.</p>
<p>For several reasons, New Jersey was a prime target for racial profiling litigation. First, the New Jersey Turnpike is one of the most important conduits for drug trafficking between Washington, DC and New York City. It is one of several primary fronts in the war on drugs. More than 250 troopers are assigned to patrol this stretch of highway. Most of them are specifically trained for and tasked with drug interdiction duties. It is likely these officers were heavily influenced by intelligence reports from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency indicating the increased probability that racial and ethnic minorities are drug couriers. Second, the political structure in New Jersey may have made administrative change within the State Police more difficult. In most states attorneys general are elected independently and the state police superintendents are appointed by independent boards or commissions. This effectively insures the attorney general, as the state’s principal prosecutor, has some objectivity in prosecutorial decision. In addition, state police superintendents in most states enjoy some independence from political influence. The New Jersey Attorney General is appointed by the governor and has command and control over the State Police. In short, this attorney general is both prosecutor and police. This potential conflict of interest became a reality during the <italic>Soto</italic> litigation. Third, the large minority populations centered around Newark, New Brunswick, Trenton, and Camden are politically active. There is a long history of contentious relations between the state police and this minority community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043986211425731">O’Reilly, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The New Jersey litigation is an excellent example of how statistical information in conjunction with documentary evidence of institutional racism can combine to make an effective legal case. John Lamberth, a well-respected professor at Temple University, was hired by the court to conduct what would become the nation’s first bona fide racial profiling study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043986211425731">Lamberth, 1994</xref>). Regardless of the criticisms Lamberth’s work has received from both the scholarly and practitioner communities, it was instrumental in developing an entirely new research agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1043986211425731">Withrow, 2006</xref>). After the Lamberth report, the racial profiling controversy developed traction all over the nation. The judge’s findings are particularly poignant because he considered the documentary and statistical information as evidence of the troopers’ prejudicial motivation for initiating traffic stops. This, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043986211425731">Huemann and Cassak (2003)</xref>, is an important opportunity for plaintiffs. Unfortunately, much to the disappointment of many, just a few weeks later, the supreme court handed down the <italic>Whren</italic> decision, effectively slamming the door on future courts considering an officer’s motivation for initiating a traffic stop.</p>
<p>It is likely not possible to find a single legal strategy that will work to the benefit of every plaintiff. The following table (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1043986211425731">Table 1</xref>) summarizes the history and potential for racial profiling litigation based on the sources and bases of the legal arguments discussed in this section. The reader will note that within each of these, there is potential success for plaintiffs able to overcome the difficult evidentiary hurdles.</p>

<title>“Successful” and “Unsuccessful” Legal Strategies from the Plaintiff’s Perspective</title>
<p>“Success” in litigation really depends on which side of the courtroom one sits. In this article, we chose to define “success” from the plaintiff’s perspective, primarily because the plaintiff has the burden of proof in most racial profiling cases. We make no attempt to argue the merits of the cases or to second guess the courts’ decisions.</p>
<p>We rely primarily on 12 cases (cited within this section) that we believe are instructive for the analysis in this section. We chose these cases for two reasons. Most of these cases did not progress beyond the trial court level. As a result, the details (e.g., arguments presented) of these cases, both legal and methodological, are relatively unknown. In each case, we had access to expert opinions, transcripts of testimony, unpublished legal arguments, and, in a few instances, comments from actual jurors.</p>
<p>Second, these cases cover a broad range of situations in which racial profiling allegations may arise. The allegations in nine of the 12 cases arose from traffic stops/searches that produced contraband. In these cases, the plaintiffs filed motions to suppress evidence based on an allegation that the stop was predicated on the police officer’s racial or ethnic prejudice. These types of cases represent the bulk of racial profiling litigation. The diversity of these cases lies in their enforcement contexts and the manner in which they came to the court. Five of these nine cases involved defendants who were stopped on an interstate highway and were subjected to a narcotics interdiction detection program. The plaintiffs in these five cases relied heavily on a recently published statewide racial profiling study for evidence that they themselves were racially profiled. Two of the nine cases involved truck drivers on interstate highways who were part of a larger illegal drug distribution cartel. The remaining two of these nine cases occurred in urban settings.</p>
<p>Three of the 12 cases are class action suits brought on behalf of Hispanic or African American defendants who alleged a pattern and practice of racial profiling. The remaining case occurred within a code enforcement context. The police were alleged to have used an individual’s status as a participant in a federal housing assistance program as a proxy for identifying and then discriminating against African American residents.</p>
<sec id="section10-1043986211425731">
<title>Successful Strategies</title>
<p>At the outset of the controversy (circa 1995), racial profiling plaintiffs enjoyed some early success. Two successful and far-reaching racial profiling lawsuits in New Jersey and Maryland resulted in comprehensive consent decrees that affected these departments in unprecedented ways. The success of these litigations can be attributed to several factors. First, because they occurred early in the controversy, there was really no body of literature within which to evaluate the validity of the methods used to measure racial profiling. The researchers in the New Jersey and Maryland cases relied on a field observation benchmarking strategy to estimate the racial/ethnic composition of drivers. This benchmarking strategy is now generally regarded as both invalid and unreliable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1043986211425731">Withrow, 2006</xref>). Subsequent cases relying on this strategy have not been successful (<italic>State of Arizona v. Anthony Jones</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043986211425731">2007</xref>; <italic>State of Arizona v. Tyrone Baldwin</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043986211425731">2007</xref>; <italic>United States v. Alcaraz-Arellano</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1043986211425731">2004</xref>; <italic>United States v. Lindsey</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1043986211425731">2003</xref>; <italic>United States v. Julio Granados-Orozco</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1043986211425731">2003</xref>; <italic>United States v. Mesa-Rocha</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1043986211425731">2003</xref>; and <italic>United States v. Miguel Orozco-Hernandez</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1043986211425731">2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, when these lawsuits were filed, the racial profiling controversy had not yet matured to the point where it had attracted the attention of competent researchers who had a better understanding of routine police systems and practices. In the absence of an effective counterargument, the court had little choice but to accept the plaintiff’s argument. For example, in <italic>Tuggles v. City of Antioch et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1043986211425731">2010</xref>) the plaintiffs alleged a disparate impact because the population of individuals adversely affected by the Antioch Police Department’s code enforcement program differed substantially (with respect to race) from the overall population of the city. African Americans represented a larger proportion among individuals the department cited or referred to the housing authority than the proportion of African American residents in the community. What the plaintiffs failed to consider was that the individuals that became the focus of a code enforcement investigation were not selected by the Antioch Police Department. These individuals (and the violations they allegedly committed) were brought to the attention of the Police Department independently through citizen referrals and calls for service.</p>
<p>Finally, the plaintiffs in the <italic>State of New Jersey v. Pedro Soto</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1043986211425731">1996</xref>) produced corroborative evidence (beyond the statistics) that demonstrated the defendants’ discriminatory intent. Various documents, policies, directives, letters, emails, training reports, and other similar items provided evidence that the defendant knowingly and intentionally targeted racial and ethnic minorities in their drug interdiction activities. This strategy was particularly effective in <italic>Arnoldo Giron et al. v. City of Alexander</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043986211425731">2010</xref>). In this case, the plaintiffs (nine Hispanic individuals) presented witness testimony in support of their claim that an Alexander (Arkansas) police officer intentionally sought out Hispanics for traffic stops.</p>

<title>Unsuccessful Strategies</title>
<p>Subsequent racial profiling litigation has been less than successful. The racial profiling controversy has attracted a great deal of attention and produced a number of credible researchers who are willing to consider the evidence more objectively. More importantly, researchers as well as some courts are beginning to understand the importance of contextual factors, some of which are measurable, that provide plausible alternative explanations. Overall, the courts are beginning to interpret the results of racial profiling research within the context of routine police operations. The following mistakes are commonly made by plaintiffs alleging racial profiling.</p>
<p>First, plaintiffs tend to use benchmark estimates of the driving population that are well known to be unreliable and invalid. As previously mentioned, although they enjoyed some early success, benchmarks based on field observations have failed to convince courts that a police departments enforcement practices produce a disparate effect, much less discriminatory intent. The most popular benchmark is based on the residential population. Here again, these benchmarks do not produce an accurate measure of the overall driving population and/or the population of individuals (by race and ethnicity) that are exposed to police observation and therefore likely to be stopped (<italic>Patterson v. City of Wichita Kansas et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043986211425731">2008</xref>; <italic>State of Ohio v. Manuel Razo</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043986211425731">2004</xref>; and <italic>Tuggles et al. v. City of Antioch et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1043986211425731">2010</xref>). Unless and until plaintiffs can find benchmarks that accurately and reliably measure the overall driving population (or the population at risk of being stopped or contacted), it is not possible to allege that the police stop a disproportionately higher proportion of racial and ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>Second, even when plaintiffs have good data and solid analyses unless they can provide corroborative evidence of discriminatory intent, they are often unsuccessful in court. It is important to recall that the plaintiffs in the most successful racial profiling litigations (New Jersey and Maryland) were able to produce evidence of discriminatory intent beyond the statistics. In <italic>Arnoldo Giron et al. v. City of Alexander, Arkansas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043986211425731">2010</xref>), the plaintiff produced testimonial and written evidence that an Alexander police officer actively targeted Hispanic drivers by placing himself in a position to observe vehicular traffic from a neighborhood known to be populated primarily by Hispanics, many of whom were suspected to be illegal aliens.</p>
<p>Third, plaintiffs, to their peril, pay little attention to routine police operations when analyzing racial profiling statistics. When they do, they open the door for the defense to interject reasonable doubt. For example, many plaintiffs assume all searches are basically the same. Individuals more knowledgeable of routine police operations understand that searches and the justifications for them vary widely. Some searches are required by law or policy (incident to arrest, inventory) whereas others are highly discretionary (consent). An officer’s level of discretion is the most important distinction between the types of searches. Unfortunately, many plaintiffs either do not analyze searches by type or merely fail to understand the differences between them. In <italic>Tuggles et al. v. City of Antioch et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1043986211425731">2010</xref>), the plaintiffs pointed out that many of the code enforcement and housing violation cases investigated by the police department were noncriminal in nature. What the plaintiffs did not realize is that a substantial portion of what a police officer does on a routine basis is noncriminal in nature.</p>
<p>Fourth, police stop data as a measure of police decision making is often insufficient. Here again, the lack of detail in most police stop data sets leaves considerable room for reasonable doubt. Police stop data are seldom able to capture important nuances existing within the contexts of stops that often explain why a police officer behaved in the way he did. For example, sometimes plaintiffs attempt to associate the reason for a stop with the outcome of a stop. The objective of this exercise is to see if racial and ethnic minorities are either stopped for less serious violations or to determine whether racial and ethnic minorities when stopped are more likely to get cited or arrested for offenses that nonminorities only get warned for. Unfortunately, the reason for the stop in most stop data sets is only nominally measured and thus cannot be organized into a logical order of seriousness. Most departments merely report the reason as a “traffic violation,” “equipment violation,” or “other violation.” Within each of these categories, there is considerable variation with respect to the seriousness of the driver’s behavior leading to the stop. Similarly, police stop data seldom contain information describing an officer’s motivation for a search.</p>
<p>Fifth, many plaintiffs attempt to use aggregate level data as a means to explain individual officer behavior. The typical case involves a recently published jurisdiction-wide racial profiling or stop study demonstrating racial or ethnic minorities to be overrepresented in stops. These studies are used as evidence of an individual officer’s alleged discriminatory intent, usually within the context of a defendant’s motion to suppress evidence. Plaintiffs making individual allegations based on aggregate data commit a serious logical error, called an ecological fallacy. Aggregate level data can neither prove nor disprove an individual officer’s motivation for initiating a traffic stop. In <italic>United States v. Alcaraz-Arellano</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1043986211425731">2004</xref>; <italic>United States v. Lindsey</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1043986211425731">2003</xref>; <italic>United States v. Julio Granados-Orozco</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1043986211425731">2003</xref>; <italic>United States v. Mesa-Rocha</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1043986211425731">2003</xref>; and <italic>United States v. Miguel Orozco-Hernandez</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1043986211425731">2003</xref>, the plaintiffs used a recently published statewide racial profiling study as evidence that they were racially profiled. Even if the study definitively proved a statewide pattern and practice of racial profiling, which it did not, this would not be sufficient evidence to prove that the five troopers involved in these cases acted with <italic>racial animus</italic>. In addition, the defense successfully attacked the validity of the study’s methodology. Most importantly, the defense demonstrated that none of the areas where the plaintiffs were stopped were included in the statewide study’s analysis. Furthermore, the areas that were included in the statewide study were substantially and qualitatively different (in terms of their traffic patterns) from the locations the plaintiffs were stopped.</p>
<p>Sixth, most plaintiffs are unable to produce evidence that the officer’s decision to stop was racially motivated because most stop data sets do not measure what the officer knew about the driver <italic>prior</italic> to the stop. The race or ethnicity of drivers stopped is nearly always collected after the stop, not before. Because of this, there is really no way for a plaintiff to allege that the officer actually knew the defendant’s race prior to the stop, much less whether this information was used inappropriately as justification for the stop. Only one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043986211425731">Alpert, Dunham, &amp; Smith, 2007</xref>) evaluated the extent to which police officers are able to accurately determine the race or ethnicity of a driver prior to a stop. In this study, the researchers found that officers are overwhelmingly unable to accurately perceive a driver’s race or ethnicity prior to the initial face to face contact. The plaintiffs in <italic>State of Arizona v. Anthony Jones</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043986211425731">2007</xref>; <italic>State of Arizona v. Tyrone Baldwin</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043986211425731">2007</xref>; <italic>State of Ohio v. Manuel Razo</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043986211425731">2004</xref>; <italic>Tuggles et al. v. City of Antioch et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1043986211425731">2010</xref>; <italic>United States v.

James Earl Lindsey</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1043986211425731">2003</xref>; <italic>United States v. Julio Granados-Orozco</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1043986211425731">2003</xref>; <italic>United States v. Mesa-Rocha</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1043986211425731">2003</xref>; and <italic>United States v. Miguel Orozco-Hernandez</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1043986211425731">2003</xref> were unable to establish that the police officers were aware of the plaintiffs race or ethnicity prior to the stop. Alternatively, the plaintiff in <italic>Patterson v. City of Wichita et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043986211425731">2008</xref>) did establish that the officer knew the plaintiff was African American because the officer testified that he observed Mr. Patterson enter his vehicle and drive away. The plaintiffs were not however able to prove <italic>racial animus</italic> in the officer’s decision to initiate the stop. These cases are in stark contrast to previously mentioned <italic>Arnoldo Giron et al. v. City of Alexander, Arkansas et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043986211425731">2010</xref>) wherein the plaintiffs were able determine that the officer positioned himself at a place where he knew Hispanic drivers were likely to be observed.</p>
<p>Seventh, plaintiffs are seldom able to establish a causal link between their minority status and the officer’s decision to stop. To prove that one thing is the cause of another (e.g., that being a racial minority is the cause of being stopped) a researcher must prove all three causal rules—temporal order, correlation, and lack of plausible alternative explanations. Because plaintiffs are not able to establish that the officer was aware of the driver’s race <italic>prior</italic> to the stop, it is not possible for them to confirm temporal order. Correlation (i.e., the overall overrepresentation of minorities stopped) is sometimes possible assuming the estimate of the driving population is both reliable and valid. Unfortunately, most benchmark estimates are neither. Tougher still is the requirement to eliminate plausible alternative explanations. Dynamic police allocation and deployment patterns, enforcement policy and other factors often provide alternative explanations to what appears to be an overrepresentation of racial and ethnic minorities in police stops.</p>

<title>Promising Strategies</title>
<p>Despite the difficulty associated with these cases it is probably too early to conclude that we may never be able to actually prove racial profiling. Over time, it is more likely than not a method will emerge that will produce the data necessary to definitively prove a pattern and practice of racial profiling. Already, a few promising strategies are emerging.</p>
<p>First, the use of an operational definition effectively makes proving racial profiling easier. Operational definitions merely allege that an overrepresentation of racial minorities in police stops is enough to prove racial profiling. This argument is similar to an affirmative action lawsuit based on a disparate effect rather than active discrimination. Researchers using this type of definition are more likely to produce findings that support racial profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1043986211425731">Withrow, 2006</xref>). This type of definition was used effectively in <italic>State of New Jersey v. Pedro Soto</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1043986211425731">1996</xref>). Alternatively, research based on a conceptual definition is less likely to conclude that racial profiling is occurring. Conceptual definitions, by far the most commonly used, require the plaintiff to prove that the police (a) knew the driver’s race or ethnicity prior to the stop, and (b) acted inappropriately on this information to initiate the stop. In <italic>State of Arizona v. Anthony Jones</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043986211425731">2007</xref>; <italic>State of Arizona v. Tyrone Baldwin</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043986211425731">2007</xref>; <italic>State of Ohio v. Manuel Razo</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043986211425731">2004</xref>; <italic>Tuggles et al. v. City of Antioch et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1043986211425731">2010</xref>; <italic>United States v. Alcaraz-Arellano</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1043986211425731">2004</xref>; <italic>United States v. James Earl Lindsey</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1043986211425731">2003</xref>; <italic>United States v. Julio Granados-Orozco</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1043986211425731">2003</xref>; <italic>United States v. Mesa-Rocha</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1043986211425731">2003</xref>; and <italic>United States v. Miguel Orozco-Hernandez</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1043986211425731">2003</xref>, the defense was successful in establishing reasonable doubt in both required elements. Of course, both definitions rely heavily on an accurate estimate of the population of drivers that are not stopped, and this has so far eluded racial profiling researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1043986211425731">Withrow, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, the use of internal benchmarks may overcome many of the problems caused by using aggregate data (i.e., department-wide stop studies) as evidence of individual discriminatory intent. Internal benchmarks are “created,” by comparing the stopping performance of similarly situated officers. Based on the assumption that officers assigned to the same tasks, beats and shifts are essentially exposed to the same driving population, an internal benchmark can identify individual officers who appear to over select racial and ethnic minorities. As a result, this technique might be an effective technique for identifying and controlling errant behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1043986211425731">Walker, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1043986211425731">Withrow, Dailey, &amp; Jackson, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Although it is difficult to predict the future of American jurisprudence, it is a relatively safe bet that racial profiling litigation will increase in the future. There are three reasons that support this prediction. First, the current administration in Washington, DC appears more willing to take on the racial profiling than its predecessor. Although the racial profiling controversy emerged during the Bush administration, despite a few public comments and policy changes, there was little interest in pursuing litigation. The most successful legal challenges (New Jersey, Maryland, <italic>Whren</italic>) were either encouraged or decided during the Clinton administration and the enforcement focus of the nation was on terrorism. An important racial profiling case involving Sheriff Joe Arpaio in Maricopa County, Arizona began during the Bush administration but did not receive federal attention from the U.S. Justice Department until after President Obama was inaugurated (<italic>Melendres et al. v. Arpaio et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043986211425731">2008</xref>). President Obama has detailed knowledge of and a legislative history within the racial profiling controversy, which might explain his willingness to comment on the Gates/Crowley affair in Cambridge, Massachusetts during the summer of 2009.</p>
<p>Second, increased attention on illegal immigration has caused several states to pursue legislative remedies, most notably Arizona. Local enforcement of federal immigration law is highly complicated and has the potential for racial profiling litigation. The probable cause that might lead a police officer to question an individual’s immigration status is likely influenced by the individual’s race or ethnicity. Although most legislative proposals place immigration enforcement secondary to the enforcement of other state statutes, there is no guarantee against the use of pretextual stops. It is likely therefore that the most robust racial profiling litigation will come from this enforcement context.</p>
<p>Third, in late 2009, a three-judge panel in the Ninth Circuit issued a ruling that further supports our contention that racial profiling litigation is likely to increase within the near future. In <italic>Farrakahn et al. v. Gregiore et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043986211425731">2010</xref>), the court ruled that the overrepresentation of African American individuals in the criminal justice system violates the Voting Rights Act. The court agreed with the plaintiffs’ allegation that the police purposively focus extra and unwarranted attention on African American suspects. In turn, prosecutors are more willing to accept cases involving African American defendants. When found guilty, African American defendants are sentenced more harshly. Because the State of Washington disenfranchises felony offenders, the criminal justice process essentially produces a disparate impact on African Americans. It is too early to know how this decade-old case will fair before the entire Ninth Circuit or whether or not it will make it to the U.S. Supreme Court, but it is our belief that this ruling can have a substantial effect on the overall criminal justice system.</p>
