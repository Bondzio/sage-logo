<abstract>
<p>This paper investigates changes in the distribution of earnings across 87 metropolitan areas in Canada. It does so using micro data taken from the 20 per cent long-form sample of the census for the years 1996, 2001 and 2006. Results point to overall increases in urban inequality and to greater heterogeneity in inequality across the urban hierarchy, with larger cities growing particularly unequal over time. Cross-sectional and panel regression models suggest that city size, unemployment, deindustrialisation and the percentage of a city’s population composed of visible minorities contribute to increased inequality. In contrast, a city’s level of economic development has a mitigating effect on inequality, although this effect appears to fade away over time. The effects of changes in a city’s age, education and gender profiles on inequality are mixed.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>The title of this paper is deliberately chosen to echo that of a 2008 report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development which documents recent trends in inequality across member countries. According to this report, Canada stands out as having experienced the second-largest increase in inequality from the mid 1990s to the mid 2000s. Looking at longer-term trends, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0042098011410335">Yalnizyan (2007)</xref> argues that the country’s widening income gap is at a 30-year high.</p>
<p>While there is an important literature dealing with the resurgence of inequality at the national level in Canada (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042098011410335">Green and Kesselman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042098011410335">Heisz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0042098011410335">Osberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042098011410335">Frenette <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>), much less attention has been paid to intercity variation in the distribution of earnings and to the potential causes of such differences. This, despite the fact that Canada’s urban system has undergone significant changes shaped by the restructuring of economic activities, increased global competition, rapid technological change and important demographic shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042098011410335">Bourne and Simmons, 2003</xref>). This paper seeks to redress the situation by providing an up-to-date and comprehensive analysis of the determinants of earnings inequality across Canadian cities. We do so by using the 20 per cent long-form sample of the census for the years 1996, 2001 and 2006 to examine two sets of questions</p>
<list id="list1-0042098011410335" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>How are earnings distributed across metropolitan areas in Canada and how have these patterns changed over the 1996 to 2006 period?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How can the differences observed in the distribution of earnings across metropolitan areas be explained?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In addressing the first question, we show that, over the period of study, earnings inequality across metropolitan areas increased, on average, by nearly 4 per cent. The distribution of earnings in larger cities grew particularly unequal from 1996 to 2006 (&gt; 9 per cent on average) and western Canadian cities tend to have, on average, higher levels of inequality than cities in other parts of the country. There is also greater heterogeneity in earnings inequality across the urban hierarchy. For example, inequality in Calgary in 2006 (the city with the most unequal distribution of earnings) was 49 per cent greater than in Saint-Hyacinthe (the city with the most equal distribution). This is more than twice the difference that separated these two cities back in 1996.</p>
<p>With regard to the second question, modelling results suggest that several factors are driving changes in the distribution of earnings across metropolitan areas. In particular, we find that city size, unemployment, deindustrialisation and the percentage of a city’s population composed of visible minorities contribute—to various degrees—to increased inequality. In contrast, the level of economic development, proxied by the median earnings of the labour force, has a mitigating effect on inequality, although this impact vanishes over time. This is likely to be a result of lopsided growth in the earnings distribution, as overall wage gains in recent years are not trickling down to those who earn less. The percentage of women in the workforce also has an inverse relationship to levels of inequality.</p>
<p>The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In the next section, we review the literature on inequality while highlighting the scarcity of empirical studies at the metropolitan scale. Section 3 introduces the datasets used for the analysis and provides a descriptive account of recent patterns of metropolitan inequality. Section 4 presents the cross-sectional and panel data regression models used to examine the determinants of inequality across urban areas, while section 5 discusses the modelling results. We conclude in section 6 by summarising the study’s main findings.</p>

<title>2. Literature Review</title>
<sec id="section3-0042098011410335">
<title>2.1 National-level Studies</title>
<p>The literature on economic inequality is vast, complex and fragmented.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0042098011410335">1</xref></sup> By and far, much of the ‘heavy lifting’ has been done by economists who tend to focus their analytical lens on national-level patterns of inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042098011410335">Myles, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098011410335">Chakravorty, 2006</xref>). The first signals of a resurgence in inequality came from the US where a series of influential papers, published in the early 1990s, established that, after a period of relative stability, inequality began to grow in the late 1970s with more significant and rapid increases through the 1980s (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042098011410335">Levy and Murnane, 1992</xref>). Since then, inequality in the US has continued to grow albeit at a more modest pace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0042098011410335">Reich, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The US is not the only country to have experienced growing inequality. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0042098011410335">Figure 1</xref> provides a snapshot of recent inequality trends for select OECD countries over two different time-periods. In each panel, countries are sorted in descending order according to the point change in their respective Gini coefficients<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0042098011410335">2</xref></sup>. From the mid 1980s to the mid 2000s (panel A), it is quite clear that increased inequality was the dominant trend. The average point change in Gini coefficient across the OECD-22 is approximately 0.02, an increase of about 7.5 per cent. In addition to the US, particularly strong increases in inequality are observed in Finland, New Zealand and Portugal. Overall, inequality declined in only four countries: France, Spain, Ireland and Greece.</p>

</fig>
<p>Panel B shows more recent trends focusing on the mid 1990s to mid 2000s period. Beyond noticeable changes in the order of countries, there is much greater diversity in inequality trajectories over the past decade with particularly strong growth in inequality in Canada. Indeed, over the past 10 years, the 0.034 point change in Canada’s Gini coefficient translates into a 12 per cent growth rate. This has pushed the level of inequality in Canada from well below that of the OECD-22 average in the mid 1990s to one that is now above it.</p>

<sec id="section4-0042098011410335">
<title>2.2 Sub-national-level Studies</title>
<p>Despite the growing literature documenting the resurgence of inequality at the national level, much less attention has been paid to sub-national variations in the distribution of incomes and to the potential causes of such differences. This has prompted several scholars to call for more ‘serious’ input and ‘critical debate’ on inequality from geographers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098011410335">Gilbert, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042098011410335">Martin, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Given that trends in rising inequality were first detected in the US, it is not surprising that this is where the response to these calls has been greatest. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098011410335">Chakravorty (1996)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098011410335">Hyclak (2000)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042098011410335">Madden (2000)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098011410335">Donegan and Lowe (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098011410335">Glaeser <italic>et al</italic>. (2009)</xref> all explore the dynamics of income inequality across US metropolitan areas. In Canada, the literature on urban inequality is much sparser.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098011410335">Bourne (1993)</xref> examines changes in the distribution of income in 12 Canadian census metropolitan areas (CMAs) from 1951 to 1986 and develops a conceptual framework to look at the components of those changes (more on this later). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042098011410335">MacLachlan and Sawada (1997)</xref> broaden the scope to 22 metropolitan areas and extend the analysis to 1991. While they provide a valuable descriptive account of trends in urban inequality (which is seen as generally rising), like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098011410335">Bourne (1993)</xref>, they do not attempt a more detailed model-based explanation of the causes of urban inequality. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042098011410335">Mitchell and Soroka (1993)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0042098011410335">Soroka (1999)</xref> investigate urban patterns of inequality using a multivariate modelling framework controlling for a variety of explanatory factors. They find, among other things, that once smaller cities are added to the mix (their analysis is based on a sample of 59 Canadian cities using 1970s–1980s data), the overall distribution of incomes across metropolitan areas appears to become more homogeneous over time—in contrast to the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098011410335">Bourne (1993)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042098011410335">MacLachlan and Sawada (1997)</xref>. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098011410335">Moore and Pacey (2003)</xref> find evidence of widespread increases in inequality across CMAs over the 1990 to 1995 period.</p>
<p>While these studies all make valuable contributions in their own right, they either: are based on 1970s to mid 1990s data that do not reflect more recent trends; ignore changes in spatial boundary definitions which may seriously impede the validity of comparative analysis over time; understate actual levels of inequality by adopting measures based on published aggregations of observations within broad income categories instead of individual-level incomes; or, limit their investigation of the determinants of inequality to one or two potential explanatory factors at a time. In providing a much needed up-to-date analysis of the determinants of urban inequality in Canada, this paper also addresses these limitations.</p>

<title>2.3 Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>Early efforts to develop a conceptual framework to study the causes of inequality long ago established that there is no overarching or general theory of income distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042098011410335">Lydall, 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042098011410335">Osberg, 1981</xref>). Rather, several competing explanations are offered and, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098011410335">Bourne (1993</xref>, p. 1296) argues, studies of metropolitan inequality “must ultimately address an array of contextual factors” that shape the urban distribution of earnings.</p>
<p>A first set of (demand-side) factors links inequality to the structure of labour markets and employment opportunities. The erosion of manufacturing employment (i.e. the deindustrialisation hypothesis) is thought by many to lead to increases in inequality, as once high-paying full-time jobs with good benefits are replaced with lower-paying, often part-time jobs with fewer benefits in the service sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042098011410335">Harrison and Bluestone, 1988</xref>). Skills-biased technological change sees the greater diffusion of technology stimulating the demand for more educated workers to the detriment of less-skilled workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098011410335">Bound and Johnson, 1992</xref>). Greater trade competition from low-income countries has also been linked to greater inequality in advanced countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098011410335">Breau and Rigby, 2010</xref>). Although the latter two explanations have received much attention at the national level, they are difficult to assess at the urban scale because of limited data availability.</p>
<p>A second set of (supply-side) factors seen as potential sources of increased inequality consists of changes in the demographic composition of the labour force. Human capital theory figures prominently here, linking inequality to changes in a population’s educational profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042098011410335">Mincer, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098011410335">Boudarbat <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>) and its age structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0042098011410335">Nielsen and Alderson, 1995</xref>). As in many other OECD countries, labour markets in Canada have also been influenced by the recent influx of immigrants. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098011410335">Moore and Pacey (2003)</xref> find that immigration is linked to increased income inequality and they argue that, as an increasing share of Canada’s visible minorities is represented by immigrants, the two categories become ‘confounding variables’ within models, with both contributing to inequality. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0042098011410335">Sakamoto (1988)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098011410335">Chakravorty (1996)</xref> find that racial/ethnic diversity influences patterns of inequality across metropolitan areas in the US. And, although the evidence is mixed, changes in female participation rates may also play a role in determining inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042098011410335">MacLachlan and Sawada, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to these two sets of factors, broader macroeconomic and institutional changes will influence patterns of inequality. Unemployment is a significant factor that consistently predicts higher inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042098011410335">Erksoy, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098011410335">Chakravorty, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042098011410335">Breau, 2007</xref>). The decline in unionised labour, which parallels the deindustrialisation hypothesis described earlier, is also thought to contribute to higher levels of inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042098011410335">Lemieux, 2008</xref>). While unionisation rates are not directly measured in the census, their magnitude may be approximated by levels of manufacturing employment. Likewise, city size and urbanisation have been argued to affect the level of income inequality with larger cities having higher levels of inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098011410335">Chakravorty, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098011410335">Korpi, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>With several factors to consider as potential determinants of inequality, the challenge for urban scholars is to disentangle the relative contributions of each (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098011410335">Bourne, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042098011410335">MacLachlan and Sawada, 1997</xref>). While researchers have tackled the issue by developing and applying multidimensional models of metropolitan inequality outside Canada, similar work in Canada has been limited.</p>

<title>3. The Data and Some Preliminary Evidence</title>
<sec id="section7-0042098011410335">
<title>3.1 Data Sources and Development</title>
<p>The statistical analysis carried out in this paper uses datasets constructed from the unpublished 20 per cent sample (based on the long-form questionnaire) of the Census of Canada for the years 1996, 2001 and 2006. In a series of recent papers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042098011410335">Frenette <italic>et al</italic>. (2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098011410335">2007</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042098011410335">2009</xref>) argue that there are a number of advantages to using the 20 per cent sample to study earnings inequality in Canada. First, by law, response to the census is mandatory which means that population coverage is almost complete. Secondly, the census micro-data files also provide for very large sample sizes. In raw form, the 1996 to 2006 samples each contain roughly six million individual responses. Such a large sample allows for more detailed and robust analyses of various segments of the earnings distribution. Thirdly, since the structure of the long-form questionnaire itself undergoes minimal change from one census cycle to another, most variables contained in the micro-data files are stable and reliable over time. Fourthly, income and earnings data in the 20 per cent census sample are not top-coded. The imposition of a truncation limit can seriously bias measurement of inequality downward, especially if earnings are increasing at the upper end of the distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042098011410335">Fichtenbaum and Sahidi, 1988</xref>). Finally, it also contains a rich collection of information on the demographic, social and economic characteristics of individual respondents including place-of-residence data down to the census sub-division (CSD) and census tract (CT) levels.</p>
<p>One of the difficulties of constructing measures of inequality at the metropolitan scale is establishing correspondence in geographical boundaries across censuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098011410335">Hyclak, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042098011410335">Martin <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). In Canada, CSDs are the standard areas used to delineate municipalities and the boundaries of CSDs change frequently across census cycles to reflect, <italic>inter alia</italic>, population changes, variations in commuting patterns and/or administrative changes (such as annexations, municipal amalgamations). Therein lies the challenge as CSDs also serve as the building blocks used to define cities as either CMAs or census agglomerations (CAs). According to Statistics Canada, a CMA or a CA consists of one or more adjacent municipalities (i.e. CSDs) centred on a large urban core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0042098011410335">Statistics Canada 2007</xref>). Each CMA has a minimum population of 100 000, including an urban core population of at least 50 000, while each CA has an urban core population of at least 10 000. In 2006, 33 Canadian cities were classified as CMAs and 111 as CAs. Changes in the geographical frame of previous census cycles are such that 27 cities were classified as CMAs and 113 as CAs in 2001; 25 as CMAs and 112 as CAs in 1996. Comparative analysis of CMAs and CAs with boundaries that cut across their respective CSDs from one census to the next therefore leads to inaccurate and potentially misleading results.</p>
<p>To address this difficulty, we use the intersect tool in ArcMAP 9.2 to aggregate 1996 and 2001 CSDs according to 2006 CMA/CA boundaries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0042098011410335">3</xref></sup> With the problem of consistent geographies resolved, it is relatively straightforward to aggregate individual-level census responses from the 1-in-5 sample to form cross-sectional metropolitan datasets for each year. Since our analysis focuses on the distribution of individual earnings (in contrast to household- or family-level total income studies relying on tax data), our metropolitan samples are restricted to persons in the active labour force between the ages of 25 and 65 who reported Can$1000 or more in annual employment earnings. For most people, earnings represent the primary source of income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0042098011410335">Saez and Veall, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0042098011410335">Osberg, 2008</xref>); hence, measures of inequality based on individual earnings are a better reflection of labour market processes and outcomes.</p>
<p>We measure inequality across metropolitan areas using the Gini coefficient. The Gini is commonly employed as a measure of inequality due to its ease of interpretation, with possible values ranging between 0 and 1, where 0 represents ‘perfect equality’ and 1 represents ‘complete inequality’.</p>

<sec id="section8-0042098011410335">
<title>3.2 Intercity Differences in the Distribution of Earnings</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042098011410335">Table 1</xref> displays summary statistics showing general changes in the distribution of earnings for all individuals in the core labour force pooled across the 87 metropolitan areas. Real median earnings (in 2002 dollars) by quintile (columns 2–4) and the percentage change in real median earnings (columns 5–7) are reported over the census years 1996, 2001 and 2006. Between 1996 and 2006, both the top and bottom quintiles of the urban labour force in Canada reported significant gains in real earnings. However, a more detailed breakdown of the earnings profile reveals sharp differences in terms of when those gains occurred. The 5-year gain of 17.9 per cent in median earnings for the bottom quintile is substantial as individuals in that group appear to have benefited from Canada’s overall GDP growth in the late 1990s. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042098011410335">Picot and Myles (2005)</xref> show that, during the late 1990s, Canadian families saw overall reductions in unemployment, increased earnings and a drop in numbers below the low-income cut-off. They argue that the recently enhanced Canada child tax benefit may have also helped to reduce employment disincentives. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0042098011410335">Yalnizyan (2007)</xref> documents similar gains by the poorest working Canadians in the late 1990s, but notes that those constant-dollar figures stand lower than they were in the 1970s. By the turn of the millennium, the fortunes of those in the bottom quintile group had changed drastically as they saw a decline of almost 7 per cent in real median earnings. In contrast, those in the top quintile consistently made significant gains across both the 1996–2001 and 2001–2006 periods. In a study of high-income groups in Canada based on data from personal income tax returns, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0042098011410335">Saez and Veall (2005)</xref> suggest that the gains experienced by the top quintile of earners are largely due to a surge in the wages and salaries of those most highly compensated employees. In between the top and bottom quintiles, growth in real median earnings was modest with individuals in the 20–40 per cent quintile actually registering a decline in real median earnings from 2001 to 2006.</p>

<p>This divergence in earnings is shown by the ratio of the top/bottom quintiles, which suggests that inequality declined from 1996 to 2001 before increasing considerably in the early 2000s. The trend is mirrored by the Gini coefficient which captures the distribution of earnings across Canadian cities as a whole. Making use of the full information on individual earnings actually suggests that the level of inequality remained flat from 1996 to 2001.</p>
<p>Beneath these aggregate trends lie significant intermetropolitan differences in earnings inequality. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0042098011410335">Figure 2</xref> plots the location of the 87 cities included in the study according to population size and value of the Gini coefficient for 2006, with darker shades indicating higher levels of inequality. A number of observations are worth pointing out.</p>

</fig>
<p>First, with the exception of Ottawa–Hull, Canada’s largest metropolitan areas have very unequal earnings distributions. In rank order, Calgary, Toronto and Vancouver occupy the top three spots in terms of earnings inequality with Gini coefficients of 0.491, 0.445 and 0.425 respectively. Edmonton is not far behind with a Gini coefficient of 0.413, while Montreal has a Gini of 0.397. As we move down the urban hierarchy, smaller-sized CMAs/CAs generally exhibit lower Gini values.</p>
<p>Secondly, sweeping the country from east to west, one observes clear differences in the spatial patterns of metropolitan inequality in 2006. The distribution of earnings in all nine metropolitan areas in Alberta is very unequal (i.e. with Gini coefficients greater than 0.390). The resource boom of the late 1990s and early 2000s certainly plays a role in explaining such high earnings inequality. An industry-level analysis of inequality (not shown here) suggests that the mining and oil industries indeed exhibited some of the highest absolute levels of inequality. Likewise, seven of eight metropolitan areas in British Columbia also register very high levels of inequality (the exception being Victoria, the province’s capital and home to an important government sector which is typically characterised by low levels of inequality). In contrast, urban areas in central Canada, most of which are concentrated along the Windsor–Quebec City corridor (see inset), tend to exhibit more moderate levels of inequality. There are exceptions: in addition to Toronto and Montreal, Hamilton and Sarnia report Gini coefficients of 0.400 and 0.412 respectively. Although Hamilton still boasts the largest concentration of steel producers in the country and Sarnia is arguably one of the most important clusters of chemical manufacturing plants, these two cities have been caught in the cross-hairs of deindustrialisation since the mid 1990s. On the whole, cities in Quebec tend to have the most equal distribution of earnings. Fourteen of the 20 CMAs/CAs with the lowest Gini coefficients are located in Quebec; most of these cities are also characterised by below-average median earnings.</p>
<p>What is not depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0042098011410335">Figure 2</xref> is how patterns of metropolitan inequality have changed over time. Of the 87 cities included in our sample, only 18 saw no increase or relatively modest declines in inequality, while the remaining cities experienced an increase in earnings inequality. Among the latter, 28 experienced relatively modest increases in inequality (0–3.5 per cent), 22 important increases (3.5–7 per cent) and 19 substantial increases (&gt; 7 per cent). As the mean value of metropolitan earnings inequality increases over the 1996 to 2006 period (from an average Gini of 0.365 to 0.379), so does the range of Gini coefficient values, suggesting greater heterogeneity in earnings inequality across metropolitan areas. Indeed, the standard deviation of earnings inequality increases from 0.019 to 0.022 from 1996 to 2001 (about 16 per cent) and again from 0.022 to 0.027 from 2001 to 2006 (about 23 per cent). In short, it seems clear that Canadian cities have grown increasingly unequal in their distribution of earnings over the 1996 to 2006 period.</p>

<title>4. Modelling Strategy</title>
<p>The next logical question to ask is how these differences—and changes—in the distribution of earnings can be explained. To investigate the link between inequality and potential causal factors, we estimate three sets of models. The first consists of basic OLS models that exploit the cross-sectional variation found in metropolitan-level observations to identify the determinants of earnings inequality. The benchmark model is specified as</p>

<p>where, the dependent variable is the Gini coefficient of earnings inequality for metropolitan area <italic>i</italic> at time <italic>t</italic>; <italic>X</italic><sub><italic>it</italic></sub> is a vector of metropolitan characteristics; <italic>PROV</italic><sub><italic>it</italic></sub> are indicator variables controlling for province fixed effects; and ε<sub><italic>it</italic></sub> is an error term carrying the usual assumptions.</p>
<p>The metropolitan variables (<italic>X</italic><sub><italic>it</italic></sub>) included in the analysis derive from the conceptual framework discussed in section 2.3. We use the percentage of labour force employment in manufacturing industries as a proxy for the deindustrialisation hypothesis along with a series of controls reflecting the demographic composition of the labour force: the female participation rate, an education ratio (defined as the ratio of individuals without a high school degree or equivalent plus those with a bachelor’s degree or higher to the remaining sample) and the percentage of the labour force that is young (percentage of the population aged under 15) and senior (percentage of the population aged over 65). We also include a variable measuring the percentage of visible minorities, including Aboriginal people, in order to account for the varying structural and spatial inequalities faced by ethnic minorities across urban Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0042098011410335">Ross <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098011410335">DeVerteuil and Wilson, 2010</xref>). This variable is highly correlated and confounding with the percentage of recent immigrants and thus we use it in the model as it also reflects non-immigrant visible minorities as well as the higher proportions of Aboriginal residents in cities such as Winnipeg, Regina and Saskatoon. Median wages are used to capture the level of economic development of a city, whereas unemployment rates are included as general controls for macroeconomic conditions. Finally, we use the size of the active labour force as a proxy for city size. Calculating the average Gini coefficients of earnings for Canadian cities according to size (large = 500 000+ total population; medium large = 200 000–499 999; medium small = 75 000–199 000; and small = &lt; 75 000) shows that, from 1996 to 2006, large cities have experienced an increase of 9.1 per cent in inequality; in contrast, growth in earnings inequality across small cities was a more modest 1.9 per cent. This is consistent with recent findings in Sweden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098011410335">Korpi 2008</xref>) and in Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098011410335">Brown <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Model (1) is estimated individually for <italic>t</italic> = 1996, 2001 and 2006 and coefficients are compared at different points in time to see how the influence of certain explanatory variables may have changed.</p>
<p>To capture variation over time and control for potential unobserved heterogeneity (for instance, inequality is likely to show strong institutional dependence at the municipal level), we exploit the panel structure of our datasets and estimate two other models. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0042098011410335">Equation (1)</xref> is first-differenced such that</p>

<p>Estimating model (2) allows us to focus on how changes in the independent variables influence changes in metropolitan earnings inequality.</p>
<p>In addition to first-differencing, we also time-demean our balanced panel to get a fixed-effects transformation (model 3). The fixed-effects model, like first-differencing, is preferred to the simpler pooled-OLS model in situations when unobserved heterogeneity is correlated with some of the independent variables in order to avoid inefficient parameter estimates (i.e. so-called heterogeneity bias). When the errors are not serially correlated, the fixed-effects model is also more efficient than the first-differenced equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042098011410335">Angrist and Pischke, 2009</xref>). We estimate both models and compare results as a further robustness check to the analysis.</p>

<p>As expected, city size consistently exerts a positive effect on earnings inequality. Of particular interest is the finding that the city size–inequality relationship in Canada becomes stronger over time which diverges from earlier findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042098011410335">Mitchell and Soroka (1993)</xref> for the 1970–80 period. In 1996, a 1 per cent increase in a city’s labour force population corresponds to a 0.003 (i.e. 0.3 percentage point) increase in the Gini coefficient, holding all else constant. By 2006, the coefficient estimate triples in size such that a 1 per cent increase in a city’s labour force population translates into a 0.01 (i.e. 1 percentage point) increase in the Gini. The standardised beta coefficients suggest that city size is in fact the strongest factor influencing earnings inequality across metropolitan areas. This increase in relative influence over time points to the role of large cities as increasingly important sources of earnings inequality and also to inequality as predominantly a large-city phenomenon. Larger and higher-density metropolitan areas typically give way to various types of agglomeration economies (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0042098011410335">Rigby and Essletzbichler, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042098011410335">Baldwin <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>) which may attract and benefit certain workers more than others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098011410335">Chakravorty, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098011410335">Glaeser <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098011410335">Brown <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). For instance, larger cities are often home to corporate headquarters, financial institutions and business service firms which have occupational structures that tend to disproportionately benefit those in the upper levels of the income spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0042098011410335">Sassen, 1991</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0042098011410335">Walks’ (2001)</xref> case study of Toronto, the ‘financial hub’ of the country, supports this argument and also provides some evidence of growing spatial polarisation within the city itself. Similar dynamics are also likely to be at work in the Calgary and Edmonton metropolitan areas where booming oil-extraction companies and large energy-resources distribution centres are located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042098011410335">Cross, 2007</xref>) although closer inspection of intrametropolitan patterns is needed to confirm this.</p>
<p>Having controlled for city size, the anticipated inverse relationship between the general level of economic development—as proxied by median earnings—and inequality holds for 1996 and 2001. The corresponding standardised beta coefficients suggest that the level of economic development was in fact one of the most important equalising factors at the time. Interestingly, as we reach 2006, the coefficient estimate is no longer statistically significant. This change in significance is consistent with recent evidence suggesting that the incomes, especially earnings, of the top per centiles have grown at a much faster pace than those of other per centiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0042098011410335">Saez and Vaell 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098011410335">Frenette <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>). Effectively, such growth raises overall median earnings to a level that cancels out or reverses the equalising effects it typically has at lower income levels.</p>
<p>High levels of unemployment lead to more unequal earnings distributions in 2001 and 2006, but not in 1996 as the coefficient estimate is not statistically significant. GDP growth rates in the mid 1990s were generally low and it is likely that cyclical unemployment played a less pronounced role in raising inequality in the labour force during those years. The 2001 and 2006 findings uphold the more traditional view that a rise in the aggregate unemployment rate tends to have a greater negative impact on workers at the lower end of the earnings distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042098011410335">Erksoy, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Results for the industrial mix variable show that a higher percentage of workers employed in manufacturing industries has a mitigating effect on earnings inequality across Canadian cities. There is not much change in the regression estimates, nor in the beta coefficients, for this variable from 1996 to 2006. Such consistency is testament to the role of manufacturing activity in maintaining an equalising effect upon earnings distributions, as blue-collar pay in those industries is generally higher and there are higher rates of unionisation than in the more variably paid service sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042098011410335">Harrison and Bluestone, 1988</xref>). This supports the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0042098011410335">Soroka (1999)</xref> who points to the growth in urban service-sector employment as a driver of inequality for both male and female workers. Increases in inequality due to deindustrialisation may also be compounded by increasing import competition from low-wage countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098011410335">Breau and Rigby, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>From 2001 onwards, higher female participation rates across urban labour markets have an equalising effect on earnings inequality. This development breaks from previous research presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042098011410335">MacPhail (2000)</xref> which suggests that the female participation rate is positively associated with overall income inequality in the 1980s, largely because of increased inequality among female workers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0042098011410335">Soroka (1999)</xref> also finds that the effect of service-sector employment is greater on female inequality than male, although he presents evidence that female earnings distributions are beginning to reflect male earnings distributions. Our findings suggest that, by 2006, a 1 percentage point increase in the female participation rate corresponds to a 0.43 point decrease in the Gini. This finding is likely to be not so much a result of a rapidly increasing share of women in the workforce since 1996, but rather evidence of the rapidly increasing level of their earnings relative to men, which corroborates the arguments put forth by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042098011410335">Fortin and Schirle (2006)</xref> in Canada and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098011410335">Kopczuk <italic>et al</italic>. (2010)</xref> in the US.</p>
<p>The proportion of the metropolitan population that is of visible minority status (including Aboriginal people) is positively correlated with earnings inequality. Visible minorities continue to face various forms of discrimination in the labour market, stemming from spatial, racial or immigration pressures, and thus are prone to increased barriers to equal pay. However, what is notable here is the variable’s diminishing impact over time. In 1996, a percentage point increase in the number of visible minorities represented in the labour force yielded a 0.160 point increase in the Gini. By 2006, the coefficient estimate drops to 0.077, although it is still statistically significant at the 0.10 level. This is also reflected in the beta coefficients which indicate that the percentage of visible minority in 2006 does not have the dominant relative influence on metropolitan inequality that it did in 1996. This evidence points to at least two possible processes: the focus of Canadian immigration policies upon the recruitment of higher-educated and thus higher-earning immigrants (although immigrant earnings are not climbing in recent years as policy-makers had expected; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0042098011410335">Picot <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>) and the good news of a fundamental shift away from structural discrimination faced by visible minority native-born and immigrants. On the other hand, its diminishing significance (and its lower contribution to explained variance in 2006) may only suggest that factors other than cultural association are growing relatively in the determination of urban inequality. Further research is necessary to tease out these possibilities, but their presence nevertheless points to the changing structure of inequality.</p>
<p>As for the remaining three explanatory variables, the results are less obvious in their effects upon metropolitan inequality. Whereas the percentage of a city’s seniors relative to the labour force does appear to increase earnings inequality in 1996 and 2006, the variable inexplicably loses its significance in 2001. Notwithstanding the latter puzzling result, this more broadly could be related to the demands of caring for elderly family members, which may take away from an individual’s hours at work. Furthermore, there is a negative correlation between median earnings and the percentage of seniors relative to the labour force (<italic>r</italic> = −0.389* in 1996 and <italic>r</italic> = −0.577* in 2006). This is evidence that cities with younger working populations are more likely to have greater levels of median earnings which, as discussed earlier, can dampen inequality (up to a point).</p>
<p>In sum, major changes in the composition of variables associated with urban labour force economic inequality have occurred between 1996 and 2006. Although most coefficient estimates carry the expected signs, variables such as city size, economic development, the unemployment rate, the rate of female participation in the labour force and the percentage of visible minorities have each changed in significance and magnitude over the course of the decade. These changes point to important structural changes in the distribution of earnings.</p>

<p>Growth in the size of a city’s labour force and its share of visible minority persons is associated with increased inequality. Conversely, positive changes in economic development and the percentage of workers in manufacturing activities tend to have a negative effect on earnings inequality across cities. These results corroborate those of the regression levels presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042098011410335">Table 2</xref>. That our panel estimates correctly reproduce four of five consistently significant relationships found in the cross-sectional results is an encouraging sign that the models of earnings inequality at the metropolitan level are correctly specified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042098011410335">Plosser and Schwert, 1978</xref>).</p>
<p>Somewhat puzzling is the non-significant result for the female participation rate. Here, the fact that the first-difference and fixed-effects models yield different results for female participation rates does lead us to interpret the statistical significance of the latter in the cross-sectional OLS models with some caution. There are likely to be other unobserved confounding factors interacting (i.e. highly correlated) with the female participation rate variable in the levels regression which the first-difference and fixed-effects transformations remove. Insufficient time variation in the female participation rate may also partly explain the non-significant result.</p>
<p>Overall, looking at how changes in explanatory variables have influenced changes in earnings inequality across metropolitan areas while controlling for unobserved heterogeneity confirms most of our cross-sectional results. A strong manufacturing base is central to providing more widely shared economic benefits, while city size and the wage differentials faced by visible minorities continue to play a significant role in predicting increases in inequality across the Canadian urban system.</p>

<title>6. Conclusion</title>
<p>The nature and structure of earnings inequality across Canadian metropolitan areas have changed over the past decade. In this article, we investigate these changes using unpublished data from the 20 per cent long-form sample of the census. Our paper makes two important contributions.</p>
<p>First, results from our descriptive analyses suggest that two emerging geographical divides characterise metropolitan earnings inequality over the 1996 to 2006 period. One is that between larger cities and smaller—more peripheral—cities. The other is between cities located in western provinces and their counterparts in the eastern provinces. In effect, these findings signal a growing imbalance between rapid-growth and slow-growth (or even declining) cities and support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042098011410335">Filion’s (2010)</xref> prognosis of a growing polarisation of the Canadian urban system.</p>
<p>Secondly, results from our cross-sectional and panel model analyses provide insights as to why these changes occurred. City size becomes an increasingly important determinant of metropolitan earnings inequality. Deindustrialisation is consistently shown to increase inequality. The percentage of visible minorities in the labour force is also positively related to earnings inequality, although its impact appears to be lessening over time, perhaps as a result of changes to immigration policies in the 1990s and reduced wage differentials. In contrast, whereas the level of economic development was once inversely related to economic inequality, it has lost its significance as an equalising variable since earnings growth is now concentrated in the top percentiles of the distribution. There is also some evidence that the ageing of the population, relative to the number of workers, may be leading to increased levels of inequality and that the higher rate of female participation in the labour force has an equalising effect on the distribution of earnings as female pay rates have climbed substantially in the past decade. However, panel estimates suggest that the latter result needs to be interpreted with some caution.</p>
<p>We acknowledge certain data induced limitations to our analyses. Although our panel models control for unobserved heterogeneity on an <italic>ad hoc</italic> basis, we are not able to control explicitly for the impact of important institutional (for example, unions, minimum wages) and trade-related factors likely to be influencing earnings inequality at the metropolitan level. Likewise, we do not have annual data which would have allowed us to look at shorter-term movements in earnings inequality, nor do we have information on taxes to investigate how changes to the redistribution system may have influenced recent patterns of inequality (although the national-level study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042098011410335">Frenette <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>, suggests that the tax and transfer system was less redistributive in the 2000s compared with the mid 1990s).</p>
<p>Despite these caveats, the results brought forth in this paper present policy-makers with distinct challenges. For example, it is clear that more attention must be paid to changes in the distribution of earnings across Canada’s urban areas, especially in the largest cities where inequality has rapidly increased. It is also clear that inequality growth is not just a question of failing redistribution mechanisms. Rather, it is in large part driven by employment income dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0042098011410335">Saez and Veall, 2005</xref>) which reflect structural changes in the labour force and the wider economy. Policy-makers must address the fact that economic growth in Canada no longer translates into widely shared gains in wages. Finally, several factors are contributing to the rise in earnings inequality. Hence, from a policy perspective, our findings support the view that the development of human capital (i.e. education, skills development and training) is important but not enough on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042098011410335">Banting 2005</xref>). More broadly, programmes designed to promote job growth—especially in manufacturing industries—and reduce local unemployment rates should help to curb the rise in inequality across Canadian cities.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, three broad strands of the literature can be identified. The first deals with issues of social justice and the normative dimensions of inequality (see, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0042098011410335">Smith, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0042098011410335">Sen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042098011410335">Macleod and Eisenberg, 2006</xref>). The second area deals with the consequences of inequality (in terms of social dysfunction, health declines and impacts on economic growth). The third strand seeks to understand the causes of inequality. The brief literature review developed in this article focuses on the latter.</p>

<p>International comparisons of patterns of inequality are always difficult because of differences in statistical data sources, income definitions and the assumptions used to compute measures of inequality. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042098011410335">OECD (2008)</xref> study reports on changes in income distribution using a common set of assumptions and methodology applied to representative national micro datasets. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0042098011410335">Figure 1</xref>, the Gini coefficient is calculated for equivalised household disposable income. Market-income-based Gini coefficients, which are conceptually closer to the earnings-based Gini used in this paper, are not available for comparative purposes.</p>

<p>Specifically, in order to be included in the analysis, a city had to satisfy the following conditions: be categorised as either a CMA and CA in all three censuses; have a total population in 2006 greater than 20,000; and, its constituent 1996 and 2001 CSDs had to correspond with 2006 CMA/CA boundaries. The first two conditions are imposed to examine those distinctly and dependably urbanised areas in Canada (effectively removing 40 of 144 combined CMAs/CAs in the 2006 census). The third condition represents a limitation of the data in that certain—smaller—cities with major boundary conflicts between earlier CSDs and their respective 2006 CMAs/CAs are excluded from the study. This condition removes an additional 17 urban areas which leaves a total of 87 metropolitan areas with consistent geographical boundaries for 1996, 2001 and 2006.</p>
