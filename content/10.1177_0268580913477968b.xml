<p>As the latest contribution to the growing topic of climate change and society, John Urry’s book is a welcome addition laying out an admirably ambitious project – to discipline sociology toward acknowledging the centrality of carbon in social systems of practice. Not only will such a disciplining benefit sociology by aligning it more closely with imminent collective problems faced in the near future, but will also make sociology more relevant to public debates over social responses to climate change, which Urry sees as too dominated by natural scientists and economists. In this regard, his work constitutes a forwarding of the general mission of environmental sociology, to better understand how social problems and practices are enmeshed in natural entities and processes.</p>
<p>Urry begins <italic>Climate Change and Society</italic> by noting a depressingly catastrophic imagined future – a coming epoch of resource depletion and climate change consequence that sociology should engage on a wider scale. The first chapter culminates in a clarion call for the discipline to make a ‘resource-turn’. Here Urry suggests that the notion of post-carbonism could trump post-modernism as a grand theme organizing the experiences to come in the twenty-first century. The rest of the book engages an array of topics, ranging from how scientists arrive at consensus on climate change processes, to the carbon-dependence that so many social practices often taken for granted, to an imagined set of possible (but not necessarily probable) future societies characterized by a dearth of carbon energy resources.</p>
<p>The book may have deserved a slightly more specific title, however. Some of the chapters simply offer summaries available elsewhere in the social science literature on climate change, and Urry’s specific contribution seems to lie in his focus on fossil fuels as a basis for so many social relationships and societal structures. This ‘resource-turn’ is a most welcome argument for the discipline, but the overwhelming focus of the book is on carbon. Urry paid little attention to a variety of climate change dynamics not reducible to fossil fuels, including freshwater, biodiversity, non-energy resources in general, or even alternative energy resources in particular. In this sense, his argument (and the book itself) may have been more aptly characterized as <italic>Carbon and Society</italic>. Climate change is sweeping in its implications – and the fossil fuels that propel this process need not be the only resources under consideration (though they are a huge topic in themselves).</p>
<p>Has Urry accomplished his goal of disciplining sociology to recognize the dependence of social practice on fossil fuels? Probably not. The book is too narrowly focused for such an ambitious goal. Few connections are made between resource dependence and race/class/gender intersectionality or changes in the welfare state, to name only two topics of general interest to sociologists. Indeed, these are the connections necessary to fully discipline the sociological tribe around resource-dependence or climate change and society. If anything, environmental sociologists seeking to discipline sociologists in general along the lines of energy and climate change now have a clearer understanding of how to move the sub-discipline forward.</p>
<p>Moreover, we might ask if there are more productive ways of achieving this disciplinary goal. During the presentation of possible post-carbon futures, Urry sets up scenarios ranging from an environmentalist system of local sustainability to an undesirable Mad Max-style energy warlordism. This approach to futures follows a logic of deductive backcasting. However, a more inductive logic starting from present-day conflicts may provide a more useful, inclusive, and potentially unifying attempt to get sociologists to systematically incorporate climate change into their research areas. Here researchers could combine a variety of topics in political sociology and social stratification, introducing environmental concerns to new communities of scholarship. This type of analysis would allow the argument to be structured by conflict theory, particularly as conflict stems from the materiality underlying climate change processes. One entry into the resource-turn could focus on the scarcity of carbon in a global context of increasing energy demand. This reality often takes a back seat to the analysis of climate change impacts within the literature. This other side of the climate change-coin is often acknowledged but frequently underemphasized in its impacts, and suggests a number of new questions. Which institutional sites within society constitute the key areas of conflict determining which type of post-carbon future will come to fruition? Do we currently have any indication of the basis for conflicting coalitions over energy resources? To what degree and in what ways will these coalitions be reducible to class, nationality, or lifestyle? These are a few meso-level questions missing from Urry’s macroscopic account, and constitute a significant lacuna in furthering the goal of disciplining sociology toward carbon, or integrating scholarly analysis of climate change with ‘society’.</p>
<p>While the book understandably fell short of its ambitious goal, it did lay out the basis for a reflective discussion. In this sense, it rightly stands alongside contributions on the topic by other established scholars such as Ulrich Beck or Anthony Giddens. Overall, the book may be limited in its usefulness for sociologists already steeped in the consideration of climate change and society. However, it may provide a nice point of entry for those sociologists who are yet to engage climate change with their research, or for students otherwise unfamiliar with the broad topic of climate change and society.</p>
