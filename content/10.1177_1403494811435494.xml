<abstract>
<p><italic>Aims</italic>: Socioeconomic inequalities in disability pensioning are well established, but we know little about the causes. The main aim of this study was to disentangle educational inequalities in disability pensioning in Norwegian women and men. <italic>Methods</italic>: The baseline data consisted of 32,948 participants in the Norwegian Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (1995–97), 25–66 years old, without disability pension, and in paid work. Additional analyses were made for housewives and unemployed/laid-off persons. Information on the occurrence of disability pension was obtained from the National Insurance Administration database up to 2008. Data analyses were performed using Cox regression. <italic>Results</italic>: We found considerable educational inequalities in disability pensioning, and the incidence proportion by 2008 was higher in women (25–49 years 11%, 50–66 years 30%) than men (25–49 years 6%, 50–66 years 24%). Long-standing limiting illness and occupational, psychosocial, and behavioural factors were not sufficient to explain the educational inequalities: young men with primary education had a hazard ratio of 3.1 (95% CI 2.3–4.3) compared to young men with tertiary education. The corresponding numbers for young women were 2.7 (2.1–3.1). We found small educational inequalities in the oldest women in paid work and no inequalities in the oldest unemployed/laid-off women and housewives. <bold><italic>Conclusions</italic>: Illness and occupational, psychosocial, and behavioural factors explained some of the educational inequalities in disability pensioning. However, considerable inequalities remain after accounting for these factors. The higher incidence of disability pensioning in women than men and the small or non-existing educational inequalities in the oldest women calls for a gender perspective in future research.</bold></p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Updated research on disability pension and its causes is important as the political, social, economic, and cultural conditions are continuously subject to change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494811435494">1</xref>]. In Norway disability pension is granted when claimants are considered at least 50% permanently incapacitated for any work due to disease, injury, or handicap. Even though the disability pension is based on medical criteria, non-medical factors also play an important role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494811435494">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494811435494">4</xref>]. Over the last decades we have seen substantial labour market changes in Norway, with an increasing participation in paid work among women, as well as in the level of their education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494811435494">5</xref>]. Over the same period we have seen a growth in the Norwegian disability pension rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494811435494">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494811435494">4</xref>] with an overrepresentation of women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494811435494">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494811435494">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494811435494">9</xref>].</p>
<p>Socioeconomic inequalities in disability pension are well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494811435494">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494811435494">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494811435494">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494811435494">12</xref>]. However, studies on socioeconomic inequalities in disability pension have mostly used social class as indicator of socioeconomic position and/or have been conducted on men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494811435494">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494811435494">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494811435494">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494811435494">12</xref>]. Attention should be paid to monitoring the socioeconomic gradient in disability pensioning, considering structural changes in the labour market and an overall increase in the level of education over the last decades, particularly in women. There are some studies on educational inequalities in disability pension, but these are based on old data, are cross-sectional, or have short follow-up time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494811435494">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494811435494">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494811435494">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494811435494">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494811435494">13</xref>].</p>
<p>The aims of this study were: (a) to make an updated study of educational inequalities in disability pensioning in Norwegian women and men and (b) to examine the contribution of long-standing limiting illness and occupational, psychosocial, and behavioural factors in the explanation of educational inequalities in disability pensioning.</p>

<title>Study population</title>
<p>All inhabitants aged 20 years and older residing in the Nord-Trøndelag county in Norway, were invited to the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study 1995–97 (HUNT 2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494811435494">14</xref>]. The study included a clinical examination and self-report questionnaires. In the whole of the HUNT 2 study, 65,600 persons participated, accounting for 71% of the adult population. In our study, the lower age limit was 25 years, when most persons have completed their education. The upper age limit was set at retirement age, which is 67 years in Norway.</p>
<p>After excluding 18,473 persons who were outside the age range 25–66 years, we were left with 47,127 persons. From this sample we excluded 6,078 persons with disability pension and 201 persons with contractual pension ≥50% at baseline. In addition we left out 57 persons with missing information on educational level, leaving us with 40,791 persons. To be able to consider occupational factors in the explanation of educational inequalities in disability pensioning in our working population, we further excluded 3,716 housewives, 1,010 with no information on employment status, 1,209 under education or in military service, and 1,908 who were unemployed/laid-off, leaving us with 32,948 persons in paid work (employed and/or self-employed).</p>
<p>Each participant contributed person time from the date of participation in the HUNT 2 study until disability pensioning (<italic>n</italic>=4,502), attending the contractual pension scheme or reaching 67 years (<italic>n</italic>=4,509), death (<italic>n</italic>=413), or the end of follow up on 31 December 2007 (<italic>n</italic>=23,524). We performed separate analyses on the housewives and the unemployed/laid-off. No multivariable analyses were made for these groups since numbers were small.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1403494811435494">
<title>Disability pension</title>
<p>Information on the first date of disability was obtained from a database of national insurance, created by Statistics Norway and the National Insurance Service. Data were linked using the unique 11-digit identity number given to each citizen at birth. The identity number was removed before the data were available to the investigators. Date of disability was defined as the point in time when a person’s earning ability was permanently reduced by at least 50% due to sickness, injury, or handicap. The date of disability pensioning thus represents the first day of sickness benefit for all persons who were later granted a disability pension.</p>
<p>The disability pensioning process usually starts with long-term sickness, and relevant treatment and rehabilitation should have been tried. For all practical purposes, disability pension has been a one-way event usually lasting until retirement pension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494811435494">3</xref>]. From 2004 a time-limited disability pension was introduced as an alternative to permanent disability pension, aiming at persons who are considered to have some chance at returning to work or expanding their work participation. However, time-limited disability pension has been shown to mainly work as a precursor for permanent disability pension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494811435494">15</xref>]. In the working population, 566 out of 4,502 disability pensioners were time limited. The corresponding numbers in the unemployed/laid-off population were 78 out of 367 and in the housewife population 114 out of 536.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1403494811435494">
<title>Educational level</title>
<p>Data on the highest achieved educational level in 1995 were available from the Norwegian Standard Classification of Education by Statistics Norway. We reclassified the educational data into three levels: primary education (primary and lower secondary school, ≤9 years), secondary education (upper secondary and post secondary school, 10–12 years), and tertiary education (first and second stage of tertiary education, ≥13 years).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1403494811435494">
<title>Long-standing limiting illness</title>
<p>Long-standing limiting illness was measured as the reporting of suffering from any long-standing limiting somatic or psychiatric illness, disease, or disability at baseline vs. not (duration of at least one year). This variable corresponds closely to the main disability eligibility criteria in Norway; a permanent reduction by at least 50% in a person’s earning ability due to sickness, injury, or handicap. About 15% of our working population reported a long-standing limiting illness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1403494811435494">
<title>Occupational factors</title>
<p>Occupational factors were measured by: (a) physically demanding work: often or almost always worn out vs. seldom or almost never worn out; (b) concentration- and attention-demanding work: often or almost always worn out vs. seldom or almost never worn out; and (c) job satisfaction: less than good satisfaction vs. good or very good satisfaction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1403494811435494">
<title>Psychosocial factors</title>
<sec id="section9-1403494811435494">
<title>Social network</title>
<p>Social network was categorised as: (a) marital status: single, divorced/separated, and widowed vs. married; (b) number of good friends: one or less vs. more than one; and (c) participation in organisation activities: never or a few times a year vs. more than once a month.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1403494811435494">
<title>Health conditions</title>
<p>A self-esteem symptom scale was constructed from four items by a 4-point Likert-scale version of the Rosenberg self-esteem instrument [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494811435494">16</xref>]. The range of the sum score was from 0–12 where a higher score indicates lower self-esteem. The scores were dichotomised with cut-off levels seven or greater vs. less than seven.</p>
<p>Finally, symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed using the self-rating Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494811435494">17</xref>]. The symptom scale consists of seven items covering anxiety and seven items covering depression by a 4-point Likert scale. Scores of these scales were dichotomised with cut-off levels eight or greater vs. less than eight.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section11-1403494811435494">
<title>Behavioural factors</title>
<p>Behavioural factors were: (a) smoking: current smoker vs. not current smoker; and (b) physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494811435494">18</xref>]: inactive and minimally active vs. highly active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494811435494">19</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1403494811435494">
<title>Statistics</title>
<p>The analyses were stratified by gender and age (25–49 years and 50–66 years). We used the Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of disability pension by educational level. The HR was adjusted for age as a continuous variable within each age group. We further adjusted for long-standing limiting illness and occupational, psychosocial, and behavioural factors in our working population.</p>
<p>We reduced the risk of bias and loss of precision and power due to missing data by multiple imputation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494811435494">20</xref>] for the multivariable analyses. We had information from national registers on the most important data: education, disability pension, the contractual pension scheme, and death. Information on age and gender from the HUNT study was complete. The variables with most missing values were taken from the second questionnaire, which was to be returned by mail after the clinical examination in the HUNT study. The most affected variables (occupational factors, number of friends, self-esteem, and organisational activity) thus had 14–20% missing values. The other variables from the HUNT questionnaires had 0–8% missing values. Multiple imputation was performed by chained equations (MICE) method in Stata 11.0 with missing at random assumption. We imputed 20 datasets, and estimates of the parameters of interest were averaged to give a single mean estimate. Results from complete case and multiple imputation analyses were almost similar. We chose to present the multiple imputation analyses as this gives us the opportunity to compare the same population (32,948 persons in paid work) before and after inclusion of all contributing factors. We also estimated age-adjusted hazard ratios for disability pension by educational level for housewives and the unemployed/laid-off. HR are reported with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).</p>
<p>The study was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics, the Norwegian Data Inspectorate and the HUNT Publication Review Board. All participating subjects provided written consent.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We found considerable educational inequalities in disability pensioning, and the incidence proportion was higher in women than in men. As expected, illness was the strongest predictor of disability pensioning. However, educational inequalities were not fully explained by the illness variable and the occupational, psychosocial, and behavioural factors. There were small educational inequalities in the oldest women in paid work and non-existing inequalities in the oldest housewives and unemployed/laid-off women.</p>
<p>The strength of this study is that it covers a total Norwegian county population. The use of data on both education and disability pension from national registers allowed for a valid and reliable assessment of the main exposure and outcome variables. By using the first date of disability pensioning rather than the date of being granted a disability pension, we prevent a possible mixing of effects from being in a disability process at baseline. Further, the incidence of disability pension in the Nord-Trøndelag county has been shown to closely follow the Norwegian rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494811435494">3</xref>]. We also reduced the risk of bias due to missing data and loss of precision and power by multiple imputation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494811435494">20</xref>] for the multivariable analyses.</p>
<p>However, contributing factors were based on self-reporting, and we were not able to consider fluctuations and changes in baseline information over time. It is possible that other factors than considered in this study may contribute in the explanation of the educational inequalities. A repeated measurement study design and more indicators might have given more accurate estimates. The participation rate for the HUNT 2 study was 71%. A non-participation study showed that the main reasons for not attending the health study were lack of time or having moved out of the county (20–44 years) and being busy in job, forgotten the invitation, or had no reason (45–69 years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494811435494">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Education was used as a measure of socioeconomic position as education is important in structuring later work and income, and key to one’s position in the stratification system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494811435494">21</xref>]. There was an educational gradient in both women and men, and in the youngest (25–49 years) and the oldest (50–66 years) age groups. The gradient was most pronounced in the youngest age groups, with a magnitude from 3- to 4-fold risk from primary to tertiary educational level. The finding of more pronounced educational gradients in the youngest age groups coincides with a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494811435494">3</xref>], and may be a result of health-related selection, particularly affecting persons with low education.</p>
<p>The basic pattern of inequalities resembles a previous Norwegian total population study by Krokstad <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494811435494">3</xref>] with baseline data from 1984–86. By limiting our material mainly to employed persons, an educational gradient was found even among the oldest women. However, we found no educational gradients among the oldest housewives or unemployed/laid-off women. It may be that personal educational level is not a well-fitted indicator of social standing for the oldest women, who were born between 1929 and 1945. These women experienced ambiguous expectations towards women’s role and more variation in their life course than the “housewife generation”: educated women tended to postpone marriage and childbirth while women with low education followed a more traditional life course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494811435494">22</xref>].</p>
<p>There were large educational inequalities in the unemployed/laid-off population as well, and the incidence proportion of disability pension was higher in the unemployed/laid-off persons compared to the working population. This was as expected as other studies have shown a higher risk of disability pension after business closure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494811435494">2</xref>] or downsizing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494811435494">23</xref>].</p>
<p>As found in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494811435494">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494811435494">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494811435494">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494811435494">9</xref>], the incidence proportion of disability pensioning was higher in women than men. Two main explanations have been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494811435494">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494811435494">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494811435494">7</xref>]. The working conditions in the female labour force are physically challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494811435494">6</xref>], particularly in the healthcare sector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494811435494">7</xref>]. Furthermore, dual-working women are mentioned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494811435494">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494811435494">7</xref>] – but this explanation has to our knowledge not been studied in relation to disability pensioning. A Norwegian study found no support for the dual-working explanation theory in relation to sickness absence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1403494811435494">24</xref>], while another study found indications for such explanation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494811435494">25</xref>]. Both sickness absence and disability pensioning is more prevalent in women than men, but little is known about why this is so.</p>
<p>In additional bivariate analyses, illness was the strongest predictor of disability pensioning. However, educational inequalities were not explained by illness. A recent study found that health problems only accounts for a small part of the association between socioeconomic position and disability pensioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494811435494">26</xref>]. Such findings have been discussed as a result of “health-related work problems” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494811435494">13</xref>]. Education-based selection to occupations can cause more health-related work problems for those with lower education: the more education, the less physically stressful and more flexible jobs. This may result in persons with similar health problems having different opportunities/chances for continuing work. The pathway from education to health and disability pensioning may go through diverse physical, social, and interpersonal environments – and adaptations to these [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1403494811435494">27</xref>]. Environments which are associated with different levels of socioeconomic position may vary in how much control individuals have, emotional and instrumental support, and exposure to conflict and threats.</p>
<p>The educational gradients were somewhat attenuated but not explained by long-standing limiting illness and occupational, psychosocial, and behavioural factors. In the fully adjusted model, the magnitude of the inequalities was 2- to 3-fold from primary to tertiary education. A Norwegian study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1403494811435494">28</xref>] found that occupational factors contributed most to educational inequalities in disability pensioning. However, even after including working conditions and lifestyle factors, they still found considerable educational inequalities. Krokstad <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494811435494">3</xref>] reported similar findings. The remaining inequalities may be a result of various factors associated with socioeconomic position, health conditions that are not appropriately measured, or other unmeasured circumstances.</p>
<p>Even if one finds which factors statistically explain educational and socioeconomic inequalities in health and disability pensioning, the results should be cautiously interpreted. Phelan <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1403494811435494">29</xref>] highlights the issue of interpretation by showing persistent social inequalities in mortality even when risk factors and diseases that are presumed to explain such inequalities have changed radically. Finally, reverse causality cannot be ruled out. A recent American study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1403494811435494">30</xref>] showed that, even after taking into account, parental income, education, and social class, poor health in childhood was significantly associated with lower educational achievements, poorer health, and lower socioeconomic status in adulthood.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we found considerable educational inequalities in disability pensioning. Illness and occupational, psychosocial, and behavioural factors explained some of the inequalities. However, even after accounting for these factors, inequalities were two to threefold from primary to tertiary education. Considering the higher incidence of disability pensioning in women than men, and the small or non-existing educational inequalities in the oldest women, a gender perspective on disability pensioning is interesting.</p>
