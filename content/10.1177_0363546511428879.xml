<p><bold>Background:</bold> Several factors influence clinical outcome after autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) for the treatment of cartilage defects of the knee joint.</p>
<p><bold>Hypothesis/Purpose:</bold> The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of cell quality on clinical outcome after ACI. The hypothesis of the authors was that cell quality at the time of transplantation influences clinical outcome after ACI for cartilage defects.</p>
<p><bold>Study Design:</bold> Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> A total of 80 patients were included in the present study. Knee function was assessed before surgery as well as 6, 12, and 24 months after ACI using standard instruments (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC], Lysholm, and Tegner scores). Cell quality was evaluated by determination of antigen expression of CD44 expression, aggrecan, collagen type II, and cell viability.

<p>Various factors influencing clinical outcome after autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) as a treatment of full-thickness cartilage defects of the knee joint have been identified. These include the cause and location of the defect, patient age, smoking habits, short duration of symptoms, prior knee surgeries, and insurance status such as workers’ compensation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511428879">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511428879">23</xref></sup> Furthermore, technical modifications sought to improve the classic ACI technique seem to positively influence the incidence of postoperative complications such as hypertrophy of the implant. Based on these investigations, patient-specific factors that are correlated with an improved clinical outcome could be identified. Recently, some authors describe a superiority of characterized chondrocytes versus arthroscopic microfracturing, suggesting a significant influence of cell quality on the quality of repair tissue and clinical outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546511428879">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546511428879">31</xref></sup> However, scientific proof concerning the influence of isolated quality parameters during the cell expansion process for this observation is still lacking. Although various parameters could potentially be used to evaluate cell quality of human chondrocytes, in the present study, we focused on cell viability, CD44 antigen expression, aggrecan expression, and expression of collagen type II.</p>
<p>CD44 is a transmembrane glycoprotein. As a cartilage-relevant surface marker, it mediates cell adhesion and migration and is thought to have regulatory functions in chondrocytes, not necessarily on differentiation, but probably on proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511428879">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546511428879">2</xref></sup> It has been reported that CD44 is the principal receptor for hyaluronic acid (HA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511428879">3</xref></sup> Hyaluronic acid can regulate growth and function of chondrocytes by binding to CD44 receptors on chondrocytes. CD44 therefore seems to play an important role in chondrogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546511428879">30</xref></sup> Barbero et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511428879">4</xref></sup> reported that chondrocytes with an increased expression of CD44 exhibit a superior capacity to generate cartilaginous tissue. CD44 might additionally be associated with pathological activities in inflammatory processes of the joints and cartilage (eg, rheumatoid arthritis),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511428879">11</xref></sup> and it seems to be associated with cartilage malignancy because high expressions were found in cartilage-associated tumors (eg, chondrosarcoma).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546511428879">36</xref></sup> Still, little is known about its in vitro influence on successful chondrocyte proliferation and expansion for eventual ACI.</p>
<p>Collagen type II is cartilage specific and has been shown to be the primary collagen in cartilage tissue. It has important mechanical properties of collagen fibers that provide stiffness and strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546511428879">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546511428879">29</xref></sup> Numerous studies used collagen type II as a marker to effectively demonstrate in vitro chondrocyte proliferation and expansion,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511428879">27</xref></sup> and some authors also describe collagen type II as a marker that correlates with a native phenotype chondrocyte.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511428879">9</xref></sup> Nevertheless, its predictive value for successful ACI procedures has not been determined. In healthy cartilage, proteoglycans form 5% to 10% of the tissue’s wet weight. Aggrecan is the major proteoglycan in articular cartilage and is synthesized and secreted continuously by healthy chondrocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511428879">17</xref></sup> It draws water into the tissue and creates large osmotic swelling pressures and therefore plays an important role in expanding and hydrating the matrix. It helps the articular cartilage to form a durable but pliable load-bearing surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511428879">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546511428879">22</xref></sup> Age-related decreases in proteoglycan synthesis have been described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511428879">10</xref></sup> With the exception of patients under 20 years of age, we did not see any significant decrease in proteoglycan synthesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546511428879">26</xref></sup> Similar to collagen type II, there have not been any reports on its influence on the success rate after ACI.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was therefore to analyze the influence of cell quality based on expression of CD44, aggrecan, and collagen type II, as well as cell viability on the clinical outcome following ACI. To classify and to further estimate the relevance of cell quality on outcome, its influence was quantitatively compared with patient-specific as well as defect-specific parameters.</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>A total of 80 of 84 consecutive patients (follow-up rate, 95%; 4 patients were lost at follow-up and could not be reached 24 months after surgery) who reached a minimum follow-up of 24 months after ACI for focal, full-thickness cartilage defects of the knee joint graded III and IV according to the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) classification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511428879">7</xref></sup> treated between October 2005 and December 2007 were included in the present study. All patients were enrolled in this study before surgery and evaluated using Lysholm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546511428879">21</xref></sup> and subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511428879">7</xref></sup> Patient characteristics are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546511428879">Table 1</xref>. All parameters including patient age, body mass index (BMI), defect location, defect size, defect cause (degenerative: no trauma; posttraumatic: patient reported trauma more than 6 months before treatment; traumatic: patient reported trauma less than 6 months before treatment), number of defects, and prior surgeries were evaluated before patients were enrolled in the present study. Follow-up examinations were performed at 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery. Results of 59 patients of this case series investigating a general efficiency of the cell-seeded collagen-matrix-supported ACI (ACI-CS) technique have been reported earlier.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511428879">24</xref></sup> In all patients, indication for ACI was determined during routine arthroscopy of the affected knee joint. The ACI was performed in all defects exceeding 3 cm<sup>2</sup>, while in smaller defects, arthroscopic microfracture was preferred. Corresponding cartilage lesions, uncontained defects, and defects of the subchondral bone plate exceeding a depth of 3 to 4 mm were considered as exclusion criteria for ACI-CS. Further exclusion criteria were malalignment of more than 5° of the affected lower limb as assessed by full-leg weightbearing radiographs and previous resection of more than one third of the meniscus. During arthroscopy, chondrocytes were harvested using a standardized cartilage biopsy tool (Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) from the intercondylar notch.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546511428879">25</xref></sup> In all patients, ACI-CS was performed as described earlier.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546511428879">32</xref></sup> Between 1 and 2 million chondrocytes/cm<sup>2</sup> defect (CartiGro Autologous Chondrocytes, Metreon Bioproducts GmbH, Freiburg, Germany) were applied 5 to 10 minutes before transplantation to the spongy side of the porcine type I/III collagen membrane (Chondro-Gide, Geistlich, Wolhusen, Switzerland). Fixation of the cell/matrix constructs was performed as described earlier. In brief, 6.0 PDS sutures were used to achieve a solid fixation to the surrounding tissue. In addition, fibrin glue (TissueCol, Baxter, Unterschleissheim, Germany) was used to seal the defect and for additional fixation.</p>

<p>Continuous passive motion (CPM) was recommended to all patients after ACI-CS starting on day 1 after surgery. Patients were instructed to use CPM devices for a minimum of 4 hours per day. Limited weightbearing (maximum of 20 kg) was recommended for 6 weeks after ACI. Subsequently, weightbearing was increased step by step until full weightbearing was allowed. Full weightbearing was achieved approximately between weeks 7 and 9. Individual limits of flexion were given depending on exact defect location to avoid early exposure of the tissue graft to axial compression and shear forces. In detail, for patellofemoral defects, flexion was limited up to 30° for 2 weeks after surgery, while flexion was increased to 60° during weeks 3 and 4 and to 90° during weeks 5 and 6. For femorotibial defects, no general limit of flexion was recommended. Only in such cases with very posterior defects was flexion limited to 90° for 6 weeks following ACI.</p>
<p>For follow-up evaluation before surgery and in the further clinical course, subjective IKDC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511428879">6</xref></sup> and Tegner scores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546511428879">34</xref></sup> were used according to general recommendations.

<title>Processing and Quality Assessment of Human Chondrocytes</title>
<p>After cartilage harvesting, samples were sent to Metreon Bioproducts GmbH in a sterile transportation medium (CellGro Chondro, CellGenix, Freiburg, Germany). After enzymatic digestion (at least 12 hours) with 5 mL 0.1% collagenase (Nordmark, Uetersen, Germany), cell suspension was centrifuged (300<italic>g</italic>, 20°C, 5 minutes), supernatant was discarded, and chondrocytes were resuspended in serum-free medium (CellGro Chondro, CellGenix) supplemented with 40 ng/mL bFGF (CellGenix) and 40 ng/mL PDGF (CellGenix). Initial cell counting was assessed by trypan blue staining (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California). For in vitro expansion, chondrocytes were seeded on coated T-flasks (BD Biosciences, Erembodegem, Belgium) in serum-free medium containing bFGF and PDGF. After 2 passages (approximately week 3) and as an in-process control, an alginate bead culture was performed as described by Häuselmann et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546511428879">14</xref></sup> with minor modifications by using 10 µg/mL IGF-1 (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota) and 10 µg/mL TGFβ-1 (R&amp;D Systems) instead of fetal bovine serum. Alginate beads were cultured in 4 mL of serum-free medium (CellGro Chondro, CellGenix) and harvested after 4 days in culture. Cartilage-specific surface antigen expression was analyzed by flow cytometry. For immunofluorescence staining, phycoerythrin (PE)–conjugated monoclonal antibody specific for CD44 was obtained from BD Pharmingen (Heidelberg, Germany). Monoclonal antibody directed to collagen type II was provided by Millipore (Billerica, Massachusetts). Monoclonal antibody directed to aggrecan was purchased from Invitrogen. As secondary labeling, reagent PE-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) was used. Phycoerythrin-conjugated IgG2b (BD Pharmingen) served as isotype-matched control antibody. For determination of viability, the proportion of 7-amino-actinomycin D (7AAD)–positive cells (BD, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey) was assessed. Chondrocytes were analyzed using FACScalibur (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, California) with a laser excitation at 488 nm (argon laser). A total of at least 10 000 events for each sample were analyzed using CellQuest Pro 6.0 software (Becton Dickinson). For expression of CD44 antigen, aggrecan, and collagen type II, the percentage of positive cells was taken as a basis of quality assessment and included in the statistical evaluation.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>For statistical analysis, SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS Inc, an IBM Company, Chicago, Illinois) was used. All parameters were tested for normal distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. For statistical evaluation of knee function before and after ACI, nonparametric Mann-Whitney rank sum test was applied. <italic>P</italic> values &lt;.05 were considered significant. Comparisons were performed between scoring (separately for Lysholm and IKDC scores) at 6, 12, and 24 months against the preoperative score. To evaluate all relevant factors that influence clinical outcome 24 months after ACI, a linear regression analysis was performed including patient- and defect-specific factors (preoperative knee function according to IKDC score, preoperative activity according to Tegner scale, number of defects treated, defect cause, defect size, BMI, and defect location) on the one hand and cell quality parameters (initial cell density after biopsy, expression of CD44 antigen, expression of aggrecan, expression of collagen type II, amount of avital chondrocytes) on the other hand. Regression analysis was performed separately for different time points after ACI (6, 12, and 24 months). Pearson coefficient (range, –1.000 to +1.000) was used to describe the extent of correlation. <italic>P</italic> values &lt;.05 were considered statistically significant.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Many parameters that influence clinical outcome after ACI for isolated cartilage defects of the knee joint have been described recently. Interestingly, the analysis concerning prognostic relevant factors focused on patient-specific and defect-specific parameters in recent studies, despite the fact that in every cell-based tissue-engineering application such as ACI, the cells applied to the individual patient represent the basis of the therapy. This is especially important in techniques where autologous cell products are used such as in ACI because there are relevant differences concerning the quality of expanded cells before transplantation in terms of collagen type II expression as well as aggrecan content and proportion of CD44-positive cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546511428879">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recently, several studies were able to demonstrate a potential influence of cell quality on clinical outcome following ACI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546511428879">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546511428879">31</xref></sup> Nevertheless, while Pietschmann et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546511428879">28</xref></sup> described a rough determination of cell quality concerning viability, Saris et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546511428879">31</xref></sup> used a patented scoring system to analyze cell quality. In these studies, individual parameters associated with the ability to produce a cartilage-specific matrix that influenced clinical outcome were not identified. The main purpose of the present study was to provide a more detailed analysis of individual factors associated with cell quality and their influence on clinical outcome. In the present article, the antigen expression of CD44, collagen type II, aggrecan, and the amount of avital cells were used as quality parameters. Because cells were pulled out of the expansion process for quality assessment, which were not actually implanted afterward, these parameters strictly observed were used as surrogate parameters. The possible influence of different handling (additional alginate culture) of the cells used for quality assessment and those that were implanted needs to be mentioned as a possible limitation of the methodology of the present study.</p>
<p>Measurement of CD44 in chondrocytes by FACS analysis and correlation with chondrogenic phenotype has been successfully used by a variety of groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511428879">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511428879">12</xref></sup> In the present study, expression of collagen type II and aggrecan was performed also based on a FACS analysis. This method has been described before and verified with classic methods such as sulfate incorporation or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546511428879">35</xref></sup> Because of its effectiveness, this method has been established as quality control by the cell expansion facility and has been used in more than 500 patients. Nevertheless, only extracellular expression of cell-bound collagen type II and aggrecan fragments can be detected by using this technique. This helps to explain the relatively low rates of collagen type II–positive and aggrecan-positive cells as presented in the present article and might be explained by the culture conditions in which chondrocytes were expanded under normo-oxide conditions, which does not correspond to the physiological synovial fluid. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that absolute values for those parameters increased after culture conditions were changed to hypoxic conditions in 2008 (data not shown because patients were enrolled in the present study until 2007 and therefore were not part of the present project). Alternatively, analysis on mRNA level has been inaugurated by other groups using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or real-time fluorescence monitoring.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511428879">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511428879">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Concerning the clinical data evaluated in the present study, a significant improvement in knee function as assessed by IKDC score compared with preoperative function was found at all time points during follow-up. Nevertheless, evaluation of function alone was not the purpose of the present study and has been described in 59 patients earlier.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511428879">24</xref></sup> Results and overall improvement seem to correspond with other studies. A continuous improvement of knee function up to 24 months after surgery was observed, which also has been described by other authors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511428879">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546511428879">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546511428879">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>To identify parameters that influence postoperative outcome, preoperative knee function according to IKDC score, preoperative activity (rated by Tegner scale), age, defect size, defect location, and BMI were correlated with clinical outcome. Analogous findings have already been reported in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511428879">20</xref></sup> Similar to other authors, we found a negative correlation for the parameters patient age and BMI with postoperative functional outcome. A negative correlation was also found for defect size in terms of larger defects, which showed a correlation with inferior clinical outcome. Interestingly, a good preoperative knee function and high sports activity seemed to be valuable predictors of superior postoperative function. This has been demonstrated in earlier studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511428879">20</xref></sup> In addition to these patient-associated parameters, cell quality parameters have been analyzed concerning the influence of postoperative outcome. A significant influence could be detected for the expression of CD44 and collagen type II, while a negative correlation was found for cell viability. Although the correlation factors are moderates ranging up to .381, the present study demonstrates that the quality of expanded chondrocytes potentially has significant influence on postoperative function. Interestingly, superior clinical outcome at 24 months postoperatively showed stronger correlations with collagen type II expression when compared to 6-month values. This finding stands in sharp contrast to the fact that early strong/frequent collagen II expression sets off improved clinical results at later time points. While aggrecan did not show this specific trend in the collective of patients analyzed in this study, the information obtained from these observations could be beneficial in the future to potentially provoke collagen type II expression in vitro prior to retransplantation by using tissue-engineering applications.</p>
<p>With regard to the correlations at 6 months after surgery, preoperative knee function seems to influence IKDC with a correlation factor of <italic>r</italic> = .489 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01), followed by preoperative activity level (<italic>r</italic> = .302, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). Although as early as 6 months after ACI a correlation of IKDC with collagen type II expression was found, this correlation was much weaker (<italic>r</italic> = .251, <italic>P</italic> = .03) compared with preoperative function and activity. Interestingly, at 6 months after ACI, defect-specific parameters did not significantly influence clinical function. At 12 months after ACI, a significant (negative) correlation was found concerning defect size (<italic>r</italic> = –.224, <italic>P</italic> = .023) and defect location in terms of inferior results, which were found in patellofemoral defects (<italic>r</italic> = –.196, <italic>P</italic> = .041). In addition, patient age was negatively correlated with IKDC at 12 months (<italic>r</italic> = –.236, <italic>P</italic> = .017). With additional significances for preoperative knee function (<italic>r</italic> = .461, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01), preoperative activity (<italic>r</italic> = –.299, <italic>P</italic> = .004), collagen type II expression (<italic>r</italic> = .242, <italic>P</italic> = .015), and a negative correlation with the number of avital cells (<italic>r</italic> = –.245, <italic>P</italic> = .014) there are a large number of parameters that seem to influence knee function 1 year following ACI. This number of relevant parameters even increases further at 24 months after surgery, when an additional negative correlation for BMI is observed (<italic>r</italic> = –.243, <italic>P</italic> = .015) (detailed significances in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546511428879">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, preoperative knee function and preoperative activity grade seem to influence clinical outcome at all time points, while patient-specific parameters, defect-associated factors, and parameters related to cell quality additionally seem to influence clinical outcome 12 and 24 months after surgery. Knee function 24 months after ACI therefore appears to depend on various factors including cell quality. The results obtained in this study demonstrate that cellular aspects, as part of a multi-item approach, seem to have an effect on clinical outcome after ACI. This might be important information to justify a prospective artificial enhancement of in vitro cell quality in the future to further improve the clinical outcome and therefore overall patient satisfaction. These observations highlight the importance of a better understanding of chondrocyte quality in vitro. Continuous work in this field might be of importance to improve the quality of chondrocytes for subsequent ACI in order to further optimize clinical outcome. Nevertheless, additional factors that could potentially be influenced by either the surgeon or the patient (including a reduction of BMI) should not be neglected.</p>
