<p>Actuators based on standard technologies often do not comply with environmental constraints on electromagnetic noise. Even though shape memory actuators are not ferromagnetic, activation by Joule’s effect poses a question about magnetic compatibility. This article presents a new concept design of a rotary actuator based on a double coil of NiTi wire, which permits to abate dramatically the electromagnetic fields generated. A particular implementation of the idea was devised as a case study to investigate feasibility. The desired torque and stroke were 83 N cm and 40°, respectively, and mechanical tests confirmed that a maximal stroke of 38° can be achieved for resisting torques ranging from 33 to 122 N cm. The built prototype proved appropriate to respond to the needs of a neuroscience study requiring mobilization of the ankle. So, this device was tested during measurement of brain activity in healthy subjects with both magnetoencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging, that is, diagnostic equipment with very demanding constraints on electromagnetic noise. Neither magnetoencephalography signals nor the functional magnetic resonance imaging images were affected by any electromagnetic noise or artifacts, allowing for further analysis and extraction of neurological features. Besides the discussed uses, this type of actuator could find an application in several fields, such as biomedical, robotic, aerospace, or automotive.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Shape memory alloy (SMA) is a compositionally heterogeneous class of materials, comprising a number of intermetallic compounds made up of transition and posttransition metals of different groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1045389X12462648">Funakubo, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1045389X12462648">Lagoudas, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1045389X12462648">Miyazaki and Otsuka, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1045389X12462648">Otsuka and Ren, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1045389X12462648">Otsuka and Wayman, 1998</xref>). The most relevant compound of this class, employed in most technological applications to date, is nearly equiatomic NiTi, which is also supplied commercially in many semifinished forms, such as wires, ribbons, bars, plates, and tubes. The general name of NiTi (or TiNi) or Nitinol refers to several grades of the alloy found in the quasi-stoichiometric range from 49%at Ni to 51%at Ni.</p>
<p>These alloys owe their name to a particular functional characteristic called the shape memory effect (SME). The SME is based on an athermal reversible martensitic transformation and is, from a phenomenological point of view, the capability of these alloys to undergo very conspicuous deformation through martensite detwinning and display macroscopic strain recovery upon heating above a certain characteristic temperature, generally referred to as <italic>A<sub>f</sub></italic> in the specialized literature. In the case of binary NiTi, the stable low-temperature phase (below the <italic>M<sub>f</sub></italic> temperature) is a B19′ martensite, while the high-temperature structure is a B2 parent phase. <italic>M<sub>f</sub></italic> and <italic>A<sub>f</sub></italic> are separated by a temperature difference of around 20°C in the solution-treated state. Cold working and aging treatments are necessary to optimize mechanical and functional properties, to adjust the characteristic temperatures and to stabilize multistep transformation (R phase) if required (for details cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1045389X12462648">Otsuka and Ren, 2005</xref>). Typically, NiTi is aged at 350°C–650°C and water quenched, and this process also shape-sets the material into the shape “to be remembered.” Treatment temperature and duration have to be honed to the application and size of the specimen. Cycling can be required to stabilize performance, especially for actuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1045389X12462648">Lagoudas, 2008</xref>). The mechanical properties, as described by a stress–strain tensile loading curve, may vary but, in the most representative cases, show an initial linear elastic range, followed by a long flat plateau and a final increase. Most of the macroscopic shape change happens along the plateau region (up to around 6% long) and corresponds to the microstructural phenomenon of martensite detwinning. There are two phenomenological varieties of the unloading curve, according to the temperature of the test. If the test is carried out below <italic>M<sub>f</sub></italic>, unloading occurs along a line and strain decreases only minimally, so no macroscopic shape recovery is often observable. Full recovery is obtained by successive heating above the <italic>A<sub>f</sub></italic> temperature. This is called the SME proper. However, if the test is carried out above <italic>A<sub>f</sub></italic>, the unloading curve is different and shows a long recovery plateau, at lower stresses than the loading one, and a final linear decrease toward zero-strains. The curve, in this case, is hysteretic, and the shape recovery is attained without any need to heat the material. When the test is conducted at room temperature <italic>T<sub>r</sub></italic>, and <italic>A<sub>f</sub></italic> lies below <italic>T<sub>r</sub></italic>, SME is given the special name of pseudo-elastic effect (PE). In all cases where the test temperature falls between <italic>M<sub>f</sub></italic> and <italic>A<sub>f</sub></italic>, the behavior is intermediate. Cold-work, aging, and precipitation of second phases can have very significant effects on all aspects of the mechanical curves, and in particular, on the height and separation of the plateaux and cycling stability. So has the precise test temperature: through the Clausius–Clapeyron effect, stress is proportional to temperature, and thus, in particular, plateau stress levels are increased by an increase in test temperature. Finally, the compositions in the range of 49%at–50.5%at Ni (Ti-rich) tend to show SME proper, while the Ni-rich ones (50.6%at–51%at Ni) have a pseudoelastic behavior at room temperature. As a general trend, the higher the Ni content, the lower are the transformation temperatures.</p>
<p>Actuation based on SMAs (SME proper) has drawn researchers’ and designers’ attention as an alternative to other technologies especially for applications requiring strict compliance to a set of compatibility (e.g. mechanical, biological, and weight) and environmental constraints. Noteworthy are also the uses in miniaturized components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1045389X12462648">Nespoli et al., 2010</xref>), lightweight systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1045389X12462648">Ikuta, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1045389X12462648">Mavroidis, 2002</xref>), sensing–actuating systems (e.g. actuators interacting with changing environmental variables; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1045389X12462648">Benafan and Vaidyanathan, 2009</xref>), low-noise or low-impact appliances (e.g. actuators with reduced interaction with the environment; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1045389X12462648">Pittaccio et al., 2011a</xref>), and self-sensing controllable devices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1045389X12462648">Liu et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>This article describes a design scheme used to develop an amagnetic rotary actuator based on coiled SMA wire. Many SMA rotary actuators have been proposed and can be found in the literature (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1045389X12462648">Nespoli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1045389X12462648">Song, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1045389X12462648">Tanaka and Yamada, 1991</xref>). None of them, however, was specifically designed to be compatible with demanding electromagnetic constraints. The proposed scheme, by appropriate changes of design parameters, should make it possible to obtain several different implementations suitable for diverse requirements in terms of torque and angular stroke. In particular, one such implementation is presented in detail. The design parameters in this case were adjusted in order to obtain a rotary device able to generate a stable stroke of 40° against a resisting torque of 83 N cm when powered with a 7-s current pulse of 0.7 A.</p>
<p>The particular implementation of the SMA rotary actuator presented was later utilized in a collaboration with the Neuroscience Laboratory at ITAB laboratories, Chieti University, Italy, for the mobilization of the ankle joint during studies employing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI), and magnetoencephalography (MEG). The purpose of these studies was to determine the brain activity and reactions during passive mobilization of the lower limb, having a direct impact on the mapping and understanding of cortical networks. Most traditional actuation systems could be employed during fMRI and MEG only if the actuator is kept outside the acquisition room, and the mechanical energy is transferred to the subject via pneumatic, hydraulic, or mechanical (pulleys, ropes, and so on) means. These systems are usually complex and suffer from long transmission lines accompanied by dissipative and delay effects. It would be desirable to place actuators directly inside the acquisition room, but this limits the possibilities of using many categories of actuators. Of course, electromagnetic actuators are, in general, not compatible with the MRI environment and also pneumatic or hydraulic motors could hardly get into the acquisition room because of their bulky metallic components. Generally speaking, in order to be utilized in an MRI acquisition room, actuators should not include ferromagnetic and conductive materials. However, it is reported that small parts made of magnetic resonance (MR)-incompatible materials do not compromise safety or generate image artifacts as long as they are sufficiently small and appropriately positioned relative to the imaged area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1045389X12462648">Tsekos et al., 2007</xref>). This clears the way to the use of SMA actuators in this field, provided that some specific design rules are respected and that they are applied to body segments sufficiently distant from the head, which is the area of principal interest in neuroscience. The article will show some details about the performance of the actuator developed in relation with the particular task of mobilizing the ankle joint, discuss its limitations in this application, and analyze the measurements of amagnetic behavior, which were carried out during the MEG acquisitions.</p>
<p>The use of an SMA actuator in neuroscience can also be considered as an expansion of the biomedical applications of these materials: biomedicine is at present the major field of use for NiTi, especially in implantable devices for cardiology, orthopedics, and orthodontics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1045389X12462648">Petrini and Migliavacca, 2011</xref>). Mainly selected grades displaying pseudoelastic behavior at internal body temperature are employed; in some implementations, the SMA element can be refrigerated before insertion to ease the procedure by exploiting SME once. Other biomedical devices for true actuation have been designed and constructed to implement innovative solutions for passive limb mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1045389X12462648">Pittaccio et al., 2009</xref>), assistive robotic rehabilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1045389X12462648">Pittaccio and Viscuso, 2011</xref>), drug delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1045389X12462648">Reynaerts et al., 1997</xref>), and so on. Our search has only identified one previous example of the use of SMA actuation (linear actuator) for neuroscience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1045389X12462648">Pittaccio et al., 2011a</xref>).</p>

<title>Concept</title>
<p>Rotary SMA actuators usually employ SMA wires that are connected to elements, which can rotate with respect to one another about a central axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1045389X12462648">Nespoli et al., 2010</xref>). When the SMA wire transforms into the austenite phase, the linear stroke Δ<italic>L</italic> is converted into a rotation Δθ of the moving parts. This solution is optimal because the geometry of the wire, with respect to other shapes (ribbons, sheets, bars, and so on), facilitates the injection of an electric current and shortens cooling time. Moreover, SMA wires can be suitably utilized to develop high-force actuators, since in axial traction the wire cross section is uniformly loaded, unlike what happens with other types of actuators (i.e. springs). The main disadvantage of using SMA wires in actuators is that long portions of the wire are often needed to produce suitable strokes, as recoverable strain is limited: for applications requiring very few movement repetitions, the limit may be as high as 8%, but 4%–5% should be considered as the maximum value for cyclic applications, depending on the intensity of loading stress and the number of repetitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1045389X12462648">Otsuka and Wayman, 1998</xref>). Increasing desired fatigue life generally limits the available strain: while a 2%–3.5% strained wire can resist 10<sup>5</sup> cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1045389X12462648">Tuissi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1045389X12462648">Van Humbeek and Stalmans, 2005</xref>), very demanding cyclic applications (N &gt; 10<sup>6</sup>) can be addressed only by limiting strain to less than 0.5% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1045389X12462648">Otsuka and Wayman, 1998</xref>). When very long wires are needed, it can be convenient to coil them in order to improve overall compactness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1045389X12462648">Nespoli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1045389X12462648">Pittaccio et al., 2009</xref>). The electric current flowing in coils of wire produces, according to Ampère’s law, an overall magnetic field <inline-formula id="inline-formula1-1045389X12462648"><mml:math display="inline" id="math1-1045389X12462648"><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>→</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> along the central axis of the solenoid, which is directed according to the right-hand rule with respect to flowing current <inline-formula id="inline-formula2-1045389X12462648"><mml:math display="inline" id="math2-1045389X12462648"><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>→</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. Apparently, this is inconsistent with the aim of fabricating a magnetically transparent actuator. However, a very simple solution can be found exploiting the same physical laws of electromagnetic fields. In fact, given two identical and concentric solenoids traversed by the same electric current in opposite directions, the magnetic fields generated by the coils will mutually annihilate. A general implementation of this concept is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1045389X12462648">Figure 1</xref>. The two ends of the SMA wire are fixed to an aluminum disk A, while the middle of the wire connects to a similar disk (part B—not shown in the picture, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1045389X12462648">Figure 2(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1045389X12462648">(b)</xref>) parallel to A and separated from A by the length of the central axis C; disk B is free to rotate about the central axis C that connects B to A thanks to a ball bearing that is used to reduce friction. One SMA wire is wound along a series of supports (pulleys) located in the space between disks A and B; the pulleys are linked to A through the shafts D. The first half of the wire forms a coil from one end at A to the middle of the wire (fixed on B). The second half of the wire is coiled in the same manner but in the opposite direction (from B to A), and running as close as possible to the first coil. By activating the SMA wire, the linear stroke Δ<italic>L</italic> is converted into a rotation Δθ of B with respect to A. Furthermore, the force that pulls B is given by twice the cross section of the wire, as the wire is arranged in such a manner that it forms two coils connected mechanically in parallel. For the present implementation, cooling is left to natural convection.</p>

<p>General concept of the rotary actuator. NiTi wire is coiled along a series of pulleys mounted on the shafts D and connects to both disks A and B (not shown) that can rotate about the central axis C. This very simple way of converting a linear movement into a rotation is improved by the double coiling of the wire, which guarantees high-force output and magnetic transparency during activation. This last property is a consequence of the fact that electric current flows in opposite directions in the forward and backward coilings.</p>

<title>Torque, stroke, and speed</title>
<p>The performance of a rotary actuator as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1045389X12462648">Figure 1</xref> depends on both the geometric parameters of the components and the SMA material characteristics. In this configuration, stroke is strictly related to the length of the coil of wire, that is to say, the number of turns and the length of each turn. The length of a turn can be described as the sum of portions of wire touching the pulleys and tracts suspended from one pulley to the next. The length of one complete turn is thus</p>

<p>With regards to actuation speed, the design can help make cycling time shorter and actuation faster. It is well known that SMA actuators have limited speed, particularly during cooling. The use of a double coil permits the reduction of the cooling time, given a set torque/stroke output. In fact, if the required pull is provided through a pair of wires (or one wire doubled up, as in our case), the wire diameter can be reduced by around 30% relative to the wire diameter of a single-coil actuator. This means that surface-to-volume ratio is increased, and the heat exchange figure (and hence the cooling speed) is improved.</p>

<title>Allowable strains</title>
<p>As stated earlier, fatigue life of SMA actuators is strictly connected to the values of strain at the working point. Reference values of maximum allowable strains were listed previously in section “Concept.” In order to optimize fatigue life for the application of interest, those values have to be compared with the maximum total strain in the design, which can be calculated by adding maximum employed working strain to the localized strain generated by the bending of the wire around the pulleys</p>

<title>A case study: requirements for a validation prototype</title>
<p>The general concept of a rotary actuator has been implemented with the aim of validating the scheme employed for dimensioning. With the general prerequisite of obtaining a <italic>compact and lightweight actuator</italic>, a desired stroke of 40° against a resisting torque of 75 N cm (nominal, 83 N cm for safety) and a fatigue life in the range of 10<sup>3</sup>–10<sup>4</sup> were considered as appropriate for a case study design. In fact, those functional constraints give the possibility of implementing a prototype with several turns of wire (at least around three double turns, so as to implement the core of the amagnetic design). In order to save some wire in the experiments, it was decided to use a deformation around 4%: even though cycling life would be diminished, it could be still significant for several applications. Testing fatigue life would also be feasible in reasonable amount of time. The chosen torque range is such that several everyday objects (e.g. masses around 1 kg) can be displaced. It was thought that for this reason, later testing opportunities would be kept open.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1045389X12462648">
<title>Implementation of the prototype rotary actuator</title>
<p>An implementation of the above-mentioned concept was built, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1045389X12462648">Figure 2</xref>. The wire is wound along a series of pulleys, mounted on six sturdy bronze shafts at the corners of a regular hexagon. The pulleys are made of a heat-resistant polymeric material and have a double triangular groove, which allows keeping the two coils as close as possible and the wire barely touching the surface of the grooves. All short circuits are prevented. The elements that connect the wire to the moving plates are nonconductive, and the two connectors on plate A also serve as electric junctions to the external power supply. All components were placed into a plastic case 140 mm in diameter and 25 mm in height. The mass of the prototype is 185 g (275 g including the case). The case has a radial arm 20 mm long with a small hole at 83 mm from the rotation axis of the actuator, by which connections can be made to external loads. The chosen design corresponds to a lever arm that varies across the movement in the range of 45–49 mm. For modeling purposes, a constant average value of <italic>b</italic> = 47 mm was used, with a maximum error estimate of ±5%.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned geometric characteristics of the implemented actuator are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1045389X12462648">Table 1</xref>. In this particular case, actuator layout was decided at the start of the design process, in order to limit overall dimensions a priori and implement a lightweight and compact prototype (referred to the desired stroke and torque output values). Further details on the refinement of the dimensional optimization, which has also taken into account the chosen SMA wire, are provided in section “Discussion.”</p>

</list>
<p>For the implementation of the prototype rotary actuator, a 0.25-mm-diameter commercial NiTi wire was considered (SmartFlex; SAES Getters S.p.A, Lainate, Italy). With this diameter, a 9 N load corresponds to 183 MPa on the wire cross section, which is below the desired limit of 200 MPa. The calorimetric characteristics were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC 220 SSC/5200; Seiko Instruments, Tokyo, Japan), and the results are reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1045389X12462648">Figure 3</xref>. The requirement on <italic>A<sub>s</sub></italic> is also satisfied. Stress–strain curves were acquired (DMA, Dynamic Test Analysis Q800; TA Instruments, New Castle, DE, USA) from samples of wire at 293 K (martensite) and at 358, 368, and 378 K (above <italic>A<sub>f</sub></italic> from DSC), in order to evaluate the recoverable strain. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1045389X12462648">Figure 4</xref> shows that the material can be expected to recover a strain of 3.65% when heated at 378 K from a room temperature of 293 K under a load of 9 N (183 MPa). Unfortunately, it was not technically possible to test austenite at higher temperatures, due to the limitations of the DMA load cell. The Clausius–Clapeyron constant was estimated to be 8.3 MPa/K from these data.</p>

<p>Strain-recovery tests were carried out by DMA on a new sample of the same wire in order to assess linear stroke in different loading conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1045389X12462648">Figure 5</xref>). Although the curves were recorded during temperature ramps as slow as 5°C/min, due to a known limitation of this instrument linked to thermal gradients and convective heat transfer delays, the thermocouple temperature reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1045389X12462648">Figure 5</xref> does not represent precisely the local temperature of the sample NiTi wire (this happens especially with thin wires). Despite this uncertainty, the calculated value of the Clausius–Clapeyron constant was 8.42 MPa/K based on the <italic>A<sub>s</sub></italic> and <italic>A<sub>f</sub></italic> data points (almost the same value obtained from stress–strain curves), suggesting that at least during heating, the error on temperature measurement is not a function of the applied load. For this reason, comparing the <italic>A<sub>f</sub></italic> estimated with the Clausius–Clapeyron relation for 200 MPa with the measured one, it can be inferred that measured <italic>A<sub>s</sub>, A<sub>p</sub></italic>, and <italic>A<sub>f</sub></italic> at 200 MPa are approximately 15 K higher than the real ones. For further modeling purposes, a value of 8.4 MPa/K will be used for the Clausius–Clapeyron constant.</p>

<p>Utilizing data from the stress–strain and strain-recovery curves, a suitable <italic>T<sub>H</sub></italic> temperature could be estimated. In fact, at 378 K, the stress–strain curve shows a residual strain of around 1.25% for a load of 9 N (making ε<italic><sub>max</sub></italic> less than required); it is therefore expected that an appropriate <italic>T<sub>H</sub></italic> will have to be above 378 K. In order to decrease the residual deformation substantially (below 0.5%), the strain-recovery curves predict that under a load of 9 N, the wire should be heated to around 400 K. By applying the 15 K correction, an estimate of a target <italic>T<sub>H</sub></italic> is &gt;385 K.</p>

<title>A later application: indications for use of the prototype in neuroscience</title>
<p>It should be noticed that the physics of SMA actuation gives the possibility of employing such an actuator also at different torque–stroke working points in a range around the design one. In doing so, it must, however, be realized that fatigue life expectancy can change and also the energy input characteristics may have to be modified.</p>
<p>For instance, the implemented actuator was later employed in a different but compatible biomedical application, where stroke is reduced, torque is increased, required fatigue life is at the bottom end of the design one, and actuation time is lengthened. This was a neuroscience study investigating brain reactivity during passive mobilization of the ankle, during which it was also possible to investigate the actual magnetic behavior of the prototype. The actuator had to be employed in order to produce dorsiflexion of the ankle joint (i.e. upward ankle flexion) during investigations of the brain reactivity to passive movement in healthy subjects. For this neuroscience study, MEG and fMRI were the selected tools for biosignal acquisitions. The device had to promote ankle dorsiflexion across a range that can be clearly perceived as movement by the subjects under study but will not cause nuisance or stretch reflexes. A healthy ankle joint can move in the sagittal plane in the approximate range of −40° to +30° (from negative to plantarflexion), but for the purpose of this study, the range of movement is limited to the negative and slightly positive angles in order to comply with those requirements. Furthermore, the movement should be smooth and slow.</p>
<p>SMA actuation should promote the ankle dorsiflexion against the resisting loads due to passive viscoelastic springback of the ankle and foot weight. In order to predict how the actuator would behave in this application, these loads have to be considered and modeled.</p>
<p>Foot weight has a limited influence in this particular application. In fact, the setup for the acquisitions in neuroscience requires that subjects should be seated on a chair with leg rest (MEG) or lie on a horizontal platform with their leg resting on a wedge-shaped cushion to lift the knee slightly (fMRI): this means that in either case, foot weight will act only through a minor vector component in the direction of plantarflexion (say 17% if leg lies at an angle of 10° down from the horizontal).</p>
<p>The reference curves for the passive viscoelastic characteristic of the ankle joint were acquired by an isokinetic machine (HUMAC NORM; CSMi Medical Solutions, Stoughton, MA, USA) that passively moved the foot of a healthy volunteer in the sagittal plane at 6°/s, that is to say, slow enough to avoid stretch reflexes. Through this information, and considering an average human being of 70 kg (foot length of 27 cm and foot mass of 1 kg), the total resisting torque for the ankle can be calculated. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1045389X12462648">Figure 6</xref> shows the viscoelastic and the total (viscoelastic plus weight) torque/angle characteristics of the ankle for the reference subject. The curves are hysteretic, since living tissues typically show viscoelastic properties. Notice that viscoelastic resistance is strongly dependent on the ankle angle and is nearly linear in the range of −30° to +10° (negative values toward plantarflexion). The total torque at the ankle reaches a maximum of 500 N cm: this is a large value for a single actuator as designed, but two of them working in parallel could be suitable for the purpose. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1045389X12462648">Figure 6</xref> shows also the characteristic of a 0.8-N/mm linear elastic spring employed to mimic the behavior of the ankle joint in fatigue tests (see section “Methods of characterization”). Notice that in the range of interest −30° to +10°, the spring matches quite well the total ankle resistance.</p>

A 30° offset was used, which descends from the chosen orientation of the actuator with respect to the ankle joint in consideration of the maximal dorsiflexion angle. It can be estimated that total resisting torque will be sufficiently high to produce martensite detwinning to approximately −12°, while angular stroke depends on the actual temperature reached by the wire. By heating the wire up to 378 K, the ankle joint would dorsiflex up to −4°. As plateau stresses for higher temperatures could not be measured directly, some (383, 388, 393, and 398 K) were estimated from the 378 K curve using the Clausius–Clapeyron equation (with a constant of 8.4 MPa/K). It is evident that increasing the temperature of the wire makes it possible to reach more dorsiflexed angles. Considering, for example, a temperature of 388 K (i.e. near the minimum estimated <italic>T<sub>H</sub></italic>), an angle of 3° can be reached.</p>

<p>As stroke, torque, and heating temperature in the present biomedical application are different from the design ones, fatigue life may also be different. According to the study protocol, each ankle should be dorsiflexed 32 times; so in order to test the chosen cohort of 12 subjects on both ankles, it was calculated that the total number of cycles should be 768. Thus, a fatigue life of around 1500–2000 cycles is considered satisfactory for the application.</p>

<title>Mechanical characterization of the validation prototype</title>
<p>The rotary actuator, mounting new wire, was tested by attaching a series of weights at a fixed distance from the center of rotation. The housing of the actuator has a hole at 83 mm from the axis of rotation that was utilized to suspend the static weights (4–15 N, with 1 N increments). In this manner, resisting torques in the range of 33–122 N cm were applied to the actuator. An electrogoniometer (SIM-HES-EG 042; Signo Motus srl, Messina, Italy) was attached to the external plastic shells that contain the actuator, to record the angular stroke during activation against various resisting torques. In this way, it was possible to obtain a pointwise characteristic of the device, with sufficient resolution. Heating power was provided, through Joule’s effect, by an electric current of 0.7 A injected during 7-s impulses, intermingled with 30-s lapses to allow for still-air convection cooling and position reset. This corresponds to a power supply during actuation of 18.9 W and an average power consumption during a full cycle of 3.57 W. Preliminary tests were conducted to measure the wire temperature during cyclic actuation with these pulse parameters. The wire temperature was measured by a thermocouple put into stable contact with the wire by an Ag paste. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1045389X12462648">Figure 8</xref> shows that the wire heats up to a measured value of 373 K. This value is probably significantly underestimated, as the thermocouple junction diameter (&gt;2 × 127 µm) was in the same order of magnitude as the wire and may have constituted a heat sink. Although the Ag paste may have provided improved thermal conductivity, its added (cold) mass could have caused more heat to be drained locally. These limitations are well known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1045389X12462648">Churchill et al., 2009</xref>) and, in our experience, lead to underestimating the wire temperature by at least 10 K, especially under dynamic conditions, and during the passage of current through the wire.</p>

<p>In order to test the cycling stability of the angular stroke, the actuator was cycled, until failure by fatigue, against a resisting torque of 83 N cm. The actuation was provided by 7-s current pulses at 0.7 A intermingled with 30-s laps for cooling and position reset.</p>

<title>Applicability of the prototype for the neuroscience study</title>
<p>A linear steel spring (0.4 N/mm) was attached to the hole in the actuator housing, to provide a resisting torque for the single actuator mimicking half of the resistance of the ankle joint (<italic>two</italic> actuators will in fact be used for the task of mobilizing the ankle). When the actuator angle was 0°, the spring was perpendicular to the housing arm. The spring was preloaded so that in this position, its resisting torque matched approximately the one measured for the ankle. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1045389X12462648">Figure 6</xref> shows a comparison between the total ankle resistance and the characteristics of a 0.8 N/mm spring.</p>
<p>For the specific application in neuroscience, an additional preferential requirement in order to optimize time windowing of the acquired MEG and fMRI signals and improve signal-to-noise ratio was that dorsiflexion should occur during 10 s. A preliminary activation test was carried out by measuring the angular stroke with two different current pulses. Besides, the 7-s current pulse at 0.7 A, also a 10-s-long profile, was considered, where current ramps to 0.7 A in 1 s and then remains flat for 8 s and finally ramps down to 0 A in 1 s. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1045389X12462648">Figure 9</xref> shows the comparison between the angular strokes generated by the two activation pulses. The longer pulse produces a small increase in stroke (roughly 0.3°), which is consistent with a slight raise of the wire temperature. By comparing these results (especially the upper end of the stroke—6.5°) with the curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1045389X12462648">Figure 7</xref>, it is possible to estimate the maximal wire temperature to be 395 K, which is coherent with the experimental results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1045389X12462648">Figure 8</xref>.</p>

<title>Magnetic tests</title>
<p>Magnetic noise produced by the activation of the actuator was measured using one superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) sensor of a MEG system. Within a shielded room, a rotary actuator was fixed at a distance of 1.5 m from the sensor, and the shielded room was locked. The electric power generator and the programming computer were kept out of the shielded room, and cables were passed through suitable ports in the shielding. The NiTi wire was activated by a direct current (DC) pulse (ramp to 0.7 A in 1 s, then flat for 8 s, and finally down to 0 A in 1 s).</p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to assess the incidence of actuator-dependent noise on the acquisition of useful biosignals, tests in both MEG and fMRI environment were carried out by measuring neural activity from a healthy subject’s brain during repeated passive mobilization of the ankle by an exoskeleton mounting of two actuators in parallel, activated simultaneously. As described earlier, also in these two cases, the electric power generator and the programming computer were kept out of the shielded rooms, and the activation timing was the same. Both MEG and fMRI tests were conducted at ITAB laboratories, University of Chieti.</p>
<p>The MEG system employed was based on 153 SQUID magnetometers covering the whole surface of the scalp.

The discussion will therefore focus on the selection of the parameters for the case study implementation and on the results of the tests carried out on the prototype. Furthermore, it was possible to use the prototype for a practical application in the field of neuroscience.

These constraints, apart from defining the required torque and stroke values, can also be exploited to limit actuator dimension and choose the most economical solution.</p>

<title>Material selection</title>
<p>The design concept of the rotary actuator with reduced electromagnetic noise is based mostly on geometrical considerations that make it possible to develop different implementations (in particular with different angular strokes) and produce the abatement of induced magnetic fields. However, in order to obtain an actuator with the desired torque, fatigue life, and actuation temperatures (and stroke), material selection plays a central role. This choice was made in the presented case study based on parameters measurable through mechanical and calorimetric tests conducted on the freestanding wire. The characteristics of the assembled actuator are expected to be linked to these parameters, even though it is evident that the interaction of different mechanical parts can affect final results. The strategy followed here neglects aspects such as friction, differential heating along the wire, and loading modes different from tensile. Only extra strain was taken into account by recognizing that the wire bends around the pulleys. In spite of those simplifications, the predictions on actuator performance were satisfactory, with strokes in the range of the desired 40°, corresponding to torques around 91 N cm. The influence of changing the material characteristics on the performance of this device will be dealt with in future studies. It is important to stress, in particular, that for applications requiring different working ranges, it will be mandatory to choose appropriate wire type, size, and actuation characteristics to exploit the material at its best.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1045389X12462648">
<title>Actuation performance of the implemented prototype in the nominal working range</title>
<p>The mechanical characteristics are in good accordance with the design specifications and predicted behavior. The angular stroke is within 10% of the maximum value for torques in the range of 57–122 N cm. According to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula8-1045389X12462648">equation (8)</xref>, the lower value of torque corresponds to around 120 MPa on the cross section of the selected wire. Below this level of loading, martensite curve is in the plateau region, so, small variations in the applied stress produce large variations in the accumulated strain. Increasing stress further does not lead to large increases in strain.</p>
<p>The temperature of the NiTi wire is difficult to measure. An attempt was made by employing thin thermocouples, but the results are likely to be affected by significant errors. The use of an infrared (IR) camera, even assuming spatial resolution was sufficient, would have posed the problem of identifying precisely the emission coefficient for the wire, which was considered beyond the scope of this article. Mathematical modeling was also ruled out as uncertain quantification of appropriate convection, and emission coefficients would have led to inaccurate results. On the other hand, it was possible to provide an indirect estimate of the <italic>T<sub>H</sub></italic> temperature by comparing the strokes calculated from static curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1045389X12462648">Figure 7</xref>) and the measured ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1045389X12462648">Figure 9</xref>). This estimated temperature (395 K) is appropriate to obtain quasi-complete shape recovery at 200 MPa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1045389X12462648">Figure 5</xref>) and is compatible with the constraints imposed to preserve the integrity of polymeric parts.</p>
<p>Cooling is left to natural convection in the presented implementation. It is theoretically possible to speed up this phase of the actuation cycle by using active refrigeration, but this would likely entail increases in energy expenditure and overall device dimensions.</p>
<p>In selecting the general requirements for the implemented prototype, the purpose was mainly to construct an object that could be tested quite easily, and that could have properties appropriate for applications in the force and displacement ranges of daily life (kilograms and tens of degrees). The question of fatigue life was approached in such a manner that testing could be carried out and repeated in a reasonable amount of time. For this reason and to save some length of wire during tests, it was chosen to use the wire at a strain of approximately 4%, which is quite high for any very durable application but not for a medium-duty one. On the other hand, it was assumed that fatigue life could be improved for a given stroke without changing the overall design concept: this could be done by using, for example, twice the length of the wire and changing the dimension of the device and/or the parameters <italic>k</italic> or <italic>n</italic> accordingly. A different implementation to prove this assumption has not been built yet, and this is left for future study.</p>
<p>With the parameters of the implemented actuator and a resisting torque of 83 N cm, the expected fatigue life, according to an article by the manufacturing company (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1045389X12462648">Fumagalli et al., 2009</xref>), should be in the range of 3 × 10<sup>4</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> cycles, accounting for at least 300 h of duty. Based on the tests carried out, it can be asserted that the stabilization of the actuator is complete after 550 cycles under a torque of 83 N cm. Probably due to the difference in loading between the freestanding wire and the wire mounted in the actuator, fatigue life, however, demonstrated a reduced order of magnitude (6.2 × 10<sup>3</sup>) with respect to the published data. It was anyway in line with desired and expected values (10<sup>3</sup>–10<sup>4</sup>).</p>

<title>Actuation performance of the implemented prototype in the neuroscience application</title>
<p>Mechanical modeling and testing were conceived to verify whether the implemented prototype could be reliably utilized in an application where resisting torque is higher and desired stroke is limited with respect to the design parameters. In particular, maximal stress on the cross section was estimated to be 320 MPa, while actuation strain was 1.8%. The use of two rotary actuators in parallel proved to be suitable for the mechanical task of moving the ankle of a healthy subject. The mechanical characteristics of the rotary actuator at different temperatures were estimated by employing <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1045389X12462648">equations (1)</xref> to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula9-1045389X12462648">(9)</xref> and the measured stress–strain curves for the chosen NiTi wire. This approach assumes that the wire is working in pure traction, which is the principal component of loading, so bending over the pulleys was neglected in dynamical terms. Moreover, the wire is supposed to be at the same temperature, although contact with the pulleys may actually decrease its temperature locally. This is acceptable to a first approximation, especially considering that the grooves in the pulleys were shaped as triangular indentations so that the wire would contact the pulley surface at only two discreet points on each cross section. Also friction between mechanical parts was not considered. This limitation was deemed acceptable because the aim of this simulation was to estimate the end points of the movement rather than the precise trajectory. Nonetheless, neglecting friction could lead to overestimation of stroke and underestimation of actuator torque losses. The comparison between the results of this mathematical modeling and the experiments shows that there is a good agreement. In particular, the lower end of the stroke is predicted with fairly good accuracy. The upper end of the stroke depends on the temperature that the wire reaches during heating. This temperature could not be measured reliably, but the experimental stroke is compatible with a final temperature in the range of 385—405 K. Provided that friction has a limited influence on the end point of the stroke, as it was our primary aim to obtain by selecting appropriate ball bearings and other mechanical parts, the maximal temperature reached by the wire can be estimated to be approximately 395 K.</p>
<p>Fatigue life in this case was somewhat shorter than for the test against 83 N cm (5236 vs 6222 cycles) but was still sufficient for the proposed neuroscience study. In fact, besides the tests presented in the article, the orthosis mounting two rotary actuators was actually employed in a MEG study with 12 healthy volunteers (overall 768 cycles plus some extra cycles for preparatory tests), during which it continued working in the expected manner and no failure was recorded. It is interesting to notice that, in this case, tests with the spring showed that drift is much abated, probably as a consequence of the very reduced force acting on the wire when the spring returns toward its less stretched condition.</p>

<title>Magnetic properties</title>
<p>The preliminary magnetic tests were carried out to estimate the magnetic field induced by the actuator when the NiTi wire is traversed by an electric current. The presented result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1045389X12462648">Figure 13</xref>) is affected by the added magnetic field induced by the passage of current cables and thus may be slightly overestimated. The measured field was <italic>four orders of magnitude</italic> lower than the typical values for many electric household appliances at the same distance from the sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1045389X12462648">Gauger, 1985</xref>), including those which mount electric rotary motors (food processors, can openers, and so on). It must also be considered that the housing of the presented rotary actuator is open and does not contain the magnetic flux effectively, so, further decrease in emissions could be obtained by using cases made of materials for magnetic field containment.</p>
<p>Magnetic transparency was also proved both during MEG and fMRI acquisitions. SQUID sensors are very sensitive to magnetic fields and have to be protected from any electromagnetic noise in order to avoid damage, saturation, or large artifacts. Cortical neural currents generate magnetic fields of a magnitude in the order of 10<sup>−13</sup> T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1045389X12462648">Malmivuo, 2000</xref>). Minor noise of low intensity and frequency can be accepted, provided it can be filtered out to retrieve a measure of the cortical magnetic biosignals. This was possible in the case of the present measurements, where software high-pass filtering at 1 Hz removed the artifact superimposed to the MEG signal.</p>
<p>The use of SMA actuators powered by Joule’s effect is not automatically compatible with MEG technology, but it could be made so for the present actuator thanks to the careful design of the interplay between geometric and energetic dimensioning.</p>
<p>The MR imaging technique is based on the action of high-intensity magnetic fields (up to 10 T) on the nuclear spins of hydrogen atoms in the living tissues. The use of such fields implies that ferromagnetic materials must be kept out of the MRI acquisition room, for sheer safety reasons and to prevent artifacts in the acquired signals. Any electric motor would not fulfill this mandatory requirement. The proposed NiTi actuator was built with only nonferromagnetic materials in order that basic requirements be met, and it could be taken into the fMRI acquisition room. However, passive magnetic transparency is not the only requirement for using any device in connection with fMRI. When electrical power is supplied, magnetic fields induced by current flowing into the conductors could interfere with signals, and image reconstruction would thus be affected by artifacts. The design of the proposed rotary actuator allowed for reduced levels of electromagnetic noise that did not affect the image reconstruction at all. The distance between head and ankle surely also plays a role in further decreasing the influence of the magnetic fields induced by the current flowing into the NiTi wire and the cables that supply power to the actuators. Further tests will investigate whether the shape memory actuators can be used in connection with fMRI studies of upper limb movement, that is to say, closer to the head and the area of maximum acquisition fields.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article presented a design concept for an SMA-based rotary actuator with reduced electromagnetic emission. The main idea behind this concept is that the two coaxial coils of NiTi wire can be activated by the input of an electric current in such a way that the current flows in opposite directions in the two coils. The practical achievements of this concept are that the two coils can work mechanically in parallel and give rise to opposite induced magnetic fields that tend to cancel out mutually.</p>
<p>The actuator design concept was demonstrated through the implementation of a completely functional prototype based on the configuration, <italic>k</italic> = 6, which was shown to be optimal given the chosen output requirements. The main result was the possibility of predicting the prototype performance based on the SMA wire characterization and a set of equations providing geometrical dimensioning and constraints. It was demonstrated that the prototype works well in the desired working range. The design parameters were chosen in order to be able to test different aspects of the general design scheme and implement a flexible tool for various applications. In fact, at lower and higher resisting torques, the available cyclic stroke generated remains greater than 30° in the range of 33–122 N cm, which may represent a nice set of working points for different applications. It was further demonstrated that the implemented prototype can be employed satisfactorily also for an application requiring a different working point (approximately 20°, 50–300 N cm). With the chosen working strain, fatigue life is limited to the range of 10<sup>3</sup>–10<sup>4</sup>, which is suitable for a number of applications. Should longer durability be desired, it could be achieved by decreasing the working strain (e.g. by making the wire longer) and utilizing the model equations to find a different set of optimized geometric design constants.</p>
<p>The magnetic transparency of the presented actuator during activation was proved through direct measurements of the emitted magnetic flux, which is of the order 1 pT at a distance of 1.5 m from the sensor. It was also shown that in practical cases, this noise level is completely acceptable and does not affect the quality of neuroscience data acquisition through MEG or fMRI.</p>
<p>The results obtained so far show the opportunities offered by solid-state actuation with SMA in solving practical problems connected to strict electromagnetic (and dimensional) requirements. Future work will be done to construct and test other layouts in different environments and applications.</p>
