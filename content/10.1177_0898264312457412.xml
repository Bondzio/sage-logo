<abstract>
<p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Analyses examine the extent to which adherence to recommendations regarding health behaviors cluster among older adults, whether people who adhere to multiple health behaviors are more likely to age successfully than those who adhere to fewer health behaviors, and whether some health behavior clusters are more closely associated with successful aging than others. <bold>Method:</bold> Cross-sectional data were collected using structured telephone interviews from 5,688 persons aged 50 to 74 living in New Jersey. <bold>Results:</bold> Prevalence odds ratio analyses indicated that differential cluster patterns exist. Logistic regression revealed that as the number of adherent behaviors increased so did the likelihood of aging successfully and that adherence to some health behavior clusters was more closely associated with successful aging than adherence to others. <bold>Discussion:</bold> Although adherence to more health behaviors was associated with a greater likelihood of successful aging, it is possible to age successfully by adhering to specific clusters of health behaviors.</p>

<p>Successful aging has long fascinated both scientists and lay people. Evidence that genetic influences account for only 20% to 25% of individual variability in successful aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898264312457412">Glatt, Chayavichitsilp, Depp, Schork, &amp; Jeste, 2007</xref>) has caused attention to be directed toward identifying how modifiable behaviors with strong associations to morbidity, mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898264312457412">Froshaug, Dickinson, Fernald, &amp; Green, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898264312457412">Mokdad, Marks, Stroup, &amp; Gerberding, 2004</xref>), and health care costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898264312457412">Goetzel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0898264312457412">Wang et al., 2006</xref>) influence successful aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898264312457412">Britton, Shipley, Singh-Manoux, &amp; Marmot, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898264312457412">Depp &amp; Jeste, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0898264312457412">Pruchno, Wilson-Genderson, Rose, &amp; Cartwright, 2010b</xref>). Overwhelmingly, these studies examined the influences of individual behaviors in isolation from other health behaviors, yet recent evidence highlights the importance of examining health behaviors in tandem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0898264312457412">Prochaska, Spring, &amp; Nigg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0898264312457412">Shankar, McMunn, &amp; Steptoe, 2010</xref>). The analyses that follow address the following questions: (1) To what extent is there evidence of clustering of health behaviors among older adults? (2) Are people who adhere to multiple health behaviors more likely to age successfully than those who adhere to fewer health behaviors? (3) Are some health behavior clusters more closely associated with successful aging than others? These analyses are the first to examine both the presence of clusters of health behaviors among older adults and their association with successful aging.</p>

<title>Clustering of Health Behaviors</title>
<p>Although there is evidence that adherence to individual recommendations regarding health behaviors, including exercising regularly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0898264312457412">Penedo &amp; Dahn, 2005</xref>), drinking alcohol in moderation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898264312457412">Cawthon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898264312457412">Maraldi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0898264312457412">Sabia et al., 2009</xref>), not smoking cigarettes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898264312457412">Depp &amp; Jeste, 2006</xref>), consuming a Mediterranean diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898264312457412">Munoz, Fito, Marrugat, Covas, &amp; Schroeder, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0898264312457412">Sofi, Abbate, Gensini, &amp; Casini, 2010</xref>), and maintaining a normal BMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0898264312457412">Hill, Catenacci, &amp; Wyatt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898264312457412">Jia &amp; Lubetkin, 2010</xref>) is associated with successful aging, most studies have examined adherence to isolated health behaviors. Recent studies suggesting that health behaviors may cluster within individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898264312457412">Chou, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0898264312457412">Poortinga, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0898264312457412">Schuit, van Loon, Tijhuis, &amp; Ocke, 2002</xref>) beg development of new research questions, methods, and theory. Evidence for clustering suggests that engaging in healthy behaviors is not randomly distributed; rather there are some people who adhere to health behaviors and others who do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898264312457412">Chou, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898264312457412">Jiao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0898264312457412">Poortinga, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Some research among adolescents and college students as well as in the general population finds that adherence to multiple health behaviors occurs with a probability greater than what would be expected if the health behaviors were independent of one another, providing support for clustering of health behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898264312457412">Chou, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0898264312457412">Pronk et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0898264312457412">Schuit et al., 2002</xref>). However, the extent of clustering varies as a function of the specific health behaviors examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0898264312457412">Berrigan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898264312457412">Fine, Philogene, Gramling, Coups, &amp; Sinha, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0898264312457412">Pronk et al., 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0898264312457412">Reeves and Rafferty (2005)</xref> found that only 3% of adults in the United States adhered to all four of the following health behaviors: being a nonsmoker, having a healthy weight, being physically active, and eating five or more fruits and vegetables a day. Evidence from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0898264312457412">Newsom, McFarland, Kaplan, Huguet, and Zani’s (2005)</xref> analysis of over 250,000 respondents from four of the largest epidemiological surveys in North America revealed that, on average, the percentage of shared variance among smoking, exercise, diet, and alcohol consumption was approximately 1%, suggesting the relative independence of these health behaviors.</p>
<p>The extent to which health behaviors cluster among older people is even less clear. In one of the few studies to examine the clustering of physical inactivity, heavy alcohol drinking, smoking, and low consumption of vegetables and fruits among old people, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898264312457412">Chou (2008)</xref> reported that clustering was most prevalent among men, very old people, and people with high levels of education. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0898264312457412">Shankar et al. (2010)</xref>, analyzing data from people aged 50 and older participating in the English Longitudinal Study of Aging found that only a small proportion of participants reported adhering to recommendations regarding smoking, physical activity, and alcohol, although adherence to all three health behaviors was greater than that expected on the basis of chance.</p>

<title>Successful Aging</title>
<p>Conceptual and empirical definitions of successful aging are myriad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898264312457412">Bowling &amp; Dieppe, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898264312457412">Depp &amp; Jeste, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0898264312457412">Rowe &amp; Kahn, 1998</xref>). Central to the debate about how successful aging should be defined is whether it can be identified by objective criteria or is a subjective value judgment. In earlier work, we developed a model of successful aging defined by its inclusion of two independent components: objective success (having few chronic diseases, ample functional ability, and little or no pain) and subjective success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0898264312457412">Pruchno, Wilson-Genderson, &amp; Cartwright, 2010a</xref>). According to our model, people can experience chronic disease and functional disability yet feel that they are aging successfully.</p>

<title>Health Behaviors and Successful Aging: A Conceptual Model, Methodological Implications, and Hypotheses</title>
<p>The search to identify the mechanisms responsible for why adherence to health behaviors reduces mortality and morbidity and promotes successful aging has focused largely on individual health behaviors. Yet consistent evidence that physical inactivity, excessive alcohol, cigarette smoking, an unhealthy diet, and obesity are each linked with the same negative health outcomes raises questions both about the nature of the relationship that these health behaviors have with one another and how they combine to influence health outcomes. If health behaviors cluster, there may be a common determinant leading some people to adhere to health behaviors while others eschew them. Clustering also raises questions about the extent to which health behaviors have synergistic or multiplicative effects on health. If a clustering model is operative, adherence to some combinations of health behaviors may be more beneficial to health outcomes than can be expected from the additive individual effects alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898264312457412">Breslow &amp; Enstrom, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0898264312457412">Slattery &amp; Potter, 2002</xref>). If, however, health behaviors do not cluster, questions regarding the independent influences that health behaviors have on health outcomes become more salient.</p>
<p>Studies examining the effects of multiple health behaviors on outcomes have taken three perspectives. The first is to examine the independent effects that multiple health behaviors have on outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898264312457412">Froshaug et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0898264312457412">Scarmeas et al., 2009</xref>). The second approach is to create a summary score representing the extent to which people adhere to multiple health behaviors and then relate that score to outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898264312457412">Khaw, Wareham, Bingham, Welch, Luben, &amp; Day, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898264312457412">Knoops et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0898264312457412">Van Dam, Li, Spiegelman, Franco, &amp; Hu, 2008</xref>). The third less frequently used approach examines how distinct combinations of health behaviors influence outcomes. Exemplary is a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0898264312457412">Reis, Loria, Sorlie, Park, Hollenbeck, and Schatzkin (2011)</xref> that found the odds of men developing diabetes was 28% lower when both the physical activity and diet score were in the low-risk category. When smoking was also in the low-risk category, men had 32% lower odds for developing diabetes. Those who were also in the low-risk category for alcohol consumption had 39% lower odds for developing diabetes. Men with all factors in the low-risk category had 72% lower odds of developing diabetes. Similar patterns characterized the sample of women.</p>
<p>Based on these studies, the following hypotheses were tested:</p>
<list id="list1-0898264312457412" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>People who adhere to one health behavior are more likely to adhere to other health behaviors.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Adherence to recommendations regarding exercise, alcohol, smoking, diet, and BMI will have independent associations with successful aging, with people who adhere to each behavior being more likely to age successfully than those who do not.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>People who adhere to a greater number of health behaviors are more likely to age successfully than people who adhere to fewer health behaviors.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Some combinations of adherent behaviors are more likely to be associated with successful aging than others.</p></list-item>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Data from 5,688 people participating in the Ongoing Research on Aging in New Jersey—Bettering Opportunities for Wellness in Life (ORANJ BOWL) panel were collected between November 2006 and April 2008. Study eligibility included being between the ages of 50 and 74, living in New Jersey, and having the ability to participate in a 1-hr English-language telephone interview. The sample was drawn from New Jersey because it is a highly diverse state whose demographic characteristics mirror those of the general U.S. population. Policies and procedures for protecting the rights of human participants established by The Institutional Review Board of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey were followed. Protocol for contacting and interviewing participants were approved by this board; consent to participate was verbal.</p>
<p>Panel members were recruited by telephone cold calling using list-assisted random-digit-dialing (RDD) procedures. Demographics of the targeted sample make coverage loss due to cell phone-only households very small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898264312457412">Blumberg &amp; Luke, 2007</xref>). In order to maximize the chances of making contact with a potential respondent, a computer-assisted telephone interview system was programmed to follow a complex set of call scheduling rules, staggering calls over various times of day and days of the week. All screening refusals, interview break-offs, and interview refusals were recontacted at least once, in an effort to convert them into completed interviews.</p>
<p>Screening interviews determining whether any eligible persons lived in the household were conducted with persons aged 18 and older. If screening indicated two or more age-eligible persons, all were listed in a Kish table, and one was chosen via computerized gender-weighted random algorithm. As such, all eligible individuals had an equal chance of being selected to participate. No substitutions were permitted.</p>
<p>Of the 151,246 phone numbers in the population, 32,678 completed the screen. In order to complete the sample, 1,060,838 calls were made, with an average of 7.01 calls made to each case. Using standard American Association for Public Opinion Research calculations, ORANJ BOWL achieved a response rate of 58.73% and a Cooperation Rate of 72.88%, consistent with or better than average RDD response rates.</p>
<p>Comparison of characteristics of ORANJ BOWL respondents with those of all persons age 50 to 74 living in New Jersey reveals that they have similar racial composition, rates of being born in the state, and marital status distributions. The ORANJ BOWL sample has a slightly higher proportion of females (63.7% to 53.3%) and a slightly higher percentage of individuals with advanced secondary degrees (18.5% to 14.8%), suggesting that the sample is an adequate representation of the population.</p>
<p>The ORANJ BOWL sample included 2,067 men and 3,621 women; mean age was 60.7 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 7.1). The average participant had a 2-year college degree, with education levels ranging from those who had not completed high school (5.4%) to those with a doctoral degree (4.2%). The modal education level among participants was a high school diploma (28.3%), with 19.5% completing a 4-year college degree. A majority of respondents were White (83.8%); 11.8% were African American. A majority of respondents were currently married (56.7%); 17.3% were divorced, 14.2% were widowed, 2.6% were separated, and 9.2% had never been married. Respondents had a mean of 2.1 children (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.60). The mean household income was between US$30,000 and US$80,000 (29.8%), with 19.1% reporting income less than US$30,000 and 41.1% reporting more than US$80,000.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p><italic>Dependent variable</italic>: As described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0898264312457412">Pruchno et al. (2010a)</xref>, confirmatory factor analyses provided support for a multidimensional model of successful aging that incorporated objective criteria and subjective perceptions. The objective component included having few chronic health conditions, maintaining functional ability, and experiencing little pain. Respondents were asked whether they had ever been told by a doctor or health professional that they had arthritis, hypertension, a heart condition, cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis, stroke, and lung conditions. Respondents reported a mean of 1.7 illnesses (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.4). Respondents reported the amount of difficulty they had with four functional abilities involving lower body strength (walking for a quarter of a mile [<italic>M</italic> = 4.4, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.1], walking up 10 steps [<italic>M</italic> = 4.6, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.93], standing for 2 hours [<italic>M</italic> = 6.2, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.2], and stooping [<italic>M</italic> = 3.9, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.2]) using a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (<italic>cannot do it at all</italic>) to 5 (<italic>not at all difficult</italic>). Pain was measured with the following three questions: “How often are you troubled with pain?” (<italic>M</italic> = 1.0, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.0); “How bad is the pain most of the time?” (<italic>M</italic> = 1.0, <italic>SD</italic> = .9); and “How often does the pain make it difficult for you to do your usual activities such as household chores or work?” (<italic>M</italic> = 0.6, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.9). Each question used a 4-point Likert-type response scale from 0 (<italic>none</italic>) to 3 (<italic>high</italic>) pain.</p>
<p>Subjective successful aging was assessed with three questions, each of which asked respondents to evaluate themselves using a scale from 0 to 10. Respondents were asked what number best: (1) describes how successfully they have aged (<italic>M</italic> = 7.8; <italic>SD</italic> = 1.8), (2) describes how well they are aging (<italic>M</italic> = 7.8, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.8), and (3) represents how they would rate their life these days (<italic>M</italic> = 7.8, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.6). Similar questions have been used by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0898264312457412">Montross et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0898264312457412">Strawbridge, Wallhagen, &amp; Cohen, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Two separate latent profile analysis described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0898264312457412">Pruchno et al. (2010b)</xref>using the eight indicators of objective success (four functional abilities, three indictors of pain, and number of chronic diseases) and the three observed indicators of subjective successful aging as dependent variables yielded two-group solutions for objective and subjective success that maximized the distinction between the successful and unsuccessful people. The latent class grouping variable from these analyses was saved and used to create the following four groups of people: (1) those who were successful according to neither definition (<italic>Unsuccessful</italic>; 8.3%); (2) those successful according to only the subjective definition (<italic>Subjective Only</italic>; 10.0%); (3) those successful according to only the objective definition (<italic>Objective Only</italic>; 8.5%); and (4) those successful according to both definitions (<italic>Successful</italic>; 73.1%). The analyses that follow contrast people who were successful according to both definitions (<italic>Successful</italic>) with all others.</p>

<title>Health Behavior Adherence</title>
<p>Health behavior data were derived from self-reports. We focused on exercise, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, adherence to a Mediterranean diet, and BMI because these behaviors have strong associations with health, mortality, and successful aging. In order to determine how adherence to multiple health behaviors was associated with successful aging, dichotomous scores were formed for each health behavior representing either adherence or nonadherence to best practice recommendations.</p>
<p>Information regarding exercise was gathered using the following questions: (1) On average, over the past 30 days how much time would you estimate you spent doing vigorous activities each week? Vigorous activities include activities like running, lap swimming, aerobic exercising, and fast bicycling; (2) On average, over the past 30 days, how much time would you estimate you spent doing moderate exercise each week? Moderate activities include brisk walking, bicycling for pleasure, golfing, and dancing; (3) On average, over the past 30 days how much time would you estimate that you spent taking a walk for pleasure or walking a dog (do not include brisk walking). These data were used respectively to create variables representing vigorous exercise, moderate exercise, and walking. People adhering to CDC recommendations regarding exercise were those who exercised vigorously for at least 75 min/week or exercised moderately for at least 150 min/week, or had a total exercise score (vigorous + moderate + walking) of at least 150 min/week (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/guidelines/olderadults.html">http://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/guidelines/olderadults.html</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Respondents were asked “During a typical week, on how many days do you have at least one drink of alcohol (a can or bottle of beer, a glass of wine, a shot of liquor or a mixed drink containing alcohol)?” and “During the past 30 days, on how many days did you have 5 or more drinks of alcohol within a couple of hours?” Although definitions of moderate alcohol consumption vary across studies, there is evidence that moderate alcohol use is associated with lowered risk of cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898264312457412">Hines &amp; Rimm, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898264312457412">Maraldi et al., 2006</xref>) as well as diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0898264312457412">Reis et al., 2011</xref>). People were defined as adhering to moderate alcohol consumption if they reported that there was at least 1 day in the past week that they had a drink of alcohol and there were no days on which they had 5 or more drinks of alcohol within a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Participants were asked whether they currently smoke cigarettes. People who were not current smokers were defined as adherent.</p>
<p>Respondents reported the frequency in a typical week that they consumed: tomato juice or tomato-based blends; red spaghetti sauce or other forms of stewed or cooked tomatoes; nuts or seeds; citrus fruits; dark or whole grain breads, pasta, or cereals; broccoli, cauliflower, or brussel sprouts; spinach, kale, bok choy, cabbage, mustard greens, or collard greens; fish (not including shellfish); and lentils or beans such as chick peas, red beans, or black-eyed peas. Frequency data for each food group were distilled into dichotomous data (ate 1 or 2 days a week or more vs. ate less frequently then 1 or 2 days a week) and a total Mediterranean diet score ranging from 0 to 9 developed. As adherence to a Mediterranean diet does not refer to a specific diet per se, but rather a collection of eating habits traditionally followed by people living in countries that border the Mediterranean Sea, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0898264312457412">Roman, Carta, Martinez-Gonzalez, and Serra-Majem (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0898264312457412">Sofi et al.

<p>BMI was calculated from participant’s self-reported weight and height, which are generally known to be accurate, except at extreme BMI values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0898264312457412">Stevens, Keil, Waid, &amp; Gazes, 1990</xref>).

<p>The extent to which adherence to pairs of health behaviors clustered (Hypothesis 1) was tested with prevalence odds ratios (<italic>OR</italic>s; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0898264312457412">Poortinga, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0898264312457412">Schuit et al., 2002</xref>). Hypothesis 2 was tested using logistic regression, estimating the <italic>OR</italic>s and 95% CIs for successful aging when entering adherence to exercise, alcohol, smoking, diet, and BMI simultaneously. Hypothesis 3 was tested using logistic regression, but here the number of health behaviors adhered to was treated as the independent variable and successful aging was the dependent variable. Finally, Hypothesis 4 was tested using separate logistic regression analyses calculated for clusters having a frequency larger than 200 people. We limited analyses to clusters with at least 200 people to ensure adequate power. These analyses contrasted people who did adhere to a given adherence profile with those who did not. All multivariate models were adjusted for age, gender, race (African American vs. others), education, and marital status (married vs. not), as these characteristics have known associations with adherence to health behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0898264312457412">Berrigan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0898264312457412">Portinga, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0898264312457412">Pronk et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0898264312457412">Schuit et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0898264312457412">Shankar et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<p>Similarly, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0898264312457412">Figure 1</xref>, Hypothesis 3 was supported. The figure shows the adjusted <italic>OR</italic>s for successful aging, by total number of health behaviors in compliance with recommended guidelines. A significant dose–response relation was observed with odds for successful aging higher (<italic>OR</italic> = 1.65; 95% CI [1.55, 1.76]; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001) for each additional healthy behavior adhered to. Compared with participants with no healthy behavior adherence increased odds for successful aging were as follows: 1.15 (95% CI [1.085, 1.29]) for one behavior, 1.16 (95% CI [1.09, 1.3]) for two behaviors, 1.29 (95% CI [1.15, 1.53]) for three behaviors, 1.52 (95% CI [1.27, 1.99]) for four behaviors, and 1.77 (95% CI [1.40, 1.93]) for five behaviors.</p>

<p>Analyses examining the association between specific combinations of adherent behavior and the odds for successful aging are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0898264312457412">Table 1</xref>. People adhering to two health behaviors were most likely to age successfully when the two behaviors adhered to were exercise and smoking. People adhering to three health behaviors were most likely to age successfully when they adhered to alcohol and smoking recommendations and either diet, BMI, or exercise.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Results from these analyses find that although there is some evidence that people who adhere to one health behavior also adhere to others, a great deal of heterogeneity characterizes patterns of adherence. Adherence to recommendations regarding exercise, alcohol, smoking, diet, and BMI have additive effects on successful aging, as each increases the likelihood that a person will age successfully. However, there is also evidence for synergistic effects, as some combinations of adherent behavior are more likely to result in success than others.</p>
<p>Our findings are consistent with the limited published research that has examined adherence to multiple health behaviors. Adherence to some pairs of health behaviors tends to cluster. However, there is a great deal of heterogeneity characterizing adherence to health behaviors that was observed in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0898264312457412">Berrigan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0898264312457412">Pronk et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0898264312457412">Reeves &amp; Rafferty, 2005</xref>) and is also supported by our analyses. Looking across all five health behaviors, our data found that a small percentage of people adhered to no health behaviors, while an even smaller percentage adhered to all five. Most adhered to one, two, or three health behaviors. Together these findings support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0898264312457412">Newsom et al.’s (2005)</xref> observation that there is probably not a general proclivity for health consciousness or a single underlying causal mechanism that guides decisions about adhering to health behaviors. These findings raise new questions both about what motivates people to adhere to some but not all recommendations regarding health behaviors and whether there are subsets of health behavior adherence that have a common cause.</p>
<p>Our analyses clearly support the central role that adherence to health behaviors has on successful aging. Whether the effects of adhering to multiple health behaviors are additive or multiplicative, our data as well as that from other studies find that people who engage in more health behaviors are more likely to age successfully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898264312457412">Depp &amp; Jeste, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898264312457412">Maraldi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898264312457412">Munoz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0898264312457412">Penedo &amp; Dahn, 2005</xref>). Similarly, the analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0898264312457412">Reis et al. (2011)</xref> found that lifestyle factors, considered in combination were associated with a substantial reduction in risk for diabetes, and that each addition factor in the low-risk category was associated with a substantial reduction in risk for diabetes.</p>
<p>Although an important strength of our analyses is its large sample size and information regarding adherence to multiple health behaviors, there are several limitations that must be acknowledged. First, data are cross-sectional. As such, no statements can be made regarding the causal relationships between health behaviors and successful aging. Moreover, it should be noted that unmeasured covariates such as depression could explain the observed findings and influence interpretation of the directionality of the associations. Second, all data were derived from self-reports. Third, findings are generalizable only to the five health behaviors examined. Future studies focused on adherence to cancer screening recommendations, annual flu shots, and adherence to other health behavior would provide a more comprehensive perspective on both clustering and the relationship between multiple health behaviors and successful aging. Fourth, the ability to operationalize some of the health behaviors, particularly regarding alcohol and diet as well as adherence was limited by the data available. Although adherence to smoking recommendations was operationalized in these analyses as a function of current behavior, previous analyses more closely examined the relationship between being a current smoker, a former smoker, and a never smoker and successful aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898264312457412">Pruchno, Hahn, &amp; Wilson-Genderson (2012)</xref>. Future studies that are able to use more sophisticated methods for collecting these data will shed new light on these complex relationships. Finally, although the total sample was large by many standards, the power to examine the relationships between adherence to multiple health behaviors and successful aging was limited to those clusters having a sufficient size. Even larger samples as well as national samples are needed to supplement these analyses and provide the opportunity to better understand how various combinations of health behavior adherence influence successful aging.</p>
<p>Although our analyses indicate that adherence to more health behavior recommendations is more highly associated with successful aging than adherence to fewer health behaviors, they also suggest that it is not critical for all people adhere to all of these health behaviors. Rather, these findings indicate that there are multiple pathways from health behaviors to successful aging. Our analyses set the stage for future hypothesis-driven work that could investigate whether health behavior clusters have differential relationships to successful aging in subsets of the population. Public health efforts and physicians should continue to encourage people to exercise, drink alcohol in moderation, not smoke cigarettes, adhere to a Mediterranean diet, and maintain a normal body weight. These findings add to a growing literature suggesting that the mechanisms underlying adherence to health behaviors are complex and that very different explanations are responsible for explaining why people adhere to some but not other health behaviors.</p>
