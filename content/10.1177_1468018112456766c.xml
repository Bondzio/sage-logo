<p>For many years trade unions have neglected pension funds’ investment policy. What mattered to them was to obtain the best possible package in terms of performance and security. By the end of the 1990s, however, trade unions came to realize the importance of investment policy and that pension money should work for, not against, the very same workers whose right to retirement was being financed. The concept of stewardship of ‘workers’ capital’ was born. It draws on a two-track approach to trade union action: representing workers as employees and as shareholders via their pension funds and/or other long-term saving schemes. In practice, workers’ capital strategies use the same instruments as those of the broader ‘responsible investment’ movement: positive or negative screening of portfolios (i.e. ‘best in class’ selection), shareholder activism and proxy voting campaigns, and specific investments in sustainability mandates (i.e. job creation, housing, social or green infrastructure).</p>
<p>It is in North America that workers’ capital is most advanced as a union campaigning tool. In the US labour pension funds are far more active than other investors in making effective use of shareholder proposals to challenge the boardroom and executive management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468018112456766">Choi and Fisch, 2008</xref>). Within Europe, it is relevant in countries where pre-funding schemes account for a substantial proportion of workers’ retirement income – the UK, the Netherlands and the Nordic countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468018112456766">Habbard, 2011</xref>). It is less so where pay-as-you-go and tax financed schemes prevail.</p>
<p>Several conditions need to be met for an effective workers’ capital strategy. First, trade unions should have the ability to nominate representatives as pension board trustees, which is not always the case. Once in the boardroom the union voice also needs to be backed by regulated duties of trustees that are wide enough to allow non-financial criteria (such as observance of human rights conventions and core labour standards) to be included in the investment policy, which is not always the case. Workers’ capital stewardship also requires trade union in-house resources and expertise, not least to maintain trustee education programmes. For example, the British TUC is putting much effort into strengthening trustee education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468018112456766">TUC, 2009</xref>) as does the Canadian CLC and its Shareholder Association for Research and Education.</p>
<p>Regulation of plan design and risk sharing between workers and employers are also key in determining the scope for active responsible strategies. The more risk averse the funding rules are, the less scope there is for an active ownership-oriented investment policy. This is because workers’ capital strategies apply to assets that bear ownership responsibilities – listed equity and private funds – and are not designed for fixed-income assets (bonds) whose creditor rights are somewhat limited. There is evidence that worker-friendly defined benefit (DB) schemes will follow more equity-oriented investment strategies than employer-favoured defined contribution (DC) schemes. Thus the pension funds that are leaders in clean energy financing – a new but rising issue in responsible investment and workers’ capital strategies – are all DB (or ‘hybrid’ DB) schemes that were established as part of collective bargaining agreements and have union representatives on their boards. The post-crisis wave of reforms to limit both risk taking behaviours and leverage in the financial sector may have the unintended consequence to limit pension funds’ ability to be active owners. Supervisory authorities have their doubts about the level of understanding and skills of pension funds in handling investment portfolios that are increasingly complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468018112456766">IOPS, 2011</xref>). In Europe, the European Commission is openly in favour of an extension of the insurance ‘Solvency II’ rules to pension funds, which may well force the latter to divest from ownership assets such as equity and over-invest in fixed income.</p>
<p>Finally, the efficiency of capital strategies will rely on the degree to which asset managers are accountable to asset owners (including pension funds). This is particularly true for the exercise of proxy voting rights that are attached to the pension funds’ shareholdings. Some jurisdictions do not require asset managers to vote the shares they hold on behalf of their clients. The AFL-CIO regularly publishes its ‘Proxy Voting Guidelines’, which serve as a guide to pension funds delegating their voting rights to asset managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468018112456766">AFL-CIO, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Conflict of interests may arise when, as often happens, asset managers belong to an international banking group that maintains business ties with the invested company. They will then have strong incentives not to challenge the board and the executive management and therefore not to exercise their voting rights. The less regulated asset management accountability is – by forms of compulsory disclosure or reporting – the more costly is shareholder activism for pension funds and other asset owners. Thus the European Commission deplores that shareholder ‘engagement is costly and the benefits may be difficult to calculate’ and accordingly is pushing for regulatory reforms in favour of greater shareholder activism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468018112456766">EC, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Shareholder activism, however, is a means to an end, not an end itself. Making a distinction between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ shareholder activism is crucial for unions that engage in workers’ capital strategy. The case of ‘activist’ hedge funds seeking quick gains by pressuring companies towards restructuring is emblematic of the dark side of shareholder activism. More broadly, the current crisis has exposed the short-termism of the prevailing shareholder value model. The parallel is telling between the huge payouts of Wall Street firms to their shareholders (dividends and share buy-backs) in the years preceding the crisis and the capital injections, including taxpayer financed bailouts, from which they have benefited since then.</p>
<p>Trade unions have had and continue to have the opportunity to develop workers’ capital strategies. Certainly, the opportunity is there. According to a survey of pension experts, they are considered as the most important driver (after public opinion) for future responsible investment in Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468018112456766">Allianz, 2010</xref>). But as the Dutch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468018112456766">FNV (2000)</xref> put it, there is an ‘inherent tension that lies between shareholder activism and stakeholders’ rights’. That warning dates back to 2000 and yet it still sounds relevant today.</p>
