<p>Evidence is used by scholars and practitioners to make decisions, and there have been many ways to “determine evidence and grades of recommendation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534484312436709">Henderson &amp; Rheault, 2004</xref>, p. 36). It seems that applied disciplines, which include a diverse array of focus areas, including HRD, medicine, nursing, social work, education, public administration, and psychology, to name a few, consider quantitative evidence as “better” than qualitative evidence. Often, lay practitioners do not question their assumption that randomized quantitative studies are the gold standard for making practice decisions, whereas qualitative studies are presumed to be poor substitutes that merely provide anecdotal stories with no real evidentiary power. However, the increasingly complex and interdependent organizational reality within which HRD and other applied disciplines are practiced has become more complicated than this either/or binary might suggest, and calls for the legitimacy of qualitative evidence are increasing (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534484312436709">Henderson &amp; Rheault, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534484312436709">Lynham &amp; McDonald, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In scholarly journals like <italic>HRDR</italic>, articles are published with the intent to add to the research base of the discipline; the articles provide evidence for new ways of thinking, understanding, or explaining phenomena. Specifically, <italic>HRDR</italic> publishes articles that make theoretical contributions in papers devoted to theory development, foundations of HRD, theory building methods and integrative reviews of the literature. The journal also addresses philosophies of HRD, historical foundations, definitions of the field, conceptual organization of the field, and ethical foundations. (Retrieved from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sagepub.com/journals/Journal201506?siteId=sage-us&amp;prodTypes=any&amp;q=human+resource+development+review&amp;fs=1">http://www.sagepub.com/journals/Journal201506?siteId=sage-us&amp;prodTypes=any&amp;q=human+resource+development+review&amp;fs=1</ext-link>)</p>
<p><italic>HRDR</italic> is seen as the “theory journal” for the discipline of HRD and compliments the “empirical journal” (<italic>HRDQ</italic>), the “international journal” (<italic>HRDI</italic>), and the “research to practice” journal (<italic>ADHR</italic>). These four publications provide a secure foundation for meeting the academy’s mission to lead human resource development through research and provide a broad spectrum of evidence from which to “do” HRD.</p>
<p>However, not all research has been adequately represented in these journals. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534484312436709">Rocco (2010)</xref>, qualitative research articles have typically been underrepresented. At the same time, calls for using qualitative research findings for HRD decision making are increasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534484312436709">Lynham &amp; McDonald, 2011</xref>). Consequently, more published qualitative studies are needed to serve the multiple stakeholders in the academy and the larger HRD discipline. There is an evidentiary gap between what HRD scholars and practitioners need and what journals are currently publishing. However, like all evidence used to justify decisions, the evidence needs to be deemed trustworthy and sufficient for subsequent research and practice claims.</p>
<p>An excellent review of existing qualitative evaluation methods is offered in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534484312436709">Savall, Zardet, Bonnet, and Peron (2008)</xref>. This article should be a “must read” for HRD qualitative research methods courses as well as for <italic>AHRD</italic> members and journal editors. Savall et al., publishing in the management journal <italic>Organizational Research Methods</italic>, found that a “fairly wide consensus” exists for evaluating qualitative articles published in the United States. The purpose of their article was to understand the implicit, or unspoken, evaluative criteria actually used by manuscript reviewers. The authors conducted a content analysis study and found that reviewers “spontaneously stress the criteria that appear essential to them” (p. 523). Their analysis of the data, supported by detailed explanations and justifications, suggests that the reviewers in the study did use some but not all of the criteria requested in the reviews. Unsurprisingly, which criteria were used varied among reviewers by virtue of their individual values for “good” qualitative research.</p>
<p>It should be obvious that implicit values and inconsistent application of evaluative criteria do not signal a trustworthy review process. Although it is comforting to know that this situation exists in other disciplines too, it is important to try to offer solutions and recommendations to minimize implicit and inconsistent reviews. Consequently, this “Instructors Corner” is a step forward on the journey to write, review, and publish high-quality qualitative research manuscripts. This article examines two existing perspectives on generating high-quality qualitative manuscripts and then compares and contrasts the different elements of each.</p>
<p>First, an overview of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534484312436709">Rocco’s (2010)</xref> eight criteria for evaluating qualitative studies is presented. Rocco offers an easy-to-follow list of specific criteria that can be used by both authors and reviewers. Second, a more systemic analysis of “quality” is offered in the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534484312436709">Easterby-Smith, Golden-Biddle, and Locke (2008)</xref>. This article describes the messy, multilevel, pluralistic environment of qualitative research methods in order to point to specific areas for improving quality publications. Easterby-Smith and colleagues do not provide an easy-to-follow list; however, the issues and concerns raised in their article are relevant and important for the discipline of HRD and the journals of the Academy. This “Instructor’s Corner” concludes by summarizing the key contributions of each evaluative method and suggests areas for continued examination.</p>
<sec id="section1-1534484312436709">
<title>Rocco’s Eight Criteria</title>
<p>Writing qualitative studies with evaluator criteria in mind is a smart strategy that can improve your chances of receiving positive reviews and subsequent publication opportunities. However, a drawback to this strategy can be that the criteria may be more applicable to certain types of qualitative studies rather than others or that the criteria may reflect a particular worldview not aligned with your particular study. Thus, a practitioner would do well to keep these limitations in mind before studying <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534484312436709">Rocco’s (2010)</xref> criteria for evaluating qualitative studies, which are as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-1534484312436709" list-type="order"><list-item><p>Well articulated problem</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Grounded in relevant literature</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Method, data collection tools, and steps to ensure rigour adequately described and grounded in relevant literature</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Adequate explanation of sampling strategies and sample description</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Data analysis process described in detail and limitations reported</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Findings include categories with definitions, sufficient data from sufficient participants to support the category</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Meaningful discussion of the significance and implications of the study</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Attention to organization, use of headings, succinctness, editing, and formatting. (p. 377)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The list above guides both authors and reviewers of qualitative manuscripts and points to eight key elements of good qualitative articles. Authors should strive to meet these eight elements, and reviewers should use them to evaluate qualitative manuscripts, both in the review process and when they are conducting research relying on scholarly publications.</p>
<sec id="section2-1534484312436709">
<title>Extending <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534484312436709">Rocco’s (2010)</xref> criteria</title>
<p>When the focus is moved beyond publishing research reports, however, the list is incomplete. The list is sufficient for evaluating quality publications but does not fully guide the research-to-practice transition, which is so important to applied disciplines like HRD. Taking the need for practical implications and evidence into account, the amended list could look like this:</p>
<list id="list2-1534484312436709" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Well-articulated problem
<list id="list3-1534484312436709" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Reviewers should be able to affirmatively answer this question: Is the problem relevant to practice, or did the problem emerge from practice?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In addition to practical problems/gaps, theoretical and conceptual problems need to be clarified. Reviewers should be able to easily articulate the theoretical problem of the manuscript.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Exemplary qualitative research articles will also position the problem in terms of the discipline of HRD and/or in relation to other academy journals. If this criterion is met, reviewers will be able to articulate how the manuscript will contribute to the advance of the discipline of HRD.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
</list-item>
<list-item><p>Grounded in relevant literature
<list id="list4-1534484312436709" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>For a scholarly publication, the “relevant” literature is assumed to be peer reviewed. However, including some practice- or evidence-based literature should not be seen to distract from the power of the publication. In fact, as an applied discipline, HRD should embrace the inclusion of practice- or evidence-based literature as long as it is framed appropriately in the manuscript. If this criteria is followed, reviewers will be able to easily distinguish the peer-reviewed from practice evidence used in the paper and will easily see the congruence between the two types of evidence.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There are two categories of “relevant” literature for qualitative research articles: (1) literature that describes, explains, or justifies the content/topic of the article, and (2) literature that describes, explains, or justifies the chosen qualitative methodology and methods used in the article.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“Relevant literature” is used differently, depending on the section of the manuscript. In some locations, like the introduction, the literature is used to convince readers that a gap or problem exists. In the literature review, the literature should demonstrate to reviewers that the author has included the key scholarship of the topic; the scholarship could include empirical studies and/or conceptual pieces. In the methods section, the literature is used somewhat like it is used in the literature review section, namely, to demonstrate to reviewers that the key scholarship surrounding the method has been consulted. However, in the methods section it is also important that reviewers easily see how the literature supports the research design and methods decisions of the author.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
</list-item>
<list-item><p>Method, data collection tools, and steps to ensure rigor adequately described and grounded in relevant literature
<list id="list5-1534484312436709" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Specific components should be provided to meet this criteria, including a description of the ethical considerations of the study; justification for the methods, tools, and steps; and demonstration of the influence of researcher subjectivity/positionality on the research process.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The methods chosen by the author should make sense to the reviewer at three different levels. First, the methods should make sense because they are justified by supporting evidence; for example, literature is used to justify the selections. Second, the methods should make sense because they are logically connected to the problem/research question. Third, the methods should make sense because the reviewer sees the author’s decision-making process; in other words, decisions are transparent to readers and reviewers.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
</list-item>
<list-item><p>Adequate explanation of sampling strategies and sample description
<list id="list6-1534484312436709" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Specifically, the article should provide enough details so that reviewers could follow the steps taken by the author.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Authors should provide readers and reviewers with a logical argument for why the specific strategies were selected over other possible strategies.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Limitations to the selected strategies should be included and integrated into the “conversation” about methods (e.g., not be an afterthought tagged at the end of a section).</p></list-item>
</list></p>
</list-item>
<list-item><p>Data analysis process described in detail and limitations reported
<list id="list7-1534484312436709" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Like Point 4 above, the article should provide enough details so that reviewers could follow the same analytical steps taken by the author.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The analysis process selected should be logically connected to the purpose of the study.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The analysis process should be justified; for example, the reviewers should be able to easily understand why the specific analysis process was selected over other possible ways of analyzing qualitative data.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
</list-item>
<list-item><p>Findings include categories with definitions, sufficient data from sufficient participants to support the category
<list id="list8-1534484312436709" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Reviewers should discern that the categories presented in the manuscript have substance; in other words, each category should have the same quality of thick description.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
</list-item>
<list-item><p>Meaningful discussion of the significance and implications of the study
<list id="list9-1534484312436709" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>As described earlier, this last section is usually where authors include practice considerations. Both practice and theory implications should be offered, and reviewers should easily see how these implications were extended from the findings of the study.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Exemplary articles will also include disciplinary significance and/or implications for the discipline of HRD.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
</list-item>
<list-item><p>Attention to organization, use of headings, succinctness, editing, and formatting
<list id="list10-1534484312436709" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Writing is a way of thinking and a way of generating new knowledge. Reviewers should be able to easily see the thought processes of the author and easily understand how the study generated new knowledge (both practical and theoretical). (Adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534484312436709">Rocco, 2010</xref>, p. 377)</p></list-item>

</list-item>
</list>
<p>As illustrated by the adaptation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534484312436709">Rocco’s (2010)</xref> criteria, reviewers and authors are now provided with more details for producing and evaluating qualitative research. The adapted list builds upon Rocco’s ideas and extends the ability of authors and reviewers to utilize these important evaluative criteria.</p>
<p>The next section introduces a wholly different way to understand how to evaluate and produce qualitative research articles. Whereas the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534484312436709">Rocco (2010)</xref> list focuses at the individual author/reviewer level, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534484312436709">Easterby-Smith et al. (2008)</xref> criteria offers a more systemic view of research production. While reading the next section, keep in mind the individual-level suggestions above and see how they “fit” into the system described below.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section3-1534484312436709">
<title>Evaluating the System That Produces Qualitative Research</title>
<p>The evaluative criteria generated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534484312436709">Easterby-Smith et al. (2008)</xref> are substantially different in scope and intent than those generated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534484312436709">Rocco (2010)</xref>. They are included in this “Instructor’s Corner” as one way to illuminate the pluralistic nature of determining quality in qualitative research and also to illustrate how to improve the overall system of research production. As the authors note in their conclusion, “There is . . . a need for interventions into individual practices and the institutional structures, including journals and employing institutions, which frame the behavior and rewards of researchers and reviewers” (p. 427). The authors also call for skill development across the career spectrum; designs for enhancing skills of both early and late career stages are needed.</p>
<p>The authors present both individual- and institutional-level criteria for enhancing the quality of qualitative research. They agree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534484312436709">Amis and Silk (2008)</xref> and write that “we need to increase our general understanding of different traditions so that whether as author or reviewer/editor we can locate our own perspectives and be informed as to how articles ought to be shaped and judged relative to the traditions from which they emanate” (p. 423). The key to this quote is the idea of “different traditions” and building skills and understandings about the pluralistic traditions represented across the qualitative research spectrum.</p>
<sec id="section4-1534484312436709">
<title>Individual level</title>
<p>At the individual level, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534484312436709">Easterby-Smith et al. (2008)</xref> offer authors and reviewers suggestions for improving their abilities to write and review qualitative research articles. For authors, the key recommendation is to “get close to the life worlds of those studied” (p. 423). Easterby-Smith et al. found that authors generally rely on quantity (e.g., 1,000 pages of transcriptions) to send clues to readers about the quality of data collected and analyzed. However, the quantity of data does not automatically generate substantial findings. The process of understanding and interpreting the data is infinitely more important than page counts as evidence of trustworthy analysis.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534484312436709">Easterby-Smith et al. (2008)</xref> recommend that “data-generating strategies and text (should) indicate that we have made a major investment in attempting to be faithful to the complexity and variability in the dimension of organizational life into which our research inquires” (p. 423). They argue that authors should carefully describe the data collection and analysis steps taken to become closely engaged with the participants in their social settings and that this closeness is a key indicator of the quality of a study. Note that the closeness is demonstrated both in the collection and analysis processes and that authors should provide evidence of closeness through a carefully crafted narrative that includes description and justification for each step along the way. Aim for transparency here—trustworthiness equates to transparency in these important sections of the manuscript.</p>
<p>For reviewers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534484312436709">Easterby-Smith et al. (2008)</xref> argue that “we have the responsibility for achieving a general understanding of quality concerns associated with the traditions and approaches we review, for identifying inconsistencies and incoherencies in submitted manuscripts, and furthermore for applying criteria and associated methodological practices consistent with the tradition in which the work is conducted” (p. 424). Consequently, because of the diverse traditions and emergent nature of qualitative research, Easterby-Smith et al. argue that reviewers should not be held to static evaluative criteria. Instead, reviewers should “expect a design that reflects emergent research questions, including an initial sampling strategy that is theoretically purposive . . . and directed toward accessing cases with rich information about the phenomenon of interest. Similarly, the analytic strategy should reflect key choices made by researchers consistent with their emergent understanding. And they (the reviewers) might look for processes through which those research claims were subject to alternative perspectives and reexamined in light of them” (p. 424).</p>
<p>Reviewers should also look for connections between claims and evidence—between the patterns or themes and what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534484312436709">Easterby-Smith et al. (2008)</xref> call the “microlevel details of what the researcher said, did, and produced” (p. 425). Is it clear to the reviewer how the theme or pattern emerged from the data? Can the reviewer understand how conceptual frameworks influenced pattern recognition? Reviewers should be able to see, understand, and be convinced that the processes moving evidence to claim were justified and trustworthy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1534484312436709">
<title>Institutional level</title>
<p>At the institutional level, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534484312436709">Easterby-Smith et al. (2008)</xref> suggest that research training programs, informal social networks and journal communities, and promotion and tenure procedures and doctoral training all impact the quality of qualitative research articles. Regarding training programs, quality is enhanced when funders of research (like the Economic and Social Research Council in the United Kingdom) make “policy decisions to require research training to cover qualitative and quantitative methods in equal measure” (p. 425). The ESRC policy in the United Kingdom is compared to the Ford/Carnegie report in the United States that substantially favored quantitative research to illustrate the influence of funders on quality scholarship.</p>
<p>Regarding the journal communities and networks, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534484312436709">Easterby-Smith et al. (2008)</xref> suggest that journals should examine their policies as well as the skills and competencies of editorial board members and reviewers. There is a tendency for editorial boards and reviewers to represent a more homogeneous population than the wider research population would suggest: “. . . there is an inevitable tendency to draw on people who share similar outlooks and who have preferences for particular forms of theoretical development (p. 425). The authors urge journals to “continue ‘affirmative’ action through both supportive editorials and through commissioning special issues edited by qualitative researchers” (p. 425).</p>
<p>Finally, regarding academic careers and doctoral training, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534484312436709">Easterby-Smith et al. (2008)</xref> argue, “Qualitative researchers are in the minority in North America because doctoral training programs pay limited attention to developing relevant expertise, often providing no more than one or two sessions within a course. An important first step, therefore, would be to increase the volume of qualitative training . . . (and that) . . . skills have to be acquired, developed and honed through practice” (pp. 426-427). Likewise, colleges and universities should “encourage and support young researchers to take the more risky route, and to support career progress for these people . . . institutional reward systems will need to find ways of valuing qualitative work” (p. 427). Finally, funding organizations like the National Science Foundation have contributed toward quality research “through measures such as sponsoring qualitative workshops and research groups, funding training in qualitative methods, supporting qualitative dissertation research, and providing grand funding over longer periods” (p. 427). These authors conclude by reinforcing the influence of the wider research system on the quality of qualitative research articles and assert that a system-wide intervention is needed for quality improvement.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>These two different perspectives on improving and evaluating the quality of qualitative research articles offers a broad understanding of the decisions, processes, and practices that impact the final result: qualitative articles that can be trusted and used for evidence for future research and/or practice decisions. As authors and reviewers, we were given specific steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534484312436709">Rocco, 2010</xref>) as well as broader responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534484312436709">Easterby-Smith et al., 2008</xref>). The specific steps should be used wisely, and judiciously, keeping in mind the pluralistic nature of qualitative research methods, traditions, and contexts. The broader responsibilities, including the commitment to being close to research participants, remind authors and reviewers of the importance of generating authentic findings from their real social context. Combined, the two perspectives reviewed in this “Instructor’s Corner” offer a way forward for authors and reviewers, as well as editors and institutions, to continue to improve the quality of qualitative research manuscripts.</p>
