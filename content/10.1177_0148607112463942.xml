<abstract>
<p>Recently, drug shortages in the United States have affected multiple components of the parenteral nutrition (PN) solution. A 62-year-old patient with systemic sclerosis who was dependent on home PN due to intestinal dysmotility developed anemia and leukopenia approximately 4 months after parenteral copper was withheld from her PN solution due to drug shortages. The patient was not able to tolerate a sufficient amount of oral multivitamins with trace elements due to severe dysphagia. Her serum copper and ceruloplasmin concentrations were undetectable, confirming the diagnosis of severe copper deficiency. The hematological abnormalities promptly resolved with copper supplementation. This report emphasizes the importance of close monitoring for nutrient deficiencies during drug shortages and supplementing with oral or enteral nutrition when feasible, particularly in high-risk patients such as those with intestinal malabsorption or short bowel syndrome who are dependent on long-term PN.</p>

<title>Clinical Relevancy Statement</title>
<p>Acquired copper deficiency in adults occurs rarely. Known risk factors include history of gastric bypass or other upper gastrointestinal surgeries, intestinal malabsorption or short bowel syndrome, dependence on long-term parenteral nutrition (PN), and an excess in oral zinc intake. We report on a patient who developed anemia and leukopenia due to copper deficiency rapidly after parenteral copper was withheld from her PN solution during a national shortage of parenteral trace element products. The patient’s hematological abnormalities resolved with copper supplementation. During drug shortages, it is crucial to monitor for nutrient deficiencies and supplement with oral or enteral preparations when possible, especially in high-risk patients such as those with intestinal malabsorption or short bowel syndrome.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a 26-year history of limited systemic sclerosis (CREST syndrome), which was diagnosed in the presence of Raynaud phenomenon, sclerodactyly, cutaneous telangiectasia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. In December 2003, she developed intermittent abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting, and bouts of diarrhea. Computed tomography (CT) scans of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a diffusely dilated small bowel. She underwent small bowel follow-through studies, which demonstrated delayed transit time in the small bowel. Her gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms worsened over the course of 4–5 years, resulting in multiple hospitalizations for small intestinal obstruction. In October 2008, an elective diagnostic laparoscopy was performed. The patient was found to have dilated and thickened small bowel without anatomical obstruction or adhesion bands. She was diagnosed with intestinal dysmotility with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth likely due to complications of systemic sclerosis.</p>
<p>Despite trials of prokinetic agents, various antibiotics, and oral nutrition supplements, the patient lost 15% of her weight over a period of 6 months, resulting in a body mass index (BMI) of 17 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. In December 2008, home parenteral nutrition (PN) was initiated, which was tolerated well and resulted in weight gain and eventual weight maintenance at a BMI of 20–21 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The PN was initially given daily but was subsequently decreased to 5 times a week (providing an average of 1150 kcal/d and 60 g/d of protein) as the patient was able to maintain nutrition and hydration on the other 2 days of the week with oral intake of regular food and water. Each PN bag contained standard doses of injectable multivitamins (M.V.I.-12; Hospira, Inc, Lake Forest, IL) and trace elements (MULTITRACE–5 CONCENTRATE; American Regent, Shirley, NY). A nutrition supplement was prescribed (Ensure; Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL), containing 0.5 mg of elemental copper (or 25% of the Recommended Dietary Allowance [RDA] per serving), but the patient used the supplement only once every 1–2 months.</p>
<p>She was asked to take oral iron supplements (iron sulfate 325 mg, 2 tabs once daily) but was able to tolerate this only once or twice weekly due to severe dysphagia as a result of systemic sclerosis. However, she was able to take 50,000 international units of cholecalciferol 3 times weekly by cutting open the soft-gel tablets and drinking the content with juice. As a result, her serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations had been maintained between 20 and 30 ng/mL. One milligram of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> was added to her PN solution once a month as the patient had been found to have borderline low vitamin B<sub>12</sub> concentrations in the past, although she did not have any symptoms attributable to vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Her other medications included digoxin, bupropion, sertraline, alprazolam, cetirizine, and omeprazole.</p>
<p>In September 2011, the infusion company that supplied PN solution to the patient was affected by a national shortage of all trace element injections, including MULTITRACE–5 CONCENTRATE, due to temporary suspension of the manufacturing process in early 2011.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112463942">1</xref></sup> The patient was asked to take a multivitamin daily (One A Day Women’s; Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Montville, NJ) that contained 15 mg of zinc, 20 mcg of selenium, 2 mg of copper, 2 mg of manganese, and 120 mcg of chromium per serving. She was able to tolerate the multivitamin only once or twice a week due to severe dysphagia related to systemic sclerosis. As injectable manganese and copper products<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607112463942">2</xref></sup> were also affected by the national shortage, other available intravenous (IV) trace elements were individually added to the PN solution that was being given to the patient 5 times weekly. These products included IV zinc (5 mg), IV selenium (60 mcg), and IV chromium (10 mcg). Her liver function tests were within normal limits without any evidence of cholestasis.</p>
<p>In December 2011, the patient began to complain of increasing fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance, and lower extremity edema associated with a decrease in her serum albumin concentration. She had a history of chronic anemia with stable hemoglobin and hematocrit of 10 g/dL and 33%, respectively. This was thought to be an anemia of chronic disease, as her iron studies, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, and folate concentrations were within normal limits. In January 2012, she was found to have severe leukopenia and anemia with a white blood cell (WBC) nadir of 3100/mm<sup>3</sup> and a hemoglobin nadir of 6.5 g/dL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148607112463942">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607112463942">Table 1</xref>). Her mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was slightly enlarged (98 fL; reference range, 80–97 fL) with an increased red cell distribution width (21.8%; reference range, 12%–14.5%), suggesting a mixed population of small and large red cells. Her platelet counts remained normal.</p>

<p>At this time, the patient was admitted to the hospital for evaluation. She denied any neurological symptoms, including difficulty walking or numbness or tingling in her hands and feet. Physical examination revealed a thin woman with diffuse muscle wasting. Examination of the skin and mucosa was normal. A complete neurological examination did not reveal any abnormalities. Esophagoduodenoscopy was performed to rule out GI blood loss and demonstrated severe reflux esophagitis and mild esophageal stricture without other mucosal abnormalities. Colonoscopy performed 6 months earlier revealed large diverticula in the sigmoid colon with no other abnormalities.</p>
<p>Additional laboratory results revealed undetectable concentrations of serum copper (&lt;3 mcg/dL) and ceruloplasmin (&lt;3 mg/dL) with a low to normal serum zinc concentration of 61 mcg/dL (reference range, 60–130 mcg/dL). Her iron studies, folic acid, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, and concentration of other trace elements were within normal limits (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607112463942">Table 1</xref>). The nutrition team presumptively diagnosed the patient with anemia and leukopenia due to copper deficiency. The patient received transfusion with 3 units of packed red cells, which resulted in significant improvement of her symptoms.</p>
<p>A trial of oral copper supplementation (copper gluconate 2 mg, GNC Copper 2; General Nutrition Centers, Inc, Pittsburgh, PA) was initiated on January 23, 2012, using a regimen previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112463942">3</xref></sup> (elemental copper 6 mg once daily for the first week, 4 mg once daily for the second week, followed by 2 mg once daily). She was vigilant and took most of the prescribed supplements as the seriousness of the deficiency truly scared her. She remained on regular food at this time. In March 2012, the patient’s home infusion company was able to obtain supplies of IV multiple trace elements (MULTITRACE–5 CONCENTRATE), which were given 5 times a week with her home PN solution.</p>
<p>Two months after treatment was initiated, the patient’s hemoglobin was maintained at 9.5–10 g/dL and WBC count at 10,000–11,000/mm<sup>3</sup>. Serum copper and ceruloplasmin concentrations normalized (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607112463942">Table 1</xref>). Oral copper supplementation was discontinued after 3 months. The patient continued to receive 1 mL of standard multiple trace element solution (MULTITRACE–5 CONCENTRATE), which contained 1 mg of cupric sulfate per dose in her PN 5 nights per week. Bone marrow biopsy was deferred because the patient’s response to copper supplementation appeared to be adequate. This incidence was reported to the Medication Errors Reporting Program (MERP) operated by the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Acquired copper deficiency occurs infrequently because copper is abundant in the diet, particularly in grains, nuts, legumes, seeds, organ meat, and shellfish.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112463942">4</xref></sup> The RDA of copper according to the Institute of Medicine is 0.9 mg/d in adult men and women 19 years and older.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112463942">4</xref></sup> The median intake of copper in adults in the United States is 1.0–1.1 mg/d in women and 1.2–1.6 mg/d in men.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112463942">4</xref></sup> Absorption of copper occurs primarily in the duodenum and, to a lesser extent, in the stomach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607112463942">5</xref></sup> Conditions associated with copper deficiency include intestinal malabsorption such as celiac disease, cystic fibrosis, or short bowel syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607112463942">6</xref></sup>; long-term dependence on PN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112463942">7</xref></sup>; gastric or small bowel resection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607112463942">8</xref></sup> and gastric bypass surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607112463942">9</xref></sup>; and excessive oral zinc intake.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607112463942">10</xref></sup> Oral zinc intake increases expression of the intracellular ligand metallothionein in enterocytes, which binds more avidly to copper than zinc and results in loss of copper when the enteric mucosa is shed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607112463942">10</xref></sup> In many cases, the etiology of copper deficiency has remained unexplained.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112463942">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hypocupremia in patients receiving long-term PN has been described in the 1970s before administration of trace elements and copper with PN became a routine practice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607112463942">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607112463942">12</xref></sup> and in patients whose copper supplementation was withheld from their PN in the setting of cholestasis due to decreased biliary excretion of copper.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607112463942">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112463942">7</xref></sup> To our knowledge, our patient is the first reported case of copper deficiency occurring as a result of a national shortage of IV trace element products in the United States. In 2004, the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) Practice Guidelines for Safe Practices for Parenteral Nutrition recommended that a daily dose of 0.3–0.5 mg of copper be supplemented to PN in adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607112463942">13</xref></sup> Recommendations from the A.S.P.E.N. 2009 Research Workshop on Micronutrients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607112463942">14</xref></sup> included daily supplementation of copper to PN at 20 µg/kg/d for pediatric patients and 0.3 mg/d for adults. For those with cholestasis, the recommended amount is 0.15 mg/d, and for those with increased copper loss due to diarrhea or loss of GI fluid, the recommended amount is 0.4–0.5 mg/d.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607112463942">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The most common manifestations of hypocupremia include anemia, leukopenia (primarily neutropenia),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148607112463942">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607112463942">16</xref></sup> foot numbness, and gait difficulty.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112463942">3</xref></sup> Hematological and neurological abnormalities often coexist but may occur independently, as in our patient, in whom only hematological but not neurological findings were observed. Anemia associated with copper deficiency may be normocytic or macrocytic and rarely microcytic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607112463942">16</xref></sup> Thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia have rarely been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148607112463942">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607112463942">16</xref></sup> Findings from bone marrow biopsy often include decreased granulocytic maturation, vacuolization of erythroid and myeloid cells, and the presence of ringed sideroblasts and iron-containing plasma cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148607112463942">15</xref></sup> These findings are highly suggestive but not diagnostic for copper deficiency. Occasionally, patients may be misdiagnosed at the time of presentation as having myelodysplastic syndrome or sideroblastic anemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112463942">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148607112463942">15</xref></sup> Hypocupremia is associated with dysfunction of the spinal cord, resulting in paresthesia and numbness in the lower extremities, sensory ataxia, and occasionally a spastic gait.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112463942">3</xref></sup> These symptoms bear a close resemblance to those of subacute combined degeneration due to vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Evaluation for copper deficiency is warranted in patients who develop worsening neurological symptoms despite vitamin B<sub>12</sub> supplementation and a normal vitamin B<sub>12</sub> concentration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112463942">3</xref></sup> In patients receiving long-term PN, hematological manifestations of copper deficiency have been reported to occur as rapidly as 8–10 weeks after copper is withheld from PN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112463942">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607112463942">12</xref></sup> but may occur as late as 7–15 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607112463942">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607112463942">11</xref></sup> Anemia and leukopenia developed after 4 months without copper supplementation in our patient.</p>
<p>In most instances, laboratory diagnosis of copper deficiency relies on serum copper and ceruloplasmin concentrations, which are frequently low during severe copper deficiency (as in our patient) but may be normal in marginal copper deficiency and can be elevated during pregnancy, inflammation, and infection independent of the body’s copper status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148607112463942">17</xref></sup> Assessing activities of copper-containing enzymes such as erythrocyte superoxide dismutase may better reflect tissue copper stores,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148607112463942">17</xref></sup> but these assays are not widely available.

<p>Since 2010, national drug shortages have affected an increasing number of PN components, including IV amino acids, fat emulsion, electrolytes, vitamins, and trace elements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148607112463942">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148607112463942"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0148607112463942">20</xref></sup> Reasons for drug shortages include product quality problems such as impurities and contamination, production capacity problems and delays, lack of raw materials, decisions to discontinue products due to limited profitability, and consolidation of drug manufacturers, which leaves the supply chain vulnerable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148607112463942">21</xref></sup> Adverse patient outcomes related to PN medication shortages are well documented in the literature.

Multiple fluid and electrolyte abnormalities have been reported as a result of shortages of IV sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphate products.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148607112463942">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0148607112463942">20</xref></sup> A shortage of calcium gluconate in 2011 led to a medication error where substitution with calcium chloride in a PN solution led to chemical burns at the infusion site in a neonate with necrotizing enterocolitis who was receiving PN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0148607112463942">24</xref></sup> During a shortage of IV amino acid solution in 2011, contamination of PN with <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> was reported at a compound pharmacy during preparation of amino acid solution from source powders, resulting in multiple reported deaths.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0148607112463942">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Management of PN drug shortages poses significant challenges to the clinician and can be time- and labor- consuming.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148607112463942">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0148607112463942">20</xref></sup> Recommendations are available from pro-fessional societies to guide management of patients during such shortages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148607112463942">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0148607112463942">26</xref></sup> General principles include providing nutrition, minerals, and vitamins by mouth or enterally when possible; monitoring for possible nutrient deficiencies during shortages; prioritizing supplies to provide for the most vulnerable patients (particularly pediatric patients and those with intestinal failure and malabsorption); avoiding use of pediatric products in adults and vice versa; no stockpiling; and reporting shortages and patient problems to involved organizations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0148607112463942">26</xref></sup> Legislative efforts are under way in an attempt to alleviate the drug shortage crisis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148607112463942">21</xref></sup> including the requirement for manufacturers to provide early warnings of emerging shortages in the future.</p>
<p>In our patient, trace element concentrations were being monitored (as recently as 3 months prior to the onset of the shortage), and the tests yielded normal results. Our attempt to prevent deficiencies during the shortage with oral supplementation was not successful as the patient could not tolerate sufficient oral supplements. Multiple inquiries were made by the patient’s nutrition support dietitian into the availability of injectable multiple trace element and copper products throughout the course of the shortage. However, these products did not become available to the home infusion company until after the patient had developed symptoms related to copper deficiency. If the IV multiple trace element or copper products had become available before the onset of her symptoms, our patient would have been prioritized to receive these products considering her malabsorption syndrome, long-term dependence on PN, and inability to use oral supplements.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>National drug shortages in the United States have affected numerous PN components over the years. Copper deficiency can occur soon after parenteral copper is omitted from PN solutions. Prevention and early identification of nutrient deficiencies during drug shortages can be achieved by close monitoring and supplementing by mouth or enterally when feasible. This is particularly important in the most vulnerable patients, including those with short bowel syndrome or intestinal malabsorption who require long-term PN.</p>
