<p>This comprehensive, 19-chapter handbook promotes the design of safe, effective, and usable medical devices employed in at least three distinct environments: hospital- and clinic-based treatment, home health care, and by EMS personnel during patient transit via ground or air ambulance. Although the handbook’s genesis is the work of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation’s (AAMI) Human Factors Engineering Committee, the chapters go far beyond the design process guidance of AAMI’s ANSI standard. It provides expanded discussions of design issues, presents product design case studies, and gives supporting illustrations.</p>
<p>Human factors/ergonomics specialists explain how to apply established HF/E design standards and conventions and provide commentary on how to develop and use professional judgment − mostly based on years of experience by numerous contributing chapter authors. Throughout, the book integrates basic HF/E tenets and principles of design pertinent to specific types of medical devices (e.g., ultrasound scanners, mammography machines, medical simulators, patient transport devices, anesthesia machines, and surgical devices and support equipment) and for designing them for particular use environments. Individual chapters draw on anthropometric and biometric data to match designs to anticipated users, to refocus classical HF/E design principles (e.g., biomechanics, controls and displays, lighting and illumination, alarms, workstation design, symbols and markings) to specific medical device considerations. Usability test data and other HF/E evaluations are illustrated for ensuring that devices perform as intended.</p>
<p>As the editors proclaim, “A good user interface can improve safety and the quality of patient care. Conversely, a poorly designed user interface can respond in unexpected ways to user actions, increase workload, induce critical errors that jeopardize patient and clinician safety, and cause fatigue and discomfort.” This book is intended for, and will be very useful for, designers in the medical device industry, health care providers, patients, and students and for those whose job includes evaluation and assessment of the efficacy of all sorts of medical devices.</p>
<p>Newer international standards and medical device regulators are increasingly compelling medical device manufacturers to invest in HF/E design. This handbook, therefore, should be particularly relevant for product developers in the medical device industry. Experience demonstrates that those companies incorporating human factors, as outlined in this guide, produce superior designs and will undoubtedly gain a marketing edge on their competitors. Extrapolating the book’s many cogent recommendations on particular devices, however, will be undertaken best by HF/E specialists assigned to ensure successful product user-device interfaces.</p>
<p>The recent attention focused on HF/E concerns in health care (i.e., two HFES international symposia held in 2012 and 2013 and another planned for 2014) and the added focus on safety in patient handling by the National Research Council’s Board on Human-Systems Integration place the importance of this handbook in the middle of our human factors community’s “hot issues” of the decade.</p>
<p>Readers are given a particularly nice treat near the end of this voluminous handbook in the form of a set of photos and short bio sketches about the three editors and the 22 contributors.</p>

<p>Gerald P. Krueger, PhD, CPE, has spent much of his career evaluating a variety of human-machine systems, much of it for the U.S. Army and, in later years, for myriad other federal agencies, including the Transportation Security Administration, Department of Transportation, and Customs and Border Protection. He is the Books editor for <italic>Ergonomics in Design</italic>.</p>
