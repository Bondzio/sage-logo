<abstract>
<p>Contemporary Australia is a country of ongoing migration and increasing cultural diversity which is reflected in its arts practices. This article considers the views held by Australian pre-service music education student teachers and their tertiary music educators about their perceptions concerning artists-in-schools programs in school music. This discussion reports on data collected for a study undertaken in Melbourne, Victoria, <italic>Intercultural Understandings of Pre-Service Music Education Students</italic> (2005–2009). Fifty-three interviews were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. The findings provide insight into teachers’ recognition of the need for artists-in-schools programs. In particular the ways in which teachers can link theory to practice, fill in omissions in their own knowledge, skills and understandings, and heighten student understandings of multicultural musics. The promotion and provision of multicultural music education is essential at all levels of education. This can be achieved by the inclusion of diverse culture bearers, artists-in-schools, and community engagement to work with both teachers and their students.</p>

<title>Setting the scene</title>
<p>Contemporary Australia is a country of ongoing migration and increasing cultural diversity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0255761411434254">Ashman (2008)</xref> refers to this diversity as a cultural mosaic that has been formed as ‘those who have immigrated maintain many of their homeland traditions while embracing, to a greater or lesser extent, the new norms, values and practices of the adopted country’ (p. 7). This article explores pre-service teacher education students’ understandings of cultural diversity as it is enacted through artists-in-schools programs. This research locates itself in one Australian state, Victoria, which is a culturally-diverse community with people coming from more than 230 countries, speaking more than 200 languages and dialects, and following more than 120 religious faiths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0255761411434254">Victorian Multicultural Commission, 2009</xref>). Although Welch (2007) recognizes the success of Australia as a multicultural nation, there remain challenges, given this wide ranging and complex diversity, that educators need to consider as to how this cultural mosaic can best be included in schooling. One long-established way to do this is through the arts at all levels of community and education where multicultural arts engagement can be a powerful and inclusive process for accommodating and celebrating difference.</p>
<p>The arts embody and enact a nation’s identity. By engaging and preparing future teachers in the compelling cultural medium of music we create empowered agents of change. Music enhances creativity, self-expression, self-confidence and enables empathetic engagement with other cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0255761411434254">Bartleet, Dunbar-Hall, Letts, &amp; Schippers, 2009</xref>). The National Agenda for a Multicultural Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0255761411434254">Office of Multicultural Affairs, 1989</xref>) identifies cultural identity as the right of all Australians to express and share their individual cultural heritage. Social justice principles demand the rights of all Australians to equality of treatment and opportunity and the removal of barriers associated with race, ethnicity, language, culture, religion, and gender to overcome multicultural barriers and incorporate the other. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0255761411434254">Pope and Doyle (2006)</xref> point out that ‘communities that embrace diversity, creative expression and cultural activity are richer, stronger and better able to deal with social challenges’ (p. i). According to the Australia Council, 85% of Australians believe that the arts should be central in the education of every child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0255761411434254">Temmerman, 2006</xref>). Between 2008 and 2009 the Australia Council provided AUD$29.9 million funding for Victorian-based artists and arts organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0255761411434254">Arts Victoria, 2010</xref>) acknowledging the value and importance of providing affective and engaging arts programs.</p>
<p>In Australia the <italic>National Review of School Music Education</italic> (NRSME; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0255761411434254">Department of Education, Science and Training, 2005</xref>) recognized the need for school music ‘to address issues of diversity, inclusive repertoire, recognition of home and community cultures’ (p. x). On 8 October 2010, as part of the development of a national curriculum, the <italic>Draft Shape of the Australian Curriculum: The Arts</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0255761411434254">Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority [ACARA], 2010</xref>) was released for public comment. Like the NRSME, this very recent document stresses that, in Learning in Music Years K-12, students should ‘come to understand and engage with the multiple and culturally-diverse practices of music, locally, nationally, and globally’ (p. 17). This draft proposal recognizes that the arts, including music, ‘provide an especially rich platform for understanding cultural diversity and being sensitive to it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0255761411434254">ACARA, 2010</xref>, p. 21). In the cultural mosaic that is contemporary Australia this ideal may not always be achievable. Teachers at all levels are faced with questions about choosing what multicultural music should be presented, how it should be taught, and how to maintain some degree of cultural authenticity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0255761411434254">Joseph and Southcott (2010)</xref> found that ‘at least in some schools, there is a lack of understanding of how multicultural music could and should be taught’ (p. 76). One way to address this problem is through the inclusion of artists in school programs.</p>
<p>In Australia, as elsewhere, the presence of artists-in-schools programs is not a new phenomenon in education but have existed in schools for more than a hundred years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0255761411434254">Geahigan, 1992</xref>) and include artists in a wide range of fields such as literature, visual arts and the performing arts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0255761411434254">Smart, 2001</xref>). In music such schemes operate under a diversity of titles such as artists-in-residence, musicians-in-schools, visiting-artists, and more recently creative partnerships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0255761411434254">Griffiths &amp; Woolf, 2009</xref>). Today many professional arts providers facilitate expert artists to run regular workshops in schools and auspice student excursions to cultural centers. For example, in suburban Melbourne (Victoria) the Center for Education and Research in Environmental Strategies (CERES) is a community educational center where students and teachers can interact and ‘discover traditional and contemporary celebrations, customs and traditions’ from a range of cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0255761411434254">CERES, 2010</xref>). Such interactions ‘give school children . . . and their teachers the opportunity to explore their creativity by working on sustained projects with creative professionals’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0255761411434254">Hall, Thomson, &amp; Russell, 2007</xref>, p. 605). American researchers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0255761411434254">Catterall and Waldorf (1999)</xref> in their study of the Chicago Arts Partnerships in Education, which brought local artists and arts agencies into partnerships with teachers at all grade levels, quoted one of their observers as noting that an artists-in-residence could ‘deepen the students’ development in ways that academic projects or art projects alone could not’ (p. 58). In Australia artists-in-schools programs can provide the same experiences and understandings. Unpacking such programs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0255761411434254">Oreck, Baum and McCartney (1999)</xref>, in their study of the Young Talent program that followed past and current students of a performing arts program in the New York City public schools, cite a teacher who asserted that professional artists were essential in a school as they bring ‘their commitment to the art, their own gifts, their drive to create good art, their immersion in the art world, their commitment to excellence’ which is transmitted to the students and teachers they work with (p. 74). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0255761411434254">Joseph (2010)</xref> recounts that she interviewed an expert culture bearer of African music who works in Victorian schools as a visiting artist, performer and composer who stated that he imparts knowledge of Africa and believes that this ‘breaks down racial barriers’ (p. 72).</p>
<p>Artists-in-schools programs can occur in schools in different ways; these might take place as a component of curriculum within timetabled lessons, as co-curricular activities (after school), in workshops, and at school camps. These can occur as single lessons, a series of lessons, a special event for a number of classes combined, in assemblies, and so forth. The program may span ‘as much as several years, or as little as a few days’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761411434254">Bryce, Mendelovits, Beavis, McQueen, &amp; Adams, 2004</xref>, p. 5). In these programs artists and culture bearers not only ‘share their passion and expertise with students and teachers’ as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0255761411434254">Hanley (2003</xref>, p. 12) suggests, but also offer a first-hand knowledge and expertise in a culture and its music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0255761411434254">Erwin, Edwards, Kerchner, &amp; Knight, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0255761411434254">Joseph, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0255761411434254">Sinsabaugh (2006)</xref> supports the idea of artists working in partnership with educators as being ‘one way to ensure that students have access to quality music education and that music education is effectively instituted for all students’ (p. 176). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0255761411434254">Eisner (1974)</xref> points out that, to this end, ‘artistic competency should be one of the major criteria for selecting artists to work in schools’ (p. 23). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0255761411434254">Seidel, Eppel and Martiniello (2001)</xref> argue that it is essential to provide students with the finest authentic artistic experiences. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0255761411434254">Hanley (2003)</xref> recognized, if visits by artists are brief and sporadic, it is less likely that meaningful learning will occur. Hanley is referring to such drop-in programs as just ‘exposure to the arts [that] does not promote meaningful learning’ (p. 14). Meaningful learning is also precluded by a smorgasbord of different world musics that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0255761411434254">Burton (2001)</xref> describes as mere serendipitous samplings without context or authenticity. Our study did not seek to measure the actual experiences of the student participants; rather, we explore their understandings of the different musics, cultures, and educational contexts they encountered. One way to try to engage in authentic practices is through artists-in-schools programs; however, provision of such programs is mitigated by the availability of financial resources.</p>
<p>Writing specifically about the Australian context, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0255761411434254">Hunter (2005)</xref> found that school ‘students valued opportunities to be engaged in real life tasks, to work with real artists’ (p. 32). Such opportunities occur too infrequently in primary and secondary education even though there is a long history of including artists in schools programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0255761411434254">Hanley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0255761411434254">Stein, 2004</xref>). This is compounded by the limitations of tertiary teacher education programs in Australia where music educators are faced with limitations of time, resources and expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0255761411434254">Jeanneret, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0255761411434254">Temmerman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0255761411434254">Russell-Bowie, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0255761411434254">Ballantyne, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0255761411434254">Southcott &amp; Joseph, 2010</xref>). In Australia, tertiary teacher education courses incorporate music in different ways for different educational levels. In secondary education music is taught by specialist teachers with in-depth musical expertise but in elementary education music is mostly taught by generalist classroom teachers. The tertiary courses reflect this difference and further vary considerably in the seven states and two territories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0255761411434254">Department of Education, Science and Training, 2005</xref>). This creates a challenge for teacher educators to find ways in which to incorporate deep immersion experiences in music of other cultures for student teachers so that they will become more inclined to include such experiences in their own teaching.</p>
<p>To date, in Australia there have only been a few studies into the changing attitudes and understandings of pre-service teachers concerning culturally-inclusive music education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0255761411434254">Anderson, Brown &amp; Jeanneret, 2007</xref>). This resonates with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0255761411434254">Green (2002)</xref> that there was little research into this area. To address this lacuna, this study considers the views of student teachers and tertiary music educators about one possible strategy to increase cultural diversity in school music: the role, potential, and need for artists-in-schools programs as both a form of authentic classroom enrichment and of professional development for teachers. Considering that we live in a society with a complex mix of languages, ethnicities, races and religions we, as tertiary educators, are unable to offer courses that meet all the needs of the many musical cultures and genres represented in Victoria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0255761411434254">Joseph &amp; Southcott, 2006</xref>). Given the rich cultural diversity of this state we strongly support the availability of artists-in-schools programs as we recognize that there is a gap in the provision of authentic multicultural music opportunities for both schools and for our student teachers. This article is based on interview data collected during a study situated in Melbourne, Victoria, <italic>Intercultural Understandings of Pre-Service Music Education Students</italic> (2005–2009), which had two aims: to explore students’ understanding of cultural diversity in music education and to discover how they envisaged multicultural music teaching in schools. This particular discussion focuses on one facet of this study: perceptions held by participants concerning artists-in-schools programs.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>In 2005 ethical approval to undertake a longitudinal project, <italic>Intercultural Understandings of Pre-Service Music Education Students</italic> (2005–2009), was gained from the relevant committees at two metropolitan Australian universities in Melbourne, Victoria (Deakin University and Monash University). Between 2005 and 2009 volunteer participant interviews were undertaken with final year music education students at both metropolitan universities concerning their preparedness to teach music in classrooms that reflect contemporary Australian cultural diversity. This article considers responses gathered during five years of interview data collection undertaken in both universities by a research assistant (RA). To ensure consistency, the same RA was used throughout the study to provide distance between the authors who, as tertiary music educators, taught the volunteer interviewees. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0255761411434254">Wiersma and Jurs (2009)</xref> point out, it is important to train the interviewer so that there is consistency across the interviews. In this study it was not necessary to educate the interviewer concerning the special knowledge required for this study as the interviewer is herself an experienced music educator and researcher. All final year music methodology students were invited by the RA by email to take part in an individual semi-structured interview (50–60 minutes duration). Sample questions were provided in the email invitation so that students could focus their thinking prior to interview. These questions initially sought details of music background, and their multicultural music experiences in both their schooling and tertiary education. Participants were invited to reflect on their understanding of these experiences. All interviews were audio recorded by the RA with the consent of the participants and transcribed. All participants were invited to confirm the accuracy of their interview transcript. Participants were interviewed once in the latter part of the final year of their course. These interviews did not seek to identify changing attitudes: rather, they are a snapshot of understandings held by participants, hence the dates of the actual interviews is not relevant.</p>
<p>Conversational semi-structured interviews encourage full and equal discussion between participants and interviewer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0255761411434254">Macionis &amp; Plummer, 2005</xref>). Fifty-three interviewees, approximately half from each institution, participated. The participants included students in their first degree and returning mature age people, thus their ages ranged from 20 to 45. The cohorts across both institutions included approximately equal numbers of males and females over the five years of the study. The authors analyzed all the interview data collected in the two universities by the RA. The authors are also the participants’ tertiary educators who are responsible for the presentation and delivery of music methodology programs that included the consideration of cultural diversity in school music. As experienced university music educators the authors offer commentary as part of the discussion of data. This discussion reports on one facet of the semi-structured interviews that offers understandings concerning the inclusion of artists-in-schools in school programs and the importance of making links with local communities.</p>
<p>All interview data were analyzed by the researchers using Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). This analytical device employs a phenomenological approach that attempts to explore personal experience in the participant’s life world. In-depth semi-structured interviews are recommended as most effective in IPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0255761411434254">Smith, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0255761411434254">Eatough &amp; Smith, 2006</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0255761411434254">Brocki and Wearden (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0255761411434254">Reid, Flowers and Larkin (2005)</xref>, IPA focuses on the exploration of participants’ experiences, understandings, and views. Further, IPA recognizes that this involves a process of interpretation by the researcher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0255761411434254">Smith, 2005</xref>). From this data it is possible to develop patterns of meaning that can be reported thematically and illustrated by direct quotations from the interview transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0255761411434254">Larkin, Watts, &amp; Clifton, 2006</xref>). The table of themes for the wider project generated by IPA identified a number of over-arching understandings (perceptions of multiculturalism, classroom music realities, personal and professional multicultural resources, past experience of other musics, multicultural music in tertiary teacher education, expectations of future effective teaching, and multicultural community artists-in-schools). The final theme (multicultural community artists-in-schools) is reported here. The other themes have already been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0255761411434254">Joseph, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0255761411434254">Southcott &amp; Joseph, 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0255761411434254">2007b</xref>). It is recognized that there is some overlap in the themes, but the rich data generated has warranted consideration of themes in isolation; thus this article will only focus on one theme – that of the understandings held by all participants (student teachers and tertiary educators) concerning artists-in-schools programs.</p>

<title>Findings: Student teacher perceptions of multicultural artists-in-schools</title>
<p>The perceptions held by our students at both universities throughout this study covered a range from considerable understanding to unthinking naivety. Under the over-arching theme of perceptions of multicultural artists-in-schools a number of sub-themes were identified. These are: basic understandings of artists-in-schools and multicultural music; pragmatic issues encountered during school placements; transformative experiences generated by artists-in-schools; the importance of cultural context; valuing the authentic voices of artists-in-schools; professional development issues; and appropriate pedagogical approaches. These will be addressed in turn within this discussion of the findings.</p>
<p>When asked about including multicultural music in schools one student succinctly stated that it ‘broadens my horizons as I learn different ways of approaching music’. Another student added that ‘there are obvious benefits as you can share different musics and cultures with people’ and one effective way of achieving this, is by having a visiting artist who ‘can open up a whole world to students and their teachers’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0255761411434254">Hanley (2003)</xref> agrees that artists-in-schools programs can bring both ‘novelty and generate excitement in schools’ (p. 12). The interviewed students understood that a multicultural artist was ‘someone who comes into the school who is experienced and knowledgeable in music from another culture who works with your students in class’. Another student explained that ‘there are great benefits in multicultural music and having someone who specializes in music from another country and from another culture and hopefully everybody will gain more appreciation of different peoples and cultures’. Overall the students’ responses seemed positive and demonstrated an awareness of the potential benefits of inviting artists into schools. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0255761411434254">Joseph (2010)</xref> confirms that the inclusion of culture bearers is essential for culturally-inclusive music programs at all levels of education, both formal and informal. Both authors are of the opinion that, ultimately, all music educators cannot be educated in all musics and cultures: it is an impossible ask.</p>
<p>Over the course of this study the participants offered a range of ideas about why we should include multicultural music in education and how this could be accomplished which has been addressed in previous discussions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0255761411434254">Joseph &amp; Southcott, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0255761411434254">2010</xref>). To a large degree our tertiary students felt that while on school placement the music teachers they were working with found it confronting to be asked about their inclusion of multiculturalism <italic>per se</italic> in their lessons. The participants reported that most teachers seemed to lack confidence in music other than the western genres in which they had been educated. There were, of course, a few exceptions to this. For example, one student reported being placed in a classroom with a teacher who had, in her own teacher education, undertaken an international school practicum. Our interviewee remembered that her supervising teacher ‘had learnt about Ghanaian music and dance during her teacher education course when she went to Ghana for three weeks which was more authentic and heaps better than just going to a few workshops in Australia’. The authors comment that it is not possible for all students to undertake such international cultural immersions, however desirable, due to financial and other constraints.</p>
<p>While on school placement, several of the student participants were present when multicultural artists visited schools to present programs of varying durations. One participant recalled that she was placed at a school for a 10-day observational visit where an Indian musician was running an artists-in-schools program for one day per week for a month. The student said that she was deeply impressed by:
<disp-quote>
<p>the Indian tabla player that I saw. He just sat there and played the instrument and explained these concepts about Indian music which I hadn’t even considered and having someone like that totally opened up my mind – I had no idea about the very high regard the community has for musicians in India.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This student was so impressed by this short experience that she enrolled in an evening class in tabla playing to extend her knowledge, skills and understandings of Indian music. Despite our reservation that a brief exposure to a different culture and music is generally inadequate, this proved to be the exception rather than the rule. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0255761411434254">Joseph and Keast (2005)</xref> point out that, in professional development for teachers, ‘the “one-off-hit” or “shot-in-the-arm” method’ is usually inadequate to support teachers through change and that teachers need time to make connections and transfer knowledge. However, in this quoted case of exposure to Indian music, this exceptional student did find one single experience to be inspirational and transformative.</p>
<p>The impression created by even one experience with a visiting artist can change awareness and understanding. One student enthusiastically stated:
<disp-quote>
<p>I remember the experience of attending a concert by a Balinese gamelan ensemble with all these players performing in our school hall while I was on placement. Not only did they play this amazing music, they explained how the whole village comes together to create these community performances which included dancing.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The connections made by these artists offered greater understanding of how music can build and enrich community. Further such explanations by culture bearers can offer insight about the context of the music that may not be apparent when either listening to the music or researching it online. One student provided an example of just this point. She said that, before she went to a gamelan performance during her school placement, she ‘had heard this music in Bali on holidays. It sounded nice but I was not very interested because I didn’t understand its context. Now I really get how the dancing and music combine to tell a story’. She explained that her perceptions had changed as ‘during the concert at the school, the musicians introduced every piece, explained what the different instruments contributed, the form of the music, what the songs were about and how the different pieces combined to tell a story’. She concluded by stating that, ‘I can much more appreciate the beauty in the sound and the purpose of the music now I’m more familiar with it’. This change of understanding is enabled and enhanced when the music is presented and surrounded by its culture. The authors explain that, in our teaching, we can play a sound recording of a gamelan ensemble or have our students watch a YouTube clip, but this is not the same as having an artist who is also a culture bearer who can demonstrate and respond to questions. When schools engage artists to work in classrooms, the performers bring with them authenticity and enrichment. The second student quoted earlier explained that ‘when the artists came they brought their culture with them – their national dress, their language and their accents, their dancing and their stories – it was so much more than just the music’.</p>
<p>Artists-in-schools can reflect this complexity. In some cultures there is little or no divide between the art forms of dance and music – rather they are seen as inseparable. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0255761411434254">Akrofi (2004)</xref> points out that, in Africa, traditional arts are community oriented, performed together with music, dance, play and storytelling. One student in this study was placed in a school where a South African artist was presenting a program of stories, singing, instrumental playing, and dancing in cultural context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0255761411434254">Sounds Alive, 2010</xref>). He described the event as ‘just fantastic, the real thing – great for kids to see someone from there who built relationships with everyone so you could freely ask questions, about how to sing the songs in African language, do gumboot moves and play mbiras’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0255761411434254">1</xref>.</sup> This tertiary student felt that he had, over the course of the week, learnt a great deal, so much so that he felt like an apprentice who could continue these activities on his own. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0255761411434254">Joseph (2010)</xref> found that, as part of her tertiary music education teaching, she is able to provide practical, authentic musical and cultural experiences for her students who develop confidence and competencies to teach African music both on school placements and in their future teaching. An example of this was offered in one of the participant interviews. The student stated that she was from Indonesia and excitedly described teaching an African song while on her teaching placement. She said:
<disp-quote>
<p>the pupils were amazed when I taught one of the songs, movements and body percussion that I learnt in Dawn’s class. They were really surprised because I really don’t look African but I clearly knew what I was doing. My supervising teacher wanted me to teach more music like this.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One of the authors is the teacher referred to in this quotation and Joseph comments that
<disp-quote>
<p>it is rewarding to hear that students on school placements are using the African songs and dances learnt during their tertiary music education classes, especially when they had found the activities initially challenging when asked to sing, play instruments, and dance in front of their peers.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Throughout this study, the participants all acknowledged that, in principle, artists-in-schools programs were valuable, which can mean many things. Primarily the interviewees recognized that the presence of multicultural artists-in-schools for long- or even short-term visits was beneficial for teaching and learning. One participant stated that it was ‘really valuable for all concerned . . . it’s good to allow kids to build a relationship with an artist and learn about their music and culture, plus, I really enjoyed it and saw how I could use what I learnt in my future teaching’. Another student teacher remarked that,
<disp-quote>
<p>I was really lucky to be at the school when the Bolivian group came for the afternoon. I learnt a lot and it was very exciting and interesting for the kids to see the costumes and hear the instruments. You could see that the kids were really listening and they knew what to listen for.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0255761411434254">Hunter (2005)</xref> identified that teachers recognized that students respected working with experienced artists which resulted in them becoming more engaged in activities. Repeatedly interviewees commented that it was more enjoyable and engaging to work with authentic artists on site. For example, one student pointed out that ‘in my classroom during my teaching practice it was more fun and engaging for the kids to talk to real people like the Celtic group that came for a day than just showing them different musics on a video’. This student recounted a conversation he had after the session with his supervising teacher who explained that he really looked forward to such events as they were ‘great for the kids but great for him too and served as a form of professional development’. This interviewee continued to quote his supervising teacher who explained that bringing in the Celtic group was the only visit by artists-in-schools for that year as the ‘budget was tight and the rest of the money was used to buy sports equipment’. Another student described a related situation in which the performing and visual areas ‘took turns to invite in artists as there was not enough money to support more than one each year’.</p>
<p>Throughout Australia, teachers are expected to undertake a certain amount of professional development every year which often involves attending offsite workshops. In the case of music, professional organizations often provide short courses or single events in music of other cultures. In Melbourne, Joseph has offered such professional development courses in African music but observes that it is much more effective when working with a class and their teacher in their own school. In this situation, Joseph was effectively functioning as a visiting artist and found teachers learnt better in their own classrooms sharing ideas and activities with their pupils. This can create a rich educational and artistic environment where the nexus of theory and practice can produce amazing and immediate results. Joseph, as artist and experienced educator, can work with the music teacher to implement and evaluate children’s understanding and participation in culturally-diverse music activities.</p>
<p>Artists-in-schools programs offer teachers the opportunity to be active participants in multicultural music making. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0255761411434254">Flecknoe (2000)</xref> points out that this is more likely to impact on improving teachers’ classroom practices and could be considered a form of onsite professional development. The authors believe that it was not always possible to immerse tertiary students in as many musics and their cultures as we would like. There are real benefits for our students on school placements when they have the opportunity to experience and engage with a visiting artist. All we can do is offer them a taste of a different music and culture. It then becomes their responsibility to further their interest, skills and understandings. Joseph explained that she teaches:
<disp-quote>
<p>African music using djembe drums, marimbas, mbiras and non-melodic African instruments but this is only a very small sample of what is possible both in terms of resources and in my performing and teaching expertise whereas artists-in-schools can offer far more. For example, when West African groups visit schools they take with them instruments and music that I cannot provide, such as the kora.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As tertiary music educators we do the best we can, but we cannot be practitioners of a range of cultures in the same way that a visiting artist can be.</p>
<p>Over the course of the study a number of students observed that artists-in-schools teaching different musics often used different pedagogical approaches. For example, one interviewee said that:
<disp-quote>
<p>I was amazed at the amount of imitation and call and response that African musicians use. They used a different system of syllables to teach the different tones and rhythms on the djembe. It was an African language that the students and I picked up very quickly. It was so much easier than reading staff notation and teaching time names – they were even able to improvise responses to the African musicians’ call.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This student is describing the use of mnemonic syllabic patterns that use vocal sounds to represent rhythmic patterns as are used in teaching music in Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0255761411434254">Kwami, 2002</xref>). Another student described a session taught by an Israeli musician where they learnt the selected song at the same time as they learnt the dance. He said:
<disp-quote>
<p>I was surprised because I would have taught the song called <italic>Ak Shav</italic> first and then added the movements but the artist was right as the children picked up both things really quickly, just by imitating the performer one line and one action at a time.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Again our students have recognized that, in these cultural contexts, as in many others, music and movement are inseparable. This also includes the use of often quite intricate body percussion patterns as another student confirmed:
<disp-quote>
<p>when my class was taught a Jamaican calypso, the visiting musician taught them the song with a lot of clapping, stamping and finger clicking. The kids learnt it really easily but I struggled because I was trying to work how to write it down so I could remember it. This meant that I never actually got it right because I was stuck on working out the time signature and where all the beats went.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As in all music education we should teach the sound before the symbol which resonates with what our students have observed when they encountered artists-in-schools programs. Further, music should not be taught in isolation but rather it should be presented holistically in its cultural context.</p>

<title>Discussion and conclusion</title>
<p>This article has discussed student teachers’ perceptions of artists-in-schools programs which is one facet of our broader study <italic>Intercultural Understandings of Pre-Service Music Education Students</italic> (2005–2009). This interview data is indicative and cannot be understood as representative of a whole generation of future teachers. However, the pre-service teacher education students’ opinions expressed and the perceptions articulated do offer direction for the preparation of culturally-responsive teachers. Our interviewees seem well aware of the challenges and potential benefits of artists-in-schools programs that can found and build relationships. Such shared-practice can, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0255761411434254">Easton (2003)</xref> suggests, inspire teachers to use a ‘wider range of artistic modalities and pedagogical approaches in their practice’ (p. 19). Our students realized that these practices should include culturally-contextualized active music making that encompasses singing, playing, dancing, moving, listening and improvisation. Our participants were convinced about the potential efficacy of artists-in-schools programs which promises well for their future practice as teachers. Some of our student teacher interviewees found that, during their teaching practice, working with artists-in-schools could fill in omissions in their own knowledge, skills and understandings.</p>
<p>Even in an aspirationally-multicultural society like Australia the opportunity to engage with another cultural group can be rare, as some of our students reported. Our Australian data resonates with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0255761411434254">Stein (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0255761411434254">Hanley (2003)</xref> that some schools are faced with difficult choices due to budgetary and other restrictions in the provision of teachers and resources. The authors recognize that these dilemmas also affect tertiary music educators as we are frequently faced with similar issues of crowded curricula and funding shortfalls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0255761411434254">Russell-Bowie, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0255761411434254">Ballantyne, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0255761411434254">Soutcott &amp; Joseph, 2010</xref>). However, we believe that it is relatively easy to access a wealth of multicultural music teaching and learning resources. We should not limit our students to what they bring to their teacher education or what we can personally provide for them. We encourage our students to make this effort consciously and intentionally as part of their commitment to lifelong learning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0255761411434254">Anderson and Campbell (1989)</xref> confirm that students enjoy learning new musics, new songs in original language, and new cultures. In addition they emphasize that students ‘can also learn to play authentic musical instruments from many music cultures’ (p. 6).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0255761411434254">Hunter (2005)</xref> found that, in Australia, ‘teachers value working alongside professional artists, especially those who have sustained experience in educational contexts’ (p. 36). The provision of artists-in-schools programs can improve the motivation to learn and engage in multicultural music for all participants, including our student teacher interviewees. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0255761411434254">Easton (2003)</xref> identifies the potential for visiting artists to engender professional and personal change in the teachers they work with and that as over time ‘both parties expand their understanding of their roles, the partnerships will better realize this breadth of possibility’ (p. 25). However, the partnerships that may be formed between teachers and artists is not the focus of this article; rather, we have undertaken a phenomenological approach, seeking to understand and interpret student experiences and perceptions of the role of artists-in-schools.</p>
<p>The students interviewed expressed a preference for extended learning sequences in multicultural music, citing the example of their semester-long programs in African music during their teacher education. During their school teaching practice they encountered a range of artists-in-schools programs that occurred as single or regular events that were held weekly or, very occasionally, lasted for an entire term. We contend that, the longer the artists-in-schools program, the greater the potential gains. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0255761411434254">Easton (2003)</xref> points out that to build effective partnerships between teachers and artists-in-schools there needs to be time for sharing, planning, and reflecting which takes time and commitment to the process. This is harder to achieve, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0255761411434254">Hanley (2003)</xref> identifies, in single, stand-alone events. Nonetheless, one-off events can bring excitement and novelty to a school and may provide some motivation to explore another music and culture.</p>
<p>As schooling is a social construct that is embedded in the society that creates it, we have, in Australia, rich opportunities for culturally-diverse music education. Our larger project has concerned the intercultural understandings and attitudes of our pre-service music education students who have demonstrated an appreciation of the possibilities of our rich cultural milieu and how this can be enacted in schools by including culture bearers and visiting artists. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0255761411434254">Welch (2010)</xref> points out that Australia ‘is a country of migration, and its history and identity are inextricable from that fact . . . Each generation must renew the commitment to diversity and multiculturalism, including in education’ (p. 131). Our student participants throughout this project will comprise the next generation of teachers who, it is hoped, will make a commitment to the inclusion of diverse cultures and pedagogies in their future music teaching. As tertiary music educators, we endorse the promotion and provision of multicultural music education at all levels of education by the inclusion of diverse culture bearers, artists-in-schools, and community engagement to work with both teachers and their students in classrooms. Our interviewed student teachers have demonstrated that they recognize that artists-in-schools provide ‘so much more than just the music’. This augurs well for the future of music education in Australia.</p>

<title>Alors, beaucoup plus que seulement la musique: l’attitude des stagiaires d’enseignament de musique en Australie par rapport aux programmes artistes à l’école</title>
<p>L’Australie contemporaine est un pays de migration continue et diversité culturelle qui se reflète dans ses pratiques artistiques. Cet article considère les opinions exprimées par les professeurs de musique stagiaires australiens et leurs professeurs de musique sur leurs perceptions concernant les programme artistes chez les écoles de musique. Cette discussion rapporte les données recueillies pour une étude menée à Melbourne, Victoria, au cadre du projet <italic>Compréhension Interculturelle sur les Stagiaires de Enseignement de la Musique (2005–2009)</italic>. Cinquante-trois interviews ont été analysés à l′aide de l′analyse interprétative phénoménologique. Les résultats donnent un aperçu de la reconnaissance des enseignants de la nécessité pour les programmes Artistes à l′École. En particulier la manière dont les enseignants peuvent lier la théorie à la pratique, de combler un manque dans leurs propres connaissances, compétences et compréhension, et d′accroître la compréhension des étudiants sur des musiques multiculturelles. La promotion et la disposition de l′éducation musicale multiculturelle est essentielle à tous les niveaux de l′éducation. Ceci peut être réalisé par l’inclusion des porteurs de cultures diverses, des artistes à l′école, et l’engagement communautaire à travailler avec les enseignants et leurs élèves.</p>

<p>La Australia actual es un país de inmigración permanente y creciente diversidad cultural que se refleja en sus manifestaciones artísticas. Este artículo tiene en cuenta los puntos de vista de los estudiantes de magisterio musical australianos y los de sus educadores musicales de la Post-Secundaria acerca de sus percepciones relativas a los programas de “artistas en las escuelas” en la música escolar. Este debate aporta datos recogidos para un estudio llevado a cabo en Melbourne, Victoria, sobre “Las comprensiones interculturales de los estudiantes de magisterio musical” (2005-2009). Se analizaron cincuenta y tres entrevistas utilizando el Análisis Fenomenológico Interpretativo. Los hallazgos aportan ideas al reconocimiento por parte de los docentes de la necesidad de programas de “artistas en las escuelas”. En concreto, las maneras en las que los docentes pueden unir la teoría a la práctica, paliar lagunas de su propio conocimiento, habilidades y comprensiones, y aumentar el entendimiento de las músicas multiculturales por parte de los estudiantes. Ofrecer la posibilidad y promocionar la educación musical multicultural es esencial en todos los niveles educativos. Esto puede lograrse mediante la inclusión de portadores de culturas diversas, “artistas en la escuela”, y el compromiso de la comunidad de trabajar con los docentes y su alumnado.</p>
