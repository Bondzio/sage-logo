<abstract>
<p>In this comparative, longitudinal case study, the author investigates the two different pathways that have been most strongly advocated for certifying middle school social studies teachers: the specialized middle school and subject-specific secondary pathways. Drawing on classroom observations, interviews, documents, teacher and student work samples, and surveys, this article compares the learning and practice of 2 seventh-grade social studies teachers across time. Both teachers learned key principles and practices from their respective teacher education programs but ultimately taught in ways that often demanded little of young adolescents intellectually. The findings suggest that teacher educators preparing social studies teachers for the middle grades need to look not only at the opportunities they provide for teachers to learn about young adolescents, social studies teaching purposes, and social studies teaching strategies but also at the implementation and integration of these learning opportunities.</p>

<body>
<p>In fall 2009, two seventh-grade social studies teachers are beginning their second year of teaching after graduating from different teacher education programs at the same university in spring 2008. Timothy (names are pseudonyms), a graduate of a secondary social studies teacher education program, and Brian, a graduate of a specialized middle school teacher education program, are thoughtful beginning teachers who are interested in constantly improving their practice, and they have embraced many of the ideals of their respective teacher education programs. Accordingly, they both envision implementing reform-oriented social studies instruction that engages their seventh-grade students and involves them in higher order thinking.</p>
<p>Given their differential preparation, Timothy and Brian’s practice provides a window into some of the central questions that dominate broader discussions of teacher preparation. To what extent should teacher education emphasize teachers’ subject matter understandings and to what extent should teacher education emphasize learning about the particular students they will teach? How do these different emphases shape teachers’ ability to enact substantive teaching?</p>
<p>In this article, I draw on data from a longitudinal, comparative case study and examine the comparative cases of Timothy and Brian in relation to two of the study’s research questions: (a) What do teachers learn from their preparation about intellectually demanding social studies teaching at the middle school level? and (b) In what ways, if any, does teachers’ preparation influence their classroom practices in their first years of teaching?</p>
<sec id="section1-0022487111426294">
<title>Relevant Literature</title>
<p>Middle school social studies teachers hold the critical responsibility of challenging young adolescents intellectually so that they are equipped to engage thoughtfully in our complex democracy. Complicating matters, some middle school teachers are prepared through generalist elementary programs, some through specialized middle school programs, and still others through subject-specific secondary programs. Yet, even at this time of increased public interest in teacher quality and the varied pathways into teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022487111426294">Boyd et al., 2006</xref>), we know little about the kind of preparation teachers receive for middle school teaching from these divergent pathways. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022487111426294">Conklin (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022487111426294">2009)</xref> compared middle school social studies teachers’ preparation from a generalist elementary and a social studies–specific secondary program, but that study did not examine specialized middle school preparation, nor did it follow teachers into their first years of practice.</p>
<p>In the research I discuss here, rather than investigating the two most common pathways into middle school teaching (elementary and secondary), I compare the two pathways that have been most strongly advocated for certifying middle school social studies teachers: the specialized middle school pathway and the subject-specific secondary pathway. Middle school advocates have argued for many years that specialized preparation focusing on knowledge of young adolescents is necessary for teaching at the middle level (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022487111426294">McEwin, Smith, &amp; Dickinson, 2003</xref>). However, these arguments have been based primarily on advocacy and have little empirical support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022487111426294">McEwin et al., 2003</xref>). Meanwhile, the <italic>No Child Left Behind</italic> legislation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022487111426294">U.S. Department of Education, 2003</xref>) has emphasized middle school teachers’ content knowledge as their most important preparation for teaching, an expectation that corresponds with the content-specific secondary pathway to middle school teaching. It is well known that a deep understanding of social studies content is essential for teaching for conceptual understanding (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022487111426294">VanSledright, 2002</xref>) and that subject training makes a difference in student achievement (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022487111426294">Juvonen, Le, Kaganoff, Augustine, &amp; Constant, 2004</xref>). However, there is limited empirical evidence of the role of social studies teacher education in relation to important teaching and learning outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022487111426294">Adler, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022487111426294">Zeichner, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, research suggests that many middle school teachers are not well prepared to challenge young adolescents intellectually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022487111426294">Conklin, 2008</xref>). Curriculum and instruction are poorly matched to the needs of young adolescents in most middle schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022487111426294">Jackson &amp; Davis, 2000</xref>), and, at a time in their lives when young adolescents are gaining new abilities to think in more complex ways (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022487111426294">Byrnes, 2003</xref>), there is a decrease in demand for higher order thinking in many middle school classrooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022487111426294">Eccles et al., 1993</xref>). These findings corroborate a growing public discontent with the lack of academic rigor in middle grades education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022487111426294">Gootman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022487111426294">Wallis, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, there is limited longitudinal research to help us understand what teachers learn from different kinds of programs and how they use that learning in new classroom settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022487111426294">Feiman-Nemser, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022487111426294">Zeichner, 2005</xref>). Some studies have taken up the complex effort of tracking teachers’ learning from their preparation into their initial years of teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022487111426294">Boyd et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022487111426294">Grossman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022487111426294">Monte-Sano &amp; Cochran, 2009</xref>), yet, there is a dearth of empirical research in middle-level social studies teacher education that examines the impact of teacher education on teachers’ practice across time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022487111426294">Zeichner, 2005</xref>). Thus, this study lies at the intersection of many underexplored areas of research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0022487111426294">
<title>Theoretical Perspective</title>
<p>This research is grounded in sociological and cognitive-psychological perspectives on teacher learning and a conception of the understandings teachers require to enact intellectually demanding social studies teaching in the middle grades. These perspectives suggest that teachers’ learning will be influenced by teachers’ own backgrounds and beliefs, the times and places they learn to teach, the content of what they learn to teach, and the ways in which their learning occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022487111426294">Feiman-Nemser &amp; Remillard, 1995</xref>). For example, teachers’ learning is likely to be best facilitated when it is carefully structured and scaffolded in the context of teaching practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022487111426294">Ball &amp; Forzani, 2009</xref>), within a community of learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022487111426294">Borko &amp; Putnam, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022487111426294">Hammerness, Darling-Hammond, &amp; Bransford, 2005</xref>). In addition, social forces such as institutional context, race, and gender will shape what teachers learn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022487111426294">Zeichner &amp; Gore, 1990</xref>), as well as the contexts of subject matter and students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022487111426294">Feiman-Nemser, 2008</xref>). Thus, in a study such as this, one needs to investigate and account for these varied influences on teachers’ learning.</p>
<p>I focus here on teachers’ learning in relation to intellectually demanding social studies teaching and learning at the middle level. Such work is characterized by students’ engagement in rigorous, relevant learning that emphasizes higher order thinking skills and value beyond school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022487111426294">Newmann, King, &amp; Carmichael, 2007</xref>). To enact this kind of teaching, middle school social studies teachers need a deep and complex knowledge of social studies subject matter (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022487111426294">VanSledright, 2002</xref>), as well as a clear, guiding purpose for their social studies teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022487111426294">Barton &amp; Levstik, 2004</xref>). They also need to have well-developed understandings of students and beliefs in the capabilities of students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022487111426294">Grant, 2003</xref>). In particular, at the middle level, teachers should have an in-depth understanding of young adolescents’ capabilities and interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022487111426294">Beane, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022487111426294">Jackson &amp; Davis, 2000</xref>). Finally, teachers should possess the practices, dispositions, and tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022487111426294">Hammerness et al., 2005</xref>) that enable them to implement social studies teaching aimed at historical inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022487111426294">Levstik &amp; Barton, 2001</xref>) and critical democratic citizenship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022487111426294">Dinkelman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022487111426294">Parker, 2003</xref>)—those forms of intellectually demanding social studies teaching that will engage and challenge young minds.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section4-0022487111426294">
<title>Program Context</title>
<p>I selected two different pathways with overlapping certification (Grades 6-8) for this instrumental case study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022487111426294">Stake, 2000</xref>) because they offered a unique opportunity to understand teachers’ learning in the context of the same institution. Both of these programs are housed in the same academic department in the same southeastern research university. The specialized middle school pathway is an undergraduate, four-semester program in which preservice teachers take coursework in general methods, curriculum, and two subject area emphases (e.g., social studies and language arts), and engage in fieldwork in middle grades classrooms (Grades 4-8) across three of the four semesters. The secondary social studies pathway is an undergraduate program in which preservice teachers take coursework in social studies methods and curriculum and engage in fieldwork in middle or high school classrooms across three semesters. (The secondary teachers are not required to complete any fieldwork in middle schools.) In both programs, the final semester of fieldwork is a full-time student teaching semester.</p>

<title>Research Design and Data Sources</title>
<p>Timothy and Brian are two cases I have drawn from this larger case study to examine the relationship between program opportunities and teachers’ learning and practice. To select Timothy and Brian, in the spring of 2008, I surveyed undergraduates in the secondary (<italic>n</italic> = 27) and middle grades (<italic>n</italic> = 22) programs, all of whom were about to graduate and eligible for social studies teaching credentials in Grades 6 to 8. The surveys elicited information such as teachers’ understandings about young adolescents, social studies, and teaching strategies; their opportunities to learn in their teacher education programs; subjects and grade levels they hoped to teach; where they planned to teach; and demographic information. Using the graduating teacher survey data, I then purposefully selected four graduates from each pathway to take part in the 2-year study: These teachers (a) secured jobs teaching social studies in middle schools (Grades 6-8) with culturally and economically diverse student populations and (b) vary along the key attributes of gender, subject, and grade levels they hoped to teach, and subject background.</p>
<p>Here I focus on Timothy and Brian because they are both males in their early 20s who taught the same state-mandated social studies curriculum to seventh graders—all factors that facilitate comparisons. In addition, they both expressed a desire to enact the ideals of their teacher education programs and both taught in supportive, collaborative schools with administrators who gave them considerable autonomy to teach according to their visions. Finally, both Timothy and Brian are representative of their respective graduating cohorts in their desire to either work with young adolescents (Brian) or teach at the high school level (Timothy).</p>
<p>In their first two years of teaching, I conducted 14 classroom observations of each teacher, recording detailed notes during each visit to examine the nature of their instruction and the kinds of thinking they were demanding from students. In the first year, I observed each teacher twice per year for three consecutive days each time; in the second year, I observed each teacher teaching consecutive lessons at three different points across the school year. Whenever possible, I observed each teacher handling the same curricular material. I interviewed each teacher three times during each year, twice as part of the classroom observations. In the interviews, I asked teachers to discuss their backgrounds, their teaching goals, and the influences on their teaching, and to reflect on the lessons I observed. During these interviews, teachers also selected and discussed assignments they believed they had learned the most from, those their students had learned the most from, and those they believed were intellectually challenging for their students. For each assignment, the teachers selected and discussed student work samples they believed were “typical” and “exemplary.” My observation and interview strategies drew upon previous teacher learning studies (Kennedy, Ball, &amp; McDiarmid, 1993) and research on authentic intellectual work in social studies classrooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022487111426294">Newmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022487111426294">Social Studies Inquiry Research Collaborative, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>To understand more about the learning opportunities in each pathway, I investigated the programs retrospectively. During the summer immediately following Timothy and Brian’s graduation, I administered surveys to all 16 teacher educators who taught the required sequence of teacher education courses that the graduating teachers were enrolled in and interviewed 14 of these teacher educators to gain further insight into the teachers’ opportunities to learn in these distinctive pathways. The teacher educator survey—which mirrored many questions on the graduating teacher survey and was informed by other teacher learning studies (e.g., Kennedy et al., 1993; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022487111426294">McDonald, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022487111426294">Teacher Policy Research, 2005</xref>)—included questions about teacher educators’ educational and teaching backgrounds as well as Likert-type scale questions about learning opportunities in each program, such as “How much opportunity do(es) your teacher education course(s) provide for teachers to learn about methods for teaching social studies?” In the interviews, teacher educators elaborated on their survey responses and described the goals, practices, and learning opportunities in each of their courses in the two pathways, answering questions such as, “Can you give me an example of a typical class session in your teacher education course? What would you be doing? What would the students be doing?” I collected the teacher educators’ course syllabi, examples of assignments and class handouts, accreditation reports, and program literature to further understand the goals and practices of each pathway. As noted earlier, the graduating teacher survey provided additional insight into program learning opportunities from the teachers’ perspectives.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0022487111426294">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Three graduate research assistants assisted me with compiling the survey data by synthesizing narrative responses and calculating means and frequencies to provide one window into each program’s learning opportunities. Following observations of Timothy and Brian, I wrote summaries of each lesson, noting the major activities and the time spent on each, and then wrote analytical memos to record patterns, initial hypotheses, and comparisons between each teacher’s learning and practice. In addition, I analyzed the classroom lessons, student assignments, and student work samples for their intellectual quality using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022487111426294">Newmann et al.’s (2007)</xref> standards for authentic instruction: I scored each lesson according to the extent to which it elicited higher order thinking, developed deep knowledge, encouraged substantive conversation or elaborated writing, and connected classroom learning to the real world (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022487111426294">Table 1</xref>). I then created data displays comparing teachers’ observation lesson summaries and scorings side by side to note patterns in the teachers’ instruction across time.</p>

<p>All interviews were transcribed, and I read through transcripts, documents, and classroom observation notes. To categorize and find themes in the data, I coded documents using codes developed from the theoretical perspective and research questions that guide the research, such as “times and places” that teachers learn, the “vision or purpose” that guides their teaching, the “practices” they have learned and implement, and the “types of thinking” they elicit from students (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022487111426294">Table 2</xref>).

<title>Differing Program Opportunities</title>
<p>To frame Timothy and Brian’s learning, I now offer a brief description of the differing opportunities to learn in each of their programs. In the middle school program, Brian and his fellow graduates had extensive opportunities to learn about characteristics and capabilities of young adolescents and to practice teaching and planning lessons for students in the middle grades but far less opportunity to learn about teaching social studies (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022487111426294">Table 3</xref>). The program’s core courses— “Educating Young Adolescents,” “The Middle School Curriculum,” and “Teaching in the Middle School”—as their names suggest, focus on teaching and learning at the middle school level.</p>

<p>These generalist courses used the National Middle School Association’s (NMSA) standards as a guiding framework (the program also used NMSA standards for accreditation). Building from these standards, the coursework emphasized teachers who engage their students, get to know young adolescents and meet their needs, become lifelong learners and reflective practitioners, and plan instruction using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022487111426294">Tomlinson and McTighe’s (2006)</xref> framework of backward design and differentiation. Course themes included “understanding the middle school learner and the middle school concept,” “planning best practices and strategies to optimize student learning in middle schools,” “creating and managing a positive and productive classroom environment,” and “developing relationships.” These themes were addressed through class activities such as small group book discussions, activities and discussion focused on course readings, and explicit modeling and discussion of the teacher educator’s practice. Assignments included a case study of an adolescent, a classroom environment and management beliefs paper, reaction papers to selected books, and lesson and unit plans. Teachers in the middle school program used a lesson plan format focused on understanding by design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022487111426294">Tomlinson &amp; McTighe, 2006</xref>) that included a hook, activity, transition, assessment, closure, and strategies for classroom management.</p>
<p>The one required social studies methods course in the middle school sequence was administered through the secondary social studies program and focused on practical social studies teaching strategies and the National Council for the Social Studies’ (NCSS) 10 themes. The course did not have a clear or consistent conceptual orientation, though placed some emphasis on “what works” and factual knowledge for teaching. Class sessions involved PowerPoint lectures and lesson demonstrations (e.g., creating graphic organizers, conducting historical inquiries, and creating replicas of historical pottery), and core assignments included NCSS theme-related student presentations and true/false, multiple choice, short answer NCSS theme-related quizzes, and a final exam.</p>
<p>In the secondary social studies program, by contrast, as <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022487111426294">Table 3</xref> illustrates, Timothy and his fellow graduates had many opportunities to learn about goals of teaching social studies and practice teaching social studies but very little opportunity to learn about young adolescents or teaching at the middle level: The five core courses in the secondary program focus exclusively on the teaching of social studies. This program used the NCSS teacher education standards to guide accreditation, and all the courses shared “core themes,” which include developing social studies teaching practice guided by clear goals; reflective teaching, marked by teachers asking important questions about their teaching practice; and a definition of good teaching, which is “teaching that leads to active student engagement in worthwhile learning.” The lesson plan preobservation form used across multiple semesters asked preservice teachers to include a context for their lesson, student learning objectives, an explanation of why the lesson is worthwhile and how it connects to students’ lives, activities they will use to address their goals, where and how they will see students actively engaged in learning, and assessments of students’ learning. Courses focused on organizing themes such as “purpose,” “knowledge,” “content,” and “teaching the disciplines” with an eye toward helping preservice teachers learn about the socially constructed and political nature of knowledge and building lessons oriented toward a view of democratic society. Class instruction often centered around discussions of course readings and formats such as fishbowls or “chalk talks,” whereas assignments across the course sequence include reading reaction papers, a social studies rationale, and lesson and unit plans.</p>
<p>The one secondary course that focused explicitly on social studies teaching methods emphasized practical teaching strategies in relation to different purposes for teaching social studies. This course had a clear conceptual focus that emphasized the program’s core themes, the instructor’s critical perspective, the idea of teachers as thoughtful decision makers, and the principles of <italic>Understanding by Design</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022487111426294">Wiggins &amp; McTighe, 1998</xref>). During class sessions, the instructor conducted lesson demonstrations (e.g., Socratic seminars, concept formation lessons, simulations, and structured academic controversies), debriefed these lessons, and facilitated discussions of the course readings. Course assignments included writing five lesson plans, reflective papers, and a rationale for teaching social studies.</p>
<p>Thus, both programs shared emphases on student engagement in learning, reflective practice and lifelong learning, and planning instruction using backward design. Notable differences in the programs included the middle school program’s emphasis on understanding and developing relationships with young adolescent learners and the secondary program’s emphasis on developing a clear purpose for social studies teaching and practices that matched those purposes. Meanwhile, the middle school program had very little focus on purposes for teaching social studies, whereas the secondary program had very little focus on understanding or developing relationships with students—particularly young adolescents.</p>

<title>Curricular and School Contexts</title>
<sec id="section9-0022487111426294">
<title>State Curriculum</title>
<p>The newly implemented, state-mandated, seventh-grade social studies curriculum that Timothy and Brian teach surveys geography, government, history, and economics in Africa, the Middle East, and Southern and Eastern Asia. Students take an end-of-year test based on the performance standards, though the social studies test is not linked to passing the course or promotion, as it is in reading and math. Although the revised curriculum aims for meaningful student learning, the standards are in flux: After 76% of seventh-grade students failed the test linked to the standards in 2007-2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022487111426294">Torres, 2010</xref>), the standards were again revised in mid-August 2008—2 weeks into Brian’s first school year.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0022487111426294">
<title>Timothy’s School and Community</title>
<p>Timothy teaches both seventh-grade social studies and science (based on passing a test) at a smaller (738 students), Title 1 middle school in a politically conservative community. With 54% of students economically disadvantaged, 61% White, 22% African American, 8% Latino, and 5% Asian, the school is considered ethnically, culturally, and economically diverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022487111426294">[State] Department of Education, 2008</xref>). Public housing lines the blocks adjacent to the school; according to Timothy, economic disparities among students are evident.</p>
<p>The older school building houses a welcoming staff with many new teachers, a supportive administration, and a collaborative atmosphere. Timothy frequently exchanges teaching ideas with a neighboring teacher. During the two years I observed Timothy’s teaching, the school provided teachers with professional development in the use of thinking maps—different types of graphic organizers—and strongly emphasized their use. Classrooms display these thinking maps prominently, and the carpeted school hallways are lined with student work.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0022487111426294">
<title>Brian’s School and Community</title>
<p>Brian’s middle school is in a bordering county to Timothy’s and is considerably larger, with 1,058 students in 2008—although Brian notes that they are “projecting huge growth.” The school is somewhat less diverse than Timothy’s, with 38% of students classified as economically disadvantaged, 74% White, 20% African American, 3% Latino, and 1% Asian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022487111426294">[State] Department of Education, 2008</xref>), but these demographics are changing. By summer 2010, the school will be officially designated a Title 1 school. Although the community borders a major metropolitan area, Brian notes that “it’s pretty rural, especially in its ideals. Still very much steeped in Southern Baptist values, and the large part of the community does center around church.” Like Timothy’s county, Brian’s school community is politically conservative.</p>
<p>Brian’s school is new and modern, and student work lines the hallways. Like Timothy, Brian finds the school to be very supportive with a “really friendly atmosphere”; he works closely with other teachers to plan and share lessons and finds his administration very supportive. His school is considered a Learning-Focused School, one that subscribes to practices, including the use of essential questions, graphic organizers, previewing learning, activating thinking, and previewing vocabulary—instructional strategies that align nicely with those Brian learned in his teacher education program.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section12-0022487111426294">
<title>Timothy</title>
<p>Timothy is representative of many of the teachers in the secondary cohort from which he graduated: He is a White, middle-class male, who was 22 years old upon graduation from his teacher education program. He is married and describes his classroom demeanor as very much like that of his father, who is also an educator. Timothy characterizes this demeanor:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>It’s direct. It’s to the point. It’s—while not the most cuddly and fuzzy guy in the world—certainly a guy where you know where you stand, and you know that he’s going to do whatever he can for you if you’re willing to do the same for him.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>His manner, which he says others might characterize as “distant and unfeeling,” illustrates the priority he places on students’ learning but not their lives outside of school. He notes,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>I respect that their personal lives have a bearing on what they bring to my classroom. However, I do not care what those things are. I care about their education and their intellectual abilities and improving those. I don’t care what they did over the weekend. I don’t want them to know what I did over the weekend. They asked me the other day, “Why don’t we see any pictures of your wife?” Because it’s none of your business . . . That’s my personal life.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Timothy traces his interest in becoming a teacher to his parents’ inspiration, because they both have been career educators. Drawing on their example, he hopes to “tap into abilities that the kids don’t even understand they have yet” through social studies—his favorite subject. As he explains, he is “a social studies guy through and through” and enjoys the interpretive nature of history. In particular, he loves European history and its people—Napoleon, King Louis the Fourteenth, and Henry the Eighth—and he recalls with enthusiasm learning about medieval monks and reading the <italic>Iliad</italic> in high school and college. He considers himself “an intellectual at heart” and notes that his “favorite historical character of all time” is Caesar.</p>
<p>As a teacher, Timothy is highly motivated, resourceful, and thoughtful about his practice. He reads professional journals, such as NCSS’ practitioner publication <italic>Social Education</italic>, and attends both the state social studies conference and NCSS’ annual conference. He actively seeks out new resources and teaching ideas and persuaded his grade-level language arts chair to order a class set of <italic>The Breadwinner</italic>, after reading in <italic>Social Education</italic> that this book could help him teach students about life in Afghanistan. In reflecting on his teaching, Timothy is thoughtful and self-aware; he recognizes many of his strengths and limitations as a teacher, often acknowledging things he might have done differently to help students learn better.</p>
<p>Timothy approaches his work as a seventh-grade social studies teacher with diligence and commitment, although this is not his ideal job. Like the majority of his graduating cohort, he would prefer to teach at the high school level, noting that he feels he “can interact better with [10th, 11th, and 12th grade] students . . . students that are more advanced with their maturity level as well as their learning capabilities.” In his first year, Timothy also expresses cynicism about the state standards he is required to teach, but observes that he needs to address these to keep his job.</p>
<sec id="section13-0022487111426294">
<title>Guiding Purposes and Vision</title>
<p>In his social studies teaching, Timothy wants to help his students become “functional, productive citizens of a democratic society.” He wants to push his students, help them analyze information and develop informed opinions. Furthermore, he hopes to help his students take on unfamiliar and uncomfortable perspectives, develop empathy and an understanding of the commonalities of people across religions and cultures, and develop research and decision-making skills. Timothy also places high value on challenging, substantive work and the struggle of learning something. He recalls, for example, a high school history teacher in whose class there was “too much cool stuff . . . it was too easy.” In his mind, struggle and frustration in learning lead to a feeling of accomplishment.</p>
<p>Over the course of the two years I spoke with him, Timothy noted that his vision of practice was influenced most strongly by his teacher education program. As he puts it, “I’m a company man.” He places great value on some key principles that his program emphasized: backward design, performance assessment, collaborative and group work, incorporating movement and kinesthetics, and teaching skills and big ideas. His vision of students as workers and helping students engage in higher order thinking with the teacher as facilitator are central ideas he drew from his preparation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0022487111426294">
<title>Timothy’s Practice</title>
<p>Drawing on these goals, Timothy’s regular instruction with his seventh graders emphasizes group work, research skills, and writing. In the fall of his second year, for example, students work in small groups over three days to create posters illustrating key facets of the Israeli, Iranian, or Saudi Arabian governments. Some students go to the school library to research the current leader and role of religion in the country’s government while other students write the country’s name, its geographic outline, and its flag on the poster. After groups present their posters to the class, each student is required to write a culminating essay comparing the countries’ governments.</p>
<p>Through teaching like this, Timothy implements many creative, thoughtful practices, many of which are designed to elicit higher order thinking. His students learn about life in Afghanistan through literature circles with the historical fiction book <italic>Breadwinner</italic>; compare Islam, Judaism, and Christianity by creating religion brochures; and research environmental issues in the Middle East and write proposals to the United Nations recommending how to address these issues. Through lessons such as these, he wants to challenge his students and strives to have them write something substantial. In keeping with the value he places on the student as worker and performance assessments, his goal is to have students produce something rather than recite something. For example, in his first year of teaching, he has students research, record, and analyze standard of living data from 10 African countries; they then write a one-page argument for which country has the highest and lowest standard of living, drawing on the data and explaining their reasoning.</p>
<p>Although Timothy provides many challenging and engaging assignments for his students, his implementation of the assignments does not always allow his seventh graders to accomplish the demanding work he envisions. In some cases, students do not understand their task and need further support, modeling, or scaffolding. He tells students, for example, to study for an upcoming test over the weekend but provides no guidance on how to study—or tells them to take notes on a lecture explaining, “don’t write down every single word: just write the gist,” without offering assistance in determining “the gist.” He frequently expects students to figure things out independently and expresses frustration with students’ questions about assignments.</p>
<p>In other cases, he does not give students all the experiences and understandings they may need to complete their task successfully. In the government project described earlier, some students colored a country’s outline whereas others researched the role of religion in a country’s government. Such differential learning opportunities prepared students unequally to accomplish the challenging essay-writing task that Timothy required of all of them:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>Compare the parliamentary democracy of [Israel], the monarchy of [Saudi Arabia], and the theocracy of [Iran], distinguishing the form of leadership and the role of the citizen in terms of voting rights and personal freedoms.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>His explanation of this assignment suggests his less developed understanding of differentiating instruction and scaffolding student learning. He comments,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>. . . the thing I liked about the government project so much is that there’s a place for everybody in it . . . somebody needed to do the research in the library . . . somebody’s got to be good at that. If you’re not good at researching information, well, you can be the person that makes the nice color or something . . . but . . . the end result will still be challenging because we’re scaffolding up to that higher order of thinking . . .</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Although Timothy works hard to help his seventh graders learn, over the course of his first two years of teaching, he increasingly pulls back from the student-centered vision of intellectually challenging teaching he learned in his teacher education program, noting that his students’ age and maturity limit what he can accomplish. For example, in the spring of his second year, Timothy teaches a series of lessons on South African apartheid and Nelson Mandela. Although he begins the lesson sequence by engaging students in a brief simulation of apartheid and having students read one of Mandela’s speeches following a think-pair-share approach, the subsequent two lessons involve Timothy giving a PowerPoint lecture and showing two videos while students take notes. Students apply their learning by writing bio(graphy) poems about Nelson Mandela and F. W. de Klerk using a format that prompts students to fill in factual information about each person.</p>
<p>Reflecting on his practice at the end of his second year, Timothy believes that he teaches the way his program advocated to a certain extent but would do this more if he taught at the high school level because of students’ maturity. Considering his lessons on apartheid and Mandela, Timothy noted that his use of a simulation was atypical because “I have trouble trusting the group of kids I have to be out of their seats and take their business seriously.” He further acknowledged that his “sit and get” lecture and video approach were not very challenging for students but observed that he has “upped the percentage of teacher-directed activities,” which he believes has improved his students’ grades.</p>
<p>Furthermore, considering particular methods he learned in his preparation, he explained that he doesn’t use Socratic seminars, any full class discussion, or structured academic controversy, because it “doesn’t work” with seventh graders. Timothy suggests that his lack of success in using these methods relates both to students’ immaturity and the secondary program’s lack of emphasis on teaching young adolescents. At the end of his first year, he explains,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>I’ve got some super fantastic ideas for lessons and things like that and ways to structure them that are more engaging to the students. But where I am seriously lacking and still struggling . . . is an understanding and a grasp of how to get the most out of a group of seventh graders . . . a lot more of the focus in the classes that I was in seemed to be geared towards the high school student.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>As a result, his learning about teaching seventh graders has been “via trial and error.” He says, “I feel lied to. [The teacher educators] are like, ‘oh yeah, this will work for middle schoolers, no problem.’ This couldn’t work.” His secondary program focused on content, but “there wasn’t enough discussion of how I control behavior at [different grade levels].”</p>
<p>These omissions in his teacher preparation parallel Timothy’s growing frustration with his students, evidenced by comments like, “they weren’t thinking,” “they weren’t paying attention,” or “they didn’t care to get the correct topic for the essay.” Although Timothy initially expresses appreciation for how middle school students are underestimated intellectually, by the end of his second year, his preference for teaching high school remains strong. When I asked, “Do you like teaching middle school?” he responded as follows:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>I like the content that I teach. I wish I taught it to people who could actually benefit from it a great deal . . . why wouldn’t you teach the modern world to people who are about to be in the world? . . .if they were 16, 17, 18, a lot of this makes a lot more sense, and a lot of it engages them a lot more, and they become more interested in the topic . . . as for the kids I teach, I’m not a huge fan. They’re very annoying. Very, very annoying . . .</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>By the end of his second year of teaching, Timothy does not appear to enjoy his students, and, consistent with his desire to focus only on students’ intellectual development, he appears detached from the young people in his classroom.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0022487111426294">
<title>Brian</title>
<p>Brian is a White, middle-class male who was 22 years old upon graduation from the middle school teacher education program. Timothy was like half of his graduating cohort in being male (52%, <italic>n</italic> = 27), whereas Brian was in the minority as one of the 23% (<italic>n</italic> = 22) of males in his graduating cohort who earned certification to teach social studies (Brian also earned certification to teach language arts in Grades 4 to 8). Brian is an energetic teacher who speaks quickly, often inserting jokes with a dry sense of humor. He describes himself as sarcastic, sometimes serious, not always patient, and as someone who likes to have fun. He explains that he likes practice much more than theory: “I like getting my hands dirty . . . diving in and actually taking care of business.”</p>
<p>Brian traces his teaching interests to a fifth-grade social studies teacher who illustrated the teacher he did <italic>not</italic> want to be:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>He was probably one of the worst teachers I ever had. And I said that I could do better . . . I decided in fifth grade . . . that I was going to go on and be the teacher that I knew I was supposed to see in the classroom.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In high school, Brian became an active participant in his state’s Future Educators program. He went on to a state college where he began the secondary education program, but after observing in middle grades classrooms, he decided to change to middle school education—the program he pursued upon transferring to Southeastern University. Brian enjoys the unpredictability and challenge of teaching at the middle level: “The kids are smarter than anybody thinks they are. They are also more mature than anybody really lets on . . . all the stereotypes are broken in middle school.” He finds high schoolers annoying and believes that teaching at the middle level presents a genuine opportunity to make a difference in students’ lives.</p>
<p>Like Timothy, Brian’s favorite subject areas are the social sciences, though it is the sociology rather than the history that Brian enjoys the most. Brian explains that</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>I’ve always enjoyed the aspect of social interaction and social psychology more than the history . . . Although that interests me . . . I really enjoy looking at how societies function. Why people do things the way they do.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Brian associates history learning with memorization—a practice he strongly dislikes—and notes that he has a terrible memory:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>You learn dates. You learn names. You learn battles, cities, capitals, and powers that came and fell. You forget them. You watch them on the History Channel a couple times, get extra credit for mentioning it to the teacher, and you forget them.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In his own education, courses that focused on social theories provided more opportunities for the conceptual learning he values. Unlike Timothy, then, Brian is teaching both the grade level and subject he wanted.</p>
<p>Like Timothy, Brian is thoughtful and reflective about his teaching practice and is constantly hoping to improve. Brian considers himself always a student and enjoys opportunities to learn about himself and his teaching. One of the central sources for improving his practice is professional development opportunities through his school and district—opportunities he appreciated in his first year of teaching but have disappeared in his second year because of budget cuts, causing him to worry “about opportunity to learn.” To continue his growth, he enrolled in the master’s degree program in middle school education at Southeastern University in his third year of teaching—after completing his participation in this study.</p>
<p>Finally, Brian speaks frequently of his frustration for the low pay and lack of respect for teachers, as well as his frustration with the state standards and the external demands continually placed on him as a teacher. In his first year, he expresses concern that the newly modified social studies standards have not been clearly explained or implemented—and by the end of his second year, he continues to be worried about the lack of correlation between the standards and the standardized tests. He also finds it challenging to keep up with school and district expectations, such as requirements to post rubrics and student work samples for every class assignment.</p>
<sec id="section16-0022487111426294">
<title>Guiding Purposes and Vision</title>
<p>In his classroom, Brian hopes students will develop global and cultural awareness, and in doing so, dispel myths surrounding particular religions or cultures. He wants his seventh graders to understand the diversity of the world and universal truths within that diversity, such as the commonalities among the three main monotheistic religions. Through his teaching, he hopes to expand students’ knowledge of other cultures and their own social morality and help students see social studies’ relevance to their lives.</p>
<p>Like Timothy, Brian believes his teacher education program had a strong influence on his vision of teaching practice. As he says, “Everything that I know about teaching comes from the education program.” He strives for a classroom that reflects the central ideas he learned: hands-on group activities, a democratic classroom that provides student choice, and dynamic lessons that call for analytical thinking. Brian also works toward breaking lessons into the parts that his program and the Learning-Focused School model emphasize: a “warm-up,” “workout,” and “cool-down” to enable students to activate prior knowledge and become engaged, develop and extend their learning, and then summarize. He wants students to understand “the big picture” and see connections between larger concepts. His preparation also helped him envision a well-planned classroom with many organizational structures, discipline tools, curriculum tools, and differentiation to facilitate student learning. Although he acknowledges that he is still working toward implementing his vision, he feels well prepared for teaching.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0022487111426294">
<title>Brian’s Practice</title>
<p>Brian’s regular instruction features vocabulary building, graphic organizers, and partner work. For example, in the fall of his second year, Brian leads his seventh graders through a series of lessons on events that shaped the modern Middle East. They create K–W–L charts to preview their learning, complete graphic organizers to learn relevant vocabulary terms, and work with partners to answer questions after watching a video on the Ottoman Empire. In a subsequent lesson, students write responses to the week’s essential question using a “think-pair-share” approach, after which they focus on new vocabulary using graphic organizers, first with partners and then as a whole class.</p>
<p>Across both the years, graphic organizers, visually rich PowerPoints, and vocabulary building are mainstays in his classroom, and Brian helps his students stay organized and learn important skills. He has students keep their class notes and handouts in order using a notebook system, and he periodically does notebook checks. Similarly, he helps them study for an upcoming test by requiring them to create flashcards for homework.</p>
<p>Although these lesson features are prominent during both the years, in his first year, Brian’s lessons are frequently teacher centered, are factually oriented, and have little intellectual challenge. In his first year, he frequently uses interactive PowerPoint lectures to communicate his social studies content or has students complete graphic organizers as they read individually from the textbook. Because he is just trying to “keep his head above water,” he gives students worksheets and assigns textbook reading but doesn’t want to be teaching that way. At the end of this year, he is not satisfied with these lessons, believing he has only taught about 25% or less the way he wants.</p>
<p>Brian’s reliance on traditional forms of social studies instruction may be related to his view that the weakest part of his preparation was learning about teaching this subject. He found that his social studies methods course, taught by a novice teacher educator, did not facilitate his learning. Perhaps as a result, Brian sometimes found himself at a loss for specific social studies teaching ideas that might help his students learn particular content. For example, in the spring of his 1st year, he strived to break his lessons into several parts as he had learned from his program, but notes,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>I’m just not at the point yet that I can do that. Not with the time allotted to me or the knowledge that I have about different kinds of activities, because I sit here sometimes and just get stumped on a way to teach something as simple as unitary [form of government].</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>By his second year, Brian incorporates more group and partner work and more student research into his practice, in an effort to help students think at higher levels of Bloom’s taxonomy. He also hopes to get his students to do more writing. In November 2009, for example, students spend two class periods working in jigsaw groups, first researching a Southeast Asian religion and completing a graphic organizer, then sharing the information with other groups. In March 2010, Brian’s students conduct a “label search” to determine the countries in which their clothing was made, record these locations on dry-erase world maps, and then work in groups to answer questions such as the following on a handout:</p>
<list id="list1-0022487111426294" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Analyze your list carefully. What are some specific reasons why these countries specialize in the production of these clothes or other items?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>When you or someone else buys the clothing or items produced in a foreign country, who benefits? Explain your answer.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Assignments like these push students to do more critical thinking, require all students to engage in equivalent intellectual work, and reflect Brian’s understanding of young adolescents and their capabilities—an emphasis of his program that he values. As he explains, the most influential courses in his thinking about teaching were the core middle school education courses, noting that “all the [social studies education courses] in the world couldn’t prepare me to react to middle schoolers.” The teacher educators in the middle school program helped him anticipate what to expect with young adolescents and shaped how he views them:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>[One teacher educator] was just so insightful and just opened my eyes . . . if I didn’t go to [Southeastern] . . . I would think, “God, these are a bunch of hoodlums. They’re crazy, worthless kids that just can’t get it right.” . . . I know now that some of them can be taken from that state and elevated. Or some of them want you to think they are and are really the smartest kids you’ll ever talk to . . . and I wouldn’t know that kind of stuff unless I talked to [that teacher educator] or had the experience at [Southeastern].</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Because of this emphasis on young adolescent learners, Brian has developed a greater appreciation for and understanding of how to work with students at this age. He sees young adolescents as smarter and more mature than people think. He has also learned that they are always unexpected and notes that they may need instructions repeated five times, and won’t pay attention, “but then will ask a question that blows your mind.” Drawing from his program learning, he references the importance of building a classroom environment that is safe and open for all students, and in which students have opportunities to interact with their peers—an understanding that mirrors his increasing use of partner and group work. His teacher education program also taught him to scaffold tasks: for example, young adolescents will not be skilled at engaging in discussions unless they have a lot of practice. Like Timothy, Brian does get frustrated with his students, and finds that they often test his patience, yet, he views them more empathetically. He explains,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>I have to really remind myself sometimes that they are feeling things for the first time, experiencing things for the first time that they don’t know how to deal with, and their actions are going to be erratic because of that.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>He adds, “I have to sometimes understand that when a kid asks a question it’s not because they are trying to be funny . . . it’s because they honestly don’t know, and you should respect that.” In his interactions with students, he is generally playful and warm, frequently joking with and smiling at them.</p>
<p>Brian’s practice, then, shifts in the opposite direction of Timothy’s, starting with lessons with little intellectual challenge, and gradually moving toward more challenging lessons over the course of the two years. In addition, unlike Timothy, Brian seems to enjoy his young adolescent students. At the same time, Brian’s heavy emphasis on vocabulary building and scaffolding through graphic organizers sometimes leaves little time for students to engage in deeper learning with more substantive, written elaboration.</p>
<p>By the end of his second year, Brian still feels that, on a scale of 1 to 10, he is only implementing the vision of practice he learned from his program at a 5 or 6. He attributes his limitations in enacting the kind of teaching he envisions to the demands of the state standards, his school district, and public schooling in general, along with a less robust repertoire of social studies teaching strategies. He is often overwhelmed by the time, planning, and organization required to create the kinds of lessons he envisions and often finds it difficult to come up with interactive social studies lessons. In reflecting on the “label search” lesson described above, he explains,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>This lesson was more interactive . . . used different props. That’s the first time I’ve broken out those desk maps all year and allowed them to use those resources . . . I’m always looking for resources like that, but often fail to have time to find them and use them.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This lesson idea came from a state economic education conference he attended.</p>
<p>Brian is also less confident than Timothy in his use of the social studies standards and seems to have a less developed understanding of the interpretive nature of history. In his second year, although he is more comfortable with the social studies content he is assigned to teach, his discussion of the newly revised state standards suggests that he maintains a general view of social studies as a fixed body of facts to be learned. He explains,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>[I’m] still shady—as are most people I think—on this new idea of focus on enduring understandings . . . it’s still a bit controversial because for so long social studies has been all about facts, and history, and timelines, and dates. And to shift the focus so entirely on things like location and governance and these big ideas that are universal is quite a change.</p></disp-quote>

<title>Discussion and Implications</title>
<p>What, then, do these data illustrate about what Timothy and Brian learned from their differential preparations about intellectually demanding social studies teaching at the middle level and how their preparations influenced their classroom practices? These data suggest that both teachers’ learning and practice are reflective in many ways of the respective conceptual and practical emphases in their programs. Both Timothy and Brian appeared to take up the ideas of student-centered, hands-on, varied instruction that parallel both programs’ emphases on student engagement. Similarly, the programs’ focus on backward instructional design was a framework Timothy explicitly referenced, and was evident in both teachers’ practice as they worked to carefully plan and sequence lessons with a range of activities leading to specific learning goals. In addition, Timothy and Brian took their messages of reflective practice and ongoing, professional learning seriously: Both teachers took advantage of professional development opportunities and took initiative to find resources or learning opportunities to continually improve their practice.</p>
<p>At the same time, Timothy demonstrated a complex understanding of the nature of social studies knowledge and historical interpretation, a relatively robust repertoire of social studies teaching strategies, and a comfort with the state standards that were consistent with the secondary program’s emphasis on the purposes and practices of teaching social studies. Brian, meanwhile, possessed a strong, sympathetic understanding of young adolescents and knowledge of organizational structures that facilitate their learning—both of which were sets of understandings emphasized in the middle school program.</p>
<p>Although these program markers showed up in Timothy and Brian’s talk and much of their practice, the limitations in each preparation were also evident, resulting in diluted versions of the practice that both teachers envisioned. Consistent with the secondary program’s absence of attention to learning about teaching young adolescents, Timothy neither developed a conceptual orientation nor practical strategies related to understanding young adolescents or developing relationships with them to counter his preexisting ideas. Without learning about social studies teaching strategies and purposes in relation to particular students, Timothy constructed his own solutions—which led him toward teacher-centered, less intellectually challenging practice that gradually grew farther away from the strategies and vision he learned in his program, findings that echo previous research on secondary teachers working with young adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022487111426294">Conklin, 2008</xref>). Meanwhile, Brian’s less developed understandings of social studies teaching purposes and strategies mirrored the middle school program’s weaker emphasis on social studies teaching. Without these understandings, his strong ideas about young adolescents and well-organized classrooms left him frustrated with the state standards and implementing the teacher-centered, fact-oriented instruction he saw in his own schooling, although he slowly began to move toward the more student-centered, challenging instruction he envisioned.</p>
<p>These findings suggest, on one hand, that teacher education programs need to provide preservice teachers with opportunities to learn the full range of understandings that teachers require for the subject and grade levels they are earning certification to teach. Timothy’s case illustrates that a program’s emphasis on a partial set of understandings can lead to important learning as well as unintended consequences—in this case, Timothy’s pared down instruction. Thus, the secondary program must provide deliberate opportunities for teachers to learn about social studies instructional practices and purposes in relation to the range of students they are preparing to teach.</p>
<p>Yet, Brian’s case illustrates that the mere presence of coursework addressing different components of teacher learning alone is insufficient. Brian took the required middle school social studies methods course as well as an optional course in teaching geography; yet, these courses appeared to lack significant impact on Brian’s understanding of social studies teaching strategies. In fact, data from this study suggest that the middle school social studies methods course lacked coherence and a core conceptual framework, and the course instructional practices did not always mirror the course messages or model best practices, offering a possible explanation for why this course was a weak intervention. The structural alignment of this course in relation to the rest of the program may have further weakened its potential impact on Brian’s learning. Because the subject-specific methods courses were administered by subject-area programs, the middle school program had little control over those courses, thereby limiting their coherence with the rest of the program.</p>
<p>These findings suggest that teacher educators preparing middle grades social studies teachers need to look not only at teachers’ opportunities to learn about young adolescents, social studies teaching purposes, and social studies teaching strategies but also at the implementation and integration of these learning opportunities. The inconsistent curricular messages and instructional practices of the middle school social studies methods course highlight the importance of the instruction that goes on within courses and the ways in which teacher educators are prepared (or not) for their roles. Teacher educators need to have clearly developed understandings of teacher learning frameworks and teacher education pedagogical practices so that they can facilitate preservice teachers’ learning successfully.</p>
<p>Along with attention to teacher educators’ instructional practices, this case suggests that teacher educators may also need to focus on how the components of middle grades social studies teaching practice are addressed in relation to each other, to prepare novice teachers to integrate these components in their own practice. Novices may need to first learn the “anatomy” of practice so that they can distinguish and practice the components of teaching before integrating them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022487111426294">Grossman, Compton, et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, teacher education programs should consider where and how preservice teachers will have opportunities to learn about young adolescents and social studies teaching purposes and practices. Yet, enacting complex practice may also necessitate teacher education that focuses on core practices and helps novices draw upon these components of teaching in relation to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022487111426294">Ball &amp; Forzani, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022487111426294">Grossman, Hammerness, et al., 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022487111426294">Grossman, Hammerness, et al. (2009)</xref> explain that “leading a classroom discussion necessarily draws on a range of more discrete practices, strategies, and instructional routines, while also drawing on knowledge of content, of group dynamics, status and equity, and of students’ development” (p. 281). In the case of the middle school program, teacher educators might rethink the subject-focused and student-focused compartmentalization of coursework and investigate possibilities for helping teachers integrate practice throughout the program across the contexts of subject matter and students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022487111426294">Feiman-Nemser, 2008</xref>). The secondary program might introduce understanding of students as a core element of teaching practice and weave this understanding throughout the subject-focused coursework so that teachers have opportunities to develop social studies teaching practices in relation to the students being taught.</p>
<p>Although Timothy and Brian’s cases suggest their programs’ influences, it is also important to consider these influences in relation to personal factors and program admissions. Timothy’s belief that teachers do not need to know about students’ lives and personae of not being “cuddly and fuzzy,” coupled with his desire to teach high school, surely shaped his practice with young adolescents and the learning he took from his teacher education program. Brian, meanwhile, drew heavily on his own K-12 teachers’ use of visuals, graphic organizers, and notebook systems to inform his practice, and he chose to teach young adolescents. Furthermore, each program’s admission criteria mirrored its respective emphases: The middle school program requires applicants to explain their experience with and interest in working with young adolescents, whereas the secondary program requires applicants to articulate a rationale for teaching social studies. Both Brian and Timothy, then, had beliefs that were consistent with their programs’ entry requirements and learning emphases, making it difficult to disentangle the extent to which each program shaped new learning or simply enrolled teachers who already shared the major program commitments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022487111426294">Kennedy, 1998</xref>). Although this study did track teachers into their teaching practice, this uncertainty about learning influences points to the importance of longitudinal studies that follow preservice teachers from their entry into teacher education programs, study actual teacher educator practices, and follow graduates into their initial years of teaching. Following teachers across these contexts might better assess whether a teacher like Timothy, for example, could change his views of teaching young adolescents with a more comprehensive, integrated set of understandings about middle school social studies teaching practice.</p>
<p>It is also important to note the limits of university-based teacher education and consider what teacher educators can be expected to accomplish. For example, preservice teachers gain most of their subject-matter knowledge from arts and sciences faculty in courses over which teacher educators typically have little or no control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022487111426294">McDiarmid, 1994</xref>). Similarly, teacher educators often have limited voice in selecting practice teaching placements, making it difficult to provide experiences that model the practices teacher educators hope preservice teachers will learn. Although teacher educators can sometimes lessen these tensions by forging partnerships across campus and with schools, such work is challenging, time intensive, and typically undervalued on university campuses. Thus, although teacher educators should work deliberately to address limitations in the preparations they provide, teacher educators—like teachers—are constrained by complex institutional barriers.</p>
<p>In sum, this comparative case suggests that these distinctive preparation programs helped shape important but incomplete understandings for Timothy and Brian, leading them to envision substantive teaching but fall short of this vision in practice in their middle school social studies classrooms. By illuminating the tensions in the preparation of middle school social studies teachers, this case study highlights the importance of teacher education programs examining their own goals and practices, studying what teachers take up from the program and implement in practice, and using these data to refine the opportunities they provide for future teachers to learn.</p>
