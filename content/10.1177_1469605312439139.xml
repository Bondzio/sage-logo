<abstract>
<p>Geographical information systems (GIS) have been a part of archaeological research practices for over two decades, yet many significant questions related to the technology remain unanswered. Long-standing ambiguities about GIS use in archaeology can be associated with a particular research atmosphere within the discipline, where a large number of practitioners consider theory-laden critical approaches to GIS optional, if not peripheral, to conducting spatial analysis. This article calls on archaeological GIS practitioners to carry existing GIS theory and critique to another level. It also argues that the critique of the epistemological implications of GIS use in archaeology has largely (and at times rather implicitly) been structured by representational thinking habits and that a move to non-representational thinking would provide novel considerations of the technology.</p>

<p>This article stems from the view that the implications of geographical information systems (GIS) for archaeology remain an unsettled issue despite the technology’s introduction to the discipline over 20 years ago. While the ubiquity of archaeological GIS applications since the early 1990s is an indicator of the technology’s widespread disciplinary acceptance (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1469605312439139">Conolly and Lake, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1469605312439139">McCoy and Ladefoged, 2009</xref>; Proceedings of the Annual CAA Conferences;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1469605312439139">1</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-1469605312439139">Wheatley and Gillings, 2002</xref>), few among its practitioners (i.e. those who have practised the technology and, hence, have acquired crucial practical knowledge of it) have explicitly acknowledged and been concerned about the theory-ladenness of GIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1469605312439139">Huggett, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1469605312439139">Llobera, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1469605312439139">Tschan et al., 2000</xref>; e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1469605312439139">Gaffney and Van Leusen, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1469605312439139">Gillings, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1469605312439139">Huggett, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1469605312439139">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1469605312439139">Llobera, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1469605312439139">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1469605312439139">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1469605312439139">Lock, 2003</xref>: 164–182, 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-1469605312439139">Wheatley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-1469605312439139">Wheatley and Gillings, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-1469605312439139">Witcher, 1999</xref>). When theoretically informed discussions on archaeological research practices have not overlooked the technology, they have presented it, in passing, as a scientific instrument (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1469605312439139">Johnson, 2010</xref>: 36; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1469605312439139">Jones, 2001</xref>: xiii). Similarly but more critically so, in counter-modernist, post-positivist research the technology has often been regarded as exclusively serving modernist aspirations and positivist research agendas, and adhering to cartographic, spatial-analytical and representationalist traditions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1469605312439139">Chadwick, 2004</xref>: 21; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1469605312439139">Cummings, 2008</xref>: 288; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1469605312439139">Thomas, 1993</xref>: 25, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1469605312439139">2001</xref>: 169, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1469605312439139">2004</xref>: 171, 198–201; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1469605312439139">Tilley, 2004</xref>: 218, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-1469605312439139">2008</xref>: 266).</p>
<p>Looking back at more than two decades of archaeological GIS history, it appears that as archaeologists we are struggling to find ways to appreciate the technology’s theory-ladenness and to destabilize the relationship between GIS and positivism. It could be argued that as long as we continue to (habitually) match GIS with scientism (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1469605312439139">Heidegger, 1977[1952]</xref> on the historical ties between modern technology, scientism and objectivity), we are either to perceive GIS-related practices in archaeology as atheoretical and having self-evident benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1469605312439139">Huggett, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1469605312439139">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1469605312439139">Lock, 2003</xref>: 11) or to dismiss them for the sake of post-positivist, counter-modernist research. Several questions about archaeological GIS arguably remain curiously and crucially unanswered in a day and age when we are all surrounded by digital technology, when we are all ‘cyborgs’ (after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1469605312439139">Haraway, 1991</xref>) of the twenty-first century and when scrutinizing the effects of digital technology is no longer optional but an endeavour to understand ourselves, the present of our historicity. Is the time up?</p>
<p>One of the objectives of this article is to advocate a theory-laden approach to GIS applications in archaeology. While the call acknowledges existing valuable work on the issue, it also aims to carry this critique to another level by promoting a critical engagement with the technology as a full-time research interest. The call draws inspiration from the rich and long history of GIS critique in geography. A brief overview of this history in the following section highlights how Critical GIS (CGIS) emerged as a research programme. The summary is meant to be thought-provoking and inspiring for archaeologists rather than being exhaustive and pointing to a ready-made path to be followed uncritically. It aims to provide some indication of the comprehensiveness and diversity of the GIS critique within geography and to guide the reader to references discussing CGIS in greater detail. Additionally, the summary is crucial in underlining the scholarly constructed nature of the strong and historically stable relationship between GIS and positivism. This is important because the strong rejection of GIS by phenomenological rhetoric in archaeology – as discussed in detail below – is, arguably, related to the technology’s conflation with positivist epistemology. Finally, the summary interestingly highlights how the technology was perceived as something of a Trojan horse in both disciplines, revoking positivist research practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1469605312439139">Lock and Harris, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1469605312439139">Sheppard, 2005</xref>: 6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-1469605312439139">Witcher, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Specializing in ‘archaeological GIS theory’ (or other digital technologies) has never been more timely and relevant. In fact, we find ourselves in a social sciences environment where we (or at least some of us) are increasingly convinced that knowledge created through scientific practices is not the result of a detached process where human subjects ‘crack the code of independent realities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1469605312439139">Haraway, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1469605312439139">Latour, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1469605312439139">1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1469605312439139">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1469605312439139">Law, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1469605312439139">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1469605312439139">Pickering, 1995</xref>). We are provided with a new vocabulary to discuss the agency of technology in the process of creating scientific knowledge in a trend led by theoreticians such as Bruno <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1469605312439139">Latour (1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1469605312439139">1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1469605312439139">2005</xref>) and Andrew <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1469605312439139">Pickering (1995)</xref>. From these non-representational perspectives, acquiring knowledge is seen as a process wherein human activity and passivity are mangled with other types of agencies (disciplinary, technological, etc.) and it is seen that there is much more to the world (and, hence, our research projects) than human intentions and conscious actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-1469605312439139">Wegner, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Drawing on these insights, this article’s second goal is to present non-representational thinking as a prospective avenue for theorizing about GIS (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-1469605312439139">Wickstead, 2009</xref>). The argument presented here is that the main concerns about the use of GIS in archaeology have revolved around GIS representations in a manner structured by representational habits of thinking. A move to non-representational thinking may afford novel and fruitful considerations of the technology’s position in archaeology. The ideas of phenomenological theoreticians Julian Thomas and Christopher Tilley provide a particular focus for the discussion, because their theory-laden criticisms on the technology have had considerable effects on GIS practitioners who take an active interest in theoretical developments in archaeology. As such, Tilley and Thomas’ criticisms have significantly shaped existing archaeological GIS theory. Bringing this particular set of GIS critique under close scrutiny also highlights that when the anti-scientism of phenomenology leads to a strong, totalizing and premature rejection of certain types of representations, we may find ourselves at a position close to representationalist and, hence, to modernist epistemological concerns. Such a position is not only at odds with the anti-representationalist and counter-modernist standpoints Thomas and Tilley aim to take but, more importantly, discussing archaeological GIS use in these terms brings us to epistemological dead-ends (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-1469605312439139">Webmoor, 2007</xref>: 570).</p>
<sec id="sec1-1469605312439139"><title>Critical GIS within geography</title>
<p>Nadine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1469605312439139">Schuurman (1999)</xref> coined the term CGIS against a disciplinary backdrop in which GIS-based research was causing a disjuncture within geography after a decade of intense discussions also referred to as the ‘GIS wars’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1469605312439139">Crampton, 2010</xref>: 99–101; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1469605312439139">Harvey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1469605312439139">Schuurman, 2000</xref>). Despite its initially vague status, CGIS is now a well-established field of human geography and GI Science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1469605312439139">Schuurman, 2009</xref>), a phenomenon evidenced in dedicated issues of lead journals (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1469605312439139">Harvey et al., 2005</xref>) and international conference sessions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-1469605312439139">Wilson et al., 2009</xref>). The research programme aims to build bridges between the opponents and proponents of GIS technology by conducting the GIS critique in a manner well informed by spatial-analytical methodologies, GIS software developments and the post-structuralist theoretical considerations of human geographers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1469605312439139">O’Sullivan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1469605312439139">Schuurman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1469605312439139">Sheppard, 2005</xref>). Drawing from a line of argument (now famously) put forward by Donna <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1469605312439139">Haraway (1991: chapter 8)</xref>, one of the foundational ideas in CGIS is that geographers cannot be excused for excluding GIS from geographic research and voicing criticisms about GIS from afar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1469605312439139">O’Sullivan, 2006</xref>: 783; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1469605312439139">Schuurman, 2000</xref>). Rather, they must actively engage with the technology, conduct GIS practices (or, at the least, acquire substantial knowledge about these practices) and theorize about the implications of the technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1469605312439139">Schuurman, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Following the implementation of GIS in 1964 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-1469605312439139">Tomlinson, 1966</xref>), it became increasingly popular in the 1970s and 1980s, and commentaries about its merits appeared in several lead geography journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1469605312439139">Schuurman, 2000</xref>). Throughout these two decades (especially in the 1970s), human geographers did not seriously challenge positivist assumptions that established spatial-analytical geography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1469605312439139">Pickles, 1995a</xref>: 18); rather, for the ‘technically minded’, GIS practices as part of positivist research were a comfortable retreat untouched by the ‘critical gaze’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1469605312439139">Goodchild, 2006</xref>: 687). The technology’s merits were continuously emphasized and the predominant idea was that if space was central to geographical research, so were spatial technologies such as GIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469605312439139">Dobson, 1983</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1469605312439139">Goodchild, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1469605312439139">Pickles, 1993</xref>, on Jerome Dobson’s ideas).</p>
<p>This scholarly atmosphere began to change in the 1980s due to the increase in GIS use in spatial-analytical geography that came at the same time as a post-structuralist/modernist ‘spatial turn’ (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1469605312439139">Hubbard et al., 2002</xref>). Spatial-analytical geography, which had been widely accepted in the 1960s and 1970s, was drastically challenged in this context and the centring of spatial patterns in geographic accounts was closely scrutinized by human geographers, who developed both strong critiques of the reductionist ontology of analytical spatialism as well as an interest in issues such as the social construction of space (hence the term ‘place’ in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-1469605312439139">Tuan, 1977</xref>), contingency and knowledge, ‘each of which in various ways problematised aspects of Cartesian science and ontology of spatial analysis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1469605312439139">Pickles, 1995a</xref>: 18; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1469605312439139">Hubbard et al., 2002</xref>). Within this particular and relatively tense atmosphere, spatial-analytical geographers welcomed GIS even more and its novelty (incorrectly) became a means to justify spatial-analytical methodologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1469605312439139">Leszczynski, 2009</xref>: 589). Ergo, a crucial and long-lasting link was forged between GIS and positivist methods that would eventually lead to conflating the technology with positivist epistemology in many disciplines using GIS, including archaeology. The significance of this historical link cannot be overstated. It still strongly affects our perceptions and practices of archaeological GIS today and comprises the ‘disciplinary agency’ (after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1469605312439139">Pickering, 1995</xref>: 115–116) which hampers our ability to stop prioritizing representations in the process of creating knowledge or criticizing GIS use in archaeology, as discussed in detail below.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the 1990s, GIS was increasingly considered by human geographers as a means to enact positivist projects, and the technology therefore found itself at the centre of a raging controversy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1469605312439139">Crampton, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1469605312439139">Schuurman, 2000</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1469605312439139">Pickles, 1995b</xref>). Human geographers felt threatened, seeing GIS as a Trojan horse that could overpower social-theoretical considerations in geography and circumscribe geography’s ability to make sense of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1469605312439139">Sheppard, 2005</xref>: 6–7). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1469605312439139">Taylor (1990: 211–212)</xref>, for instance, GIS was the ‘positivists’ revenge’, a ‘technocratic turn’ and ‘a return of the very worst sort of positivism, a most naïve empiricism’ (see also, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1469605312439139">Harley, 1989</xref>: 2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1469605312439139">Lake, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1469605312439139">Pickles, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1469605312439139">Taylor, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1469605312439139">Taylor and Johnston, 1995</xref>). The claims of the positivist nature of GIS would remain one of the main grounds for dismissing its role within geography in the early 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1469605312439139">Schuurman, 2000</xref>). Note, however, that in recent years, the theory-laden efforts of CGIS literature have increased the awareness of the complex relationship between technology and epistemology in general, and GIS and positivism in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1469605312439139">Leszczynski, 2009</xref>: 584).</p>
<p>Beyond the concerns about positivism, a substantial amount of GIS criticism within geography sophisticatedly scrutinized the technology’s impact on contemporary society in the mid 1990s (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1469605312439139">Pickles, 1995b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1469605312439139">Sheppard, 1995</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1469605312439139">Crampton, 2010</xref>: 99–101). Geographers in this context looked beyond ‘GIS as a research tool’ and traced its relationship to issues such as ideological dominance, erosion of privacy, inequality, war and militarism, environmental devastation, capitalism and gender bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1469605312439139">Sheppard, 2005</xref>). This was also an era when many geographers were willing to engage in a substantive dialogue that would acknowledge social-theoretical and GIS-related interests (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1469605312439139">Schuurman, 2000</xref>: 578–579, on ‘Friday Harbor’ meetings). It was out of this particular intellectual soil that CGIS emerged in the late 1990s with a variety of insights – including those grouped under participatory (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1469605312439139">Elwood, 2006</xref>), feminist (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1469605312439139">Kwan, 2002</xref>) and qualitative GIS (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1469605312439139">Kwan and Ding, 2008</xref>) – all of which are awaiting critical scrutiny for their archaeological implications.</p>

<p>While the archaeological GIS critique cannot be regarded as limited to epistemological concerns, such concerns have certainly comprised one of the most dynamic critical strands within the discipline (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1469605312439139">Conolly and Lake, 2006</xref>: 3–10; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1469605312439139">Gidlow, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1469605312439139">Huggett, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469605312439139">Lake, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1469605312439139">Lock, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1469605312439139">2003</xref>: 164–182, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1469605312439139">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1469605312439139">Lock and Brown, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-1469605312439139">Wheatley, 2004</xref>). Questions in this context include whether the knowledge created in GIS-based projects is intrinsically ‘objective’ rather than ‘subjective’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1469605312439139">Brück, 2005</xref>: 54; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1469605312439139">Chadwick, 2004</xref>: 21; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1469605312439139">Lake and Woodman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1469605312439139">Thomas, 2004</xref>: 198–201; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-1469605312439139">Witcher, 1999</xref>). Put differently, can GIS bring us any closer to how people experience the world? Are archaeological explanations afforded by GIS results predominantly (if not completely) determined by environmental properties, such as topography, soil type and vegetation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1469605312439139">Gaffney and Van Leusen, 1995</xref>)? Does GIS bring forth a type of past reality where seeing matters more than hearing, tasting, smelling, touching, feeling and moving within an environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1469605312439139">Frieman and Gillings, 2007</xref>: 13; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1469605312439139">Thomas, 2004</xref>: 199; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-1469605312439139">Wheatley and Gillings, 2000</xref>: 13)? In all these questions, a significant level of concern exists as to whether what GIS can represent determines what we (want to) know about the past (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1469605312439139">Huggett, 2000</xref>: 17; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1469605312439139">Wansleeben and Verhart, 1997</xref>: 61). The technology is rightly presented as affording creation of a limited range of representations.</p>
<p>However, why does it matter so much that GIS representations are better suited to represent certain aspects of life and not others? That is, if all representations are partial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1469605312439139">Castree and Macmillan, 2004</xref>: 476; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1469605312439139">Dewsbury et al., 2002</xref>: 437–438), including those texts that narrate the landscape experiences acquired through our bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1469605312439139">Thomas, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-1469605312439139">Tilley, 2008</xref>), why should we be particularly concerned about the partiality of GIS representations and hold this as a debilitating factor for technology’s standing within archaeology (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1469605312439139">Thomas, 2004</xref>: 198–201; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1469605312439139">Tilley, 2004</xref>, 218, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1469605312439139">2008</xref>: 266)?</p>
<p>In his book, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1469605312439139">Thomas (2004)</xref>, from his counter-modernist point of view, regards GIS as an illegitimate offspring of modernism (unlike, for example, counter-modernist discourse itself or avant-garde art would be). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1469605312439139">Haraway (1991: 151)</xref>, however, ‘… illegitimate offspring are often exceedingly unfaithful to their origins. Their fathers, after all, are inessential’. Haraway’s metaphor highlights that there is no reason for believing in a future for GIS that is faithful to the technology’s past. Therefore, an anti-representationalist or anti-modernist rhetoric in archaeology need not throw out the baby with the bathwater on the basis of GIS’s historical relations. This would be particularly inexcusable today, in the age of digital media, when we are venturing into the uncharted waters of new mappings and representations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1469605312439139">Pickles, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1469605312439139">Silver and Balmori, 2003</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1469605312439139">Llobera, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1469605312439139">Smiles and Moser, 2005</xref>). Moreover, this dismissal is ironic when conducted as part of a counter-modernist, anti-representationalist rhetoric, because it shares many concerns of modernist, representationalist epistemology, an issue discussed in the following two sections.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1469605312439139"><title>Representationalism</title>
<p>Representationalism (or representational thinking) has been closely scrutinized by many theoreticians of embodied practice and experience, and counter-modernist epistemologies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1469605312439139">Anderson and Harrison, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1469605312439139">Bourdieu, 1977[1972]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1469605312439139">Doel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1469605312439139">Hacking, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1469605312439139">Heidegger, 1977[1952]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1469605312439139">Latour, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1469605312439139">1999</xref>: 1–23; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1469605312439139">Pickering, 1995</xref>: 180–186; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1469605312439139">Rorty, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1469605312439139">Taylor, 2005</xref>). Various aspects of representational thinking have also been highlighted in recent years as non-representational case studies on relationality, extended mind, practices, atmospheres, situated knowledge, material agency and mangled practice have emerged as lively topics in social and political sciences as well as in biological philosophy (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1469605312439139">Bennett, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1469605312439139">Clark, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1469605312439139">Haraway, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1469605312439139">Hinchliffe, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1469605312439139">Knorr-Cetina, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1469605312439139">Lakoff and Johnson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1469605312439139">Thrift, 1996</xref>: 1–50, 2008: 1–26). Within archaeology and anthropology, the relationship of the respective disciplines to representationalism has been accounted for on various occasions and a call for an anti/non-representationalist stance has been voiced through a variety of perspectives (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1469605312439139">Barrett, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1469605312439139">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469605312439139">Herva, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1469605312439139">Ingold, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1469605312439139">Knappett, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1469605312439139">Knappett and Malafouris, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1469605312439139">Llobera, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1469605312439139">Olsen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1469605312439139">Thomas, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-1469605312439139">Webmoor, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-1469605312439139">Witmore, 2007</xref>). Therefore, the discussion on representationalism will be limited in this article. Instead, the intent is to summarize representationalism in terms of its four major preoccupations and to ultimately recount these in relation to the epistemological GIS critique. The preoccupations listed below are strongly associated with one another, as is to be expected, and separated artificially for the sake of argumentative clarity only.</p>
<p>The first of these preoccupations is the prioritization of representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1469605312439139">Anderson and Harrison, 2010</xref>: 2). It is no surprise that we prioritize representations when we think in representationalist terms. When we split the world into two as an independent reality (e.g. ‘the past’) and a realm of representations (e.g. ‘the present’) (see the second preoccupation), we will in fact be left with but two options while creating knowledge: we will <italic>either</italic> rely directly on the independent reality itself in our quest for knowledge,<italic> or</italic> we will rely on the representations of this reality. The former is inconceivable for a modernist epistemological project where reality is considered independent and detached from the observer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1469605312439139">Ingold, 2000</xref>: 209–218; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1469605312439139">Latour, 1999</xref>, 2004: 218–219; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1469605312439139">Thomas, 2004</xref>). Accepting that we are embodied researchers undetached from the reality we are seeking would be acknowledging that there is no independent reality as such and would drastically destabilize the foundations of objectivism, one of the major tiers of modernist epistemology. It is therefore unavoidable that if we take a representationalist stance in a modernist quest for knowledge and split the world into two, we will be left with the single option of focusing fully on representations to understand the independently located and far removed ‘modernist reality’. As such, in representational thinking, worldly reality is an object of observation to represent and reveal rather than something we live in and habitually relate to (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1469605312439139">Heidegger, 1977[1952]</xref>).</p>
<p>The second preoccupation of representationalism is the dualist ontology in which the world is conceptualized. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1469605312439139">Anderson and Harrison (2010: 6)</xref> state, ‘on one side, over there, the world, the really real, all “things coarse and subtle”, and on the other, in here, the really made-up, the representations and signs which give meaning and value’. The human subject in this dualist ontology is conceptualized as being ‘here’ and within the world of representations, meanings, mind and culture. As mentioned, this subject is theorized as being detached spatially and/or temporally from the material, bodily and natural reality that now becomes an object of observation and representation for the human subject. Carving the world in such a fashion leads to typical Cartesian bifurcations, such as past and present, object and subject, nature and culture, matter and mind, and material and meaning, all accumulating along this representation-reality divide. These two parts in representational thinking are seen as independent realms, clear-cut and waiting for the best medium to bridge the gap.</p>
<p>This medium can be counted as representationalism’s third preoccupation. Because reality is conceptualized as being independent and detached, located outside the mind, we are inevitably left with the necessity of finding the best medium to transfer this reality to the realm of representations where we (the human subjects) belong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1469605312439139">Latour, 1988</xref>). Because one is after a representation faithful to reality (see the fourth preoccupation), the qualities of the medium bridging the gap between the two realms become crucial: this medium should be able to convey the form and meaning of reality to the realm of representations without (ambiguous) transformation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1469605312439139">Latour, 2005</xref>: 39, where this kind of medium is referred to as an ‘intermediary’). In a familiar example, New Archaeology typically treats archaeological materials as such a medium, as ‘information’ transferred to the present from the past (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1469605312439139">Latour, 1988</xref>: 159). Becoming a ‘record’ of the past in the present, what New Archaeology and related approaches expect of these materials is to straightforwardly bridge the gap between past (i.e. the independent reality) and present (i.e. the realm of representations) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1469605312439139">Barrett, 2006</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1469605312439139">Patrik, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1469605312439139">Shott, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, the fourth preoccupation of representationalism is what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1469605312439139">Pickering (1995: 184)</xref> refers to as ‘a characteristic humanist fear about representation’, that is, the fear of representing the independent reality inadequately and/or wrongly. In other words, taking a representationalist stance goes together with the need to be continuously assured that the representations we employ adequately correspond to the independent reality they substitute (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1469605312439139">Lefebvre, 1991[1974]</xref>: 85; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1469605312439139">Pickering, 1995</xref>: 180–186; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1469605312439139">Prendergast, 2000</xref>: 9). Should our representations be inadequate, our hope of accessing this far-removed reality ceases.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1469605312439139"><title>GIS, archaeology, epistemological critique and representationalism</title>
<p>Concerns surrounding the epistemological implications of archaeological GIS share the representationalist preoccupations listed above in a number of ways. Let us discuss this phenomenon through some examples.</p>
<p>Regarding the first preoccupation, we can say that the epistemological critique prioritizes GIS representations (e.g. viewsheds, cost-distance surfaces, distribution maps, etc.) rather than other aspects of GIS-aided archaeological projects. For example, when the concern is about the technology facilitating ‘male gaze’, GIS representations are considered to stand for/substitute/are representative of archaeological interpretations and projects (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1469605312439139">Thomas, 2001</xref>: 169; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-1469605312439139">Wickstead, 2009</xref>, on male gaze and GIS). The underlying assumption or fear in such contexts is that archaeological interpretations in such projects will have qualities similar (or identical) to the representations created by GIS.</p>
<p>Two points must be noted here. Firstly, if one is taking an anti-representationalist stance, as Thomas and Tilley are, is it not a paradox to criticize GIS projects on the basis of GIS representations? That is, if (GIS) representations are partial and do not correspond to past realities, to what extent do they correspond to the realities of a GIS project? If we truly want to break away from representational thinking, should we not rely on something other than GIS representations (e.g. GIS practices) in the process of assessing GIS critically? Secondly, do we ever manage to completely prioritize (GIS) representations in our research projects (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1469605312439139">Castree and Macmillan, 2004</xref>: 475; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1469605312439139">Latour, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1469605312439139">2004</xref>)? Regardless of how much we represent, are we not always non-representational inhabitants of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1469605312439139">Castree and Macmillan, 2004</xref>: 475)? No matter how hard GIS practitioners aim (if they do at all) to be detached from the ‘subjectivities of landscape’ and base their knowledge on cartographically accurate representations, they remain embodied inhabitants of this world with too much experience of ‘being in the world’ to confuse GIS representations with reality and rely on them unconditionally (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1469605312439139">November et al., 2010</xref>). In accordance with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1469605312439139">Fleming’s (2006: 271)</xref> views, the GIS-using archaeologists do not see the landscape in two dimensions, nor are they an ‘outsider’. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1469605312439139">Latour (2004: 226)</xref>, even for the most enthusiastic GIS users, confusing the feeling of ‘gazing at a digital map' with ‘being at the landscape' would not be a sin to make amends for, but an unreachable dream.</p>
<p>The second representationalist preoccupation is discernable in an epistemological critique, which treats GIS representations as representing rather than performing (i.e. having agency). Note that when representations are treated as purely representing, they are taken as a substitution for an independent reality, but when they are taken as performing, they are acknowledged as making a difference here and now, in various ways contributing to the production of realities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1469605312439139">Latour, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1469605312439139">Thrift, 2008</xref>: 95–96). This issue is particularly apparent in objectivity- and subjectivity-related discussions on archaeological GIS use. In such a critique, objectivity relates to nature, materials, environment and the past, whereas subjectivity relates to culture, the mind, meaning and the present (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1469605312439139">Brück, 2005</xref>: 54). Here, the fear is that GIS representations substitute ‘subjective reality’ with an ‘objective’ one, where nature, materials, the environment and the past are prioritized over culture, the mind, meaning and the present (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1469605312439139">Thomas, 2004</xref>: 198–201). Yet, we will only become concerned about GIS technology representing the past objectively and in an undesirable manner (i.e. as relating to matter/nature/inanimate materials rather than meaning/culture/mind/human) if we are treating representations as merely representing and substituting for the independent past. Such claims are meaningless outside representational thinking, where representations are not treated as substituting reality but, in pragmatic terms, as participating in knowledge creation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1469605312439139">November et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-1469605312439139">Wickstead, 2009</xref>: 256–257).</p>
<p>For the third representationalist preoccupation, it is not surprising that the moment we begin to understand the world as comprising two parts, we will be tempted to seek the best medium to bridge the gap between them. Much of the epistemological critique of GIS has implicitly focused on how GIS could or could not accomplish such a task. According to a certain phenomenological understanding of archaeological GIS, the technology is not suited for the job (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1469605312439139">Thomas, 2004</xref>: 198–201; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1469605312439139">Tilley, 2004</xref>: 218, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-1469605312439139">2008</xref>: 266) and it is only our bodies that afford human engagement with the material world (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1469605312439139">Barrett and Ko, 2009</xref>: 280, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1469605312439139">Brück, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1469605312439139">Fleming, 2006</xref>). On the other hand, some GIS practitioners have been arguing that the technology will potentially be able to bridge the gap in the future, if not now, with further software and hardware developments and methodological improvements (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1469605312439139">Lake and Woodman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-1469605312439139">Wheatley and Gillings, 2000</xref>). Note, however, that the need for such a medium only appears if we do split the world into two; otherwise, there is no sense in saying that we would practise archaeology better with our bodies or stating that GIS is one of the worst media to create knowledge about past human experiences (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1469605312439139">Latour, 2004</xref>: 208).</p>
<p>In fact, it is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1469605312439139">Tilley (2004: 218)</xref> who explicitly states that GIS is one of the worst media with which to create archaeological knowledge. He writes (emphasis added):
<disp-quote>
<p>Ancient stones in landscapes … cannot be known or understood simply from publications, from maps, diagrams, photographs and descriptions, because these are only representations. As representations they necessarily fail in conveying a bodily understanding of prehistoric remains. <italic>Statistical analysis, Geographical Information Systems and simulations are, if anything, far worse</italic>. There can be no substitute for the human experience of place – of being there …</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>One might wonder what the basis could be for this degradation of GIS representations, which brings us to the fourth representationalist preoccupation.</p>
<p>Tilley implies a ‘hierarchy of representations’ in this passage where those created by GIS are among the most inferior. Such a hierarchy would make sense in a context where one is worried about the truth value of representations and accredits a certain methodology – in this case phenomenology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1469605312439139">Barrett and Ko, 2009</xref>: 279; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1469605312439139">Brück, 2005</xref>: 55–56) – as creating more legitimate knowledge than others. Tilley appears to be holding a theoretical primordial reality in his hands (i.e. past was experienced through human bodies) and dismissing certain representations for <italic>inadequately</italic> substituting this reality (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-1469605312439139">Wickstead, 2009</xref>: 256–257). Another example is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1469605312439139">Thomas’s (2001: 169)</xref> statement on the relationship between GIS and androcentrism, where his argument appears to be that the composition of GIS and other representational technologies is inherently androcentric (contra <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1469605312439139">Kwan, 2002</xref>). As such, they would only afford an androcentric and, hence, <italic>inadequate </italic>(if not wrong) representation of the past.</p>
<p>Notice that GIS practitioners, affected by such critiques from a phenomenological perspective, have had persistent concerns about the adequacy of GIS representations. Generally, the aim has been to render representations as more ‘realistic’ by improving the modelling of physical remains or trying to model the ‘humanistic’ dimension of space (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1469605312439139">Lake and Woodman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1469605312439139">Tschan et al., 2000</xref>). However, since to represent is to differ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1469605312439139">Doel, 2010</xref>), or, in other words, since there is no way of making a copy of the original (human experience), this was always going to prove to be a dead-end road, which, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1469605312439139">Latour (2004: 211)</xref>, predictably involves the expenditure of considerable effort and ends in failure and unhappiness.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1469605312439139"><title>Non-representational thinking and GIS</title>
<p>What if we move beyond such <italic>representationalist preoccupations with archaeological GIS representations</italic>? The suggestion in this study is to keep with non-representational thinking habits that do not prioritize representations, and have a predominant interest in practice and the relational ontology of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1469605312439139">Anderson and Harrison, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1469605312439139">Dewsbury et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1469605312439139">Lorimer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1469605312439139">Thrift, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1469605312439139">2008</xref>). Although non-representational approaches can have varying emphases (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1469605312439139">Ingold, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1469605312439139">Thrift, 2008</xref>: 110–111) and can be referred to differently, they commonly understand the world as spatio-temporally contingent. For instance, with profound implications for archaeology, and drawing heavily on Deleuzian temporality, the past in non-representational thinking is always in the present; the present is always becoming past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1469605312439139">Rose, 2010</xref>: 346–348). Past realities from a non-representational perspective, then, can no longer be understood as pre-existing to our archaeological research projects with an independent code waiting to be unambiguously deciphered once and for all. Rather, the past as we (can) know it is something that lingers in and relates to our presence in various ways (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1469605312439139">Rose, 2010</xref>: 346–348; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-1469605312439139">Witmore, 2007</xref>: 556–557, plate 1). Thus, keeping with some ‘post-processual’ ideas (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1469605312439139">Johnson, 2010</xref>: 110–111; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1469605312439139">Shanks and Tilley, 1987</xref>: chapter 1), the past can never be understood as a frozen and pre-given entity in non-representational approaches but rather as something that continuously melts down and is remade in the present.</p>
<p>Another key and related insight in non-representational thinking regards the primacy granted to ‘difference’ rather than ‘identity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1469605312439139">Doel, 2010</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1469605312439139">Deleuze, 1994[1968]</xref>). Non-representational approaches stress that each worldly phenomenon is unique. This is not only about the variable and relative nature of unities – material categories, social identities, conceptual unities – which lose their self-evidence in close examination due to inherent differences between their constitutive elements (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1469605312439139">Foucault, 2002[1969]</xref>: Part II on ‘discursive regularities’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1469605312439139">Deleuze, 1994[1968]</xref>: 13–14 on ‘principal of difference’). It is also about a vitalist ontology – that is, how everything is continually becoming, how nothing ever stays the same or, if you like, how we can never step into the same river twice (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1469605312439139">Pluth, 2010</xref>: 3–4). Non-representational thinking is consequently about how worldly phenomena are continuously becoming and melting down, and how these phenomena will never satisfactorily lend themselves to last words or definitive explanations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1469605312439139">Thrift, 2008</xref>). Moreover, the non-representational emphasis on difference and relationality tells us that the act of representing cannot be the act of exactly copying the original, which is now deemed impossible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1469605312439139">Latour, 2004</xref>: 211). Rather, representing is inherently an act of creating something different from the original yet something related and relevant to it (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1469605312439139">November et al., 2010</xref> ‘resemblance’ and ‘relevance’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1469605312439139">Pickering, 1995</xref>: 180–186 on ‘pragmatic realism’).</p>
<p>Let us now elaborate on two possible critical strands for archaeological GIS in relation to this brief overview of non-representational thinking. Both strands are likely to be expanded and extended, and placed in relation with novel trajectories in the future.</p>
<p>A good way to start giving a non-representational account of archaeological GIS would be to realize the spatio-historically situated nature of archaeological GIS practices. That is, archaeological GIS practices did not emerge and do not occur in a vacuum but are mangled with what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1469605312439139">Pickering (1995: 115)</xref> calls a ‘disciplinary agency’ – the agency of an established conceptual system that leads us through a series of manipulations when we use GIS. However, do we know enough about this conceptual system? Out of which intellectual soil did it really grow? Is it really a direct descendant of archaeological spatial analysis? Can it simply be reduced to a ‘maps as power’ rhetoric (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1469605312439139">Mitchell, 1996</xref>: 73–74) as in the male gaze critique (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-1469605312439139">Wickstead, 2009</xref>)? Can its history be told as a progressive one? What happens if, instead, we tell this history in terms of backtrackings and ‘wrong turns’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1469605312439139">Edney, 1993</xref>)? Put briefly, historical (and, more specifically, genealogical) approaches to archaeological GIS use are yet to be conceived. Such approaches would trace the paths archaeological GIS practices have taken across time and space, and show how our current understandings of and intentions with archaeological GIS technology are inextricably bound with these paths and their spatio-historical context.</p>
<p>Secondly, we can discuss archaeological GIS use by embracing the non-representational emphasis on difference. Note that every ‘thing’ that mangles with archaeological research practices will lend itself to a unique set of representations, political and ethical concerns, discourses, practices, etc. Also, the relevance and enactment of what archaeological research materials lend themselves to will be different in different spatio-temporal contexts (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1469605312439139">Latour, 1999</xref>: chapter 2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1469605312439139">Law, 2004</xref>: chapter 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1469605312439139">Mol, 2002</xref>). For example, there will be a number of things we can do with a GIS representation of an archaeological site, all being different from what we can do on the site itself. The site will keep changing through time, lending itself to certain practices in one year while not in another – for instance, we cannot re-excavate what has already been excavated. The GIS map will similarly lend itself to ever differing sets of practices, representations, political and ethical concerns or discourses as we keep on editing it and as its contexts inevitably keep on changing across time and place together with its archaeological relevance and our archaeological research questions. The point here is that everything contributes to archaeological knowledge creation processes in a unique manner, in unique and contingently created time-place settings. This eclecticism in archaeological practice can be fully embraced by keeping with Deleuze’s non-representational, differential ontology and realizing that difference is everywhere across time and space, and, thus, cannot be the basis to divide archaeological discourses, representations, materials and practices into paradigms that are closed off from one another (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1469605312439139">Mol, 2002</xref>: 55); from a non-representational perspective, difference cannot be the reason for dismissal. We have in fact fruitfully learned in the past – through (de)constructivist and Foucauldian historical approaches – that human history is a history of relating different things and making them appear naturally relevant to one another (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1469605312439139">Foucault, 2002[1969]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469605312439139">1995[1975]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1469605312439139">Hacking, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1469605312439139">Latour, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Specifically, then, a second critical strand for archaeological GIS can be about accounting for and embracing the differences GIS makes in archaeology, and about enacting fruitful relations between other forms of archaeological knowledge and those created through the technology. This latter research engagement should constitute a simple but most valuable shift from archaeological research ‘based on’ GIS to hybrid approaches (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1469605312439139">Kwan, 2004</xref>) where we no longer feel that the birdsongs, for instance, have to stay apart from an archaeological narrative that involves cost-distance analysis (see, however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1469605312439139">Thomas, 2004</xref>: 200).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1469605312439139" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>An ethical archaeology should yearn for inclusiveness rather than dismissals based on totalizing accusations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1469605312439139">Latour, 1988</xref>) and exclusion of the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1469605312439139">Meskell, 2002</xref>). Walking across the landscape or excavating a site is not the only legitimate way to create archaeological knowledge. By interacting with digital or non-digital technology and a series of inanimate and animate materials, we create narratives about past lives as well. It is important to realize that we are recreating the worlds of past people in the present, whether that is with our bodies, GIS, or something else. There is (unfortunately) no master practice, decoder, or representation that will guarantee the best knowledge creation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1469605312439139">Haraway, 1991</xref>: 198–199). Neither walking across the landscape nor collecting the most precise spatial data will reveal a past reality that exists independently from us, the archaeologists. If no practice can guarantee anything, no practice should be excluded from archaeology. Much as walking across the landscape and narrating our experiences in all their complexity and subtlety matters, so should GIS practices. If we are to give up on the idea that there is no independent reality as such and, accordingly, acknowledge that ‘the world is to be made, not revealed and accepted’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1469605312439139">Jones, 2008</xref>: 1601), our next question asks: how did our GIS representations and practices come into being across time and place and how did/can they become part of the complex process of creating past worlds in the present?</p>
