<sec id="sec19-0961203313488840"><title>Background</title>
<p>Depressive symptoms are common in adolescence and young adulthood; however, their prevalence in childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (cSLE) is unknown.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec20-0961203313488840"><title>Objective</title>
<p>The objective of this study was to examine the prevalence of depressive symptoms and their association with disease characteristics in children, adolescents, and young adults with cSLE.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec21-0961203313488840"><title>Methods</title>
<p>A cross-sectional sample of patients with cSLE between 10 to 24 years old completed standardized depression inventories. Demographics and disease characteristics were collected.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec22-0961203313488840"><title>Results</title>
<p>Total depression inventory scores reported were below standard cut-off values for depression. However, 26% (10/38) of children and adolescents, and 44% (seven of 16) of young adults had scores at or above established cut-offs for elevated depression symptoms. Physical symptoms of depression were endorsed most frequently. There were no differences in depressive symptoms by disease characteristics including disease duration, health-related quality of life inventory scores, antiphospholipid antibody status, and a history of renal involvement or neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE). However, two patients had a history of depression as an NPSLE manifestation of their SLE. In the children and adolescents, prednisone dose was associated with negative self-esteem (<italic>r</italic> = 0.37, <italic>p</italic> = 0.04) and somatic depressive symptoms (<italic>r</italic> = 0.39, <italic>p</italic> = 0.02), but we did not observe a significant association in the young adults.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec23-0961203313488840"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Depressive symptoms in cSLE are frequent, although similar to the high prevalence rates in the general population. Physical symptoms are most frequently endorsed. Further study will determine if serial evaluations are recommended for early detection in this at-risk population.</p>

<p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disease with onset in childhood in up to 20% of cases. Childhood-onset SLE (cSLE) has greater disease activity at presentation and over time than does adult-onset SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203313488840">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313488840"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203313488840">3</xref></sup> Neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE) occurs frequently, in up to 65% of patients with cSLE,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203313488840">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203313488840">5</xref></sup> and patients may manifest any of the 19 described syndromes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203313488840">6</xref></sup> One of these syndromes is mood disorder, with depression most often described. Depression and depressive symptoms are prevalent in “healthy” adolescents, with up to 12% of adolescent girls in the United States experiencing a major depressive episode each year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203313488840">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203313488840">8</xref></sup> Although depression can be a manifestation of active SLE (i.e. NPSLE), depression also occurs as a reaction following diagnosis of a chronic illness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203313488840">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203313488840">10</xref></sup> or as a side effect of treatment (e.g. corticosteroids).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203313488840">11</xref></sup> Depression has a significant impact on daily life, with effects on sleep, appetite, and participation in school and other activities, and can further exacerbate SLE disease activity because of decreased treatment adherence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203313488840">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203313488840">13</xref></sup> For these reasons, depression and depressive symptoms warrant attention and management during childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood.</p>
<p>Few studies have assessed depression in cSLE,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203313488840">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203313488840">8</xref></sup> and those that have examined it only as a demographic descriptor of the sample, or in a secondary analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203313488840">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203313488840">15</xref></sup> In one of these secondary analyses, we demonstrated a trend toward higher total depression scores (as measured by the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI)) among a cross-sectional sample of children and adolescents with cSLE when compared to healthy age-matched controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203313488840">14</xref></sup> Another recent study suggested that suicidal ideation is endorsed by as many as 19% of children and adolescents with cSLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203313488840">16</xref></sup> Interestingly, in these studies total depression inventory scores rarely met diagnostic or clinical standards for the diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (as outlined in the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203313488840">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Depressive symptoms fall into broad categories of physical, cognitive, and affective symptoms, and these categories have not been widely studied in childhood chronic disease populations. This differentiation of symptoms may be of particular importance as the physical symptoms of depression (loss of energy, fatigue, appetite, and sleep disturbances) are common in patients with active SLE. These contrast with the cognitive symptoms of depression, which include self-critical thoughts, pessimism, and worthlessness, while affective symptoms include sadness, crying, and loss of enjoyment. Studies of adult-onset SLE cohorts have recognized the overlap between physical depressive symptoms and SLE disease manifestations, highlighting the need to examine the specific types of symptoms prevalent in cSLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203313488840">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203313488840">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Certain SLE disease characteristics may contribute to a greater number and increased intensity of depressive symptoms. For example, adult SLE patients with NPSLE report higher levels of depression and anxiety compared to those without NPSLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961203313488840">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961203313488840">21</xref></sup> Other disease characteristics that may affect depressive symptoms include disease duration, disease activity and damage, dose and duration of corticosteroids, organ manifestations, and autoantibodies (including antiphospholipid antibodies),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961203313488840">22</xref></sup> reflecting either the burden of disease or complications of treatment. In this study, our primary objective was to determine the prevalence, severity, and types of depressive symptoms in patients with cSLE. Further, our secondary objective was to explore any associations between depressive symptoms and clinical disease characteristics.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0961203313488840" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were recruited into one of two research cohorts between April 2010 and January 2012. All participants had cSLE (SLE diagnosed prior to the 18th birthday when ≥ 4 of 11 SLE classification criteria were fulfilled)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961203313488840">23</xref></sup> and were originally diagnosed and treated at the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids). Patients in cohort 1 were children and adolescents (10–18 years old) with cSLE disease duration of less than 18 months. These patients were participating in a 36-month longitudinal study of neurocognitive function, and all completed the CDI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961203313488840">24</xref></sup> Participants in cohort 2 were young adults with cSLE, with disease duration of ≥ 3 years, currently 18–24 years of age, and followed by an adult rheumatologist at the University Health Network (University of Toronto Lupus Clinic). These participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961203313488840">25</xref></sup> as part of a study investigating neurocognitive function in the transition to young adulthood. Informed consent was obtained from participants, and Research Ethics Board (REB) approvals (#1000014075 and #1000020762) were obtained prior to the initiation of the studies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0961203313488840"><title>Recruitment</title>
<p>Eligible patients were recruited by study team members during routine clinic visits. For cohort 1, 79 cSLE patients were approached, 46 consented to the longitudinal study, and 38 patients completed the baseline visit. For cohort 2, using a standardized telephone transcript, we first attempted to contact all 97 former patients of the SickKids Lupus clinic meeting eligibility criteria. Fifty-one patients were not reached either because of non-working phone numbers or no response to three telephone messages. Eleven patients refused, and follow-up information letters and consent forms were sent by mail or e-mail to 35 interested individuals. Additionally, all eligible patients currently followed at the University of Toronto Lupus clinic were given information letters and consent forms at a subsequent clinic visit, and a member of the study team followed up with these individuals by phone. Twenty-five patients consented; however, only 16 subjects completed study activities because of closure of the pilot study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0961203313488840" sec-type="methods"><title>Procedures</title>
<p>All study participants completed the appropriate depression inventory for their age as part of a research neuropsychological evaluation that included intelligence testing. Participants also completed either the Pediatric Quality of Life Index<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961203313488840">26</xref></sup> (participants ≤ 18 years) or the Short Form-36<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961203313488840">27</xref></sup> Health Survey (participants &gt; 18 years) as a measure of health-related quality of life (HRQOL).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0961203313488840"><title>Measures</title>
<sec id="sec7-0961203313488840"><title>CDI</title>
<p>The CDI is a 27-item self-report rating inventory measuring the extent and severity of depressive symptoms in children aged 7 to 17 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961203313488840">24</xref></sup> Each item requires the child or adolescent to choose one of three statements that best represents how they have felt in the previous two weeks. The statements correspond to different severity levels of symptomatology: absence of symptom, mild or probable symptom, and definite symptom. Each item, therefore, has a score of 0 to 2, with total scores on the scale ranging from 0 to 54. For analysis, individual items were dichotomized to examine patterns of the different endorsed symptoms (e.g. presence/absence). The CDI categorizes items into five subscales associated with depression, including Negative Mood, Interpersonal Problems, Ineffectiveness, Anhedonia, and Negative Self-Esteem. Total scores and subscale scores are converted into <italic>T</italic> scores (mean = 50, standard deviation (SD) = 10) based on gender and age. There are two ways of classifying elevated depressive symptoms using the CDI: 1) a raw score ≥ 13 is indicative of borderline significant depression in populations at risk for depression and 2) a <italic>T</italic> score ≥ 65 is indicative of clinically significant depression in normative samples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961203313488840">24</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0961203313488840"><title>BDI-II</title>
<p>The BDI-II is a frequently administered 21-item self-report rating inventory measuring symptoms of depression in adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961203313488840">25</xref></sup> Each item contains four statements that correspond to different severity levels of symptomatology: absence of symptom, mild symptom, moderate symptom, and definite symptom. Each item has a score of 0 to 3 and total scores range from 0 to 63. For this analysis, individual items were dichotomized (presence/absence) in order to examine overall prevalence of the different symptoms across this group of participants. The BDI-II defines mild depression as a raw score &gt; 10, moderate depression &gt; 19, and severe depression &gt; 30. Items were categorized according to three subscales based on depressive symptom clusters: affective symptoms, cognitive symptoms, and physical symptoms. Typically researchers have combined affective (e.g. negative mood) and cognitive (e.g. negative attributions) symptoms into one factor;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961203313488840">25</xref></sup> however, given the potential differences in these symptom clusters within an SLE population as well as the subscales identified in the CDI, we chose to explore these symptom clusters separately.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0961203313488840"><title>Disease characteristics</title>
<p>Clinical disease and laboratory characteristics were extracted from the SickKids Lupus Clinic database, a prospectively collected database housing demographic data, disease manifestations, detailed medication, and laboratory data for all patients followed in this clinic since 1984. Clinical data for cohort 2 were also extracted from the University of Toronto Lupus Clinic database, a prospectively collected clinical and laboratory database that has been following a standard protocol for all patients since 1970. Data collected included the (ever) presence or absence of lupus nephritis and NPSLE manifestations (classified using the 19 case definitions defined in the 1999 American College of Rheumatology NPSLE classification),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203313488840">6</xref></sup> and the (ever) presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant (LA) and anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL)). Medication data were collected, and current prednisone dose was calculated as daily dose per kilogram of body weight at the time of the study visit. Lupus disease activity and damage were measured at the most recent clinic visit (within three months) by Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) and Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics Damage Index (SDI).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0961203313488840">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0961203313488840">29</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0961203313488840"><title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>Statistical analyses were completed using SPSS Software Package version 19 and Stata 12.0 (College Station, TX). Means, frequencies, standard deviations, and ranges were calculated to examine prevalence of depressive symptoms. <italic>T</italic> tests were used to compare depression scores across the various dichotomous disease characteristics, and correlations were used for all continuous variables. Fisher's exact tests were used to determine differences in the proportions of children, adolescents, and young adults reporting depression symptoms. A two-tailed <italic>p</italic> value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Correction for multiple testing was not performed as this study was primarily exploratory.</p>

Thirty-eight children and adolescents were recruited into cohort 1. The mean full-scale intellectual quotient (FSIQ) score of this predominantly (84%) female cohort was in the average range. The 16 young adults recruited into cohort 2 were all female and the mean FSIQ score was also within the average range. Patients in cohort 1 were in the appropriate school grade for their current age. Patients in cohort 2 were highly educated; all had graduated high school, four were enrolled in or had completed community college, eight were currently enrolled in or completed undergraduate university degrees, and two were currently in a graduate program (one Masters' program, one PhD).

<p>When we analyzed the cohorts for differences in depressive symptoms by disease characteristics, we did not find any significant differences in depressive symptoms by disease duration, HRQOL index score, SLEDAI score (analyzed as both a continuous variable and as a binary variable with SLEDAI &gt; 4 representing active disease and ≤4 inactive disease), SDI score, presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, and presence of lupus nephritis ever (data not shown). In cohort 1, current prednisone dose significantly correlated with Negative Self-Esteem (<italic>r</italic> = 0.37, <italic>p</italic> = 0.04) and Anhedonia (<italic>r</italic> = 0.39, <italic>p</italic> = 0.02) but not with the other subscales (data not shown). For cohort 2, there were no associations between current prednisone dose and depression subscores.</p>
<p>Further, we compared depression subscale scores for patients with a history of NPSLE to those without NPSLE (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0961203313488840">Table 2</xref>). No patient had signs of severe active NPSLE at the time of study participation, including active psychosis, movement disorder or acute confusional state. In cohort 1, seven (44%) patients with a history of NPSLE had elevated depression scores (≥ 13), compared to three (14%) of those without a history of NPSLE (<italic>p</italic> = 0.06). The mean total CDI as well as the subscale scores did not differ between patients with and without a history of NPSLE. Two patients in cohort 1 had a history of depression as an NPSLE manifestation. In cohort 2, only one subject had had depression that was attributed to NPSLE.</p>

<sec id="sec16-0961203313488840" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current study examined depressive symptoms in a cohort of children, adolescents, and young adults with cSLE. Based on two well-established depression rating inventories, overall scores for the child/adolescent group as well as the young adult group did not reflect clinical or severe levels of depressive symptoms. Individual items that fell in the physical symptoms subscale were the most frequently endorsed by both cohorts, while the child/adolescent group also endorsed moderate affective symptoms (i.e. elevated levels of depression, but below the clinical depression range). Although suicidal ideation was not endorsed by patients in our study, awareness of this particular depressive symptom continues to be important.</p>
<p>SLE is a chronic disease with symptoms of active disease that may include fatigue, sleep disturbances, and anorexia; therefore, it is not surprising that physical depressive symptoms were the most frequent. It may be more useful to monitor affective mood indicators (e.g. irritability, negative mood, negative self-esteem, worthlessness) when assessing depression in cSLE patients as these symptoms are less likely to coincide with symptoms of active SLE leading to (falsely) elevated composite depression scores.</p>
<p>Negative mood (i.e. affective symptoms) was elevated in the child/adolescent cohort, consistent with what is observed in the general adolescent population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203313488840">8</xref></sup> We might have expected a greater number of patients in the child/adolescent group with symptoms in the clinical depression range due to the natural reaction to a recent diagnosis of cSLE. In fact, the literature is variable, with adolescents with chronic disease demonstrating either normal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0961203313488840">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0961203313488840">32</xref></sup> or elevated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0961203313488840">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0961203313488840">34</xref></sup> depressive symptom scores depending on the underlying chronic disease, duration of disease, and other sociodemographic factors. In this sample, children and adolescents with a history of diagnosed NPSLE did not have significantly higher overall CDI scores or negative mood as compared to the non-NPSLE group, consistent with prior literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0961203313488840">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>Higher corticosteroid dose (at the time of study) in the child/adolescent cohort was associated with higher physical depressive symptoms and lower self-esteem. In the young adult cohort, both the proportion of patients currently taking prednisone and their current dosage were very low, thus the lack of relationship between steroids and depressive symptoms was not unexpected. Lower self-esteem may reflect steroid side effects such as cushingoid facies and weight gain as was evident in the subjects who scored this item as significant. In adults with SLE appearance concerns are related to depression,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0961203313488840">36</xref></sup> and this relationship was recently observed in adolescent females with SLE who were also taking steroids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0961203313488840">37</xref></sup> It is not surprising that the physical and appearance changes associated with (high-dose) corticosteroids would lead to issues with self-esteem and depressive symptoms during the vulnerable years, when peer acceptance and body image are paramount. Anticipation of adherence issues that make the management of adolescents with cSLE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0961203313488840">38</xref></sup> challenging should address coping strategies to counter these self-esteem issues in advance of known steroid side effects.</p>
<p>Our research sample endorsed few social difficulties or concerns (interpersonal problems subscale, e.g. I have some friends but I wish I had more), which contrasts with the suggestion that a diagnosis of SLE has a negative impact on children and adolescents' self-esteem as well as peer relationships.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0961203313488840">39</xref></sup> Given the importance of peer relationships in this age group, it is promising that our sample of children and adolescents endorsed few social stresses. Similarly, cognitive depressive symptoms (e.g. negative attributions) were infrequently reported and in line with the general adolescent population.</p>
<p>There are several limitations to our study. Our sample size was small, allowing for hypothesis generation but potentially limiting our ability to detect differences even if they were present. Data collection was cross-sectional; however, longitudinal surveillance may be more sensitive to detect change in depressive symptoms and identify patients at risk for long-term psychological difficulties. Although the highly educated young adult cohort were similar in age, disease duration, and ethnicity to patients who did not participate, we do not know if disease activity, history of NPSLE or current functioning (education, employment) were similar, all factors that could change the prevalence of depressive symptoms.</p>
<p>In contrast to existing adult SLE studies, we did not observe significant depressive symptoms in our cohort of cSLE patients. When present, depressive symptoms largely reflected the overlap with some of the physical symptoms associated with SLE. The overall percentage of children and adolescents reporting depressive symptoms was within the range reported in the general adolescent population,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203313488840">8</xref></sup> suggesting that cSLE may not be an additional risk factor for depression. Despite these encouraging findings, health care providers should be aware of and continue to screen for depressive symptoms in this at-risk population, given the potential negative effects of depression on medical compliance and disease outcome.</p>
