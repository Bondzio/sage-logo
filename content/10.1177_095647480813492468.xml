<disp-quote>
<p><italic>For those who are too busy fighting to read the small print, this is what the current proposals actually mean for the media</italic></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The over-arching recommendation of the Leveson report was that there should be a new scheme of “voluntary, independent, self-regulation” for the newspaper industry to replace the ombudsman model of the Press Complaints Commission. What Leveson recommended – and what the framework proposed by the cross-party agreement seeks to deliver – is the establishment of a new regulatory body set up by the industry, but with the appointment of a board that is independent of the newspaper industry itself.</p>
<p>The body would have three core regulatory functions – complaints handling/investigations/arbitration – combined with greater powers of sanction; and membership of this new body would be voluntary in that it would not be made compulsory by law. However, while membership would be voluntary, Leveson recommended a system of “convincing incentives” to encourage news publishers to sign up to a new industry body and maximise participation among the press (e.g. by giving subscribers protection from costs in civil litigation and from proposed new exemplary damages measures).</p>
<p>He also recommended that there should be a body made responsible for formally “recognising” the new press regulator to ensure that it ticks the boxes (e.g. of independence etc.) set out by the Leveson report. He said this mechanism for formal recognition should be enshrined in legislation and that the recognition body should be the statutory regulator of telecoms and broadcast media, Ofcom.</p>
<p><italic>The political response</italic>: In his response to the Leveson report, the Prime Minister welcomed what he called the basic “Leveson principles,” but expressed great reservation about “crossing the Rubicon” of enshrining press regulation into the law of the land for the first time. All three political parties subsequently became concerned about having Ofcom play a role, and that specific proposal was dropped.</p>
<p>During the course of cross-party talks, there emerged the alternative proposal (attributed to the Cabinet Office minister, Oliver Letwin) of establishing a recognition body by Royal Charter (overseen by the Privy Council), instead of having it enshrined in (or “underpinned by”) legislation enacted by Parliament. The government produced a draft Royal Charter, which, it maintained, satisfied the substance of the Leveson principles without the need for any new press law as such. The content of the draft was debated in heated talks between the parties in conjunction with newspaper groups and the press victim campaign group Hacked Off.</p>
<p>On March 14 (2013), the Prime Minister announced a halt to the cross-party talks, insisting that agreement could not be reached on certain points in the Royal Charter. But within a week, on March 18, all three main political parties announced that a deal had been reached, and an agreed draft of the Royal Charter was published for debate in Parliament. Following intense criticism by the press of the cross-party deal, the way it was reached, and the content of the new regulatory proposals put forward, key newspaper groups published their own Royal Charter (on April 25) which, while accepting many of the provisions of the government's draft, differs in certain material respects.</p>
<sec id="sec1-095647480813492468">
<title>Some newspapers were not consulted</title>
<p>The move was made with the backing of industry trade associations (through the Newspaper Society/Society of Editors) and led by News International (<italic>The Sun/The Times</italic>), Telegraph Media Group, Trinity Mirror, Express Newspapers and Associated Newspapers (<italic>Daily Mail</italic>.) The announcement was followed by an open letter to party leaders, published in The <italic>Times, Daily Mail</italic> and The <italic>Daily Telegraph</italic>, pushing the case for the rival Charter, combined with accompanying editorials.</p>
<p><italic>The Guardian, Independent</italic> and <italic>Financial Times</italic> were reportedly not consulted about the proposal for a rival Charter. These titles have not formally endorsed the plans and have reserved their position. The <italic>Independent's</italic> reaction was to hedge its bets by saying that it was “prepared to work with” the government's Charter and was now also “willing to accept the latest alternative proposal, too”. <italic>The Guardian</italic> expressed more concern about the rival Charter, saying that aspects did “not look like consensus building,” and it called for a mediator to reach a compromise.</p>
<p><italic>The proposed framework:</italic> The overall framework of press regulation devised by the cross-party agreement is not solely to be achieved by the mechanism of a Royal Charter – be that the government's draft or the newspaper industry's. It is to be achieved by a combination of a Royal Charter – setting out the detail of the new, independent self-regulatory scheme – accompanied by certain legislative provisions and amendments designed to provide the necessary encouragement (carrots and sticks) to “relevant publishers” to sign up to that new scheme under the Charter.</p>
<p>As explained below, the legislative carrots and sticks have now been enacted by Parliament and put on the statute book (although they have yet to come into force). So the unilateral publication of a rival Charter by the newspaper industry does not immediately stand to affect that position. However, the industry's rival draft Charter does still have power to affect the particular content and details of the new self-regulatory regime to which the legislative carrots and sticks apply, because those matters are currently set out in the government's cross-party draft which has not yet been sealed and does not require formal enactment by Parliament.</p>
<p>Unlike ordinary legislation, Charters – being creatures of the royal prerogative – are granted/approved by application (or petition) to the Privy Council (which in practice involves more direct influence and agreement of government ministers), rather than being enacted by Parliament. So what the newspaper industry has done is simply to publish, promote and apply for approval of its own draft Royal Charter in the hope that it is adopted in preference to the current cross-party version. In reality, however, the press is seeking to force the government into a compromise over the content of the final Charter that goes before the Privy Council for approval.</p>
<p><italic>A choice of Royal Charters:</italic> Both draft Royal Charters establish a recognition panel rather than the new industry regulator itself (which is for the industry to do), setting out its core functions and its terms of membership. They explain the panel's role in granting or withdrawing recognition of the new industry regulator, and in carrying out reviews of the regulator's recognition. More importantly, they set out the specific criteria for recognising the new industry regulator to make sure that it ticks the boxes recommended by Leveson.</p>
<p>The Charters additionally prescribe the independence and appointment requirements for a new self-regulatory body (as well as for the recognition panel itself) and make varying provision for the core functions and powers of the new body. The government's Charter makes clear that any new industry regulator should have three core functions (as recommended by the Leveson report). Broadly speaking, those functions are:</p>
<list id="list1-095647480813492468" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>A complaints adjudication arm, free for complainants to use (similar to the PCC)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A power to carry out investigations into general standards/compliance failures (of a “suspected serious or systemic” nature) in the absence of complaints</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>An accessible, cost-effective arbitration arm – free for complainants to use – that can determine civil legal claims (as opposed to mere standards complaints) against subscribing publishers without requiring complainants to take those publishers to court</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The government's Charter also requires the new industry regulator to have increased powers of sanction, which include powers to direct corrections and apologies, and to impose financial penalties of up to 1 per cent of a relevant publication's turnover (with a maximum of £1 million). The regulator would not have power to prevent publication of material in advance (which remains for the courts), although it should provide a service of advice to editors of “relevant publishers” on compliance with a standards code (similar to the mediation service offered by the PCC).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-095647480813492468">
<title>Remove parliamentary involvement</title>
<p>Although it accepts the form and much of the content in the government's Charter, the proposed Charter from the press contains significant areas of difference and dilution to give the newspaper industry greater participation and influence. The alternative press Charter would, for example:</p>
<list id="list2-095647480813492468" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Have the Press Board of Finance (“PressBof”) as first interim members of the recognition panel</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Remove parliamentary involvement in the amendment/dissolution of the Royal Charter itself, but allow greater involvement of peers in the appointments processes</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Involve a new Industry Funding Body to collect and provide funds to both the recognition panel and the new industry regulator. It would also have a power of veto over amendments to the Charter (as part of a new “triple-lock” system – see below)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Narrow the definition of an “editor” to persons with “overall responsibility” for the content of a publication (which is relevant to restrictions on who can sit on the boards of both the recognition panel and the new industry body)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Remove a bar to former editors sitting on the board of the recognition panel</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Remove a general power to “direct” corrections and apologies in favour of requiring remedial action (apologies are taken out entirely)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Remove a requirement for the standards “code committee” to be appointed by the board of the new industry body</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Make it more difficult for an industry body to hear complaints from representative groups</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Make it optional for an industry body to have an “arbitral process” for the determination of civil legal claims against subscribers, stipulating instead that the body “may” provide such a process</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><italic>Legislative sticks and carrots:</italic> In parallel with a Royal Charter, the government, with cross-party consensus, put forward legislative measures to encourage “relevant publishers” of news-related material (see below) to sign up to the system set out in the Charter. One measure (now contained in the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013) seeks in effect to entrench the terms of the final Royal Charter by ensuring that no proposal for amendment or dissolution of the Charter can be made unless the relevant requirements in the Charter itself have been met. (The government's draft requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament. The press Charter, by contrast, removes the involvement of Parliament completely in favour of a triple-lock system of unanimous resolutions by the recognition panel, the board of the industry regulator and the boards of the trade associations represented on the new Industry Funding Body.)</p>
<p>The more substantive (and contentious) provisions are those now contained in the Crime and Courts Act 2013, which are designed to provide a system of financial incentives for “relevant publishers” to sign up to the new regime in the Royal Charter. They do that by offering protection from legal costs in certain civil litigation claims to those “relevant publishers” that do sign up to the new model (the carrot), and making exemplary damages available in those claims – beyond ordinary compensatory damages – for the courts to award as a punitive measure against “relevant publishers” who refuse to sign up to the new framework (the stick). It should be said there remain certain important limits and constraints on the courts' power to award exemplary damages, even where they are available in principle.</p>
<p>These costs and exemplary damages incentives apply to specific media-related claims (i.e. libel; slander; breach of confidence; privacy; malicious falsehood; harassment) and were introduced into the final stage of the Crime and Courts Bill. While that bill has now been formally enacted by Parliament (following Royal Assent on April 25), it is important to note that the costs and exemplary damages provisions have not yet come into force. The Act makes clear that the exemplary damages provisions will come into force a year after the establishment of the recognition panel under the Royal Charter (which has yet to occur). The costs protection measures will be brought in by further ministerial order in Parliament.</p>
<p>Apart from those caveats, the publication of the press's alternative Royal Charter does not, it seems, immediately or directly affect this parallel legislative process as such – rather it seeks to alter the details and content of the self-regulatory scheme to which newspapers are being encouraged to sign up by virtue of these legislative measures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-095647480813492468">
<title>Signatories can benefit</title>
<p>But once a Royal Charter is finalised and sealed, and once the financial incentives in the Crime and Courts Act do collectively come into force, the combined effect will be that any newspaper or “relevant publisher” that chooses not to sign up to a new industry regulator recognised under the Charter when it is eligible to do so may fall foul of the costs and exemplary damages provisions set out in the legislation. Put another way, the effect of signing up to a recognised regulator will be to enable newspapers/“relevant publisher” to benefit from the costs protection measures and insulate them from exemplary damages when defending media-related claims. The overall structure of the new framework proposed by the cross-party agreement is set out in the graphic opposite.</p>
<p><italic>Who gets caught in this?:</italic> The scheme of costs and exemplary damages incentives applies not just to conventional newspapers but to “relevant publishers” – a carefully defined term in the Crime and Courts Act 2013 that has been subject to detailed debate in Parliament. Although there seems to be little doubt that the definition would catch traditional newspapers, the definition is drafted in wider terms than that.</p>
<p>The Act sets out four cumulative criteria which must be met by a publisher to satisfy the definition. A publisher must:</p>
<list id="list3-095647480813492468" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Publish “news-related material” (see below)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Publish “in the course of a business” (whether or not carried on with a view to profit)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>[Produce material] “written by different authors,” and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>[which is] “subject to editorial control” (over the content of material, presentation and the decision to publish).</p></list-item>

<attrib><italic>Adapted by Caro Cluskey from a graphic in The Economist</italic></attrib>
</fig>
<p>“News-related material” is itself defined in very broad, alternative terms as meaning:</p>
<list id="list4-095647480813492468" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>News or information about current affairs</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Opinion about matters relating to the news or current affairs</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Gossip about celebrities, other public figures or other persons in the news</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>It is clear from other provisions in the Act that the above criteria apply to both print and online publications. But the Act also contains provisions which expressly exclude certain publishers – either by name or by description – from the ambit of the costs and exemplary damages scheme.</p>
<p>Specific exclusions apply for:</p>
<list id="list5-095647480813492468" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Broadcasters (e.g. BBC)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“Special interest titles” (relating to a particular “pastime, hobby, trade, business, industry or profession”)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“Scientific or academic journals”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“Public bodies and charities”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“Company news publications etc” (newsletters, circulars)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“Book publishers”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“Micro-business” blogs (those with fewer than 10 employees and an annual turnover of not more than £2m)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>It will be a matter of judgment for individual publications whether they can properly be regarded as falling into these categories of exclusion.</p>
<p>In addressing the “relevant publisher” definition in the House of Commons, the culture secretary Maria Miller said the definition was intended to cover only “more sophisticated news publishers,” and not “small-scale activity online”. She expressly listed the following as excluded services:</p>
<list id="list6-095647480813492468" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>News aggregation services (Yahoo/MSN/Google)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Social networking sites</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Sites which simply moderate the comments of others or aggregate a series of blogs “without any active consideration of the content” – specifically blog-hosting services such as Wordpress or Tumblr</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-095647480813492468">
<title>Newspaper groups announced their objections</title>
<p>She also said that where websites merely operated online blog forums (such as Mumsnet), that activity was “very clearly not covered by the definition of ‘relevant publisher’, as indeed forums are not covered by this definition”. But, she explained, the definition may still apply to such services if they undertake different activities and are additionally “in the business of commissioning articles and publishing news stories”. The culture secretary accepted there would still be doubts “at the margins” of the definition (which would ultimately be resolved by the courts) and the government would seek to give additional guidance on the provisions in the usual way.</p>
<p>The Department of Culture, Media and Sport produced an info-graphic to help publishers decide if they will be caught by the new incentives-based regime. View it at: <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thedcms/8663308157/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/thedcms/8663308157/</ext-link></italic></p>
<p>In addition to publishing its rival Charter, the press has articulated a wider series of objections to the whole intended framework of post-Leveson regulation, including that:</p>
<list id="list7-095647480813492468" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Liability to exemplary damages may be unlawful under Article 10 of the European Convention of Human Rights (freedom of expression) [There is a legal opinion in circulation from various senior counsel/QCs to this effect, but the government maintains that it has received external legal advice that the scheme is lawful under European law.]</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The proposal for arbitration by the new regulatory body may be costly for a national and regional press industry in financial difficulty, by encouraging a raft of vexatious, try-on claims with no merit</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Courts may still be able to disregard decisions of a recognised regulator with the result that subscribing newspapers could potentially be judged for the same complaint twice</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Aside from the traditional press, there is concern among wider media and information businesses about the scope of the proposed new regime and whether it may apply to them. Their specific concern relates to the breadth of the definition of “relevant publishers” in the government's Royal Charter and especially in the new Crime and Courts Act 2013 (addressed above), since it is the latter which governs who may fall foul of the costs and exemplary damages provisions if they are eligible to sign up to the new regulatory body, but choose not to.</p>
<p>The legislation implementing the financial incentives for signing up to a new self-regulatory scheme under Royal Charter has been passed. The question is, which Royal Charter? The intervention of the press left the Prime Minister with a political dilemma – to push ahead with the original cross-party Charter or to amend it in line with the press's diluted draft.</p>
