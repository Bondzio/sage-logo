<p>Memory has a very dynamic neurobiological basis, and it has been found that when a previously consolidated memory is reactivated it enters a labile state where it can be modified prior to being reconsolidated. Now it has been shown in rats exposed to cocaine, morphine, or heroine that when a drug memory is reactivated 10 minutes or 60 minutes prior to extinction training this reduces drug-induced reinstatement, conditioned drug effects, and spontaneous reemergence of drug-related behavior that occurs with the passage of time. This was not seen when the drug memory was activated 6 hours prior to extinction training, indicating a “reconsolidation window” during which the effect can occur. In rats trained to self-administer cocaine, memory reactivation 10 minutes before extinction training increased protein levels of protein kinase M zeta (PKM zeta) in infralimbic cortex and decreased it in basolateral amygala, suggesting a mechanistic role in the observed behavioral effects of this constitutively active protein that mediates maintenance of appetitive and aversive memories. In three groups (22 in each group) of male detoxified abstinent heroin addicts the group that retrieved drug-associated memories 10 minutes prior to a 45-minute extinction session on two successive days had reduced cue-induced heroin craving assessed 1, 30, and 180 days later compared with the group that viewed a neutral video 10 minutes before the extinction session or the group that retrieved drug-associated memories 6 hours before the extinction session during the same 2-day period (Xue and others 2012). These findings demonstrate that memory retrieval prior to extinction training could be an important method to reduce drug craving of addicted individuals during abstinence; however, it remains to be demonstrated that this effect is robust enough to reduce relapse to drug taking when addicts return to their previous drug taking environments. At the mechanistic level, memory retrieval prior to extinction training could act by improving new learning during extinction or act by disrupting reconsolidation of memory. The increase in PKM zeta in infralimbic cortex (new learning) and decrease in basolateral amygala (disruption of reconsolidation) following memory retrieval and extinction suggests that it possibly does both. Taken together, these important new findings suggest that memory retrieval prior to extinction could improve outcomes when extinction-based methods are used to treat a variety of conditions such as drug addiction, posttraumatic stress disorder, and other anxiety disorders.</p>

<p>There is considerable evidence that drug-induced changes in synaptic plasticity mediate addictive behavior. In rats, sensitization to the locomotor stimulating effects of cocaine can be seen for several days after a single injection of cocaine, and this is greater and longer lasting following repeated cocaine injections. Rats that have self-administered cocaine for 6 hours per day for 10 days have a progressive increase in cocaine seeking for at least 60 days after cocaine is no longer available. In humans addicted to cocaine, cocaine craving is low for a few days immediately following cocaine withdrawal, and it then increases over subsequent days and weeks. Now it has been found that a single dose of cocaine potentiates excitatory transmission in nucleus accumbens dopamine-1 receptor expressing medium spiny neurons with a time course similar to cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization. Optogenetic stimulation in vivo of cortical nucleus accumbens inputs with a depotentiation protocol 7 days after a single cocaine injection restored transmission to normal and abolished cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization. When the optogenetic depotentiation was administered 10 days after five daily cocaine injections, locomotor sensitization to cocaine was prevented for at least 5 days (Pascoli and others 2012). This demonstration that drug-induced alterations in synaptic plasticity and behavior can be reversed by a more “physiologic” intervention suggests that treatments for addiction that restore normal synaptic plasticity would be most effective. By using rodent models of drug induced in synaptic potentiation it should be possible to discover new pharmacologic and behavioral methods to reverse it. Even at the present time, a reduction in the sensitization of cocaine craving during cocaine withdrawal in humans could be attempted using transcranial magnetic stimulation depotentiation protocols or targeted behavioral training to restore normal synaptic plasticity and reduce relapse. The demonstration that cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization can be normalized with selective depotentiation provides an important proof of principal that can now be used to develop improved treatments for addiction.</p>

<p>During successful aging from middle age onward, there is an increase in positive affect while negative emotions decline. There is evidence that this involves controlled processing that maximizes positive experiences and limits negative experiences with an emotional control strategy that reduces emotional engagement in regret. Regret depends on the feeling of responsibility and the attribution of internal control, and compared to young adults, healthy elderly adults report lower levels of internal-control attributions and a reduced intensity of regrets. Now, using a sequential decision task that induces regret, it has been found that during task-induced regret, healthy old individuals have increased activation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and reduced deactivation in the ventral striatum than healthy young individuals or old individuals with the onset of depression after the age of 55 (Brassen and others 2012). In addition, healthy old individuals have increased activation of the ACC during attention to happy stimuli than young individuals, and in the healthy old individuals the increased ACC activation was related to greater emotional stability (Brassen and others 2011). These findings support the concept that disengaging from negative experiences and attending to positive experiences in late life is an active process involving activation of the ACC. The limitation of regret and with a focus on the positive is a successful adaptive strategy to deal with the decline in resources and opportunities as aging progresses beyond middle age. Since the ACC is involved in the assessment of emotional significance and the control of emotional conflicts, training in age-specific tasks that strengthen ACC function could be beneficial to individuals with difficulties with late life adjustments. It should be possible to identify those tasks and procedures that produce optimal ACC activation in healthy old subjects and then use training in these ACC validated tasks and procedures as therapeutic interventions for the treatment of individuals with impairment in late life adjustments.</p>
