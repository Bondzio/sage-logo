Seven dogs had hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HS-TCL). Dogs with HS-TCL presented with hepato- and/or splenomegaly, regenerative anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hypoproteinemia. The clinical course was rapidly progressive with all dogs but 1 dead within 24 days of initial presentation. Neoplastic lymphocytes were centered on hepatic and splenic sinusoids and had a CD3+ (5/7), TCRαβ– (5/5), TCRγδ+ (3/5), CD11d+ (6/7), granzyme B+ (5/7) immunophenotype. Bone marrow and lungs were consistently but variably involved. These findings closely resemble the human disease and support the classification of HS-TCL as a distinct World Health Organization entity in dogs. The remaining 2 dogs markedly differed in the pattern of hepatic involvement by neoplastic lymphocytes, which were not confined to hepatic sinusoids but invaded hepatic cords. In addition, neoplastic cells had a CD11d– immunophenotype, and clinicopathologic data indicated marked cholestasis and mild to absent anemia. Based on the distinct tropism of neoplastic lymphocytes for hepatocytes, the name <italic>hepatocytotropic T-cell lymphoma</italic> (HC-TCL) is proposed. Given the histomorphologic, clinicopathologic, and immunophenotypic differences, HC-TCL likely represents a separate biological entity rather than a histomorphologic variant of HS-TCL.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>emperipolesis</kwd><kwd>gamma delta T cell</kwd><kwd>hepatosplenic T cell lymphoma</kwd><kwd>hepatocytotropic T cell lymphoma</kwd><kwd>molecular clonality</kwd><kwd>WHO classification</kwd><kwd>PTCL-NOS</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Considerable effort has been directed toward a generally accepted classification scheme for canine lymphomas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0300985812451625">19</xref></sup> An appropriate classification scheme should adequately group tumors into clinicopathologic entities and serve as a basis for prediction of biological behavior and choice of treatment. With advances in research and diagnostic methods, classification schemes are subject to constant refinement and evolution.</p><p>The current most commonly accepted classification scheme for human lymphomas is the World Health Organization (WHO) system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0300985812451625">18</xref></sup> The majority of WHO entities are defined by clinical, morphological, immunophenotypic, and genetic criteria. One such example is hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HS-TCL). HS-TCL is defined as a T-cell lymphoma that is centered on the liver and spleen without significant involvement of peripheral lymph nodes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0300985812451625">18</xref></sup> HS-TCL is thought to arise from splenic cytotoxic T cells and is predominantly of γδ T-cell origin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0300985812451625">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300985812451625">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0300985812451625">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0300985812451625">21</xref></sup> Patients clinically present with splenomegaly and/or hepatomegaly, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. Histologically, neoplastic cells are predominantly found within splenic and hepatic sinusoids with concurrent bone marrow involvement in most cases.</p><p>HS-TCL has recently been adopted as a new entity in the canine WHO classification. However, so far only 2 cases have been reported in dogs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0300985812451625">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0300985812451625">6</xref></sup> Although these cases resembled the human disease, their singularity precluded identification of general characteristics of HS-TCL in dogs. Additional data are needed to more precisely characterize this tumor type and to validate its status as a distinct WHO entity in dogs.</p><p>In contrast to HS-TCL, other WHO entities are more heterogeneous and include a range of different tumor types that have not been further characterized. One such example, in humans as well as in dogs, is peripheral T-cell lymphoma–not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0300985812451625">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0300985812451625">19</xref></sup> In humans, this entity is being refined as more neoplasms are classified with the help of immunophenotypic or genetic markers. Analogously, a more comprehensive analysis of poorly characterized canine T-cell tumors is needed. This will result in the identification of new clinicopathologic entities and ultimately improve diagnosis and treatment through refinement of the current classification scheme.</p><p>The objective of this study was to examine 9 canine lymphomas that involved the liver in the absence of peripheral lymphadenopathy. Clinical, clinicopathologic, and pathological data were evaluated. Seven dogs were diagnosed with HS-TCL, which supports its classification as a distinct WHO entity in this species. In 2 dogs, the pattern of liver infiltration, immunophenotype, and clinicopathologic features differed markedly. On the basis of the distinct tropism of neoplastic cells for hepatic cords, the name <italic>hepatocytotropic T-cell lymphoma</italic> (HC-TCL) is proposed. The findings of this study support the notion that HC-TCL represents a distinct biological entity that warrants classification separate from HS-TCL and PTCL-NOS.</p><sec id="section1-0300985812451625" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="section2-0300985812451625"><title>Case selection</title><p>The electronic medical records of the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital (VMTH) of the University of California, Davis were searched for dogs that had histologically confirmed lymphoma in liver without peripheral lymphadenopathy.</p><p>Nine cases were retrieved and consisted of 8 necropsy specimens and 1 biopsy specimen.

When available, Wright-Giemsa–stained aspirate smears and immunocytochemically stained smears were reviewed. Lymphomas were classified based on the histologic pattern of liver involvement.

To further assess the clinicopathologic data, a complete-linkage hierarchical cluster analysis using an L2 dissimilarity measure was done (Stata/IC 12.1; StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas), using the following: hematocrit; concentrations of platelets, white blood cells, neutrophils, bands, and unclassified cells; total protein; albumin; globulin; alkaline phosphatase (ALP); γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT); alanine aminotransferase (ALT); total bilirubin; and cholesterol.</p></sec><sec id="section4-0300985812451625"><title>Antibodies</title><p>Mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for canine leukocyte antigens were developed in one author’s laboratory (PFM).

The clinical history for both entities was similar and included progressive lethargy, anorexia, weight loss, diarrhea, and vomiting ranging from 1 week to 3 months prior to presentation to the UC Davis VMTH. Physical examination revealed cranial abdominal organomegaly in all dogs as well as icteric mucus membranes in both dogs with HC-TCL and 1 dog with HS-TCL. Diffuse hepatomegaly and splenomegaly with or without altered echotexture were noted ultrasonographically in 4 and 6 dogs with HS-TCL, respectively. One dog with HC-TCL (No. 9) had both hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. Other findings in dogs with HS-TCL included abdominal effusion (1) and pleural effusion (1). One of the dogs with HC-TCL (dog No. 8) had a severely thickened gallbladder wall and was taken to surgery for cholecystectomy and liver biopsy. Histopathology of the gallbladder revealed a mild cholecystitis with bile inspissation. Dog No. 5 was treated with dexamethasone and l-asparaginase. Dog No. 7 was initially diagnosed with aleukemic chronic lymphocytic leukemia of granular lymphocyte type and sequentially received prednisone, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, and CCNU, alone or in combination. All other dogs did not receive chemotherapy. Seven dogs were euthanized and 1 died (dog No. 3) from 1 to 23 days after initial diagnosis. One dog with HS-TCL was euthanized 196 days postdiagnosis (dog No. 7). Euthanasia or spontaneous death was a consequence of lymphoma in all cases.</p><table-wrap id="table1-0300985812451625" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Signalment and Affected Organs From Canine Patients With Hepatosplenic T-Cell Lymphoma (HS-TCL) and Hepatocytotropic T-Cell Lymphoma (HS-TCL).</p></caption><graphic alternate-form-of="table1-0300985812451625" xlink:href="10.1177_0300985812451625-table1.tif"/><table><thead><tr><th/><th/><th/><th colspan="2">Signalment</th><th/><th> </th><th colspan="5"> Affected Organs</th></tr><tr><th>No.</th><th>Diagnosis</th><th>Breed</th><th>Sex</th><th>Age, y</th><th>Survival, d</th><th>Chemotherapy</th><th>Liver</th><th>Spleen</th><th>Bone Marrow</th><th>Lung</th><th>Other Organs</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>HS-TCL</td><td>Siberian Husky</td><td>FS</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>No</td><td>+</td><td>+</td><td>+</td><td>+</td><td>Kidney, intestine, tonsil</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>HS-TCL</td><td>Rottweiler</td><td>M</td><td>18</td><td>2</td><td>No</td><td>+</td><td>+</td><td>+</td><td>+</td><td/></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>HS-TCL</td><td>Corgi</td><td>M</td><td>12</td><td>1</td><td>No</td><td>+</td><td>+</td><td>+</td><td>+</td><td/></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>HS-TCL</td><td>Mixed breed</td><td>FS</td><td>11.5</td><td>23</td><td>No</td><td>+</td><td>+</td><td>+</td><td>+</td><td/></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>HS-TCL</td><td>Basenji X</td><td>MC</td><td>7.5</td><td>4</td><td>Dexamethasone, L-asparaginase</td><td>+</td><td>+</td><td>+</td><td>+</td><td/></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>HS-TCL</td><td>Labrador Retriever</td><td>MC</td><td>11</td><td>2</td><td>No</td><td>+ </td><td>+</td><td align="center">NA</td><td>+</td><td>Kidneys, heart, adrenals, pancreas</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>HS-TCL</td><td>German Shepherd X</td><td>MC</td><td>12</td><td>196</td><td>Prednisone, cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, CCNU</td><td>+</td><td>+</td><td>+</td><td>+</td><td>Lymph nodes (pancreatic, mesenteric, sternal)</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>HC-TCL</td><td>Siberian Husky</td><td>FS</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>No</td><td>+</td><td align="center">NA</td><td align="center">NA</td><td align="center">NA</td><td>NA<sup>a</sup></td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>HC-TCL</td><td>Springer Spaniel</td><td>MC</td><td>12</td><td>2</td><td>No</td><td>+</td><td>+</td><td align="center">NA</td><td>+</td><td>Kidney</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="table-fn1-0300985812451625"><p>FS, female spayed; MC, male castrated; NA, not available.</p></fn><fn id="table-fn2-0300985812451625"><p><sup>a</sup>Biopsy only.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="section10-0300985812451625"><title>Clinicopathologic features</title><p>All 7 dogs with HS-TCL were anemic on presentation, with a median hematocrit of 29.9% (reference interval, 40%–55%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0300985812451625">Table 2</xref>).

The findings in canine HS-TCL closely recapitulated the human disease. Neoplastic lymphocytes in most dogs, for which the TCR could be assessed, expressed a γδ TCR. Gamma delta T cells are a special group of T cells that bridge innate and adaptive immunity and are enriched in various epithelia as well as the red pulp of the spleen. Neoplastic lymphocytes in 2 dogs lacked expression of a T-cell antigen receptor (αβ or γδ chains) and CD3. Given that both had clonally rearranged TRG genes, lack of reactivity with CD3 and TCR antibodies is assumed to be due to complete loss of T-cell antigen receptor complex expression. A natural killer (NK) cell origin of neoplastic lymphocytes is theoretically possible but is considered less likely. Rearrangement of the TRG locus has been shown only in approximately 1% of murine splenic NK cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0300985812451625">20</xref></sup> Assuming a similar prevalence in the dog, the occurrence of 2 NK cell neoplasms with rearranged TRG chains in this study is considered unlikely. The precise lineage of the neoplastic cells in these 2 dogs remains unknown. Neoplastic lymphocytes in all dogs lacked expression of CD4 and CD8β and inconsistently expressed CD8α. This is in line with reports of HS-TCL in humans and is a common immunophenotype of γδ T cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0300985812451625">9</xref></sup></p><p>Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in dogs most likely originates from CD11d+ splenic red pulp γδ T cells. Neoplastic lymphocytes expressed CD11d in all but 1 dog and markedly expanded the splenic red pulp. In contrast to the liver, the splenic red pulp has been shown to harbor high numbers of CD11d+ lymphocytes normally.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0300985812451625">14</xref></sup> Gamma delta T cells that express CD11d are 4-fold enriched in splenic red pulp compared with peripheral blood (S. McDonough and P. Moore, unpublished observations). Further evidence in support of a splenic origin was the pronounced involvement of the spleen with minimal involvement of the liver in 1 dog (dog No. 3).</p><p>Granzyme B expression in neoplastic lymphocytes of most dogs with HS-TCL was consistent with a cytotoxic T-cell origin. Lack of reactivity despite the presence of cytoplasmic granules in the remaining 2 dogs does not exclude a cytotoxic T-cell origin since expression of granzyme B has been shown to depend on the activation state of the cell.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0300985812451625">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0300985812451625">8</xref></sup></p><p>The clinicopathologic findings in canine HS-TCL closely mimicked the human counterpart. All dogs lacked peripheral blood lymphocytosis. Dogs were variably thrombocytopenic and anemic, which was typically regenerative. Erythrophagocytosis by neoplastic lymphocytes and a concurrent hyperplastic population of (erythophagocytic) macrophages were a consistent feature in HS-TCL, suggesting that anemia is, at least in part, attributable to a secondary hemophagocytic syndrome. The common presence of a hemophagocytic syndrome secondary to HS-TCL in this series of dogs with HS-TCL is in agreement with previous reports in both people and dogs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0300985812451625">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0300985812451625">6</xref></sup> In dog No. 2, the markedly expanded population of hemophagocytic macrophages in association with relatively low numbers of neoplastic T cells in some sections resembled hemophagocytic histiocytic sarcoma (HHS). Differentiation of the 2 entities in this instance was further confounded by their similar biochemical profiles. Patients with either HHS or HS-TCL typically present with regenerative anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hypoalbuminemia. Hemophagocytic histiocytic sarcoma is therefore a potential differential diagnosis in dogs with HS-TCL, necessitating thorough and concurrent evaluation of the clinicopathologic, histopathologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular clonality data to make the distinction. Seven of 9 dogs did not receive chemotherapy and died or were euthanized within 23 days of diagnosis. One of the 2 dogs that did receive treatment survived for 196 days. However, the low number of treated dogs precludes conclusions regarding the efficacy of chemotherapy. In most cases, the owners elected euthanasia because of advanced disease progression at the time of diagnosis.</p><p>Hepatocytotropic T-cell lymphoma shared several features with HS-TCL but also showed distinct differences suggestive of a separate clinicopathologic entity. Like HS-TCL, HC-TCL seems to arise from a cytotoxic γδ T cell. Neoplastic lymphocytes in the dog available for TCR immunophenotyping expressed a γδ TCR, and neoplastic lymphocytes in both dogs were positive for CD3 and granzyme B. HC-TCL had an aggressive clinical course, and patients presented with thrombocytopenia and hypoalbuminemia. HC-TCL differed from HS-TCL in the pattern of hepatic involvement, lack of expression of CD11d, and clinicopathologic features. The most striking histopathologic feature of HC-TCL was the invasion of hepatic cords by neoplastic lymphocytes, which resembled emperipolesis. The term <italic>emperipolesis</italic> (from Greek, “wandering round about within”) was coined by Humble et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0300985812451625">10</xref></sup> in 1956 to describe the phenomena of cells wandering freely within the cytoplasm of larger host cells. However, transmission electron microscopy revealed that lymphocytes in HC-TCL resided between hepatocytes or within invaginations of hepatocyte cell membranes rather than within the cytoplasm proper of hepatocytes. These findings parallel the location of “intraepithelial” lymphocytes in the intestine and indicate a similar epitheliotropism. Invasion of hepatic cords by neoplastic lymphocytes has been described in cats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0300985812451625">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0300985812451625">17</xref></sup> The pattern of liver involvement in cats was identical to that in dogs in the present study. However, most feline cases described to date lack comprehensive clinical, clinicopathologic, and pathological data.</p><p>Neoplastic lymphocytes in both dogs with HC-TCL lacked expression of CD11d. This could indicate that HC-TCL does not arise from lymphocytes of the splenic red pulp, as these cells commonly express CD11d. Instead, a primary hepatic origin is most likely. Also, the most severely affected organ in the only dog with HC-TCL available for necropsy was the liver with only minimal involvement of the spleen. Similarly, involvement of the spleen was not emphasized in previous reports of feline lymphoma similar to HC-TCL, although spleen was available only in 2 of 14 total cats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0300985812451625">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0300985812451625">17</xref></sup> A primary hepatic origin would also be consistent with the liver’s role as an organ with predominantly innate immunity and relatively high numbers of γδ T cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0300985812451625">7</xref></sup> However, antigen loss by neoplastic cells cannot be ruled out, and careful assessment of organ involvement in future cases is needed to fully elucidate this question.</p><p>The most remarkable clinicopathologic difference between HC-TCL and HS-TCL was the presence of severe jaundice and cholestasis in both dogs with HC-TCL. Neither prehepatic causes of hyperbilirubinemia nor posthepatic biliary obstruction was noted in either dog. Given the intimate association of hepatocytes with neoplastic lymphocytes, it is logical to speculate that intracellular and bile canalicular transport and secretion of bilirubin were impeded by the latter. In addition, dogs with HC-TCL had higher hematocrits than dogs with HS-TCL. The lack of secondary hemophagocytic syndrome, which was common in HS-TCL, likely explains this hematological difference.</p><p>In conclusion, this study supports the classification of HS-TCL as a distinct entity in dogs, which is analogous to the human counterpart in the WHO classification scheme for hematopoietic neoplasia. In addition, a new form of hepatic lymphoma with distinctive architectural, immunophenotypic, and clinicopathologic features was recognized. It is characterized by marked tropism for hepatocytes, and the term <italic>hepatocytotropic T-cell lymphoma</italic> is proposed. Additional cases with detailed clinicopathologic, histopathologic, and immunophenotypic data are needed to further define this entity in dogs.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"
