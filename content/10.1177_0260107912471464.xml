<body>
<p>Increasingly corporations in the developed world are looking for ways of doing good while still doing well. Indeed, environmental and social concerns are becoming prominent in today’s globalized world, what with the growing role of NGOs, spread of restrictive legislations or looming consumer boycotts.</p>
<p>However, one can wonder whether these concerns, even if legitimate, should be addressed in the corporate realm: After all, as Adam Smith understood more than two centuries ago, isn’t it the case that by promoting one’s own self interest, one contributes to the greater benefit of society? Didn’t Nobel prize-winner Milton Friedman claim in a 1970 much-cited article ‘The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its profits’ (<italic>The New York Times Magazine</italic>, September 13, 1970) that ‘there is one and only one social responsibility of business—to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rule of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception or fraud’? Major companies such as Nike, Merck, Monsanto, Citigroup or Wal-Mart can bitterly testify that these arguments do not shelter businesses from loss of goodwill, if not outright bankruptcy, when deemed to neglect their alleged environmental or social responsibilities.</p>
<p>So what does ‘being responsible’ mean today? What should a ‘responsible’ corporation aim at, on top of maximizing its shareholders’ revenue? And of course, what’s in it for corporations? ‘When principles pay’ is an accessible yet rigorous book about the incentives companies face when making a choice on environmental and social issues, and the non-market forces attempting to influence it.</p>
<p>Acknowledging that corporations do have a deep impact on society beyond production is the first step towards understanding the responsibilities that befall them. As Geoffrey Heal makes clear from the start, Smith and Friedman are right in saying that profit-maximizing behaviour delineates the fastest way to global efficiency, but only under strict conditions not always met in real life. As soon as economic activity imposes a cost on external agents without their consent, like generating pollution or selling health-damaging goods such as cigarettes, are these conditions violated. This entails a discrepancy between corporate and social interests.</p>
<p>Government intervention often aims at correcting such discrepancies by imposing norms or taxing socially harmful behaviour, for instance. However, public authorities do not always have the necessary information or means to enforce such correcting mechanisms. In these circumstances, disputes, law suits and punitive actions in order to realign corporate and social interests are to be expected. At sometimes a huge cost for corporations.</p>
<p>Besides, even in the absence of external effects, there exist several ways of reaching global efficiency, many of which are not considered ‘fair’. And it turns out that fairness is a widely shared concern: Most people hardly see discriminating on gender or race, using child labour or prospering on ‘sweatshop’ technology as defensible practices. So being responsible means just this: supporting the actual cost of one’s activities on environment and society on the one hand, and adopting fair business practices on the other hand.</p>
<p>But does it really pay in the end to do the right thing? Undoubtedly, corporate social responsibility (CSR) must involve additional costs that less scrupulous competitors do not support, so that in the long run, unless all companies are compelled to follow the same rules, do-gooders are bound to be wiped out of the market, right? Geoffrey Heal convincingly argues that to the contrary, doing good generally serves long-term corporate interests through ‘in addition to reducing the risk of conflicts, the reduction of waste, improving relations with regulators, generating brand equity, improved human relations and employee productivity, and a lower cost of capital’ (p. 20).</p>
<p>Capital markets understand this and there is empirical evidence that socially responsible behaviour leads to higher stock-market valuation, as long-run profits are likely to be positively affected by lower dispute prospects. In other words, capital markets tend to consider opportunistic behaviour as a future liability.</p>
<p>Moreover, the data also exhibit positive correlation between a good CSR record and superior financial performance, and everything indicates that the causal link goes from the former to the latter. Hence, environmental and social records are gaining importance in the eyes of an increasing number of investors, all the more as the information is becoming easier to obtain. Some agencies have even found it profitable to provide environmental and social ratings.</p>
<p>In the same line of thought, socially responsible investment (SRI) funds are constantly growing in volume and in diversity; they represent all kinds of persuasions and amount today to about ten percent of the total funds invested in capital markets. Not only are these funds increasingly popular, but they also perform well on average, so that being an ethically motivated investor doesn’t really harm the returns. Several studies tend to suggest that ‘socially responsible behaviour proxies for general managerial competence’ and although the effects of SRI are unclear, ‘shareholder activism by socially responsible investors, along with consumer activism, has affected the choices of influential corporations’ (pp. 65–66).</p>
<p>One of these influential corporations is certainly Citigroup. Typically, financial institutions do not really have to care about costs they impose on external agents. But the projects they finance could entail such costs, so that banks might be seen as indirectly responsible for their clients’ shortcomings. This has led several major international banks, at the initiative of Citigroup, to design and implement in 2003 the so-called Equator Principles (EP), a set of constraining social and environmental standards that financed projects, whether set in developing countries or not, should satisfy.</p>
<p>These standards are often more stringent that internationally acknowledged ones and their promoters were under no legal obligation to develop them. Still, they found it in their interest to do it and a growing number of banks are now committed to follow them. Geoffrey Heal carefully describes the context in which this story takes place and the reputational importance of the EP that led competing banks to unite their efforts to this purpose.</p>
<p>In subsequent chapters, other recent and significant case studies illustrate the importance of CSR: how Merck and the pharmaceuticals’ in general failed to understand that ‘it is politically unacceptable that people should die or suffer only because of their income levels’ (p. 111), how Wal-Mart and Starbucks chose diverging policies and experienced different successes, or how and why Interface and Monsanto failed to reach their business objectives despite good intentions.</p>
<p>Before concluding by discussing from a corporate executive’s perspective how to measure CSR and incorporate it into financial statements, the author tackles the fairness side of globalization that, not surprisingly, constitutes probably the most controversial aspects of social responsibility. With great clarity, he asks the right questions and provides the relevant elements for answering them.</p>
<p>Outsourcing is perhaps one of its most discussed and the less well-understood aspects, with implications not only on the home labour market but also in developing countries where child labour and sweatshops are not uncommon. Very often, it is forgotten that the poor in developing countries gain from outsourcing. Cases of outrageous abuse of workers still exist, but are increasingly driving Western firms to closely monitor their subcontractors.</p>
<p>Another aspect is ‘getting rich by selling to the poor’. Is it moral to make money by selling goods to people who hardly earn a couple of euros a day? The same questions arise with the spread of mobile phones in poor countries. Do these people not have more urgent needs? This is forgetting that these goods and services sold to the poorest make an immense difference to their quality of life by bringing economic benefits to them as well as to the sellers. These are transactions in which both sides can win.</p>
<p>With this book, Geoffrey Heal builds a strong case for involving the corporate world in environmental and social issues. Globalization is not only a market enlargement, it also brings increased consumer awareness and multiplication of NGOs. These non-market forces grow stronger as time goes by and no doubt the spread of corporate social responsibility is an accelerating movement. We can expect business models based on opportunistic or short-sighted behaviour to have an increasingly hard time in the future. Might it be that, after all, being socially responsible is the profit-maximizing behaviour?</p>
