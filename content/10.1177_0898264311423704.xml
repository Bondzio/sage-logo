<p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The structural aging of the population and withdrawal of older people from the labor force have become common themes within Western social policy discourse and have particular relevance to policy development around health and aging. The current study examines whether particular occupation types are associated with both poor health and an increased likelihood of labor force exit. <bold>Methods:</bold> Longitudinal data are used to examine workforce participation among older Australians (aged between 55 and 64, in 2002). <bold>Results:</bold> Older workers in trades, labor, and production occupations, the majority of whom are men, have poorer general health than their counterparts in other occupations and are also the most likely to exit the workforce. <bold>Discussion:</bold> These findings suggest that a number of older men in Australia (and, indeed, elsewhere) may face both poor health and limited employment opportunities in areas that match their abilities and experience. These individuals may experience a number of years out of the labor force, highlighting a role for targeted policies and programs.</p>

<body>
<p>The structural aging of the population and its flow-on effects for productivity have become common themes within Western social policy discourse. Older people represent a growing proportion of the total population, and their participation in paid work affects the ability of the labor market as a whole to support national production and a tax base that sustains public programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898264311423704">Cai &amp; Kalb, 2006</xref>). However, in Australia (and elsewhere) many older people1 are leaving the workforce at an earlier age than their predecessors and spending more years in retirement. The implications of this for social policy and program design, as well as service delivery, have generated increased interest in understanding both workforce attachment and the reasons for workforce exit among persons approaching retirement age.2</p>
<p>A considerable amount of research into early workforce exit has focused on wealth accumulation and, to a lesser extent, lifestyle factors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898264311423704">Headey, Warren, &amp; Wooden, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0898264311423704">Warren, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0898264311423704">Warren &amp; Oguzoglu, 2007</xref>). Consequently, policies such as lifting the superannuation preservation age3 or offering bonus payments for remaining in the workforce emphasize the role of financial measures as a means of retaining older workers.</p>
<p>This approach implies a degree of control and choice over older workers’ decision to exit the labor force. This contrasts with a growing body of research highlighting the role of health in labor force participation. Study in this field links the occurrence of workforce exit with the incidence of chronic illness and disability in Australia (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0898264311423704">Schofield, Passey, Earnest, Gloor, &amp; Shrestha, 2007</xref>). There is substantial evidence that poor health is associated with lower workforce participation in general and, among persons who are in paid work, a greater likelihood of exiting paid work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898264311423704">Cai &amp; Cong, 2009</xref>, provide a useful overview of this literature).</p>
<p>Consequently, for persons in poor health, leaving paid work may not be a voluntary or positive event. Some groups of older workers may be more affected than others in this regard. For example, a range of international studies using a variety of different methods and sampling techniques have consistently shown that older manual or unskilled workers tend to have poorer health than their counterparts in other types of occupation and are likely to exit work earlier than workers in less labor-intensive occupations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0898264311423704">Arndt, Rothenbacher, Brenner, &amp; Fraisse, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898264311423704">Arndt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898264311423704">Gleeson &amp; Gallagher, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898264311423704">Hagen, Holte, Tambs, &amp; Bjerkedal, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0898264311423704">Young et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898264311423704">McPhedran, in press</xref>) has indicated that when age was controlled for, older Australians who left the workforce had preexisting poorer health relative to older people who remained in paid work. This supports the theory that health status may predict workforce exit among older Australians but raises the question of whether specific job characteristics also play a role in workforce exit. For example, particular types of occupation may be more strongly associated with poor health, and offer limited options for continued participation in the event of poor health, thus increasing the likelihood of (not necessarily voluntary) workforce exit. Understanding the types of factors that predict ongoing workforce attachment or workforce exit can in turn inform tailored social and economic policy initiatives designed to assist and support specific groups of older workers.</p>
<p>The current study has three main aims. First, it describes self-reported health and well-being and a selection of job characteristics across different occupation types and assesses whether there are differences between occupation types on those measures. Second, it determines whether occupation is a significant predictor of workforce exit, after controlling for health and job characteristics that were found to differ significantly between different occupation types. Finally, it assesses whether for each different occupation type different health and work characteristics predict workforce exit.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-0898264311423704">
<title>Data Source and Sample Selection</title>
<p>Data were drawn from Waves 2 to 6 of the Household, Income and Labor Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey. The study used a cohort of Australians whose self-reported age category was between 55 and 64 years in 2002, when Wave 2 of the HILDA survey was conducted. Participants who responded at all waves of the survey and provided employment status information each year were selected for further analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0898264311423704">
<title>Employment Status and Income Variables</title>
<p>The focus of the study was on respondents who were <italic>consistently</italic> in the labor force between Waves 2 and 6 of data collection, compared with those who were in the labor force at Wave 2 but <italic>left the workforce and did not reenter it</italic> between Wave 2 and Wave 6. In the interests of clarity, these groups are referred to as “employed” and “NILF” (meaning not in the labor force), respectively. At Wave 6, 175 respondents were no longer in the labor force, leaving a total of 398 (235 men and 163 women) employed respondents. Of those employed respondents, 346 had been attached to the labor force continuously across the study period. The remainder of respondents had been employed at Wave 2 but had not been in the labor force continuously during that period. Those respondents were classified as an “intermittent employment” group, which consisted, for example, of employment followed by a period out of the labor force, followed by unemployment, and then a return to employment. Respondents who had an intermittent employment pattern were excluded from the sample. This method resulted in a total sample of 541 survey respondents who took part in Waves 2 through to 6 of the HILDA study and who were either continuously attached to the labor force or who left and did not reenter the labor force during the five waves of data collection.</p>
<p>In addition, for respondents who were employed at Wave 2 of data collection, hours worked per week, current average weekly income from wages/salary, and household private income (financial year) were analyzed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0898264311423704">
<title>Life Satisfaction</title>
<p>Each wave of the HILDA survey contains a set of nine self-reported life satisfaction measures (for further information on scale construction and validation in the HILDA survey, the reader is referred to the comprehensive HILDA Discussion Paper Series and HILDA Technical Paper Series provided by the Melbourne Institute; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898264311423704">Melbourne Institute, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898264311423704">2011</xref>). On the basis of previously observed differences between employed and NILF respondents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898264311423704">McPhedran, in press</xref>), two specific items were selected from this scale: respondents’ satisfaction with their health, and their employment opportunities. Each item is scored on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 representing the lowest level of satisfaction and 10 representing the highest level of satisfaction. For the purpose of analysis, the scale was treated as a continuous variable. Note that in the logistic regressions described below, satisfaction with health was included as an indicator of general health and well-being, whereas satisfaction with employment opportunities was classified as a “job characteristic.” It should be noted that this scale captures respondents’ perceptions about their opportunities, which may not accurately match with objective data about prevailing labor market conditions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0898264311423704">
<title>General Health and Well-Being</title>
<p>General health and well-being was assessed using the Short Form-36 (SF-36), a widely used and well-validated self-report measure covering physical, mental, and emotional health and functioning over the 4 weeks prior to survey completion. The SF-36 consists of 36 questions that sample 8 dimensions of health with each dimension scored on a scale ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate better health.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0898264311423704">
<title>Job Satisfaction</title>
<p>The HILDA survey contains self-reported job satisfaction data, including items such as satisfaction with total pay, job security, hours worked, and perceived job flexibility. Each item is scored on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 representing the lowest level of satisfaction and 10 representing the highest level of satisfaction. For the purpose of analysis, the scale was treated as a continuous variable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0898264311423704">
<title>Occupation Type</title>
<p>Occupation type was classified using the one-digit Australian Standard Classification of Occupations (ASCO) system (Australian Bureau of Statistics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898264311423704">[ABS], 1997</xref>). Three broad categories were created: professional (comprising managers and administrators, professionals, and associate professionals), clerical/sales/services (C/S/S; comprising advanced, intermediate, and elementary clerical, sales, and service workers), and trades/laborer/production (T/L/P; consisting of tradespersons and related workers, laborers and related workers, and intermediate production and transport workers). For further detail on the specific types of occupations falling within each of these categories, the reader is referred to ABS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898264311423704">ABS, 1997</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0898264311423704">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>Bivariate differences between occupation types on the measures of self-reported health and job characteristics at Wave 2 were identified using analysis of variance (performed on each item) with follow-up pairwise comparisons. Items where bivariate analysis revealed significant between-occupation differences were analyzed further. A parsimonious logistic regression model was used to determine which of those items were significant predictors of labor force exit. This model contained four steps. The base model contained only occupation type. Demographics, health and well-being indicators, and job characteristics were entered in subsequent blocks.</p>
<p>To investigate whether different variables predicted labor force exit within different occupation types, all variables were entered into a logistic regression model containing three steps: demographics, health and well-being, and job characteristics. This model was applied separately to each occupation type, with the outcome of interest being a dichotomous variable: labor force exit between Waves 2 and 6 (0 = no, 1 = yes).</p>

<p>The greater proportion of T/L/P workers who exited the labor force between Waves 2 and 6 of data collection was not a product of preexisting age differences (i.e., at Wave 2, T/L/P workers were not older than workers in other occupation types). At Wave 2, the mean ages within each occupation type were comparable (professional: mean age = 57.6 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.8 years; C/S/S: mean age = 58.3 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.8 years; T/L/P: mean age = 58.4 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.8 years). In addition, almost half (46.9%, or 53 individuals) of the 113 study participants who were aged 65 years or above by Wave 6 were still in the workforce. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0898264311423704">Table 2</xref> shows workforce exit figures for respondents aged 65 or above at Wave 6, by occupation type.</p>

<title>Health Status and Job Satisfaction by Occupation Type</title>
<p>At Wave 2 of data collection (i.e., when all respondents were in paid work), there were relatively few differences between occupation types on the range of health and job characteristics examined. Overall, respondents in the T/L/P occupation type reported poorer health and general well-being than the other two occupation types, though these differences reached only marginal statistical significance for physical functioning (where T/L/P differed from professionals) and general health (where T/L/P respondents differed from both other occupation types). In terms of job characteristics, professionals were most satisfied with their employment opportunities but also most likely to want to change their working hours, whereas T/L/P respondents were least satisfied with the work itself. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0898264311423704">Table 3</xref> provides further information.</p>

<p>The inclusion of demographic factors (age and sex) reduced to nonsignificance the predictive power of C/S/S as an indicator of workforce exit. This is most likely a reflection of the greater proportion of women in the C/S/S category, coupled with the documented likelihood of women older than 55 leaving the workforce at a younger age than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898264311423704">ABS, 2007</xref>). In contrast, T/L/P continued to be associated with a greater likelihood of labor force exit until job satisfaction and work hours were controlled for. This suggests that when T/L/P workers experience the same levels of job satisfaction and have the same total work hours per week as workers in other occupation types, their likelihood of early workforce exit is comparable with that of workers from other occupation types. However, as discussed later in this article, in practical terms T/L/P workers may face greater challenges in attaining comparable conditions to those observed in other occupation types. In addition, poorer general health among older T/L/P workers may further limit their ability to attain comparable satisfaction and working hours to workers in other occupations. General health was an independent predictor of labor force status, with poor health associated with a greater likelihood of workforce exit.</p>

<title>Do Different Factors Predict Workforce Exit for Different Occupation Types?</title>
<p>Each occupation type was analyzed separately to determine which of a range of potentially relevant factors was significantly associated with labor force exit within different occupation types. The full spectrum of variables presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0898264311423704">Table 2</xref> was examined, on the grounds that though few of these items differentiated <italic>between</italic> occupation types, this does not equate to the expectation that those items would not have predictive utility <italic>within</italic> each occupation type.</p>
<p>Although increasing age was associated with labor force exit within each occupation (as expected), other predictive factors differed between occupation types (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0898264311423704">Table 5</xref>). For professionals, not only lower vitality and overall job satisfaction but also higher satisfaction with their employment opportunities were associated with labor force exit. This may indicate greater confidence among those workers about their ability to rejoin the labor force in the future, should they wish to. In contrast, the strongest predictors of labor force exit for C/S/S were lower levels of satisfaction with their health and the work itself. For T/L/P respondents, however, lower levels of general health and less satisfaction with their employment opportunities predicted labor force exit.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current study described health status and job characteristics across three different occupation types and assessed whether those specific characteristics varied across different occupation types. Second, it determined whether occupation is a significant predictor of early retirement, when various health and job characteristics are controlled for. Finally, it assessed whether within different occupations different health and well-being indicators and job characteristics predict workforce exit.</p>
<p>Overall, older people who worked in trade, labor, and production occupations were most likely to exit paid work during the period 2002-2006. The latter group also reported generally, though not always statistically significantly, poorer health at Wave 2 of data collection relative to other occupation types. In addition, poorer self-reported general health was a significant predictor of labor force exit among trade, labor, or production workers but not for other occupation types. This suggests that the group of older Australians most likely to leave paid work are those in trade, labor, or production occupations—occupation types that also tend to involve manual labor and which contain an overrepresentation of men.</p>
<p>The finding that older trades, labor, and production workers were the group most likely to exit the workforce during the 5-year period examined in this study may reflect the role played by health in those occupations, relative to more skilled, less labor-intensive positions. That is, though there were relatively few statistically significant differences in health found in this study, the impact of poor and/or declining health on workforce attachment may be greater among those who are least able to afford workforce exit but who work in jobs that often necessitate good physical health in order to perform manual or labor-intensive tasks (to meet the requirements of the occupation). This observation potentially also relates to the social determinants of health and relationships between health and socioeconomics (see, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0898264311423704">Warren, Carayon, &amp; Hoonakker, 2008</xref>),</p>
<p>An additional possibility is that the influence of poor health on workforce exit among trades, labor, and production workers is exacerbated by declines in job availability in particular industries in Australia (e.g., manufacturing) coupled with more general challenges that may be faced by older workers seeking employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898264311423704">ABS, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898264311423704">Keating, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898264311423704">Saunders, 2007</xref>). It is possible that labor market conditions may further interact with the capabilities of the worker; for instance, those who experience poor health may also experience declining confidence about their ability to secure other types of work in a competitive labor market. Collectively, the findings indicate that older workers in those occupations who experience poor health may be particularly affected by broader changes occurring within certain industries.</p>
<p>In practical terms, these observations suggest that a number of older men in Australia are likely to face, or are currently facing, both poor health and a lack of employment options in areas that match their abilities and experience, potentially leading to those individuals experiencing a number of years out of the labor force. The life course and broader social and/or economic circumstances contributing to poor health and a lack of employment options may not be easily addressed by policy interventions, suggesting that for these groups of workers, there may be need for short-term policies that focus on post–workforce exit support. Situations where an individual leaves the workforce at a much earlier time than they originally anticipated or planned for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898264311423704">Jackson &amp; Walter, 2009</xref>) may represent a particular concern in this regard.</p>
<p>Previous suggestions that undertaking part-time and/or flexible work may facilitate workforce retention among older people (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0898264311423704">Shacklock, Brunetto, &amp; Nelson, 2009</xref>) were not convincingly supported. Those who were working fewer hours at Wave 2 were more likely to not be in the labor force by Wave 6. The occupation type with the highest reported working hours at Wave 2—professionals—was also the occupation with the highest likelihood of remaining in the workforce. One possible explanation is that older people in part-time work may be using that work pattern as a means of transitioning to complete cessation of paid work, rather than as a way to continue their participation in paid work (or, potentially, a combination of the two). Alternatively, the greater likelihood of workforce exit among older part-time workers may simply reflect workforce exit by older women (e.g., leaving work at the same time an older spouse retires from full-time work—see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0898264311423704">Henkens, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898264311423704">Ho &amp; Raymo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0898264311423704">Onyx &amp; Baker, 2006</xref>). This is consistent with the finding that the clerical, services and sales occupations group consisted largely of women, and reported the lowest number of working hours at Wave 2.</p>
<p>The study did not support the premise that job flexibility relates to ongoing workforce participation among older Australians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898264311423704">Calvo, Haverstick, &amp; Sass, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898264311423704">Gielen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898264311423704">Kantarci &amp; Van Soest, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898264311423704">Zissimopoulos &amp; Karoly, 2008</xref>). This job characteristic at Wave 2 was not a significant predictor of labor force status at Wave 6. While a characteristic like flexibility may indirectly contribute to overall satisfaction with the work itself (which did predict labor force status over time), flexibility in itself did not appear to offer predictive utility in understanding labor force exit.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Directions</title>
<p>The current study used very broad occupational classifications. This was a consequence of the longitudinal nature of the study and relatively small sample size (521 respondents) who provided data across all waves of collection. This limitation leaves unanswered the question of whether specific types of occupation within those broad groupings are at particular risk of poor health and early labor force exit. In addition, the current study did not examine trends over time within occupation types on outcome measures such as mental health, family and/or marital relationship quality, and social activities—or how those outcomes may relate to workforce status. Addressing these limitations through more detailed longitudinal quantitative analysis, augmented by qualitative study, would provide useful information for policy development and service delivery.</p>

<p>While definitions of “older” vary greatly across existing literature, the age group studied in the present paper ranged from 55 to 64 years in 2002.</p>

<p>In the current context “retirement age” is defined using the age of 65 years, which also represents the point of eligibility for an Age Pension for Australian men, although the accumulated literature uses a range of different “retirement ages.”</p>

<p>“Preservation age” is the age at which an individual can access their superannuation fund. For Australians born before July 1, 1960, the preservation age is 55 years. This rises to 60 years for persons born after July 1, 1964.</p>
