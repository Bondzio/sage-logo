<p>In Britain, as elsewhere in the rich West, the ‘problem’ of immigration is one of the few issues where mainstream parties are converging: the numbers of immigrants should go down, low skilled migration should be stopped and only the ‘best and brightest’ should be admitted in to the country, while allowing subsidiary protection of those in genuine need. In post-war Britain, immigration politics is framed very much in terms of binaries, immigration politics is framed very much in terms of binaries—most precisely, the deserving and the undeserving migrant. In dealing with this increasingly complex, fragmented and politically charged field, Anderson seeks to make sense of the often contradictory and volatile immigration politics and policies. In particular, she connects immigration discourses and politics to wider debates about national identity. Migration controls, Anderson suggests, are not just about ‘them’ but are also about ‘us’. They operate to define who the ‘other’ is—in other words, who should be excluded from the ‘frontiers of identity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1362480613494287">Cohen, 1994</xref>)—as much as about reinforcing the constitution of the community within. Her central argument is that by portraying themselves as ‘communities of values’, formed by like-minded ‘good citizens’ who ‘share common ideals and (exemplary) behaviour expressed through ethnicity, religion, culture, and language’ (p. 2), modern states legitimize themselves. This appeal to ‘popular communitarianism’ or neo-nationalism manifests those (idealized) shared values while simultaneously setting the boundaries of inclusion/exclusion. ‘Non-citizens’ are by definition excluded from that community of values as are ‘failed citizens’ (the welfare dependent, the benefit scrounger, the criminal). Immigration controls, argues Anderson, play a crucial role in the delineation of this ‘community of values’.</p>
<p>The first two chapters set the scene of the book, tracing and exposing continuities in the way the social and political elites have sought to control the mobility and labour of the destitute poor. The embryonic roots of immigration controls, Anderson tells us, can be traced back to Medieval England. In this period, it was the ‘vagrant’ who emerged as the prime symbolic threat to public order due to his perceived idleness and unruliness, and his mobility sought to be controlled through settlement and vagrancy laws. These processes continued through the Empire with the control over the movements of those subjects from the colonies. Anderson concludes that the history of immigration controls became intrinsically linked to early attempts to define the ‘other within’ for the purpose of discipline and subjugation.</p>
<p>Throughout the book, Anderson points precisely to the ‘productive nature’ of these controls. Although ‘migrants’ are loosely defined as those living outside their country of origin, in practice not all foreigners are migrants and neither are all migrants foreigners. In Chapter 3, she explains that there is an obvious disjuncture between the formal category of ‘migrant’ (in the law) and the moral and normative one (in politics). This disconnection produces tensions and difficulties for immigration management because of the unsuitability of technocratic solutions to what is essentially a politically constructed problem, as well as owing to the difficulties for liberal democracies in reconciling exclusionary policies against particular groups with liberal values. Indeed, while governments of all colours have insisted on the ‘raceless’ character of their immigration policies, the everyday practice of immigration controls suggests that these are not neutral in terms of race, nationality and class, but are organized to keep the poor and non-white from the Global South out. Through immigration controls, states produce and maintain (racial) difference, which is not so much about skin colour, but rather about ‘culture’, thereby distinguishing the uncivilized foreigner from the good citizen.</p>
<p>Immigration controls also produce ideal workers and ideal citizens – as argued in Chapters 4 and 5. By creating the conditions for workers’ exploitation and precariousness, Anderson explains that immigration requirements boost the demand for a labour force which is flexible, temporary and unprotected. Instead of safeguarding the domestic labour market as policymakers often claim, immigration controls create the ‘ideal worker’ against whom the British benefit dependent—for whom going to work is increasingly a duty—is judged. Indeed, because migrant workers are clustered in dirty, dangerous and difficult jobs, their competitors are not the ‘hard-working family man’ in ‘decent, secure, and honourable’ jobs, but are instead the idle benefit scrounger. Immigration rules also create ‘ideal citizens’. First, they filter out categories of migrants unsuitable for citizenship. Second, as the route to naturalization is increasingly predicated upon a ‘thick’ or ‘substantial’ idea of citizenship, as opposed to a formal one, applicants are required to attest their qualities as ‘good citizens’ and to subscribe to British values. By requiring new citizens to fulfil conditions that are not mandatory for British-born citizens, naturalization requirements uphold the idea of ‘super citizens’. Even when citizenship is attained, Anderson argues that naturalized citizens are required to prove themselves continually, for citizenship is not equal to ‘Britishness’.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 deals with immigration enforcement. The first part addresses the thorny issue of terminology. Anderson consciously adopts the politically incorrect notion of ‘illegal’ to refer to immigrants without legal status. While acknowledging that the binary legal/illegal oversimplifies a reality which is much more complicated—particularly because of the phenomenon of what she and Martin Ruhs call ‘semi-compliance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1362480613494287">Ruhs and Anderson, 2010</xref>)—she defends her choice of wording because the reference to ‘illegal’ tell us more about the law than about the migrant labelled as such. While I agree with Anderson on this, it seems that the categories of ‘illegal’ and ‘criminal’ are used here as alternative words which are not entirely accurate. Although such distinction is increasingly tenuous given the extensive criminalization of immigration norms, being in breach of immigration rules is different from committing a criminal offence. The substantive part of this chapter addresses when and against whom immigration norms are enforced. As with immigration law in general, formal categories differ from substantive ones. It is the irregularities of the poor coming from poor countries that immigration enforcement generally targets. While breaches to visa conditions are frequent and generalized, those who are more easily imagined as ‘illegal’ and heavily policed are more likely to be found in breach. But immigration enforcement—most notably deportation—is not just about ‘them’, it affects citizens as well. The emphasis on in-country immigration enforcement in the last decade means that these controls are closer to home, and enforcement is more visible, affecting ‘us’ all. While this expansion has the potential to undermine the credibility of the UK Border Agency, as Anderson argues, past experience suggests that public disquiet about immigration controls have usually stopped when those affected by them were ‘third parties’ and did not extend to the main targets of those controls—the migrant. On the face of it, the prospect that more intrusive controls over ‘us’ will result in mounting criticism over immigration enforcement seems slim.</p>
<p>While immigration enforcement against ‘illegal’ migrants is ethically contested and reveals the limits of liberal values, the British government has recently appealed to its potential for protecting victims of sexual and labour exploitation as a means of legitimization. Chapter 7 accordingly explores the tensions stemming from using immigration laws to protect trafficking victims. First, the ‘victim of trafficking’ is constructed narrowly arguably because the consequence of recognizing someone as victim is granting him/her some form of ‘immigration reward’. Second, and most importantly, the staging of the state as rights protector obscures its role in creating relations of domination and setting the grounds for exploitation. Anderson also argues that debates around trafficking leave unchallenged the liberal fiction of disembodiment and the sharp distinction between forced and free labour, thereby portraying Britain as a space of freedom and equality where foreign, regressive forms of domination have no place.</p>
<p>The final chapter explores domestic work, particularly the worker visas of the au pair and domestic worker. It examines the gendered and racialized nature of domestic work, and how immigration controls shape the demand for foreigners. Anderson points to the paradox that ‘[g]iven the importance of the work of making homes to the production of nationhood, it is interesting that domestic work is … nevertheless considered suitable for non-citizens’ (p. 165). The rise and fall of the visas for domestic work reveals the difficulties in defining this work as ‘employment’ and fitting it within the immigration regime. This chapter also revisits earlier ideas in the book about labour migration (in terms of the exploitative relations resulting from stricter immigration regulation and deregulation of labour) and trafficking (concerning how hosting families conceptualize themselves as care givers ‘helping’ and ‘rescuing’ poor, vulnerable youth).</p>
<p>By unpacking categories and interrogating dichotomies, Anderson exposes historical and conceptual continuities in the portrayal of the ‘other’ and finds that immigration politics is not only about immigration policies. For me, the book invites many questions, most notably how one starts picking up the pieces after this work of deconstruction: in particular, what is morally and politically acceptable in immigration controls? Can they be justified at all? Are liberal values, such as equality and personal integrity, still helpful for preventing suffering, unfairness and discrimination, or are they instrumental for their perpetuation? Is the recognition of universal human rights compatible with a distinction between ‘us’ and ‘them’? My second comment is related to the focus on Britain. Although immigration flows and their controls necessarily evoke its international dimension, such aspects rarely appear in Anderson’s analysis. Migration controls emerged as a population technique in medieval England and evolved alongside the formation of modern Britain as it gained control over its territory and population, expanding further afield with the Empire. Hence it is an analysis that remained state-centred. The origins, the evolution and the consequences of immigration controls, are not only ring fenced within national boundaries, but also within a particular geo-political space—the British Isles. As such, it runs counter to current claims about legal convergence and global governance in the field and prompts questions about the impact globalization has on how states exercise their sovereign powers both at home and abroad (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1362480613494287">Aas, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1362480613494287">Dauvergne, 2008</xref>). Finally, Anderson draws parallels between the ‘migrant’ and the ‘criminal’, and on how immigration laws and politics mirror crime control ones. This, for me, raises the question of whether both fields are akin. It is also a reminder of the advantages of criminology to understand and resist state punitive powers. Issues such as the social construction of ‘illegality’, the ‘criminogenic’ effects of immigration controls and the discretionary exercise of state powers are all too familiar within criminology, and its longstanding tradition of scrutinizing state prerogatives to punish should shed light on the renewed state enthusiasm to force immobility.</p>
