<abstract>
<p>Functional behavior analytic approaches have been demonstrated to be widely applicable and efficacious. While interventions have typically focused on children and individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities, behavior analytic principles have a great deal to offer to conceptualizations of psychopathology in other populations. This manuscript describes a case of an adolescent with oppositional symptoms treated using a functional behavior analytic intervention. Following an 8-week course of treatment, the client experienced improvements in the areas of academic and social functioning. Findings suggest that a functional behavior analytic perspective may have a great deal to offer to treatment of adolescents.</p>

<title>1 Theoretical and Research Basis for Treatment</title>
<p>Functional behavior analysis aims to explicate contingencies maintaining undesirable behavior and uses these to modify the likelihood of its occurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534650113491310">Hanley, Iwata, &amp; McCord, 2003</xref>). From this perspective, behaviors may be conceptualized as occurring in the context of their antecedents (preceding stimuli) and consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534650113491310">Barnhill, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534650113491310">Harvey, Luiselli, &amp; Wong, 2009</xref>). Behaviors may appear different but serve the same function, acting as members of the same response class and being maintained by similar contingencies. Typically, antecedent stimuli signaling the availability of a consequence (discriminative stimuli; SDs) and increasing consequence effectiveness (establishing operations; EOs) have been considered in functional analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534650113491310">Beavers, Iwata, &amp; Lerman, 2013</xref>). Antecedents decreasing the effectiveness of a consequence, termed <italic>abolishing operation</italic>s (AOs), may also be manipulated to shape behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534650113491310">Michael, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Consequences altering the chances of subsequent behavior are thought of as reinforcers or punishers. Reinforcers increase the probability of a behavior occurring, whereas punishers diminish it. Positive reinforcement and punishment describe the introduction of a new stimulus, and negative reinforcement and punishment characterize stimulus removal. For example, if the introduction of electric shock decreased the probability of movement, shock would be considered a positive punisher. Similarly a decrease in a teenager’s misbehavior following the removal of a privilege, such as a cellphone, would fall in the category of negative punishment.</p>
<p>Behavioral principles are used in functional behavior assessments (FBAs) to identify the function and maintain contingencies of problematic behaviors. Although these are not all encompassing, behavioral difficulties commonly serve functions of escape, sensory reinforcement, attention seeking, and obtaining tangible rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534650113491310">Carr, 1994</xref>). FBAs have been emphasized in federal law as a means to address challenging behaviors and have been widely used within public schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534650113491310">Fox &amp; Davis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534650113491310">Scott, Alter, &amp; McQuillan, 2010</xref>). Key components of FBAs constitute obtaining a measureable definition of undesirable behavior, explication of maintaining antecedents and consequences, identification of function, development of a functionally similar adaptive replacement behavior, and manipulation of contingencies to shape replacement behavior occurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534650113491310">Scott et al., 2010</xref>). Interviews, questionnaires, environmental modifications, and behavioral observations may be used to determine the relevant maintaining factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534650113491310">Shriver, Anderson, &amp; Proctor, 2001</xref>). Resultant behavioral interventions frequently require changes within the school setting; teacher and administrator cooperation is crucial to ensuring successful implementation given demands on staff resources.</p>

<title>2 Case Introduction</title>
<p>“Joe” was a 16-year-old Caucasian Latino male referred to the behavioral consultant by a public high school located within the Southeastern United States. School administrators were concerned about Joe’s oppositional behavior, which culminated in Joe allegedly threatening to kill one of his teachers. Joe had been drawing during class, leading his teacher to ask Joe to stop. Joe refused and was sent to the principal’s office. The principal contacted Joe’s mother and sent Joe to speak with the school counselor. During this discussion, Joe reportedly communicated that, if his teacher continued to enforce classroom rules, Joe would shoot her and bury her in his backyard. This threatening statement required more extensive disciplinary action within the school district. Joe attended a district disciplinary hearing to discuss his statement. During the hearing, it was determined that Joe did not have access to a gun or truly intend to harm his teacher. School administrators remained concerned about Joe’s oppositional behavior and requested a behavioral consultation to help address this issue.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1534650113491310">
<title>3 Presenting Complaints</title>
<p>Although Joe’s threat regarding his teacher had been the most troubling incident for school administrators, other problems had previously occurred. Teachers reported that Joe would frequently draw in class and “was defiant” in interactions with adults. Joe had been sent to the school counselor a number of times following these incidents and discussed his drawings as representations of demonic symbols. Furthermore, Joe described to the school counselor demonological rituals during which he had engaged in bloodletting and sexual activity with others. School administrators were seeking to eliminate Joe’s creation of demonic drawings and threats against school staff, and to increase respectful nonverbal behavior and completion of academic work. The school counselor further requested that the consultant determine the level of threat Joe posed to other students, particularly those who could be considered “victim children.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1534650113491310">
<title>4 History</title>
<p>Joe’s mother had been a mistress of a high-ranking military official in Latin America, allowing him to enjoy financial benefits of his father’s position, but not social acceptance. Joe grew up in South America, moving with his mother to a large city in the Southeastern United States approximately 2 years before the intervention. Six months prior to consultation, Joe and his mother relocated to a small rural Southern town. Although Joe was fluent in English due to a boarding school education, he experienced a number of cultural differences with immigration.</p>
<p>Joe reported feeling he was of a lower socioeconomic status (SES) after relocation. His prior experiences with academic behavioral norms diverged greatly from his current school’s expectations. Behaviors considered to be in violation of school discipline were more stringent and often related to locally normative forms of dress and communication. For instance, dress code violations (e.g., not having a shirt tucked in) could result in suspension, and Joe’s current school used corporal punishment (e.g., “paddling”). Adults were to be addressed as “Sir” or “Ma’am” and failure to use these ways of speaking was negatively perceived, per Joe’s report. These behaviors were not heavily emphasized in either South America or the urban school Joe previously attended, and he found the new rules frustrating and difficult to follow. In addition to feeling at odds with the adults and social norms of his current school, Joe struggled to find a social group. Joe enjoyed listening to heavy metal and metalcore music, which was not popular among most of his peers who preferred country and popular music. Despite these differences and Joe’s interest in drawing during class, his grades had been primarily As, Bs, and Cs.</p>
<p>Prior to intervention, school staff attempted to decrease Joes undesirable behaviors by negative descriptions in phone calls home to his mother, placing him in in-school suspension (ISS), a disciplinary hearing, and not asking Joe to do any work. With the exception of being excused from doing schoolwork, these interventions did not influence Joe’s behavior. When excused from doing work, Joe spent time creating nondemonic drawings in ISS. He had not received prior psychological or psychiatric interventions and had not been taking medications.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1534650113491310">
<title>5 Assessment</title>
<p>School administrators requested a FBA following Joe’s disciplinary hearing. Although Joe was determined not to pose a serious threat to his teacher, administrators were concerned about escalation of his oppositional behavior. Interviews were conducted with Joe’s teachers, his school counselor, school administrators, and Joe. Unfortunately, Joe’s mother was unable to provide information due to a lack of facility with English and absence of a Spanish translator in the rural area. Although she was reported to have limited understanding of English phrases, she found speaking English challenging and did not feel comfortable speaking with the consultant. Joe’s teachers described a number of initial behaviors perceived as disrespectful following Joe’s arrival at school. These included insufficient verbal and nonverbal expressions of guilt when given feedback on breaking social norms, failure to consistently use respectful “Sir” and “Ma’am” phrases, and drawing in class. Teachers reported that they provided negative verbal feedback and referred Joe to the school counselor in an attempt to decrease these behaviors.</p>
<p>School counselor records indicated that the problem behaviors increased in intensity and frequency over time. As Joe saw his counselor, he began to draw “demonic” symbols and provide descriptions of past participation in demonological rituals involving sex and bloodletting to his school counselor. Following these behaviors, Joe received more frequent negative verbal feedback from administrators and more sessions with the school counselor. The behaviors culminated in the disciplinary hearing, when Joe had threatened to murder a teacher. After this event, Joe was excused from doing any academic work and began to spend his time drawing in ISS. Observations of Joe within ISS did not evidence defiant or oppositional behavior. Joe could not be observed within an unstructured environment because school administrators did not wish to have Joe interact with other students without close supervision.</p>
<p>An interview was conducted with Joe. Although Joe initially refused to speak with the consultant, he was more open during the second meeting. Joe expressed frustration with his teachers, administrators, and the school counselor. He felt that the school was against him and that he disliked the school counselor’s use of alternative intervention strategies (e.g., visualizing a colorful “healing mist” to deal with negative emotions). Joe communicated that he enjoyed “messing with” the adults at school and that this was his favorite hobby other than drawing. In conjunction with reports from school staff, Joe’s oppositional behavior was determined to serve the primary function of obtaining adult attention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1534650113491310">
<title>6 Case Conceptualization</title>
<p>The case was conceptualized from a behavior analytic perspective, focusing on determining the function of Joe’s undesirable behaviors. Joe’s problematic behaviors included discussing socially deviant topics, threatening his teacher, and noncompliance with school staff requests. Negative feedback appeared to increase behavioral problems and Joe reported that he enjoyed getting others upset. Although Joe’s difficulties appeared topographically distinct, they responded to similar contingencies (e.g., increasing with adult attention) and were hypothesized to be members of the same response class. Joe discussed feeling culturally at odds with teachers and classmates at his current school. He struggled to find a peer group and had found his social interactions were limited. Joe’s socially deviant behaviors may have emerged as a means to obtain social contact. It was hypothesized that providing Joe with an appropriate alternative means to obtain attention, combined with a lack of attention to inappropriate behavior, would decrease deviant attention seeking. Given the increased occurrence of undesirable behavior in the presence of Joe’s school counselor, her presence was conceptualized as an SD signaling the availability of negative attention. Due to this stimulus function, other adults were used to shape normative social communication.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1534650113491310">
<title>7 Course of Treatment and Assessment of Progress</title>
<p>Joe was provided with an alternative means to obtain adult attention, to decrease the occurrence of socially deviant behavior. Initially, the consultant evoked appropriate social behavior by noticing that Joe was wearing a T-shirt from a popular metalcore band and discussing a shared interest in this genre. As the discussion shifted toward Joe’s hobbies and away from his interest in manipulating others, his communicative repertoire changed. While Joe was discussing his ability to “mess with” adults there was little fluctuation in facial expression and vocal tone. The flat and invariable nonverbal behavior and discussion of nonadaptive topics were conceptualized as members of the socially deviant repertoire. After conversation shifted to Joe’s interests, his features became animated and his tone increased in variability. These behaviors constituted the socially appropriate communicative repertoire. As Joe shifted back and forth between these two broad patterns of behavior, the consultant differentially attended to the socially appropriate repertoire. As the adaptive repertoire became fairly stable with the consultant (after the first three meetings), the intervention focused on generalizing this response style to other contexts. A teacher identified as a potential source of support and an assistant principal were instructed in the shaping process. The teacher began to check in with Joe and attend to his normal social discussions. As the school counselor had served as a SD for negative attention, disciplinary interactions were shifted to the assistant principal and the school counselor was directed to decrease reinforcement of deviant behavior.</p>
<p>Over the course of treatment, Joe’s teachers were directed to record instances of socially deviant behaviors (e.g., discussions of demons, demonic drawings, refusal to complete work). Joe ceased discussing demonic rituals and creating demonic drawings. Joe asked the school administrators to allow him to complete the work he had missed over the course of the year and spent extra time after school working on these assignments. Joe was able to return to the classroom, behave normally, and successfully complete his schoolwork. Joe continued to receive positive attention from an identified mentor teacher for appropriate interactions. It was concluded that Joe’s behavior had served the function of obtaining adult attention and that providing him a socially adaptive replacement behavior with which to obtain attention was an effective intervention.</p>
<p>Assessment of treatment progress was limited by the extent to which school staff were able to record Joe’s behaviors. Teachers agreed to record instances of discussions of demons, creation of demonic drawings, and work refusal. After meetings with the consultant, identification of a mentor teacher, and ceasing meetings with the school counselor were implemented, undesirable behaviors did not occur. Ideally, daily records of both undesirable and adaptive behaviors would have been most desirable. However, limited teacher to student ratio, as well as many of Joe’s teachers having multiple students with academic or behavioral difficulties made it challenging for teachers to focus solely on Joe.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1534650113491310">
<title>8 Complicating Factors</title>
<p>Although Joe’s mother could understand some English (enough to understand that school feedback on Joe’s behavior was negative), her ability to communicate with the behavioral consultant and school administrators was extremely limited. A translator was unavailable in this rural school system and parent report information on Joe’s behavior at home and in prior education settings could not be obtained. Joe experienced a number of cultural differences after moving to his current environment. Sociocultural mismatch complicated Joe’s interactions with the school environment and school administrators’ perceptions of him. While some of Joe’s initial behaviors would have been normative in Latin America, they were perceived as disrespectful in a small rural Southeastern town.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1534650113491310">
<title>9 Access and Barriers to Care</title>
<p>Implementation of evidence-based interventions within the school system is strongly influenced by administrator and teacher support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534650113491310">Berkout, Kim, Gross, &amp; Young, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534650113491310">Forman, Olin, Hoagwood, Crowe, &amp; Saka, 2009</xref>). School staff viewed behavioral problems as resulting primarily from inadequate discipline and focused on addressing issues through taking away privileges and providing consequences they believed to be undesirable. Staff believed that being chastised, negative phone calls home, suspension, and corporal punishment were effective intervention strategies for bothersome conduct. Corporal punishment was common among schools in the area and generally accepted by local families. Parents would sometimes request that school administrators provide more intensive corporal punishment, in response to being contacted with concerns over youth behavioral problems. Disciplinary practices reflected a focus on punishing misbehavior, rather than reinforcement of appropriate behavior. Using limited resources to shape the behavior of a problematic student was at odds with the school culture.</p>
<p>A great deal of emphasis was placed on social relationships within the school system. Staff would send holiday cards, spend time discussing family and recreational activities, and emphasize respecting the wisdom of experienced school employees. Teachers made an effort to converse with students and include them in social interactions. Joe’s behaviors placed him at odds with administrators and teachers. Negative relationships with these individuals had to be addressed, as they were largely responsible for implementing Joe’s treatment.</p>
<p>The consultant focused on social strategies to help obtain school staff cooperation. Some work in this area had been done prior to Joe’s specific case. The consultant spent time learning about and participating in the school’s social network. She took time to speak with teachers and administrators whenever she was called into the school, making herself an appetitive stimulus. When addressing Joe’s case, she allowed staff to vent their frustration and validated the challenge of working with a youth they did not understand. The consultant provided psychoeducation on Latin American cultural differences and rewarded intervention-consistent behaviors by staff (e.g., emailing the principal commending a teacher for attending to Joe’s normative conversation). Staff experience was considered when formulating the intervention: The principal was asked to identify potential support teachers for Joe and teachers were queried about behaviors they considered particularly aberrant. Including these individuals in the formulation helped increase the likelihood the intervention would be implemented (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534650113491310">Kataoka, Rowan, &amp; Hoagwood, 2009</xref>, for a discussion).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1534650113491310">
<title>10 Follow-Up</title>
<p>Joe’s case was followed for several months, during which administrators and teachers reported socially appropriate behavior and completion of schoolwork. After several months, Joe moved back to South America and further follow-up could not be conducted. However, it should be noted that following implementation of this intervention, school staff did not report additional instances of socially deviant verbal behavior, threats, or demonic drawings. More extensive assessment of Joe’s difficulties (e.g., standardized teacher and parent report forms) would have been beneficial but was not feasible given the context within which the intervention was implemented.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1534650113491310">
<title>11 Treatment Implications of the Case</title>
<p>Given the empirical database supporting use of contingency management to modify behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534650113491310">Shriver et al., 2001</xref>), application of this perspective may be beneficial in a number of populations. Historically, contingency management strategies have commonly focused on treating individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities (ID/DD), autism spectrum disorders (ASD), youth externalizing, and other cognitive difficulties (e.g., dementia). However, consideration of function has been used to conceptualize more diverse behavioral problems, for instance, maladaptive eating behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534650113491310">Wedig &amp; Nock, 2010</xref>) and personality pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534650113491310">Koerner, Kohlenberg, &amp; Parker, 1996</xref>). As noted by dissemination and implementation researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534650113491310">Rogers, 2003</xref>), the social culture and infrastructure within which a treatment is provided has tremendous impact on its success. Developers of school-based interventions report that teacher, administrator, and staff support play a major role in implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534650113491310">Forman et al., 2009</xref>). In our experience, building and maintaining social relationship with school staff was key in engendering willingness to work with an oppositional youth. We believe that consideration of social relationships and culture within systems of care is of paramount importance to treatment acceptance and implementation.</p>
<p>Cultural considerations play a major role in case conceptualization and treatment. Behavioral function and appropriateness is perceived through the perspective of the assessor and the influence of culture may be particularly difficult to recognize within an ethnically homogeneous setting. Joe’s initial problems arose from cultural misunderstanding and alienation from adults and peers around him. Efforts to recognize, validate, and work with the experiences of immigrants and minority students may decrease the likelihood of these complications.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1534650113491310">
<title>12 Recommendations to Clinicians and Students</title>
<p>Joe’s case illustrates the broad utility of behavior analytic principles and the importance of context in shaping behavior. Behavior analysis is flexible in its application and may be used to conceptualize any behavioral difficulty in relation to context and function. Clinicians can apply basic principles of operant conditioning to any behavior of any organism. Although humans vary in temperament and learning history, current behavioral repertoires may still be conceptualized and influenced using behavioral principles. A clinician need not identify primarily as a behaviorist to make use of the tools of functional behavior analysis. Consideration of behaviors in relation to context and function has been incorporated into other evidence-based approaches, including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534650113491310">Linehan’s (1993)</xref> Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534650113491310">Hayes, Strosahl, and Wilson’s (2012)</xref> Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). These techniques may easily be used within the traditional cognitive behavioral approach to conceptualize the maladaptive cognitions and behavioral repertoires.</p>
<p>Interventions are often applied within systems of care. Whether these are primary care settings or public school systems, organizations usually have a set of norms and parameters to which an intervention must adhere. Learning cultural norms of an organization and working to build social relationships with staff can greatly influence success of an intervention. Clinicians may spend time briefly talking with staff about social matters, express empathy, and ask for input when formulating treatments. Although interventions must be supported by empirical evidence, there are often minor modifications that can make these appear more congruent with an organization’s culture. Whenever possible, clinicians should take organizational norms into account.</p>
<p>Cultural influences must be considered in case conceptualization, diagnosis, assessment, and intervention. Social norms and cultural beliefs shape repertoires conceptualized as normative or deviant. Immigrants, disenfranchised clients, and other individuals differing from dominant cultural perspectives may behave in a manner that seems out of sync and pathological. Clinicians should take steps to educate themselves on the cultural background and norms of their client’s culture. Consultation with more experienced colleagues and perusal of relevant literature may broaden cultural perspectives. Openness to and discussion of cultural issues with clients can lead to productive discussions of cultural differences and misunderstandings. Consideration of these issues will ensure that clinicians are providing culturally competent services and meeting mental health needs of individuals from diverse backgrounds.</p>
