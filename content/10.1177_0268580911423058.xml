<abstract>
<p>Drawing on an analysis of negotiations between the Colombian government and international donors over Colombia’s Poverty and Inequality Reduction Strategy, this article describes the normative, institutional and technical patterns that configure a political governance structure within the international cooperation and development system. The article argues that this structure works as an interface that integrates global governance processes aimed at the regulation of global risks (e.g. poverty and inequality) into national political systems in aid-receiving countries. This case study suggests that the shape of this governance structure leads to a form of ‘agreed violation’ of sovereignty that can be defined and analysed as an instance of the ‘emergent formations of multi-scalar globalization’, to which the sociology of globalization refers. However, this interpretation necessitates a fine-tuning of the sociology of globalization’s understanding of governance, which is discussed in this article.</p>

<p>A partir de un análisis de las negociaciones entre el gobierno colombiano y los donantes internacionales sobre la estrategia colombiana para la reducción de la desigualdad y la pobreza, este artículo describe las pautas normativas, institucionales y técnicas que configuran la estructura de la gobernanza política dentro del sistema internacional de cooperación al desarrollo.

Este estudio de caso sugiere que la configuración de la estructura de gobernanza conduce a una forma de “violación acordada” de la soberanía que puede ser definida y analizada como un caso de las “formas emergentes de globalización multi-escalar”, a las que se refiere la sociología de la globalización. No obstante, esta interpretación necesita un conocimiento más preciso de la gobernanza por la sociología de la globalización, cuestión que es discutida en este artículo.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Saskia Sassen has synthesized a research agenda in the field of sociology of globalization that takes ‘emergent formations of multi-scalar globalization’ as its core object of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0268580911423058">Sassen, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0268580911423058">2010</xref>). This term refers to processes wherein the global enters into the national by means of negotiation processes between international agents and government authorities at the national level. To the extent that these processes are aimed at the production of a state’s response to the regulatory requirements of both the international agents and the global flows linked to their action models, we witness the emergence of ‘new legalities’ that reconfigure the internal power distribution of state authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0268580911423058">Sassen, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0268580911423058">2007</xref>). Thus, these processes partially redefine and specialize some regulatory functions of the state, the main outcomes of which are ‘de-nationalized’ territories and institutional spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0268580911423058">Sassen, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0268580911423058">2010</xref>). It is worth noting that Sassen’s de-nationalization approach diverges from the ‘growing interdependence’ approach to the study of globalization in that her interest is to study the imbrications of the global and the national at the national scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0268580911423058">Sassen, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>These de-nationalized spaces and new legalities include a number of features that suggest they are governance structures. First, they are an outcome of negotiation processes between national governmental authorities and agents external to the political system. Second, they are aimed at solving problems of regulation and coordination between these agents. Third, one of their final outcomes is the redistribution of state authority.</p>
<p>In the literature on the sociology of globalization, the term governance refers to the emergent problems of regulation and coordination that arise from global flows and their effects on or integration within national or local contexts. In this literature, we find references to phenomena such as global governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0268580911423058">Castells, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0268580911423058">Nash, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0268580911423058">Sassen, 2003</xref>), urban governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0268580911423058">Brenner, 2004</xref>), local governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0268580911423058">Denis and Kalekin-Fishman, 2009</xref>) or Internet governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0268580911423058">Sassen, 2007</xref>). Despite frequent use of this term, there is no agreed definition of governance within the sociology of globalization literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0268580911423058">Ansell, 2007</xref>). Instead, this literature implicitly builds upon definitions developed in analyses of corporate organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0268580911423058">Aoki, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0268580911423058">Williamson, 1996</xref>) or in the analysis of self-governance processes occurring outside the national political system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0268580911423058">Ostrom, 1990</xref>). A typical usage involves a reworking or combination of these definitions with the concept of networks, found in economic sociology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0268580911423058">Brinton and Nee, 1998</xref>), or with the organizational culture concept, found in the sociology of organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0268580911423058">Lawrence et al., 2009</xref>). The lack of an agreed definition of governance in the literature on the sociology of globalization is particularly problematic when new objects for empirical analysis using this theoretical perspective are identified.</p>
<p>This article analyses one issue not previously studied from the sociology of globalization perspective: official development aid flows that are part of the system of international cooperation and development (the ICD system) or international development regime. I argue that the ICD system could be conceptualized as an instance of the emergent formations of multi-scalar globalization. However, this conceptualization requires that the concept of ‘governance’ be fine-tuned.</p>
<p>The argument is as follows: given interdependence conditions that engender new global risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0268580911423058">Beck, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0268580911423058">Giddens, 1999</xref>) and a sovereignty principle that still functions as barrier to global agents’ entry within the national political system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0268580911423058">Krasner, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0268580911423058">Sassen, 1996</xref>), the ICD system specializes in the production of coordination and negotiation processes between international donors<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0268580911423058">1</xref></sup> and domestic government authorities aimed at the configuration of regulatory structures of these risks. However, the analysis of the international development regime in the sociology of globalization perspective requires a reworking of the concept of governance in order to appropriately characterize the resulting regulatory structures as political governance structures. Therefore, in order to explain both how these regulatory structures emerge as global formations and become institutionalized at the national level and their effect on state authority and the functioning of the government, I analyse these negotiation processes.</p>
<p>My research strategy is based on the case study method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0268580911423058">Mjøset, 2006</xref>). I study negotiations held from 2004 to 2006 between the Colombian government and international donors surrounding the formulation of the first ‘Strategy for Poverty and Inequality Reduction in Colombia 2006–2015’ (hereafter referred to as the Strategy).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0268580911423058">2</xref></sup> This case study enables a focus on the debate about the intervention of global agents in the internal government processes of aid-receiving countries. This issue has been widely debated in the international development literature. Of particular relevance are the criticisms of the ICD system that emerged in the 1990s regarding (1) aid effectiveness; (2) asymmetries in relations between donor and aid-receiving countries, given the differential distribution of power between the two; and (3) the strategic and hegemonic use of these relations and economic flows by donor countries as a means of political intervention to advance their homeland security agendas, thereby violating the aid-receiving countries’ sovereignty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0268580911423058">Edwards, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0268580911423058">Escobar, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0268580911423058">González Chavarría, 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0268580911423058">2008b</xref>).</p>
<p>To advance this debate from a sociology of globalization perspective, it is necessary to take into account the normative, institutional and technical responses of the ICD system to these critiques. These responses involved systemic changes in the ICD system, especially during the period 2000–5. Given these changes and recalling the main argument in this article, I explore three questions. First, how has the ICD system changed, and what is the structure and the dynamics of the negotiations between international donors and the domestic governments of the aid-receiving countries? Second, how and to what extent can the outcomes of this negotiation process be conceptualized as a political governance structure? Third, what is the effect of these negotiation processes upon governmental function, that is, upon the distribution of state authority?</p>
<p>I begin the analysis with a general overview of the processes through which the Strategy was formulated. I highlight the main structural elements that framed the negotiation process in terms of the normative, institutional and technical changes in the ICD system and also in terms of the legal framework in Colombia that regulates this type of negotiation. I identify the main actors involved and their interests in the negotiation process. I delimit the main patterns found in the intergovernmental coordination mechanism and the resulting governance structure. I then argue that the ICD system is an instance of emergent formations of multi-scalar globalization and that, as such, its analysis necessitates a refinement of the concept of governance, as found in the sociology of globalization literature. I conclude by stressing the main effects of these patterns upon the functioning of the Colombian government and by proposing some avenues for future research.</p>
<p>To the extent that the bilateral and multilateral agents considered in this study, and in general all OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries, have donor-like relations with multiple aid-receiving states within the ICD system, I hope that the Colombian case serves to delimit the patterns and parameters that can be used in the comparative analysis of the integration processes of global flows linked to the international development regime with the national government processes in the aid-receiving countries. Therefore, I hope to advance the research agenda proposed for the sociology of globalization in widening the empirical scope of this analytic framework and by exploring some specific conceptual improvements entailed in the analysis of this new empirical object.</p>

<title>The mission for the formulation of the Strategy</title>
<sec id="section3-0268580911423058">
<title>General overview</title>
<p>During President Uribe’s first term (2002–6), his administration undertook the Mission for the formulation of the Strategy in an effort to institutionalize the dynamics of the ICD system within the Colombian political system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0268580911423058">Presidencia et al., 2005</xref>). The main objective was to produce in-depth studies of the determinants of poverty and inequality in Colombia, and also to examine the role of the public and private sectors within the given institutional framework in order to propose and construct a far-reaching policy for poverty reduction in Colombia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0268580911423058">Presidencia, 2004</xref>: Art. 1).</p>
<p>The Mission’s governance structure included a Consultative Council and a Technical Committee. Functional dependence analysis shows the workload distribution between these two groups. The Technical Committee was charged with giving expert advice to the Consultative Council on the designation of areas of investigation for the studies that were to be carried out to aid the formulation of the Strategy. Upon receiving and evaluating the recommendations of the Technical Committee, the Consultative Council was charged with coordinating these studies. The Council was also charged with approving the final report on the Strategy.</p>
<p>The Mission presupposed a series of allies, both internal and external. Internal allies included some sectors of the Colombian civil society (academia, NGOs, labour unions), economic agents (enterprise unions, financial institutions, banks) and political agents (parties and political representatives). External allies comprised the International Development Bank (IDB), the World Bank (WB), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the British Department for International Development, the Korean Fund, the Swiss Fund, the Finnish Fund and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).</p>
<p>It is worth noting that, with the exception of enterprise unions and labour unions, internal allies were not represented in either the Technical Committee or the Consultative Council. The international donor community played a major role in the Technical Committee: four out of nine members of the Committee were representatives of international donor agencies. However, only one of the 14 members of the Consultative Council represented an international organization, but this organization was not among the international donors participating in the Mission. This distribution of agents had an important effect upon the distribution of roles and responsibilities for the decision-making process, as the Technical Committee was granted a greater decision-making power regarding the formulation of the Strategy.</p>

<title>Normative and institutional change of the ICD system</title>
<p>In response to the critiques raised in the 1990s, a series of international conferences and summits leading to the formulation of an agenda of normative and institutional change of the ICD system took place between 2000 and 2005. Normative changes included the integration of human development and sustainable development perspectives into the agenda of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which encompassed the main set of global risks identified by the international community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0268580911423058">PNUD, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0268580911423058">UN, 2000</xref>). Institutional change was synthesized (1) in the specification of the relation between the ICD system and the MDGs in terms of the financing for development and (2) in the points of agreement about aid harmonization found in the Rome Declaration of 2003 and about aid effectiveness found in the Paris Declaration of 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0268580911423058">DAC, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0268580911423058">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0268580911423058">ONU, 2002</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0268580911423058">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The signatories of the Paris Declaration engaged in working around a core set of strategic principles of ‘harmonization’ of the relations between donors and aid-receiving countries. These principles aimed at improving the efficiency of development aid and at the attainment of the MDGs. In what follows, I briefly describe this set of formal principles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0268580911423058">4</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Coherence</italic> refers to the need for horizontal harmonization of the development policies and financing plans among the donor states, aimed at avoiding the duplication of efforts. This includes the simplification of the bilateral and multilateral channels of cooperation and of donors’ institutional procedures for the collaboration and alignment of priorities, systems and procedures with aid-receiving countries.</p>
<p><italic>Coordination</italic> refers to the need to align the priorities of the donors with national-level development strategies. This leads to an emphasis on the importance of strengthening national development strategies, operative frameworks and institutional capacity in the aid-receiving countries. It also highlights the need for direct financing of the state’s budget and technical aid in planning and evaluating the performance of national development policies.</p>
<p><italic>Co-responsibility</italic> refers to the active participation the donors seek in the process of diagnosis, analysis and appropriation of the development problem. It also refers to their effort to exceed the role of mere financers and play a larger political role in addressing the development problem at the national level in the aid-receiving countries.</p>
<p><italic>Partnership for development</italic> indicates a conception of cooperation relations between donors and aid-receiving countries as a society within which each actor shares the risks, obligations and benefits from cooperation. It is meant to reconfigure the asymmetric relationship between donors and aid-receiving countries.</p>
<p><italic>Technical standardization</italic> refers to the standardization of the evaluation instruments and accountability procedures used in international cooperation processes. These instruments include a series of planning and monitoring methods that allow for the evaluation of plans, programmes and project implementation. The most important trend is towards the standardization of these instruments as part of a new legal framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0268580911423058">Sassen, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0268580911423058">2007</xref>) specific to the ICD system.</p>
<p>These are the normative, institutional and technical principles that configure the intergovernmental mechanisms within the ICD system. At first glance, these principles are postulated to improve the effectiveness of aid, to redefine the asymmetric relations between donors, aid-receiving countries and the ultimate beneficiaries of the aid flows and to respond to critiques highlighting the role of aid in violating state sovereignty.</p>
<p>However, the institutionalization of these principles in aid-receiving countries depends on the configuration of an interface between the national political system and the global flows of development aid to regulate these cooperative relationships at the national level. Therefore, it is necessary to analyse the legal framework of international cooperation as part of the structural determinants of the development aid flows in Colombia. It is at this point that sovereignty redefines itself to generate the necessary interface for the integration of these global flows into the political system and the institutional structure of the Colombian state, thereby affecting the exercise of the governmental function at the national level.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0268580911423058">
<title>Legal framework of international cooperation in Colombia</title>
<p>Colombia ratified both the 1969 and the 1986 Vienna Conventions, which regulate the signing of treaties between states and the constitution of contracts between states and international organizations or between international organizations themselves. International agreements or covenants constituted as contracts between the Colombian state and international donors are subject to these instruments of international law. Article 27 of the 1969 Vienna Convention states that once an international treaty is signed and ratified by a participant state, this state cannot invoke internal legislation as an excuse for non-compliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0268580911423058">Congreso, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0268580911423058">1997</xref>).</p>
<p>At the national level, the most important norm structuring this regulatory framework is Article 62 of the Colombian Political Constitution, which states the obligation of respecting the will of the donors. This norm is meant as a guarantee to the donors that the resources they transfer will be used for ‘the attainment of the objectives approved by them’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0268580911423058">Acción Social, 2008</xref>: 53).</p>
<p>Further, the resources of international cooperation are subject to a special regulation that states, ‘the contracts financed with resources of the multilateral credit institutions or signed with foreign persons of public law or with cooperation organizations . . . can be subject to the internal regulation of such entities in all aspects regarding formation procedures, assignment and special clauses of execution, fulfilment, payment and adjustment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0268580911423058">Congreso, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>This explains why one of the most frequent requests on the part of donors is ‘to apply their contracting rules, procedures and norms in the execution of the non-reimbursable cooperation resources allotted by them’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0268580911423058">Acción Social, 2008</xref>: 57, 71). Hence, the cooperation covenants include the donors’ own principles, rules and procedures that will become the basis for establishing the contracts for the use of donations. Contracts become frameworks of a special character that express the will of the donors, which are subject to constitutional protection and mandatory compliance on the part of the Colombian state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0268580911423058">Acción Social, 2008</xref>: 59s).</p>
<p>On the one hand, the will of the donors is forged following the normative, institutional and technical changes of the ICD system and its functional definition in terms of global risks regulation. On the other hand, it is forged according to the foreign policy orientations of each donor country. According to Colombia’s Attorney General’s Office<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0268580911423058">5</xref></sup> to the extent that the donors’ internal regulations incorporate the covenants, agreements and other mechanisms established in multilateral forums and contexts of negotiation, such as the United Nations, these institutional frameworks are legitimate and, therefore, the Columbian state has an obligation to respect them in the frame of international cooperation relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0268580911423058">Acción Social, 2008</xref>: 61).</p>
<p>In summary, both the international cooperation that is enacted by means of international treaties and its execution by means of complementary agreements are regulated by international law, and it is inadmissible ‘in conformity with these international regulations recognized by the Colombian state, to allege dispositions of internal law in order to condition, limit or avoid the compliance with the obligations incurred in such international instruments’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0268580911423058">Acción Social, 2008</xref>: 70).</p>

<title>What is at stake?</title>
<sec id="section8-0268580911423058">
<title>From the donors’ perspective</title>
<p>With regard to the MDGs and the problem of the effectiveness of aid, the donors had two main objectives. The first was to establish a coordinated programming instrument with the Colombian government that allowed them to define how the aid would be used in programmes in the country. Their second objective was to foster at the national level the institutionalization of the normative, institutional and technical changes in the ICD system that had been occurring at the international level since the year 2000.</p>
<p>Bilateral and multilateral donors’ institutional frameworks and action plans incorporate the normative agreements and covenants regarding the management and regulation of global risks and their links with the ICD system that were developed at the global level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0268580911423058">OECD, 2009</xref>). Because the definition of these risks and the regulatory approach to solving them rests on governance structures, the effectiveness of this solution depends on the institutionalization of these structures at the national level. This leads to the need to structure intergovernmental coordination mechanisms that enable the integration of these global governance processes with the governmental function at the state level.</p>

<title>From the Colombian government’s perspective</title>
<p>In establishing the ‘Mission’, the Colombian government’s general objective was to facilitate the use of international aid in solving structural development problems. This objective can be disaggregated into three specific interests: (1) to standardize a technical instrument for the formulation of a far-reaching development policy; (2) to use this instrument in the negotiations for official development aid with bilateral and multilateral donors; and (3) to develop this instrument with political legitimacy and social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0268580911423058">DNP, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>With regard to the first requirement, the Strategy was launched as a programming instrument of a far-reaching development policy in Colombia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0268580911423058">DNP, 2006</xref>: 5). However, because various other institutional and technical instruments exist that the Colombian government could use to formulate such a policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0268580911423058">DNP, 2003</xref>), the Strategy is better explained as the government’s response to constraints imposed by international donors regarding the construction of a shared normative and institutional framework on development policy, focused social expenditure and anticipated contributions of aid flows to Colombia to achieve the MDGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0268580911423058">DNP, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The second requirement refers to the Uribe administration’s orientation towards international cooperation. This government privileged international aid resources as one of the primary sources of financing for its social and poverty reduction policy. This was manifested (1) by a policy of pooling resources with international donors from 2003 to 2007, (2) in the institutionalization of the international cooperation policy as part of the institutional arrangement of the Colombian state and, finally, (3) in the launching of the first public policy on international cooperation in February 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423058">Acción Social, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0268580911423058">Presidencia et al., 2005</xref>: 3, 6).</p>
<p>Lastly, the government tried to fulfil the third requirement by allowing representatives of enterprise unions and labour unions to participate in the Consultative Council. Once again, it is notable that the legitimacy factor is associated with the participation requirements and other normative elements that had been institutionalized in the recent evolution of the ICD system. The Uribe government was constrained to formulate the Strategy in accordance with precise normative, institutional and technical standards that included consultation with social sectors. However, this was not a wide-scale process of consensus building with Colombian civil society.</p>

<title>Global–national interface patterns in the making of the Strategy</title>
<p>During the negotiations around the Strategy, global–national interface patterns in both the Technical Committee and the Consultative Council included normative, institutional and technical dimensions. The main outcome of these negotiations was the configuration of a governance structure that integrated the regulatory dynamics of the ICD system into the functioning of the Colombian government.</p>
<sec id="section11-0268580911423058">
<title>The normative integration pattern</title>
<p>The pattern of normative integration changed the <italic>locus</italic> of politics in the process of the formulation of the Strategy. The political debate at the national level was centred on such technical points as focalization, procedures, coverage, timings, institutional design and other factors related to the implementation of the development and social policy. The core normative consensus concerning the principles of sustainable human development and normative agreements about the attainment of the MDGs had been established previously at the international level. This suggests that these international consensuses and agreements oriented the normative development of the Strategy, which led to the construction of a shared cognitive base among the agents, helped frame the debate and allowed for the symbolic regulation of the potential conflict at the national level that the Strategy could entail.</p>
<p>In general, the bulk of academic studies produced by the Consultative Council supported the international agenda of the Millennium Goals. This suggests a core relation with the national academia as the source of studies and discourses about social problems normatively attached to the international development regime. At the national level, these academic entities were invested with symbolic authority and functioned as a common knowledge base for institutional and political debate in the formulation of the Strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0268580911423058">DNP, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0268580911423058">
<title>The institutional integration pattern</title>
<p>The pattern of institutional integration is established by the legal framework that applies to international cooperation in Colombia. This leads to a fundamental ambiguity because, while respect for state autonomy and sovereignty is a core regulating principle for the cooperation relationships, the constitutional principle of respecting the will of the donors regarding objectives and allocation of the resources is also an accepted principle in this system. Ultimately, the regulatory framework for these relations is based on internal business rules and the institutional regulations of donors, which institutionalizes a mechanism that allows for the ‘agreed violation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0268580911423058">Krasner, 2001</xref>) of Colombian state sovereignty.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0268580911423058">
<title>The technical standardization pattern</title>
<p>Technical standardization is configured by the integration of the technical and methodological institutional procedures of the bilateral and multilateral cooperation agencies with the institutional processes of the government bodies that depend on these financial sources. The outcome here is the standardization of these processes in terms of business rules and technical procedures for programming, follow-up, assessment, evaluation and accountability. It is now customary for donors to define this set of technical and methodological instruments, except in the case of some macro-programming instruments, such as the Strategy itself, the formulation of which depends on intergovernmental coordination processes.</p>
<p>In the Colombian case, the evaluation and accountability instruments that are defined as part of the technical standardization process within the ICD system are the main technical references for the planning, programming and formulation of development projects that seek international financing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0268580911423058">Acción Social, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0268580911423058">DNP 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Multi-scalar globalization and political governance: Points of debate</title>
<p>The flows and processes linked to the dynamics of the ICD system in Colombia can be analysed as an instance of the emergent formations of multi-scalar globalization. First, negotiations include global agents and national governmental authorities. Second, negotiations aim, on the one hand, to address Colombia’s problems with poverty and inequality, which are defined as global risks, and, on the other hand, to coordinate the agendas and action models of the agents attempting to address these problems. Third, the outcome is an institutional interface that establishes the normative, institutional and technical integration of ‘the global inside the nation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0268580911423058">Sassen, 2010</xref>); that is to say, the integration of the global dynamics of the ICD system into the government dynamics of the Colombian political system. The final effect is the redistribution of the Colombian state authority to autonomously formulate the public policy suitable to regulate these problems, which is defined in this analysis as the main effect on the government function.</p>
<p>The analysis to this point has focused on the attributes of this case that allow us to interpret this new legality as a governance structure aimed at regulating Colombia’s poverty and inequality problems through an ‘agreed violation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0268580911423058">Krasner, 2001</xref>) of the Colombian state’s sovereignty. However, the case also shows a number of attributes that distinguish it from the type of objects usually analysed in the sociology of globalization literature. These differences entail specific definitional requirements for analysing this case as an instance of emergent formations of multi-scalar globalization.</p>
<p>First, the normative, institutional and technical interests of the international donors and their relation with an agenda of global risks regulation (MDGs) suggest a clear political profile for these agents. To the extent that the global agents perceive that problems of poverty and inequality are a global risk, that is to say, that they affect their own national interests, they seek to orientate the design of the development policy in the aid-receiving countries according to their own regulatory preferences. This is a distinctive trait because it is not the case of a corporate agent seeking legal protection for its private, corporate interests in order to operate at the national level and having no interest in becoming a political actor within the domestic political system. On the contrary, this trait highlights international donors’ interest in becoming active political actors in the governmental processes of the aid-receiving countries. Finally, to the extent that the resulting regulatory structure has as its main object public and social problems subject to regulation by a national and sovereign political system but with de facto political participation of global agents, this regulatory scheme entails a fuzzy integration of global governance processes with the national political system and the government function at the national scale.</p>
<p>This poses an important problem for the concept of governance as used in the sociology of globalization. For comparative purposes, I now briefly review two very influential concepts of governance found in the social sciences literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0268580911423058">Bevir, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0268580911423058">2010</xref>). On the one hand, there is the concept of corporate governance, which refers to the way that organizations solve regulatory, resource allocation and enforcement problems by means of hierarchical coordination mechanisms for decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0268580911423058">Aoki, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0268580911423058">Williamson, 1996</xref>). These agents take their political environment into account to generate mechanisms to legally protect their private interests or to adapt to relevant political changes, without holding integration into the national political system as their main objective. In general, the sociology of organization employs this approach to the concept of governance, with important variants when working with the cultural variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0268580911423058">Lawrence et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, the concept of self-government refers to social organizational processes at the communitarian or grassroots level that solve problems of regulation, common-pool resource allocation and enforcement by means of horizontal coordination mechanisms for making decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0268580911423058">Ostrom, 1990</xref>). These governance structures are conceived of as emerging in strict separation from and independently of the national political system. This is the general approach to the concept of governance found in economic sociology and especially in the literature on social networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0268580911423058">Brinton and Nee, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Between these two extreme points, there are participative processes of governance that involve both government authorities and the general public, but always under the shadow of the state, that is, with the direct intervention and control of the state over the governance process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0268580911423058">Baiocchi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0268580911423058">Bevir, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0268580911423058">Treib et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Although it is not possible to generate a universally applicable definition of governance for the sociology of globalization literature from a single case study, it is possible to refine the concept of governance implied in Sassen’s research agenda using the main analytical traits of this case. I maintain the distinction between governance and government. Not doing so would risk losing the concept of governance’s analytical power to explain changes in the way authority is exercised and new global risks regulated in the context of globalization. By maintaining this distinction, it is possible to continue research on governance as self-government processes, whether they are social or corporate. Still more important, it is possible to research the fuzzy interstices and interfaces between the government processes proper of the national political system and the participation processes of external agents who seek to play a very active political role in this system and in the regulation of public, social problems by means of government.</p>
<p>Within these interstices, it is possible both to maintain the three attributes of governance structures referred to in the introduction to this article and to generate new political traits that are detached from the agents’ profile and the public agendas linked to the regulation of global risks within the ICD system. This allows me to approximate a definition of political governance as regulatory structures, which are configured upon different kinds of coordination, constraint and enforcement mechanisms, that result from negotiation and decision-making processes within the national political system between external agents and domestic government authorities aimed at the regulation of global risks.</p>
<p>This definition entails two important assumptions. First, it assumes that the government function and, as such, the sovereignty of the state are still the main factors creating barriers to entry for external agents. Second, if a democratic political system exists at the national level, it assumes that the Executive is still accountable to the general public and citizenship with regard to policies that are formulated as a result of these governance processes. In this regard, and drawing from Sassen’s image of ‘the global inside the nation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0268580911423058">Sassen, 2010</xref>), the specification of the concept of governance as political governance allows one to study how institutional interfaces are configured in such a way as to allow for the insertion of the global within the national political system.</p>
<p>However, my approach still presupposes a condition of interdependence that engenders new global risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0268580911423058">Beck, 2008</xref>), the regulation of which depends on governance processes. Therefore, even though political governance structures engender de-nationalized institutional spaces within the national political architecture, the production of these structures depends on the way government function and the sovereignty principle are negotiated between the agents.</p>
<p>In brief, the case presented here allows me to specify the mechanisms that define political governance structures within the ICD system as part of the emergent formations of multi-scalar globalization. Given the interdependence condition, problems of poverty and inequality are conceptualized as global risks that affect not only developing nations, but also industrialized countries. Thus, it is necessary to search for joint and shared mechanisms to regulate these risks with the involvement of the stakeholders. However, sovereignty still functions as a political barrier to entry that formally excludes external agents from interfering in the internal government affairs of official development aid-receiving countries, leading to the major role given to governance structures as suitable regulatory schemes.</p>
<p>Thus, a functional link is created between the ICD system and the distribution of official development aid, which is conditioned by the normative, institutional and technical harmonization of the agendas of interacting agents (donors and aid-receiving countries) with regard to the regulation of the relevant problems. This leads to the configuration of intergovernmental coordination and negotiation processes upon the patterns that make up an institutional interface that allows for the integration of the international development regime (the global) within the political system and the governmental function at the national level (the local). The main outcome is the configuration of a political governance structure that operates with an intergovernmental coordination mechanism and a constraint mechanism that affects the exercise of government and redistributes the state authority between the interacting agents. As such, the main trait of this political governance structure is that it allows for the ‘agreed violation of sovereignty’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0268580911423058">Krasner, 2001</xref>) of the host state.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this article, I have argued that the international development regime (the ICD system) can be studied as an instance of the emergent formations of multi-scalar globalization, which is the core object of study in Sassen’s research agenda for the sociology of globalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0268580911423058">Sassen, 2010</xref>). However, to do so, I have proposed a specification of the concept of governance in terms of political governance. My argument is that the institutional interface between the flows of global development aid and the Colombian political system is configured as a political governance structure that solves a problem of coordination by means of an intergovernmental coordination mechanism, the final outcome of which is the ‘agreed violation of sovereignty’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0268580911423058">Krasner, 2001</xref>) in the workings of this governance structure. In what follows, I briefly summarize this argument.</p>
<p>The case study developed here allowed me to analyse the configuration of this governance structure. I specified the governance structure according to the normative, institutional and technical changes in the ICD system between 2000 and 2005. I also defined the patterns that allowed for the integration of global flows of development aid into the Colombian political system following these changes.</p>
<p>With regards to the normative pattern, the MDGs function as the main normative referent in order to align the development agenda of the Colombian state with that of the donors. These goals establish a common discursive ground that frames the host government and international donors’ debate about development policy at the national level.</p>
<p>With regards to the institutional pattern, Colombia’s constitution establishes the donors’ autonomy in the allocation and use of aid at the national level; this autonomy enables the institutionalization of a mechanism allowing for direct intervention of international agents in government processes. This pattern is reinforced by recent institutional changes in the ICD system, wherein donors adopted a very politically active role in the creation of development policy in the aid-receiving countries.</p>
<p>However, the implementation of the donors’ will at the national level depended on the results of the negotiation process with the Colombian government. As such, these processes cannot be seen as an example of hegemonic relations within the ICD system. Instead, we must employ the interdependent sovereignty perspective, placing emphasis on the workings of constraint mechanisms attached to intergovernmental coordination and negotiation processes within a political governance structure.</p>
<p>With regard to the technical pattern, the main trend is towards the technical standardization of the programming, monitoring, assessment and evaluation instruments used to enact national development policy.</p>
<p>Here, we see a pattern of international donors playing an active political role when performing as technical counsellors and advisers seeking to harmonize or align the political contents of the national development agenda with their own normative and institutional agendas (bilateral agents) or with normative and institutional frameworks agreed upon at the international level (multilateral agents). The harmonization rule posed by international donors functions as a constraint mechanism and conditions evaluations and decisions regarding the allocation of development aid to aid-receiving countries. This is the main feature that structures a constraint mechanism within these international negotiations. Further, economic and political factors exist that motivate domestic governments to accept both the active participation of these external actors in the formation of development policy and the constraints they impose when engaging in such negotiations. This creates a technically-based institutional interface within the national political system that allows for the agreed violation of sovereignty.</p>
<p>This governance structure has specific traits that necessitate a further refinement of the sociology of globalization’s concept of governance. Donors can be conceived as political agents who seek an active political role in the government processes aimed at the formulation of the development policy in the aid-receiving countries. This leads to negotiation processes with aid-receiving countries, the main outcome of which is a regulatory structure (governance) that allows for the agreed violation of sovereignty. Thus, even though these governance structures can be conceptualized as de-nationalized institutional spaces, this conceptualization requires assessing and stressing the political character of these processes and their integration in the host political system. The concept of political governance attempts to address these issues. A core issue in these donor–recipient negotiation processes is the fundamental changes in the exercise of government in the aid-receiving countries.</p>
<p>The case presented here suggests that future research should employ a sociology of globalization perspective in analysing the international development regime. This research should focus on several core questions. First, what are the main characteristics of the political governance structures that emerge within the framework of the ICD system for each of the global risks addressed in the MDGs? Second, what are the coordination requirements of these governance structures and how are they met (if met)? Third, how do the emergence and integration of these regulatory structures in the national political system ultimately affect the government function and the distribution of state authority in the aid-receiving countries?</p>
