<sec id="section1-0194599813475777">
<title>Objective</title>
<p>Our previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of resveratrol, a grape constituent noted for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, in reducing temporary threshold shifts and decreasing cochlear hair cell damage following noise exposure. This study was designed to identify the potential protective mechanism of resveratrol by measuring its effect on cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein expression and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation following noise exposure.</p>

<title>Subjects and Methods</title>
<p>Twenty-two healthy male Fischer 344 rats (2-3 months old) were exposed to acoustic trauma of variable duration with or without intervention. An additional 20 healthy male rats were used to study COX-2 expression at different time points during and following treatment of 24 hours of noise exposure. Cochlear harvest was performed at various time intervals for measurement of COX-2 protein expression via Western blot analysis and immunostaining. Peripheral blood was also obtained for ROS analysis using flow cytometry.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0194599813475777">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Acoustic trauma exposure resulted in a progressive up-regulation of COX-2 protein expression, commencing at 8 hours and peaking at 32 hours. Similarly, ROS production increased after noise exposure. However, treatment with resveratrol reduced noise-induced COX-2 expression as well as ROS formation in the blood as compared with the controls.</p>

<sec id="section6-0194599813475777">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>COX-2 levels are induced dramatically following noise exposure. This increased expression may be a potential mechanism of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and a possible mechanism of resveratrol’s ability to mitigate NIHL by its ability to reduce COX-2 expression.</p>

<p>Noise is a pervasive form of pollution, similar to that of air and water pollution. This is a growing concern to the population at large, the military, and industries employing workers who are exposed to noise significant enough to produce permanent hearing loss. Increasingly, people are exposed to hazardous noise levels often in combination with other ototoxic agents. Occupational noise is the major cause of acquired hearing loss in adults, and noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is recognized as a leading work-related disease and injury. The American Academy of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery recently estimated that 10 million adult Americans (70% younger than 60 years) and 5.2 million children from ages 6 to 19 years have already suffered irreversible damage from noise and that 30 million more are exposed to dangerous levels of noise daily.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813475777">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813475777">2</xref></sup> It has also been estimated that 12.3% of our men and women in the armed forces involved in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Afghanistan are being sent home with permanent hearing disorders secondary to exposure to improvised explosive devices and other noise sources.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813475777">3</xref></sup> A comprehensive and systematic understanding of the molecular mechanisms of NIHL remains elusive. However, compelling evidence implicates reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation as having a putative role in NIHL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813475777">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813475777">5</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression has been demonstrated to have a direct association with inflammation and the formation of ROS. The level of expression of COX-2 relates proportionally to the level of cytotoxic and neurotoxic damage of the inflammatory process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599813475777">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813475777"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813475777">8</xref></sup> Studies from our laboratory and others have shown that partial protection from noise damage can be achieved by reducing ROS generation or by scavenging ROS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599813475777">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599813475777"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813475777">11</xref></sup>

<p>Resveratrol (trans 3,5,4′-trihydoxystilbene) is a compound found mainly in the skin and seed of grapes. It is recognized for both its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and its potential to reduce the risk of cancer and heart disease, and its role in mitigating oxidative stress has been demonstrated in various studies. The direct neuroprotective effects of resveratrol against this stress have been noted in PC12 cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813475777">11</xref></sup> Resveratrol stimulates a key enzyme in the brain known as mitogen-activated protein kinase, which is involved in nerve regeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599813475777">12</xref></sup> and neural protection from the damage caused by systemic injection of excitotoxin kainic acid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599813475777">13</xref></sup> Earlier studies demonstrated the efficacy of resveratrol in reducing temporary threshold shifts and decreasing cochlear hair cell damage following noise exposure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599813475777">14</xref></sup>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Twenty-two healthy male Fischer 344 rats (2-3 months old) were used in this the first arm of the study, and an additional 20 rats were used in the second arm of the study. The first experimental group consisted of 10 rats (20 cochleae) to study COX-2 protein expression at different time points. Animals were transcardially perfused with 250 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, Illinois) following anesthesia with ketamine and xylazine (100 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg, respectively, by intramuscular injection). Cochleae from each of the 10 rats were harvested at baseline (0 hours) and 4, 8, 16, and 24 hours following noise exposure, and COX-2 protein expression was measured by Western Blot.</p>
<p>In the second experiment, 12 rats were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups (n = 4): group A was the control group, received no treatment, and was not exposed to noise. Group B was pretreated with 0.9% sodium chloride, the vehicle control, and then exposed to noise. Group C was pretreated with resveratrol and then exposed to noise. The resveratrol dose used for pretreatment in the group C rats was 5 mg/kg of resveratrol daily for 3 days by gavage. Cochleae were then immediately harvested following the 24-hour noise exposure and used for Western blot and immunoblotting. The protocol for NIHL was modeled after previous validated methodology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599813475777">15</xref></sup> The experimental animal protocol used in this study was approved by the Care for Experimental Animals Committee at Henry Ford Health System. All procedures were conducted in strict compliance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for experimental animals.</p>
<p>A third experiment was conducted to confirm and further expand the initial Western blot analysis results. An additional 20 healthy male Fischer 344 rats (2-3 months old) were used to study COX-2 expression at different time points during and following treatment of 24 hours of noise exposure. Cochleae were harvested at baseline (before noise exposure) and 4, 8, 16, and 24 hours during noise exposure. Following cessation of noise exposure and treatment, additional cochleae were harvested at 32, 40, 48, and 72 hours (ie, 8, 16, 24, and 48 hours posttreatment) after noise exposure.</p>
<sec id="section8-0194599813475777">
<title>Acoustic Trauma</title>
<p>Rats were placed in separate wire mesh cages (30 × 30 × 15 cm) located 40 cm in front of the loudspeaker in an acoustically-insulated noise booth (Industrial Acoustics, New York, New York). Rats were exposed to 105 dB sound pressure level broadband noise for 24 continuous hours and given free access to food and water, similar to previously documented protocols.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599813475777">15</xref></sup> Noise levels within each cage were measured with a sound level meter (LD 800B; Larson-Davis, Depew, New York). Caging was designed to be acoustically transparent; calibration measurements throughout the cage revealed a variance of 0.6 to 1.0 dB from the front of the cage to the back. Exposure level was varied by less than ±1.2 dB per cage.</p>

<sec id="section9-0194599813475777">
<title>Western Blot Analysis</title>
<p>After various experimental conditions, animals were deeply anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine and xylazine (100 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg intramuscularly, respectively) followed by intracardial perfusion of 250 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride. Temporal bones of each animal were removed, and the inner ear was dissected immediately. The cochlea was exposed and transferred into ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4). The bony otic capsule was removed under a dissection microscopic (wild type 355110, Heerbrugg, Switzerland) within 10 minutes. Inner ear tissue (VIII nerve, modiolar, and sensorineural epithelium) was collected via microscopic dissection, washed in PBS, and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholic acid, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM NaVO3, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM PMSF, 10 mg/mL leupeptin, 10 mg/mL aprotonin) on ice. The tissue was subjected to brief sonication, and soluble proteins were obtained by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C. The concentration of each sample was determined by Bradford protein assay (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, California). For immunoblotting, equal amounts of cell lysate were subjected to electrophoresis on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gels. Separated proteins were then electrotransferred to Immobilon membrane (Millpore, Bedford, Massachusetts). The membrane was probed with a rabbit polyclonal anti–COX-2 antiserum (1:500; Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Michigan), and COX-2 proteins were visualized by use of an enhanced chemiluminescence protein detection kit (Pierce Biotechnology Inc, Rockford, Illinois).</p>

<title>Measurement of Free ROS in Lymphocytes</title>
<p>Serum ROS were measured in a similar fashion performed by the principal investigator in previous experiments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599813475777">15</xref></sup> Blood (1 mL) was extracted from the tail vein of all rats involved in the study. RPMI medium 1640 (GibcoBRL, Grand Island, New York) with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) was then added and mixed with the blood in chilled 15-mL tubes. The mixture was placed on the surface of Histopaque-1077 (3 mL; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Missouri) and centrifuged at 400<italic>g</italic> for 30 minutes at room temperature. After removing the buffy coat, the sample was placed in a 15-mL tube and RPMI medium 1640 with 5% FCS was added to a total volume of 10 mL for washing. The sample was again centrifuged at 240<italic>g</italic> for 10 minutes. The pellet was resuspended with 1% FCS in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM; GibcoBRL). The cell suspension was counted for the number of viable cells, and DMEM was added to achieve a final density of 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL. Two tubes containing 0.5 mL of cell suspension were prepared. One tube was added to a final concentration of 200 µM resveratrol, and the other tube was added with an equivalent volume of DMEM and vortexed and incubated at 37°C for 90 minutes. 2′,7′-dicholrodihydrofluorescien diacetate (H2DCFDA) was added to both tubes, giving a final concentration of 10 µM. Both tubes were incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes. Cell samples were analyzed with a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, California), and the distribution of DCF density was determined with the software from BD Biosciences.</p>

This was performed to determine if the COX-2 protein expression was still higher than control beyond 24 hours of noise exposure. Similar to the previous results, it revealed the lowest expression of COX-2 at 0 hours followed by up-regulation through 24 hours. Additional data revealed COX-2 protein reached its maximum expression at 16 to 32 hours, with a decline commencing at 32 hours until the final time point of 72 hours. Quantification revealed a 9.3-fold increase between baseline and both 16 hours and 24 hours of noise exposure, followed by a 9.4-fold increase between baseline and the maximum expression at 32 hours. A 3.1-fold decrease of COX-2 expression occurred from the maximum expression at 32 hours to 72 hours.

<title>Resveratrol Inhibited COX-2 Protein Expression following Noise Exposure</title>
<p>To investigate the effect of resveratrol on noise-induced COX-2 expression, information from the same 3 groups of animals were used. COX-2 protein levels were assayed from the cochlea of the animals with an antibody raised against COX-2 by Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599813475777"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>) at one single time point after the 24-hour noise exposure. There was little or no COX-2 expression in the control group (“control”) that was not exposed to noise and did not receive any treatment. Expression increased several fold in the vehicle-treated group (“noise”). However, the resveratrol group demonstrated a reduction in intensity of the COX-2 band (“R+N”) compared with the vehicle-treated group. Densitometric measurements demonstrated that the induction of COX-2 expression in the vehicle-treated group was significantly increased as compared with the control group (<italic>P</italic> = .0189). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599813475777"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref> illustrates the significant inhibition of COX-2 expression following noise exposure in the resveratrol-treated group.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>There are several interesting properties of resveratrol that have been investigated in a variety of different areas. Resveratrol has been touted as a possible explanation for the “French Paradox,” the low incidence of heart disease among French people, despite a relatively high-fat diet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599813475777">18</xref></sup> Resveratrol has many other important biologic activities, including inhibition of lipid peroxidation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599813475777">19</xref></sup> free radical scavenging,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599813475777">20</xref></sup> alteration of eicosanoid synthesis, inhibition of platelet aggregation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599813475777">21</xref></sup> anti-inflammatory and anticancer activity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599813475777">22</xref></sup> modulation of lipid metabolism, and cardioprotective and neuroprotective actions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599813475777">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599813475777">13</xref></sup>

<p>Oxidative stress in the central nervous system may cause oxidation of lipoprotein particles. The oxidized lipoproteins may damage cellular and subcellular membranes, leading to tissue injury and cell death. Draczynska-Luciak et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813475777">11</xref></sup> have shown that antioxidants, such as resveratrol, as well as vitamins E and C, protect neuronal cell damage from oxidative stress in vivo. Resveratrol was noted to decrease complex III activity in the rat brain by competition with coenzyme Q. By decreasing the activity of complex III, resveratrol not only suppresses the production of ROS but also scavenges them.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0194599813475777">23</xref></sup> Resveratrol also suppresses tumor necrosis factor–induced activation of nuclear transcription factor NF-kappa B, activator protein-1, and apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0194599813475777">24</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>It is generally accepted that at least 2 isoforms of the principal enzyme responsible for prostaglandin (PG) synthesis exist: COX-1 and COX-2. Constitutive COX-1 activity provides PGs involved in physiologic reactions and performs a housekeeping function that regulates normal cell activity. Normally, COX-2 is either not present or present in very small amounts in the resting cell. However, levels of COX-2 can be dramatically induced by various cytokines, growth factors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0194599813475777">25</xref></sup> and endotoxins. There is mounting evidence that up-regulation of COX-2 expression contributes to ischemic brain damage,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0194599813475777">26</xref></sup> Alzheimer disease,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0194599813475777">27</xref></sup> inflammatory states,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0194599813475777">28</xref></sup> various tumors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0194599813475777">29</xref></sup> and the aging process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0194599813475777">30</xref></sup> Studies have shown that selective COX-2 inhibitors can attenuate ischemia or reperfusion-induced brain damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0194599813475777">31</xref></sup> In a study by Kim et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0194599813475777">32</xref></sup> COX-2 mRNA, protein levels, and COX-2 activity increased with age in the heart (using, respectively, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and PGE2 synthesis), whereas those of COX-1 showed no change.</p>
<p>Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that treatment with resveratrol reduces noise-induced hearing and cochlear outer hair cell loss based on auditory brainstem response testing and histologic examination. This demonstrates a protective effect of resveratrol in response to noise exposure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599813475777">14</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In the current study, the progressive up-regulation of COX-2 was observed following noise exposure. First, the experiments from this study demonstrated a time-dependent COX-2 protein expression over time. The first experiment, as noted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599813475777"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>, demonstrated that COX-2 protein expression in the rat cochlea increased in the first 24 hours after noise exposure. A second experiment, as noted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599813475777"><bold>Figure 1D</bold></xref>, expanded on this premise and demonstrated a similar result, albeit slightly lower, in the first 24 hours of noise exposure. This experiment went a step further and found that COX-2 protein expression peaked at 32 hours after a noise exposure before starting to return to baseline. Additional experiments demonstrated that COX-2 protein expression in a saline-treated group following noise exposure was significantly increased as compared with the control group, which received neither treatment nor noise. COX-2 expression in the noise with resveratrol–treated group was significantly reduced as compared with the vehicle-treated group. ROS formation with resveratrol treatment was also significantly reduced as compared with the vehicle-treated group. Despite the low numbers in this single arm of the experiments, these data provide compelling evidence that COX-2 levels can be dramatically induced following noise exposure and, likewise, attenuated by the protective effect of resveratrol.</p>
<p>A potential limitation in this study pertains to the role of ROS in response to noise. We hypothesize that the elevation of ROS in lymphocytes in response to noise is an indirect measure of the oxidative stress in the inner ear, but it is possible that this elevation is in part due to a generalized stress response by the animal.</p>
<p>Another limitation of this study was the omission of the immunostaining data collected on the rat cochlear apparatus. After noise exposure, the cochlea of the rats were sectioned and studied for COX-2 immumoreactivity of the stria vascularis and vascular pedicle of the modiolus in rats given a prenoise control and a resveratrol prenoise control. COX-2 immunoreactivity was found to be elevated in both the noise-exposed saline-treated and resveratrol-treated groups compared with a control group. These stains demonstrated COX-2 immunoreactivity was significantly reduced in the resveratrol-treated group compared with the saline-treated group, further suggesting that resveratrol inhibits COX-2 expression following noise exposure. However, a flaw in these particular images was that they had a high background-to-noise ratio, and there was no nuclear co-staining to strengthen the results.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The purpose of the current study was to determine the mechanism by which resveratrol confers protection from noise-induced damage to the auditory system. The current results indicate that acoustic overstimulation causes a time-dependent up-regulation of COX-2 protein expression. Resveratrol significantly reduces ROS formation and inhibits COX-2 expression following noise exposure. These findings suggest that resveratrol may exert its protective effect from NIHL by the inhibition of COX-2 expression and ROS formation, although other mechanisms may also be involved.</p>
