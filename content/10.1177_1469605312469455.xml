<abstract>
<p>This article examines the significance and social context of early Anglo-Saxon figurines. Dating to the seventh century AD, these objects are three-dimensional metallic sculptures of the human form, between 30 and 50 mm in length, and only 12 are known to exist. The figurative portrayal of the human form is exceptional; the majority of designs in this timeframe incorporating the human form are represented in two dimensions. The figurines are therefore a marked development in the manufacture and deployment of anthropomorphic representational art that demands explanation. The figurines are considered here in terms of their three-dimensionality, structural function and the gestures they represent. It is suggested that the figurines are crucial, if rare, material evidence for the emerging importance of gestural and gendered expression within elite social contexts.</p>

<p>Early Anglo-Saxon<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1469605312469455">1</xref></sup> metallic objects often carry images of humans, animals and hybrids of the two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469605312469455">Haseloff, 1981</xref>). The objects comprise a style of artistic output within north-west European societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469605312469455">Salin, 1904</xref>) that is most frequently found within burial contexts. Close attention has been paid in previous research to their manufacture, typology and ornamentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1469605312469455">Dickinson, 1991</xref>). The decorative repertoires of this period are considered an important medium for the construction and conveyance of concepts of identity and belief by both individuals and social groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1469605312469455">Dickinson, 2009</xref>). Animal imagery has been studied in terms of artistic parallels, meanings and roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469605312469455">Fern, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1469605312469455">Høilund Nielsen, 1999</xref>). The human and humanoid image, however, remain under-researched, despite forming a widespread element of this ‘zoomorphic’ decoration. This article examines three key aspects of a particular and distinct category of artefact representing the human form. I explore a group of figurines, mostly found in the last two decades and hitherto not explored in any detail. I address: 1) their three-dimensional form, 2) their function and 3) their bodily gesture. The figurines are argued here as rare but significant material evidence for the emerging importance of the represented human form to male and female elites and their regalia in an early historic society.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1469605312469455"><title>Anthropomorphic imagery in early Anglo-Saxon England</title>
<p>In early Anglo-Saxon England there are two recognised art styles: Salin Style I and Style II. Style I emerged in the second half of the fifth century and was succeeded by Style II in the late sixth and early seventh centuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1469605312469455">Dickinson, 2009</xref>). Both of these styles were in use across Europe during the fifth and sixth centuries, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1469605312469455">Haseloff, 1984</xref>). Style I refers to fragmented zoomorphic and anthropomorphic body parts and Style II is typified by ribbon or interlacing animal and human designs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1469605312469455">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1469605312469455">Dickinson, 2009</xref>: 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1469605312469455">Speake, 1980</xref>: 17). Whilst human designs play an important role in these style categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1469605312469455">Leigh, 1984</xref>: 39), it is incredibly rare to find figurative imagery in the Style I and II repertoire. The naturalistic portrayal of the human form was not consistently produced until the tenth century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1469605312469455">Wilson, 1984</xref>: 27). In this time period, the majority of human designs were represented in two dimensions on three-dimensional portable metallic objects, largely in copper-alloy, although other portable image-carrying objects were in all likelihood made with organic materials, including leather, textiles, wood and ivory. Despite the biases of the archaeological record, there is some indication that metal was preferred over ceramic as a medium for the human image. Of the many thousands of cremation urns of early Anglo-Saxon date from England, only two carry a recognisable human form: an etched human face on an urn from Markshall cemetery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1469605312469455">Myres and Green, 1973</xref>: 237) and a unique three-dimensional figure seated on a chair from the Spong Hill cemetery in Norfolk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1469605312469455">Hills, 1980</xref>: 52–54). Despite the paucity of human imagery on funerary urns, the majority of metal items sporting figurative motifs are from funerary contexts or represent unstratified finds. Thus the bias of preservation and retrieval means that the legacy of early Anglo-Saxon human imagery is largely visible to us today through representations on metal objects from mortuary contexts.

</fig></p>
<p>Despite this rarity, there is a limited series of artefacts that carry full-bodied human representation. It is, however, difficult to assign such representational art to either Style I or II. These figures do not form part of an interlaced design and clearly they are not disarticulated body parts, thus falling outside the established style criteria. The issue of what types of designs are included and excluded in Style I has been recently discussed. Tania <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1469605312469455">Dickinson (2009: 2)</xref>, for example, does not include some disarticulated human and animal heads. She excludes human heads on bucket vandykes<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1469605312469455">2</xref></sup> or appliqués on the basis that some of these may be imports from the Continent and are, therefore, not bona fide Anglo-Saxon. Additionally, Dickinson excludes animal heads on bow brooches, although such heads can be placed within Style I. Although anthropomorphic elements within Style II are extremely rare, unambiguous human heads can be found embedded within the Style II ribbon-like animal motifs. Each of the vandykes, for example, on the Maplewood bottles from mound one at Sutton Hoo, carry two intertwined animals and a bearded human face (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1469605312469455">Evans, 1986</xref>: 66, fig. 51). In the most recent discussions on Style II, which have examined its distribution and significance within Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1469605312469455">Høilund Nielsen, 1999</xref>), human imagery has been largely overlooked. In an earlier examination of Style II in England, Speake identified that the vandykes for the drinking cups at the high-status, male barrow burial at Taplow (Buckinghamshire) were ‘decorated with face-masks and not Style II ornament’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1469605312469455">Speake, 1980</xref>: 75). It thus seems uncertain if these human heads should be considered as part of the Style II repertoire, especially given these designs as suggested by Webster as remnants of an earlier artistic repertoire of Style I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1469605312469455">Webster, 2003: 16</xref>). It is notable that other human designs have not been assigned with confidence to either Style I or II, including the famous horse and rider design and the ceremonial men with bird-headdresses that are rendered on the Sutton Hoo helmet. However, these are found on objects that bear classic examples of Style II animal art.</p>
<p>Many human figures thus appear to operate outside the current stylistic classifications for early Anglo-Saxon art. Some human designs – including a range of disarticulated heads and full-bodied humans – are treated as insular traditions emergent from connections between England and Scandinavia or continental Europe. Whilst it is useful to identify styles in order to create typologies and chronologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1469605312469455">Høilund Nielsen, 1999</xref>), it is perhaps equally important to explore thematic topics that are embedded within the artistic repertoire. One topic is human representational art. Although the human heads represented on the bucket vandykes may reflect Continental influences of production, these designs operated alongside a series of similar and contrasting human representations. This use of varied human imagery may well relate to the emergence of specific social strategies and perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1469605312469455">Bailey, 1996</xref>: 293; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1469605312469455">Scarre, 2007</xref>: 18). Certainly, in recent years the human form has been identified as an important research topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1469605312469455">Back Danielsson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1469605312469455">Helmbrecht, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1469605312469455">Watt, 1999</xref>). Anglo-Saxon human art has not, however, seen extensive discussion. A review, although not exhaustive, is thus necessary here to set the context for a later discussion of the emergence of this genre of figurative portrayal. This article takes full-bodied human imagery as a theme, with the awareness that the breadth of material under discussion falls within and between the classic style categories of I and II.</p>
<sec id="sec3-1469605312469455"><title>The meaning and interpretation of the human form</title>
<p>To date, the interpretation of early Anglo-Saxon human and animal imagery has been largely influenced by Icelandic and Germanic literature of the ninth to thirteenth centuries. These written accounts contain supernatural characters and details of ritual performances and are considered to contain surviving details pertinent to pre-Christian beliefs and cosmology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1469605312469455">Hedeager, 2011</xref>). Bracteates (round pendants that are generally made from gold dated to the fifth and sixth centuries AD) and their art have long been used to connect the material culture of the pre-Christian world with later literary narratives by Christian authors. A series of publications addressing the iconography and development of bracteates in north-west Europe by Karl Hauck interpreted the interacting full human bodies, human heads and animals as relating to the Nordic god Odin and his associated menagerie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1469605312469455">Hauck, 1977</xref>). Bracteates are considered to be amuletic objects. The image of a god attracted divine favour or the image of a defeated monster repelled evil forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1469605312469455">Behr, 2010</xref>: 36). This finds-group has thus played an influential role in the analysis of the art and artefacts of the period and has incited scholars to connect other human and animal imagery with Odin and other gods or deities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1469605312469455">Webster, 2011</xref>: 463).</p>
<p>Scholars researching Scandinavian Migration Period art have connected the hybrid nature of Style I imagery to thematic concepts such as bodily transformation, animal–human relationships, shamanism and shape-shifting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1469605312469455">Hedeager, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469605312469455">Kristoffersen, 2010</xref>: 263). Such themes have also been explored in discussions of Anglo-Saxon art. The Style II animal images found on objects from mound one at Sutton Hoo have been connected with Odin and his capabilities to change into animal form, thus suggesting evidence for an elite cult of Odin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1469605312469455">Dickinson, 2005</xref>: 160). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1469605312469455">Pluskowski (2010)</xref> has more broadly considered zoomorphic Style I and II imagery in association with ecological and faunal evidence in mortuary contexts and argues for a generic pagan belief-system centred on animal–human relationships. In a similar way, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1469605312469455">Sanmark (2010)</xref> views the figurative bird, boar and wolf images as evidence for a shamanistic ideology.</p>
<p>A crucial criticism, however, of some of the above is that such interpretations rely heavily on historical accounts that were written several generations later, within a Christian context. Whilst textual sources can often provide us with insights to perceptions or realities of how people may have made sense of the world, it has long been established that we have to be cautious with associating imagery with much later textual sources. Price suggested that it might be useful to consider anthropomorphic art in terms of historic literature when there are substantial similarities and associations between image and text. He suggests that if we can correlate associative imagery, for example the garb, objects and bodily actions, with descriptive verses, we can avoid ‘simplistic attributions’ and make more useful connections with characters from later texts (2006: 182).</p>
<p>In prehistoric studies, the complete absence of textual sources has not stopped speculation. Anthropomorphic objects have long been considered representations of deities in prehistoric studies; figurines, for example, have been thought to represent the mother Goddess in Neolithic Europe and South-west Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1469605312469455">Meskell, 1995</xref>: 75). Douglass Bailey, however, has suggested that such interpretations remain unsubstantiated and that there are alternative ways to analyse figurative art. In his published research on Neolithic figurines, Bailey recognised the value of examining the representation and corporeality of figurines and speculating on the effects of this type of imagery on the human senses (2005). Thus, if we cannot pin down the ‘meaning’ of the early Anglo-Saxon figurines, we can at least perhaps consider the possible effects that these figurines might have had on the viewer and handler. In this way, it may be possible to establish new perspectives on the role of metal sculptures within the largely illiterate society of early Anglo-Saxon England, where human imagery might have been an important medium for communicating ideologies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1469605312469455"><title>The psychological effects of imagery</title>
<p>Recent discussions in Migration Period art have suggested that imagery can be explored by considering the potential psychological and sensory responses that designs might evoke in human audiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1469605312469455">Lindstrøm and Kristoffersen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1469605312469455">Williams, 2011</xref>). It is possible that hybrid or transformative human images in Migration Period art were designed with the aim of stimulating a psychological response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1469605312469455">Kristoffersen, 2000</xref>). Siv Kristoffersen argues that the gold-like appearance and the visual contour of relief brooches in Migration Period Scandinavia reflected light and created an appeal to the senses, provoking an emotional response in the viewer (2000: 266–267). The human and shape-changing imagery represented on metalwork may even have assisted the wearer/owner and audience in gaining access to a spiritual and psychological state (Back <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1469605312469455">Danielsson, 2002</xref>: 188). The hybrid images of this time period are also thought to have been visual riddles, playing on the viewers’ perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1469605312469455">Leigh, 1984</xref>: 40).</p>
<p>Whether objects and art caused emotional and psychological reactions is debatable, but we can safely suggest that the display and presentation of images might have been designed to manipulate the way the viewer interacted with the object. The efficacy of portable objects on their audience has been identified as an important area of study. Runic inscriptions might have been read aloud, serving to communicate to their audience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1469605312469455">Karkov, 2011</xref>), and some image-carrying objects have been suggested to play a role in masculine identity and perhaps instilled some sense of protection in the wearer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1469605312469455">Dickinson, 2005</xref>). For this time period, some objects and imagery are thus considered to have the potential to catalyse and facilitate social dynamics and interaction. These debates are crucial to this article because they suggest that it is through the examination of how objects were experienced (viewed and interacted with) that we can explore possible responses and effects. The effect of art on people is argued to perhaps reflect the agency of the objects that carried the designs and motifs (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1469605312469455">Gell, 1998</xref>). The combination of stylistic analysis and the examination of the functional role of the object might, therefore, indicate the role that objects played in an early historic society.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1469605312469455"><title>Metallic sculptures of the human form</title>
<p>It is within this stylistic context outlined above that figurines were created as a part of the expressive Anglo-Saxon material culture. These figurines have not been assigned to either Style I or II, but emerge at the same time as Style II and full-bodied imagery of the seventh century. This object type represents the first substantial finds group for three-dimensional portrayals of the human form in the material culture of the early Anglo-Saxon period. The Portable Antiquity Scheme (PAS) database lists seven finds of such human figurines and the others are either published or remain unpublished (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1469605312469455">Table 1</xref>). Unfortunately, there is very little detail on the finds. No photographic images or illustrations exist for some, while information on the archaeological context for others is also lacking. Many of these figurines are held within private collections. Some have been purchased by collectors from overseas and cannot be examined first-hand. With these caveats in mind, this article discusses 12 figurines from: Rodmell (East Sussex); Caistor (Lincolnshire); Carlton Colville, Halesworth, Great Waldringfield, Tuddenham-St-Martin, Eyke and Friston (Suffolk); and Higham, Broadstairs, Breach Downs and Lenham (Kent) (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1469605312469455">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1469605312469455">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1469605312469455">4</xref>). These figurines have been selected on the basis that they have a photographic image or could be handled and viewed by the author. These metallic sculptures measure between <italic>c</italic>.40 and 50 mm in length, making them highly portable. These objects are not homogeneous; each figurine is individually crafted with a different appearance and in some cases the human form is schematically represented.

<p>In terms of dating evidence, the figurine from Broadstairs (Kent) was recovered from a burial ascribed in terms of its assemblage to the seventh century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1469605312469455">Meaney, 1981</xref>: 231; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1469605312469455">Webster, 2002</xref>: 15). The Breach Downs figurine was described as found ‘near a Saxon tumuli’ during 1841–1845 excavations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1469605312469455">Evison, 1965</xref>: 215). The figurine from Carlton Colville (Suffolk) was found in a spoil heap during the ‘initial phases of excavations’ of an early Anglo-Saxon settlement and cemetery site ‘dating from the sixth to the early eighth century’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1469605312469455">Lucy et al., 2009</xref>: 1, 178).</p>
<p>For the other figurines that lack an archaeological context we might question what identifies them as Anglo-Saxon and not prehistoric or Roman in date. Certainly there are some similarities between the Friston figurine and the late Roman or Iron Age figurine from Henley Wood (Somerset) in terms of its size and hand gesture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1469605312469455">Henig, 1996</xref>). There are, however, crucial differences between these figurines. The bodies of the figurines under study here are generally less curvilinear; they have less well-defined necks and are not portrayed with paraphernalia such as the ‘Celtic’ torque (as is rendered on the Henley Wood figurine). The majority of the Roman figurines are also rendered with their hands gesturing away from the body, whereas this group of figurines has ‘feebly attenuated arms’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1469605312469455">Evison, 1965</xref>: 216), marking a stark contrast with the Roman figurines.</p>
<p>This collection has been associated with human imagery from early Anglo-Saxon England and the Vendel and Viking world. The figurine from Tuddenham-St-Martin has been paralleled with a three-dimensional ring-headed pin from the island of Öland, Sweden, and the figurine from Staraja Ladoga, Russia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1469605312469455">Geake and Webster, 2001</xref>: 250). Such objects cannot be securely dated to the Vendel period and may be Viking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1469605312469455">Helmbrecht, 2008</xref>: 44–45). As rehearsed elsewhere, however, such bird or horned headdresses are also portrayed on other objects from seventh-century archaeological contexts in England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1469605312469455">Helmbrecht, 2008</xref>). Additionally, the figurines from Friston, Carlton Colville and Higham share a similar tapering hat as a three-dimensional human head that is carried on an implement from grave 161 at Buckland, Dover (Kent), dated to <italic>c</italic>.AD 675–700 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1469605312469455">Evison, 1987</xref>: 84–85). Based on at least one secure archaeological context and stylistic comparison in the early Anglo-Saxon repertoire, it can tentatively be asserted that this small collection of figurines is likely to date to the seventh century.</p>
<p>Despite the rarity of full-bodied representation, the figurines fit with a genre of human imagery of this time. Male figures can be discerned by the presence of genitalia for the first time in this period; moreover, we also see the representation of the anatomically visible female. The figurines do represent clothed figures or figures wearing costume and these details have been considered to indicate that the images are god-like figures, connecting the object to concepts of protection, talismanic power and cultic practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1469605312469455">Webster, 2012</xref>: 82). Their bodily gestures and attire, however, cannot be securely connected with characters from historical sources, but their clothing, shape, form and gesticulation all set them entirely apart from known human representations in Anglo-Saxon England. Currently, the figurines have been considered as part of the ‘pagan’ repertoire and the female figurines that are naked or semi-naked have been associated with the concept of fertility (Pestell, forthcoming). Webster has suggested that these figurines are material responses to the coming of Christian religion in this time period (2011: 474). Little, however, is known of their role and function for Christian or non-Christian audiences.</p>
<p>To summarise, the figurines were clearly not regularly deposited in mortuary or settlement contexts or many more would have been found. The lack of archaeological context might support the idea that these objects were kept with, and used by, living individuals. The metallic sculpture was small enough to be held in the palm of the hand, implying that these items were made for highly individual use and engagement. We might, therefore, learn more about the role of these objects by examining their structural form.</p>
<p>The structural form of the figures suggests five ways in which the figurines might have been used. The figurines from Broadstairs, Carlton Colville and Great Waldringfield have pendant loops that would enable the object to be suspended or attached. Indeed, the Broadstairs example was found ‘suspended on a chatelaine’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1469605312469455">Webster and Minter, 2007</xref>: 225). The Great Waldringfield, Tuddenham-St-Martin and Lenham figurines have hollow bodies and were thus designed to be used as an application to another object. Meaney suggested that the bar underneath the feet of the figure from Broadstairs could perhaps ‘slot into some kind of pedestal’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1469605312469455">Meaney, 1981</xref>: 231). The Caistor figurine is not represented in the round, but has a hollow back and on the rear there are rivets, thus indicating that it may have been fixed or mounted onto another surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1469605312469455">Webster, 2002</xref>). The Higham, Breach Downs, Eyke and Friston along with Halesworth and Rodmell figurines have none of these means of attachment. The Breach Downs figurine, however, is hollow and was cast as a head and tubular torso; the head is suggested to be a pin head and the body a phial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1469605312469455">Evison, 1965</xref>: 216). Thus it is clear that despite their similarities each object had a particular way that it could be handled: suspended and worn on the body or an object or structure; affixed to another object; displayed on a pedestal; and, as we can perhaps add, held in the hand. Additionally, one figurine might have been used to contain fluid substances.</p>
<p>We might surmise that these diminutive human forms were used in personal spaces and for small-scale displays given their size, but the indications that these were fixed or applied to perhaps larger items in some instances implies usage was not identical. However, the scale of the objects suggests that they were not intended to be highly visible and used within a group, rather the size and independent design hints at the concept of private ritual and intimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1469605312469455">Bailey, 2005</xref>: 41). Additionally, the three-dimensional art might have provoked an alternative way of viewing and engaging with the content of the object (2005: 26–44). The object is not supported or framed by the structural components of the object type and it also represents the <italic>totality</italic> of the human form. Through such an engagement, the object invokes a sense of intimacy between the individual and the object, thus suggesting that the user’s theory of the object’s agency associates with introspection (the observation of one’s own cognitive and emotional processes). We might question, what could the full-bodied human image represent that hybrid and animal imagery could not? Why is there such a substantial development in representational art? In order to explore how these objects came into being and what technical and cognitive processes were involved in their manufacture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1469605312469455">Morphy, 2010</xref>: 279), the focus now turns back to possible stylistic influences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1469605312469455"><title>Stylistic influences within the North Sea littoral</title>
<p>In the sixth to seventh centuries, Anglo-Saxon England was strongly connected with Scandinavia and continental Europe. Stylistic connections between continental and English art styles are well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469605312469455">Salin, 1904</xref>); additionally, there are shared object types and mortuary practices between Anglo-Saxon England and Scandinavia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1469605312469455">Bruce-Mitford, 1975–83</xref>) and Merovingian Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1469605312469455">Welch, 2011</xref>: 267). We might thus expect the style of the figurines to have been influenced by the social and material dynamics within the North Sea littoral.</p>
<p>There are a number of three-dimensional figurines from the Merovingian world. Typically, these include human and animal combinations with a ‘horseman’ or figure mounted on an animal, for example a wolf or horse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1469605312469455">Menghin, 2007</xref>: 97–99). Whilst they depict the full human figure they do not fit within the repertoire of a single, represented human form. In terms of the style of object, contemporary Scandinavian human imagery closely parallels the early Anglo-Saxon figurines. Webster has noted the distinct similarity between figurines from Anglo-Saxon England and contemporary Scandinavia (2012: 82). A recent study has noted a variety of three-dimensional figurines that date to the seventh and eighth centuries in Scandinavia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1469605312469455">Helmbrecht, 2011</xref>: 246–249). Whilst these three-dimensional figurines do not directly correspond with the Anglo-Saxon examples, figurines from an earlier time period share a startling resemblance with some of the Anglo-Saxon collection.</p>
<p>The hand gesture has some resonance with a figure on the Gundestrup cauldron from Denmark, which dates to the second century BC. The figure (possibly female) raises the right hand to the centre of the chest and the left hand rests immediately below this. There are several bronze figurines from Scandinavia, two of which are stylistically related. A bronze statue from Denmark is represented with its right hand to its breast and the left arm rests on the waist, although it is a stray find it has been stylistically dated to the third–fourth century AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1469605312469455">Jørgensen et al., 2003</xref>: 390). Another bronze figurine dating to the fifth century, also from Denmark, demonstrates a hand gesture similar to three Anglo-Saxon figurines with the left hand flat against the right side of the chest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1469605312469455">Brøndsted, 1960</xref>: 315).</p>
<p>From the Timmele parish, Västergötland (Sweden), four metallic human figurines dating to the Nordic Late Bronze Age were found on the topsoil with burnt bones and flints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1469605312469455">Arne, 1909</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1469605312469455">Kristiansen and Larsson, 2005</xref>: 308–313). The Västergötland figurines are positioned with the hands on their midriff/waist, which are stylistically comparable to the Caistor figurine. The slightly bent knees of these Swedish examples are also found on the Higham and Carlton Colville figurines. The Caistor example also shares a similar arm and hand gesture as a three-dimensional figurine from Skåne (Sweden) with its curled arms and hands firmly on the waist area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1469605312469455">Zachrisson, 2003</xref>: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1469605312469455">fig. 2</xref>). From Rällinge, Södermanland (Sweden), a bronze figure of a naked man with an arm-ring and conical hat sits cross-legged with a large phallus, stroking or grabbing his beard with his left hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1469605312469455">Gräslund, 2008</xref>: 253). This figurine has been related to Carlton Colville in the fact that the hand is close to the beard and the style of hats is similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1469605312469455">Webster, 2002</xref>). This figure from Sweden, however, has been stylistically dated to the late Viking Age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1469605312469455">Gräslund, 2008</xref>: 253).</p>
<p>The gestures of the two figurines from Friston (Suffolk) and Broadstairs (Kent) remarkably parallel a series of <italic>guldgubber</italic> from Uppåkra, dating to the Migration Period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1469605312469455">Watt, 2004: 182</xref>). A three-dimensional, male figurine from Lunda is also represented with a similar hand posture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1469605312469455">Helmbrecht, 2011</xref>: 247). This figurine was recovered from a settlement strata dating to around AD 450–600 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1469605312469455">Andersson et al., 2004</xref>: 158). Broadly contemporary to this, female figures were also represented with this hand positioning, such as the figurines from Öja in Sweden (2004: 91). All these figures are represented with their arms folded across their waist or hands resting on their stomach and meeting in the middle. Such rare finds perhaps tentatively indicate that comparable hand gestures were used in pre-Christian contexts over the long term or re-emerged at particular temporal, cultural or socio-political moments.</p>
<p>Perhaps surprisingly, stylistic influences from (or styles shared with) contemporary continental Europe have not been thoroughly examined in terms of the figurines. Given the strong shared material culture and recent focus on identifying religion and shared belief systems with the northern world, it is an automatic reaction to look toward Scandinavia to seek an explanation for phenomena in sixth- to seventh-century England. However, a house-shaped reliquary was discovered beneath a church altar at the abbey of Fleury, Saint-Benoit-sur-Loire in Loire (France), dating to the seventh or eighth century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1469605312469455">Perin and Fefferm, 1985</xref>). The reliquary is made from wood and copper-alloy plates with gold foil. The box measures 133 mm in length, 112 mm in height, 51 mm in width, and evidence suggests that it could have been suspended and possibly worn on the chest (1985: 142). All of the figures are rendered in gold foil, made through repoussé. Both of the longest sides carry images of six supposed angels (on one side one figure is represented with a sword, identified as the Archangel Michael). Represented on one end of the object, a male or female human figure without a mouth is rendered in an orans position (prayer gesture) with raised hands. The human figures on the longest sides are represented with five types of bodily postures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1469605312469455">Figure 5</xref>).
<fig id="fig5-1469605312469455" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>A house-shaped reliquary from the abbey of Fleury, Saint-Benoit-sur-Loire in Loire (France), which dates to the seventh or eighth century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1469605312469455">Perin and Fefferm, 1985</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1469605312469455-fig5.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Remarkably, two of these postures directly correspond with five of the figurines from early Anglo-Saxon England. The Halesworth, Eyke, Carlton Colville and Higham are all rendered with the left arm bent at the elbow and the hand resting on the chest, the right arm folded over the waist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1469605312469455">Figure 1</xref>). The Breach Downs figurine is represented in a similar bodily posture, but it is reversed – with the right hand on the chest and the left hand resting at the waist area. The reliquary carries four figures that are represented with their right hand on the chest and left hand at the waist, and two figures with their left hand on the chest and right hand at the waist. These five figurines thus share a closer stylistic connection with the Christian imagery on the Saint-Benoit-sur-Loire reliquary than the third- to fourth-century AD statue from Denmark. The reliquary is more proximate in chronological terms to the Anglo-Saxon figurines, thus suggesting that the Anglo-Saxon gestures have a stronger and more direct link with Merovingia then pre-Christian Scandinavia. However, the appearance of identical gestures across space and time in North Europe perhaps signifies a grammar of bodily gestures – perhaps pertinent to elites – which has been present as early as the fourth century. It is worth underlining that the Anglo-Saxon figurines share a similar stylistic appearance to figures from mid- to late-Anglo-Saxon manuscript illuminations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1469605312469455">Webster, 2012</xref>: 84). The figurines are rendered with an ‘elongated, linear treatment and distant frontal gaze’ which Webster suggests relates to a similar stylisation in ‘early medieval sacred images from Italy, Gaul and their Christian Germanic neighbours’ (2012: 84).</p>
<p>A Latin inscription on the reliquary provides a glimpse of possible commissioners and the act of gift-giving; the inscription reads that a person named Mumma made this reliquary for the love of St Mary and St Peter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1469605312469455">Perin and Fefferm, 1985</xref>: 142). The name Mumma can be ascribed to a male or female individual and so the person might have been an abbot or abbess (1985: 91, 142). It is equally possible that Mumma was an elite secular individual that donated a gift to the ecclesiastical institution. Interestingly, the figures represented on the reliquary lack religious paraphernalia, bar the Archangel Michael who carries a sword. We might expect, for example, such religious figures to carry a book or a bell, and might this, therefore, imply that this gesture was not a religious gesticulation? The repeated postural designs alongside the recognised orans position might imply that this posture had some meaningful significance. These item-free postures might have thus evoked some authoritative understanding and it is possible that such a bodily gesture might have derived from the secular world.</p>
<p>The notion of a secular gestural repertoire is not new for the medieval world – the Norwegian <italic>Speculum Regale</italic> (the king’s mirror) and the Germanic <italic>Sachsenspiegel</italic> (the Saxon mirror) provide textual evidence and illuminations that depict particular bodily expressions and describe their meaning. Recent advances in the study of representational art have successfully linked Migration and Viking Period Scandinavian metalwork carrying human figures with law texts written in the medieval period. <italic>Guldgubber</italic> (or gold foil) are small portable objects that carry human or animal images that were created by pressblech (or stamping) technique or they were cut out to form a human or animal figure, and range from 7–8 mm to over 30 mm in height (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1469605312469455">Ratke and Simek, 2006</xref>: 259; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1469605312469455">Watt, 1999</xref>). Figures with one hand clasping the wrist have been related to a thirteenth-century description in the Norwegian <italic>Speculum Regale</italic>. This accounts that it is good manners to approach the king with the right hand grasping the left wrist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1469605312469455">Watt, 1999</xref>: 182). In this way, the guldgubber have been linked to concepts of kingship. There is a substantial time gap between the guldgubber and the medieval manuscript, but it has been noted that the conservative nature of the legal procedures indicates that this is a very likely interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1469605312469455">Simek, 2002</xref>: 107). Moreover, this type of gestural expression was in use in classic and Christian art dating to the fourth century AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1469605312469455">Maguire, 2007</xref>: 154–155) and was not a <italic>Speculum Regale</italic> invention. Again, this points perhaps to the survival of specific bodily gesture. Humans depicted on gold foils have also been related to the dead. Figures with bent feet and knees, and with the palms of their hands showing, have been paralleled with illustrations from the manuscript <italic>Sachsenspiegel</italic>, which depicts a number of corpses in similar gestures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1469605312469455">Ratke and Simek, 2006</xref>: 260–263). In this interpretation, the body gesture does not indicate dance and life, but implies incapacity and the dead.</p>
<p>Although there are currently no known links between bodily gestures from later medieval texts and human representational art manufactured in Frankish continental Europe or early Anglo-Saxon England, the gestural connection between some of the figurines and the reliquary might indicate a performative and symbolic (secular or not) gestural expression. The remaining figurines with postural designs, although paralleled in Scandinavian art but not in Merovingian designs, could be construed on this basis as a range of further symbolic bodily expressions in use in this time period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1469605312469455"><title>Shifts in representational art</title>
<p>Shifts in representational art do not happen without cause but are generally stimulated by ‘associated changes in people’s bodily capacities and the corporeal modes through which they express the world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1469605312469455">Shilling, 2008</xref>: 148). The development of this object type suggests that there was some kind of social need for the represented full-body, singular and individualised male and female human forms. We might, therefore, question what can be suggested about the connection between the figurines and the transformation of bodily representation, and what this might tell us about society agency in early to mid-Anglo-Saxon England. From the above discussion there are two crucial aspects that need to be considered within the wider archaeological context of this time period: 1) the emergence of female representation and 2) the gestural expressions of the figurines.</p>
<p>Prior to the development of the figurines, the male image dominated the artistic repertoire, but was predominately rendered on female objects such as brooches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1469605312469455">Dickinson, 2009</xref>). The first decipherable depiction of the female body is thus a significant turning point in Anglo-Saxon art. If we are to assume that the figurines date to the seventh century, the emergence of female representation correlates with broader social transformations and shifting expressions of gender. Such social transformations include the increasing presence and influence of the Christian church and the development of kingdoms.</p>
<p>The change from furnished male or female graves to unfurnished graves within community cemeteries has been suggested to demark the shifting focus from an individual’s identity to the display of a family unit, thus strengthening family identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1469605312469455">Sayer, 2009</xref>; 2010). Whilst family units were strengthened, the male and female elite were choreographing perceptions of power and status within the landscape. Recent studies indicate the reformation of mortuary contexts and the emergence of female elite expressions and power by the mid-seventh century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1469605312469455">Geake, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1469605312469455">Williams, 2006</xref>). Whilst high-status females were interred within cemeteries outside the realm of the ecclesiastical institution, high-status males were buried within the boundaries of church buildings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1469605312469455">Petts, 2011</xref>: 107). This contrast, however, has been argued as not indicative of religious distinctions but a gender differentiation; women in this timeframe were buried with what could be described as Christian paraphernalia and iconography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1469605312469455">Petts, 2011</xref>: 108). A clear example of a new female expression is the high-status female grave at the seventh-century cemetery at Street House (Yorkshire). This corpse was adorned by the living with elite personal accessories and laid out in a bed burial in the centre of a rectilinear enclosure, which was constituted by male and female graves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1469605312469455">Sherlock and Simmons, 2008</xref>). These developments in the mortuary environment indicate new control over burial planning, but also new modes of expressing female identity and role in society.</p>
<p>Returning to the female figurines, their bodies were not inert but were represented with similar gestural expressions to the male counterparts. We might speculate that the development of both male and female figurines indicates a similar desire to produce a gendered expression. Might this imply that the users and wearers of these objects were both male and female? Certainly, at least one of the 12 figurines – a female figurine – was found in a female burial context.</p>
<p>It is not certain if the reliquary from France represents a gift from a secular elite or religious figure, or even if it was gifted from a male or female. The close correspondence, however, of the figures and their bodily postures with five of the Anglo-Saxon figurines indicates a formal gestural expression that seems to have been used in elite contexts. The figurines embody a fusion of ideas from the northern world and continental Europe, perhaps representing the development of an early (secular or not) elite society and the emergence of symbolic and performative gestural expressions in social systems. The production of male and female figurines that share similar hand postures is a highly distinctive development in representational art of this period. Indeed, the contrasting and distinct ways that high-status male and female individuals were commemorated in the seventh century have serious implications for the interpretation of the development of these figurines. What is more, this evidence strongly indicates that elite females were engaged in performative roles in conjunction with male elites within Anglo-Saxon society.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1469605312469455" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In the late sixth to seventh centuries new object types were deposited in graves. Figurines, however, are simply not found in grave contexts of this period (bar one), and this is not due to a lack of excavated burials or cemeteries across Britain. Such human sculptures are highly significant in the study of human and animal representation on portable art and mark a crucial development in representation of this time period. In terms of dating, a seventh-century context can be suggested. The diverse functional role of these objects indicates the social need for the full-bodied form and distinct hand postures. In Scandinavian Migration Period contexts, bodily gesture has been associated with authority, control and symbolic bodily behaviour. In a similar way, we might suggest that such bodily gestures of the figurines mark the development of appropriate gestural behaviour in ritualised contexts. The association with the contemporary Merovingian reliquary might not simply indicate stylistic influence, but a shared and symbolic gestural expression that developed in this time period or redeveloped out of an earlier era. Significantly, female representational art appears for the first time in Anglo-Saxon England and is a concurrent shift in the way the ideas of high-status females were redefined through commemorative practices. Both male and female figurines shared at least one type of bodily gesture – the hand over the chest and waist – which corresponds with the figure’s bodily posture on the reliquary from France. We might, therefore, suggest that these male and female figurines were used by both male and female elite individuals. Additionally, these sculptured gendered figures appear at the same time as the redevelopment of male and female commemorative practices in the seventh century. Perhaps both of these archaeologies hint at the shifting interplay between male and female expression and identity. As such, the three-dimensional human sculptures of both male and female figures are argued here as crucial, if rare, material evidence that feeds into a wider narrative of reformation of gendered expressions in an altering world and in an era of kingship and power.</p>
