<abstract>
<p>There is a growing emphasis on the role of organizations as settings for dissemination and implementation. Only recently has the field begun to consider features of organizations that affect dissemination and implementation of evidence-based interventions. This manuscript identifies and evaluates available measures for five key organizational-level constructs: (a) leadership, (b) vision, (c) managerial relations, (d) climate, and (e) absorptive capacity. Overall the picture was the same across the five constructs—no measure was used in more than one study, many studies did not report the psychometric properties of the measures, some assessments were based on a single response per unit, and the level of the instrument and analysis did not always match. One must seriously consider the development and evaluation of a robust set of measures that will serve as the basis of building the field, allow for comparisons across organizational types and intervention topics, and allow a robust area of dissemination and implementation research to develop.</p>

<p>Over the past several years researchers and practitioners alike have recognized the need for more research focused on the dissemination and implementation (D&amp;I) of evidence-based programs to promote health and manage chronic disease. Organizations (e.g., schools, workplaces, hospitals) are considered important settings for delivering health promotion interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090198111409748">Brownson, Haire-Joshu, &amp; Luke, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1090198111409748">Fielding, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1090198111409748">Katz, 2009</xref>). There is a reasonably robust literature across organizational settings on the delivery of health promotion interventions. However, only recently has the field begun to consider features of organizations that facilitate or inhibit the D&amp;I of evidence-based interventions.</p>
<p>Some of the earlier studies examining the role of organizations in the delivery of evidence-based interventions have considered primarily structural features, such as organization size, complexity, and formalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090198111409748">Drazin &amp; Schoonhoven, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1090198111409748">Emmons &amp; Biener, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090198111409748">Emmons et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1090198111409748">Emont &amp; Cummings, 1989</xref>). Some of these features may in fact reflect less tangible but perhaps more important characteristics of organizations in influencing D&amp;I decisions, such as organizational readiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1090198111409748">Weiner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1090198111409748">Weiner, Amick, &amp; Lee, 2008</xref>), leadership, climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1090198111409748">Helfrich, Weiner, McKinney, &amp; Minasian, 2007</xref>), and organizational culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090198111409748">Barnsley, Lemieux-Charles, &amp; McKinney, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1090198111409748">Ferlie, Gabbay, Fitzgerald, Locock, &amp; Dopson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1090198111409748">Kanter, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1090198111409748">Van de Ven, Polley, Garud, &amp; Venkataraman, 1999</xref>). For example, although organizational size has been well studied, it is likely a proxy for other determinants, such as extent of resources available and functional differentiation or specialization of roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1090198111409748">Greenhalgh, Robert, Macfarlane, Bate, &amp; Kyriakidou, 2004</xref>). Much of the literature at this point is conceptual, with a call for increased research examining the role of these factors in D&amp;I.</p>
<p>A key challenge in the transition from research focused on evidence generation to that focused on D&amp;I is the unit of analysis. The very nature of dissemination efforts often requires an organizational perspective, moving beyond the individual as the unit of analysis and exploring how organizational factors influence dissemination efforts. Although such an approach is relatively new in the health field, other fields have historically focused on organizations as a key intervention target (e.g., organizational behavior and theory, public policy, education) and have extensively used organizational-level measures to assess factors influencing organizational behavior and outcomes.</p>
<p>To build the field of D&amp;I research, we need reliable and valid measures. Recent reviews have reported a dearth of such measures even when considering the broader literature. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1090198111409748">Weiner (2009)</xref> recently developed a conceptual framework of organizational readiness to change and completed an extensive review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1090198111409748">Weiner et al., 2008</xref>) examining how organizational readiness for change has been defined and measured in health services research and other fields. Analysis of 106 peer-reviewed articles revealed conceptual ambiguities and disagreements and limited evidence of reliability or validity for most publicly available readiness measures.</p>
<p>As health promotion research increasingly examines organizational-level factors, the need for good operational definitions and measures of key organizational characteristics becomes clearer. The purpose of this article is to identify available measures for key organizational-level constructs that are important for D&amp;I research, to evaluate the measures’ psychometric properties, and to determine if additional measures are needed. A key goal from the outset was to recommend measures that appear to have sound psychometric properties so that a larger body of research using common measures could develop.</p>
<p>The starting point was to identify and evaluate the extant measures related to organizational factors. To guide this work, we selected Greenhalgh et al.’s (2004) conceptual framework for considering the determinants of D&amp;I within health service and delivery organizations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090198111409748">Figure 1</xref>). This framework identifies three categories of system antecedents for innovation that relate to the organizational-level factors that may influence dissemination outcomes: (a) structure, (b) absorptive capacity for new knowledge, and (c) receptive context for change. Since there has been considerable attention in the literature to structural variables, for this review we focused on absorptive capacity and four features of receptive context (leadership, vision, managerial relations, and climate). We provide a brief review of the literature for each of these five constructs below.</p>

<title>Leadership</title>
<p>Although leadership has been studied since the 1930s, it is a difficult construct to define and measure. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090198111409748">Aditya (2004)</xref> argues that leadership centers on both the creation and achievement of goals. The Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness program (GLOBE), a network of researchers who seek to identify effective “universal and culture-specific” leader behaviors and organizational practices, has defined leadership as “the ability of an individual to influence, motivate, and enable others to contribute toward the effectiveness and success of organizations of which they are members” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1090198111409748">House et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Leadership is thought to be an important component of organizational change and may be particularly important in terms of encouraging members of an organization to think in new ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1090198111409748">Van de Ven et al., 1999</xref>). Leadership style also has important implications for power balances, social relationships within the organization and across systems, and institutional attitude and approach toward risk taking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1090198111409748">Kanter, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1090198111409748">Van de Ven et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1090198111409748">
<title>Vision</title>
<p>Although vision is often seen as a leader’s ability to create and communicate clear direction and rationale for the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090198111409748">Alexander, Zakocs, Earp, &amp; French, 2006</xref>), it can also be conceptualized as a separate construct that cuts across multiple levels within a given organization. Vision has been defined as a guiding theme or overriding principle that steers the organization, articulating the desired direction and intentions for the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1090198111409748">Reh, n.d.</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1090198111409748">West (1990)</xref> defines vision as “an idea of a valued outcome which represents a higher order goal and a motivating force at work” (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198111409748">Anderson &amp; West, 1998</xref>). From a theoretical perspective, we would expect that having a clear vision that values innovation sets the stage for adoption and implementation of new health programs. We might also expect that a clear vision would allow members of an organization to adequately assess whether or not an innovation matches with the existing organizational values and goals of the organization, a concept known as <italic>compatibility</italic>, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1090198111409748">Rogers’s (1995)</xref> diffusion of innovation theory.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1090198111409748">
<title>Managerial Relations</title>
<p>A simple definition for good managerial relations is the positive alliances between groups within an organization to promote change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1090198111409748">Pettigrew, Ferlie, &amp; McKee, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1090198111409748">Shortell, Morrison, &amp; Friedman, 1990</xref>). In clinical settings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1090198111409748">Shortell et al. (1990)</xref> emphasized the significance of (a) looking for common ground, (b) involving selected physicians early on in planning, (c) carefully identifying the needs and interests of key physicians, and (d) working on a daily basis to build a climate of trust, honesty, and effective communications. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1090198111409748">Pettigrew et al. (1992)</xref> also proposed that manager–clinician relations are easier when negative stereotypes have been broken down and that it is important to understand what clinicians value. In fact, managers who were best at promoting change had semi-immersed themselves in the world of clinicians, understood the implications of medical work flow, and perhaps even helped clinicians do their own planning as a way of earning trust.</p>

<sec id="section4-1090198111409748">
<title>Climate</title>
<p>Climate describes organizational members’ perceptions of their work environment. Climate captures the meaning or significance that organizational members perceive in organizational policies, procedures, and practices. These perceptions enable organizational members to interpret current events, predict possible outcomes, and gauge the appropriateness of their own actions and those of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1090198111409748">Jones &amp; James, 1979</xref>).</p>
<p>There is some debate as to whether climate is a homologous multi-level construct. Some argue that the construct’s meaning, measurement, and relations with other variables differ across levels of analysis. Reflecting this position, scholars distinguish between psychological climate, a property of individuals that refers to personal perceptions of work environment, and organizational climate, which is a property of the collective and refers to shared perceptions of work environment.</p>
<p>Climate is also a multifaceted construct. In a classic formulation, James and his colleagues identified five primary work environment facets: (a) job characteristics, (b) role characteristics, (c) leadership characteristics, (d) work group and social environment characteristics, and (e) organizational and subsystem attributes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1090198111409748">L. R. James &amp; Sells, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1090198111409748">Jones &amp; James, 1979</xref>). More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1090198111409748">Patterson et al. (2005)</xref> identified 17 facets of work environment. Confirmatory factor analysis provides support for both approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1090198111409748">L. A. James &amp; James, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1090198111409748">Patterson et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1090198111409748">
<title>Absorptive Capacity</title>
<p>An important albeit quite understudied construct is absorptive capacity, or an organization’s ability to access and effectively use information. absorptive capacity was originally conceptualized as an organization’s cognitive structures and prior related knowledge that underline learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090198111409748">Cohen &amp; Levinthal, 1990</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1090198111409748">Zahra and George (2002)</xref> expanded this definition to include (a) a broad set of skills needed to deal with and modify transferred knowledge and (b) the organization’s capacity to learn and solve problems. This construct reflects the process by which ideas from outside the organization are captured, circulated internally, adapted for the organizational culture/environment, internalized, and integrated into organizational routines. absorptive capacity reflects an organization’s ability to find and use knowledge. In the theoretical literature, there is a discussion of potential versus realized absorptive capacity, with the former focusing on organizational capability for knowledge acquisition/assimilation and the latter focused on use of absorbed knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090198111409748">Cohen &amp; Levinthal, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090198111409748">Daghfous, 2004</xref>), suggesting that an organization’s absorptive capacity depends on that of its individual members but is not simply a summation of individual capacity. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090198111409748">Caccia-Bava, Guimaraes, and Harrington (2006)</xref> point out, organizational absorptive capacity is best understood in terms of the structures that allow multiple organizational members to gather, communicate, apply, and exploit diverse knowledge within the organization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1090198111409748" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>In order to identify measures of these five constructs, we searched the peer-reviewed literature using PubMed, CINAHL®, and ISI Web of Science<sup>SM</sup>. With assistance from a reference librarian, we formulated a set of search strings that combined each of the target organizational constructs (organization, climate, managerial relations, leadership, vision, absorptive capacity) and the following terms: <italic>innovation, diffusion, adoption, implementation</italic>, and <italic>health.</italic> All search strings included the target construct and “health” and were applied to the title, abstract, and keyword list. We added wildcard characters to all terms in order to capture potentially important permutations (e.g., innovate, innovating, innovative, and innovation). We restricted the search to English-only articles. Overall, we identified 1,178 articles in PubMed, 946 articles in CINAHL®, and 1,698 articles in ISI Web of Science. The distribution of these articles by construct is outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1090198111409748">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>From the articles identified, we then reviewed the abstracts using four predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria. First, articles had to report original empirical research and appear in a peer-reviewed journal. Second, articles had to mention the organizational construct or a close synonym in the abstract and use a quantitative measure of the construct. Third, articles had to include a measured outcome relevant to innovation, diffusion, adoption, or implementation. Examples of such outcomes include implementation of an innovation, defined as a new program, product, service, practice, or technology; the spread of an innovation through an organization or social system; the decision to use an innovation; the process of putting an innovation into practice; and the level of initial use of an innovation, or the sustained use of an innovation beyond an initial trial period. Finally, articles had to focus on a health service or health-related intervention or outcome. Research studies involving schools, businesses, or other organizational settings were included if they focused on a health-related intervention, such as an employee wellness program or a tobacco cessation program.</p>
<p>We assigned each article retained after full-text review a unique identification number and used a structured data abstraction form to extract key information from each article (e.g., study setting, construct name, construct dimensionality, number of items, and construct level). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1090198111409748">Table 2</xref> shows the “dictionary” that we used to structure the data abstraction form. We then created tables to display, categorize, and analyze the information we extracted.</p>

<p>We used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1090198111409748">Trochim and Donnelly’s (2007)</xref> classification of validity and reliability types (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1090198111409748">Table 3</xref>), in which <italic>construct validity</italic> is regarded as an umbrella term that includes translational validity and criterion-related validity. Translational validity includes face and content validity. Criterion-related validity includes predictive, concurrent, convergent, and discriminant validity. Reliability includes interrater or interobserver reliability, parallel forms reliability, test–retest reliability, and interitem reliability (e.g., Cronbach’s alpha). In this review, we combined face and content validity into a single category. We did the same for the various forms of reliability assessment.</p>

<tr>
<td>Construct validity</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td> Translation validity</td>
<td>The degree to which an instrument accurately translates (or carries) the meaning of the construct</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>  Face validity</td>
<td>A summary perception that an instrument’s items to translate or carry the meaning of the construct. Procedures for assessing face validity include informal review by experts or more formal review through a Delphi process</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>  Content validity</td>
<td>A check of instrument’s items against the content domain of the construct. Examples include expert review based on a clear definition of the construct and a checklist of characteristics that describe the construct. If the construct is multidimensional, factor analysis could be used to verify the existence of those theoretically meaningful dimensions</td>

<td> Criterion-related validity</td>
<td>An empirical check on the performance of an instrument against some criteria</td>

<td>  Predictive validity</td>
<td>The degree to which an instrument predicts a theoretically meaningful outcome. Examples include regression analysis in which the instrument serves as an independent variable. Predictive validity is not demonstrated if the instrument serves as a dependent variable</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>  Concurrent validity</td>
<td>The degree to which an instrument distinguishes groups it should theoretically distinguish (e.g., a depression screener distinguishes depressed and nondepressed patients)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>  Convergent validity</td>
<td>The degree to which an instrument performs in a similar manner to other instruments that purportedly measure the same construct (e.g., two measures show a strong positive correlation). Convergent validity is most often assessed through confirmatory factor analysis</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>  Discriminant validity</td>
<td>The degree to which an instrument performs in a different manner to other instruments that purportedly measure different constructs (e.g., the two measures show a zero or negative correlation). Discriminant validity is most often assessed through confirmatory factor analysis</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reliability</td>
<td>The consistency or repeatability of an instrument’s measurement. Examples include interrater or interobserver reliability, test–retest reliability, parallel forms reliability, and internal consistency reliability (e.g., Cronbach’s alpha)</td>

<p>The articles examined various leadership dimensions, including commitment, clarity, champion, transformational leadership, style, competence, and administrative support, among others. The measures of leadership included 1 to 45 items. Several articles measured more than one dimension of leadership; in all, there were 16 leadership measures identified across the 12 studies reviewed.</p>
<p>Five articles (42%) reported measurement of the leadership construct at the organizational level of analysis. One article (8%) measured the construct at the team level of analysis, and two articles (16%) assessed leadership at the individual level of analysis; one article (8%) measured leadership at both the individual level and organizational level of analysis; one article (8%) measured leadership at the team and organizational levels; and two articles (16%) measured the construct at the individual level and then combined responses to create a team level variable. Among the articles that described leadership measured at either the team or organizational level, two used assessments of leadership based on a single response per unit, eight studies based the assessment on multiple respondents per unit, and one article did not report the number of responses per unit used.</p>
<p>Organizational leadership was examined in the context of several dissemination-related outcomes. Nine (75%) focused on innovation implementation, one (8%) focused on innovation sustainability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1090198111409748">Evashwick &amp; Ory, 2003</xref>), and two (16%) focused on innovation adoption and innovation sustainability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1090198111409748">Thaker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1090198111409748">Weiner, Alexander, &amp; Shortell, 1996</xref>).

<p>There was no agreement across the articles about how leadership should be assessed; our review identified 16 different measures to assess organizational leadership in dissemination-related studies, with no measures used in more than one study.</p>
<p>Psychometric properties of instruments were reported in some of the studies. Four studies (33% of articles, representing five measures) reported face/content validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090198111409748">Bin Saeed, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1090198111409748">McFadden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1090198111409748">Roberts-Gray, Gingiss, &amp; Boerm, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1090198111409748">Somech, 2006</xref>). Five studies (42%) reported reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090198111409748">Bin Saeed, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1090198111409748">Livet, Courser, &amp; Wandersman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1090198111409748">Marchionni &amp; Ritchie, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1090198111409748">McFadden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1090198111409748">Somech, 2006</xref>). Ten of the leadership constructs measured either reported on or exhibited predictive validity for dissemination related outcomes. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090198111409748">Bin Saeed (1995)</xref> collected data from 202 physicians across three hospitals in Saudi Arabia to determine factors associated with implementation of a hospital-based quality assurance (QA) program. Using factor analysis to identify dimensions related to implementing QA programs, an 11-item scale was created for “leadership commitment.” In a subsequent analysis using multiple regression, this leadership construct was significantly associated with implementation of the QA program. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1090198111409748">West et al. (2003)</xref> measured leadership clarity among 3,447 respondents from health care teams in the United Kingdom. Leadership clarity predicted levels of innovation among community mental health teams and breast cancer care teams but not among primary health care teams. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1090198111409748">Table 6</xref> summarizes the psychometric properties assessed in each study.</p>

Shared vision was measured with four items and was based on a single response per unit. Presence of a well-defined vision was measured with a one item question. Inamdar et al. also assessed the extent to which barriers were overcome by successful implementation of the innovative strategy and had interviewees rate (from 1% to 100%) the extent to which the <italic>vision barrier</italic> (lack of vision related to adoption and implementation) was overcome.

<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1090198111409748">Livet et al.

In the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1090198111409748">Inamdar et al. (2002)</xref> study, interviewers asked executives of health care organizations that were early adopters of an organizational strategy framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1090198111409748">Kaplan &amp; Norton, 1992</xref>) whether or not their organization had a well-defined vision. All but one of these organizations reported having a well-defined vision. These same respondents later rated the extent to which the barriers of having “a lack of vision” was overcome (i.e., the strategy is understood by most of the organization); the average rating was 77%.</p>

Practical management support, a facility-level variable, was measured using a summary index created from eight dichotomous items about the presence of specific practical expressions of management support for the advanced clinic access (ACA) initiative at the facility (Cronbach’s alpha not reported). Contrary to their hypotheses, only personal leadership support was significantly associated with greater ACA implementation (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1090198111409748">Table 6</xref>). Of note, these two dimensions just included items on communication (“. . . talking about the ACA” at facility “town meeting” events and staff meetings as well as presentations by clinical staff at managerial meetings) and did not encompass the other characteristics of positive alliances described by Shortell et al (2004; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1090198111409748">Pettigrew et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1090198111409748">Shortell et al., 1990</xref>), which include (a) looking for common ground, (b) involving selected physicians early in planning, (c) identifying the needs and interests of key physicians, (d) daily efforts to build a climate of trust and honesty, (e) breaking down negative stereotypes, and (f) understanding what physicians valued.</p>

<title>Description of articles</title>
<p>Of the 14 articles that examined the association of organizational climate and innovation dissemination in health, 4 (29%) focused on health care organizations, 1 (7%) focused on public health organizations, 4 (29%) focused on schools, 3 (21%) focused on mental health or substance abuse organizations, and 2 (14%) focused on more than one type of organization (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1090198111409748">Table 4</xref>). Six articles measured organizational climate as a one-dimensional construct; these measures of climate included from 1 to 32 items. Eight articles measured organizational climate as a multidimensional construct; these measures included 16 to 39 items.</p>
<p>The majority of articles (<italic>n</italic> = 11) assessed organizational climate at the organization level of analysis. In all but one case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090198111409748">Brownson et al., 2007</xref>), team-level or organization-level assessments of climate were based on the perceptions of multiple respondents per unit. The articles also examined the association of organizational climate with a variety of dissemination-related outcomes, although the majority focused on adoption (5 articles [36%]; e.g., presence of innovative medical imaging technologies), and implementation (6 articles [43%]; e.g., therapist adherence to multisystemic therapy). Two articles (14%) focused on sustained innovation use (e.g., institutionalization of obesity prevention interventions in schools). In all but one case, the level of the outcome variable matched the level of the climate variable. Only <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1090198111409748">Schoenwald, Carter, Chapman, and Sheidow (2008)</xref> examined the possibility of cross-level effects—that is, the effects of organizational climate on aggregate (i.e., organization-level) and individual-level therapist adherence to multisystemic therapy.</p>

<title>Analysis of instruments for measuring organizational climate</title>
<p>Of the 14 articles reviewed, there were 14 instruments used to assess organizational climate. In other words, each article used a different instrument.</p>
<p>Nine (64%) of the studies reviewed used in whole or in part well-researched, standardized instruments to assess organizational climate. Examples include the Team Climate Inventory, Creative Climate Questionnaire (CCQ), the Organizational Social Context instrument, the Charles F. Kettering School Climate Scale, the Texas Christian University Organizational Readiness for Change instrument, and the Organizational Climate Questionnaire (OCQ). Not surprisingly, the psychometric properties of these instruments are better understood than those of locally adapted, exploratory instruments. Even for these well-researched instruments, however, questions remain about their validity and reliability. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1090198111409748">Mathisen and Einarsen (2004)</xref> raised questions about the translational validity of the CCQ. Although the instrument’s developer defined climate as an organizational attribute, the CCQ measured individual perceptions of the work environment. These authors also note that instrument’s developer has not presented sufficient information to support his claim that the CCQ has adequate psychometric properties. Similarly, several authors have raised doubts—based on empirical study—about the factor structure of the OCQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1090198111409748">Hellriegel &amp; Slocum, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1090198111409748">Patterson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1090198111409748">Simms &amp; Lafollette, 1975</xref>). It remains unclear whether these scales developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1090198111409748">Litwin and Stringer (1968)</xref> and subsequently used in two of the studies included in this review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1090198111409748">Nystrom, Ramamurthy, &amp; Wilson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1090198111409748">Wilson, Ramamurthy, &amp; Nystrom, 1999</xref>) actually measure what they purport to measure. Likewise, the climate scales in the Texas Christian University instrument have displayed variable levels of reliability across types of respondents and settings. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1090198111409748">Lehman, Greener, and Simpson (2002)</xref>, computed alpha coefficients for each of the six climate scales for administrators, staff, and programs. Six of the 18 alpha coefficients were below the accepted .70 threshold. Other studies also report variable levels of reliability for climate scales, with some also reporting alpha coefficients well below .70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1090198111409748">Rampazzo, De Angeli, Serpelloni, Simpson, &amp; Flynn, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1090198111409748">Saldana, Chapman, Henggeler, &amp; Rowland, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The climate instruments included in this review exhibited mixed results in terms of predictive validity (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1090198111409748">Table 6</xref>). Three (21%) instruments showed statistically significant associations with dissemination-related outcomes in health. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090198111409748">Allen, Lehrner, Mattison, Miles, and Russell (2007)</xref> observed a positive, significant relationship between organizational climate—which they measured as perceived organizational support—and the frequency with which health care providers screened patients for possible domestic violence. In an organizational sample that included medical research and services firms, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090198111409748">Choi, Andersen, and Veillette (2009)</xref> found that an unsupportive organizational climate inhibited employee creativity. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1090198111409748">Wilson et al. (1999)</xref> observed in correlation analysis that organizations with more risk-oriented climates tended to adopt more radical innovations and innovations that provide greater relative advantage.</p>
<p>Eight (57%) instruments exhibited only partial evidence of predictive validity for dissemination-related outcomes in health. In most cases, some of the dimensions of organizational climate assessed by the instrument were significantly associated with some of the dissemination-related outcomes examined in the study. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198111409748">Anderson and West (1998)</xref> found that one dimension of team climate, support for innovation, emerged as the only significant predictor of overall innovation and innovation novelty. Another dimension of team climate, participative safety, emerged as the best predictor of the number of innovations. It also emerged as the best predictor of team self-reports of innovativeness. A third dimension of team climate, task orientation, predicted innovations’ anticipated administrative efficiency. Finally, as <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1090198111409748">Table 6</xref> shows, well-researched climate instruments exhibit no greater predictive validity than locally developed, exploratory ones, at least with regard to dissemination-related outcomes in health. It is difficult to interpret the mixed results observed in these and other studies included in this review because the statistically significant relationships between climate dimensions and dissemination-related outcomes displayed no obvious pattern.</p>

<title>Absorptive Capacity</title>
<sec id="section21-1090198111409748">
<title>Description of articles</title>
<p>Of the three articles that examined the association of absorptive capacity and dissemination in health, one focused on health care organizations, one focused on private substance abuse organizations, and one focused on governmental health ministries and hospitals (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1090198111409748">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Analysis of instruments for measuring absorptive capacity</title>
<p>There was no agreement across the three studies reviewed in terms of how absorptive capacity was measured. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090198111409748">Caccia-Bava et al. (2006)</xref> defined and measured two dimensions of absorptive capacity: managerial knowledge and communication. The communication dimension encompassed communication channels, cross-function teams for knowledge integration, and communication boundary spanners. Both dimensions were related to hospitals’ IT adoption, the dependent variable. This study also examined the relationship between absorptive capacity and organizational culture; strong developmental and rational cultures and weaker hierarchical culture were significantly related to both dimensions of absorptive capacity (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1090198111409748">Table 6</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1090198111409748">Knudsen and Roman (2004)</xref> defined and assessed absorptive capacity across three different dimensions, including workforce professionalism, environmental scanning, and satisfaction among client referral sources and third-party payers. The dependent variable was organizational adoption of treatment innovations. They found partial support for workforce professionalism as a predictor of innovation adoption; both environmental scanning and satisfaction were associated with innovation adoption.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090198111409748">Belkhodja, Amara, Landry, and Ouimet (2007)</xref> defined absorptive capacity as the size of the unit, as an estimate of its capacity to acquire/absorb knowledge, and the presence in the unit of people who were paid to do research. The dependent variable was whether or not governmental health service organizations used research, assessed for seven types of activities: (a) received research results for areas of responsibility, (b) understood research results, (c) referenced research evidence, (d) adapted research results to provide information to decision makers, (e) promoted adoption of research evidence, (f) made professional decisions based on evidence, and (g) made concrete changes in services provided based on use of research evidence. Absorptive capacity was associated with research utilization. However, the individual components of absorptive capacity had different relationships with research utilization in different kinds of health organizations. Being a medium-size unit was related with research utilization in health ministries and hospitals but not in regional health authorities; being a smaller unit was associated with higher research utilization in regional authorities, as did having paid research staff.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>There is currently a growing emphasis on the D&amp; I of evidence-based strategies at the organizational level. The standard methodologies used in the health promotion and disease prevention literature to create evidence (e.g., randomized trials) have serious limitations for research focused on <italic>how</italic> to disseminate evidence-based interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1090198111409748">Mercer, DeVinney, Fine, Green, &amp; Dougherty, 2007</xref>). Attention to measurement issues is critical if we are to make progress in both understanding the factors that influence dissemination and for developing approaches to accelerate the adoption and use of evidence-based strategies in practice and community settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090198111409748">Bowen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1090198111409748">Weiner, 2009</xref>). The development of this area of research will benefit from the use of good measures with adequate psychometric properties.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article was to identify available measures for five key systems antecedents hypothesized to be important for D&amp; I research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1090198111409748">Greenhalgh et al., 2004</xref>), to report on the measures’ psychometric properties, and to develop a compendium of measures that could be recommended for use. We limited our review to peer-reviewed empirical research that focused on outcomes related to innovation, diffusion, adoption, or implementation; that assessed the construct at the organizational level; and that used a quantitative measure of the construct. Some of the constructs we studied have a larger quantitative literature (e.g., climate, leadership) than others (e.g., managerial relations, absorptive capacity), and thus we expected that we might be able to make more recommendations for measures for those constructs. Overall, however, the picture was the same across the five constructs—no measure of a specific construct was used in more than one study, many studies did not report the psychometric properties of the measures, some assessments were based on a single response per unit, and the level of the instrument did not always match the level of analysis. Thus, we are unable to make any recommendations for specific instruments in any of the five constructs evaluated.</p>
<p>A key issue with the majority of the constructs measured is that they might not be homologous multilevel constructs. That is, the construct’s meaning, measurement, and relationships with other variables differ across levels of analysis. Construct validity issues arise when an organizational characteristic is measured at the individual level of analysis when such measures do not convey the construct’s emphasis on <italic>shared</italic> perceptions of the organization. Construct validity issues also arise when data regarding organizational characteristics are obtained from only one individual. One cannot ascertain from a single respondent the extent to which other organizational members share his or her perceptions across the organization. As more research is done using these constructs, it would significantly benefit the field if extant measures were evaluated and built on, rather than new measures being created for each inquiry. Across all of the constructs, there is a significant need for strong psychometric evaluations of the measures’ properties, and in particular a focus on predictive validity across a range of D&amp; I outcomes. Of particular concern is the considerable diversity in how the constructs are measured, which suggests a lack of theoretical agreement on the constructs’ meaning. This highlights the need for more theoretical work, particularly for construct that do not seem homologous. The need for more careful attention to measurement practices was also apparent in this review. When theory suggests that consensus is important, then it is critical to have more than one respondent. In addition, when multiple respondents are used, it is important to conduct the appropriate statistical tests (e.g., within-group agreement statistics) before aggregating to higher levels of analysis.</p>
<p>Three limitations merit discussion. First, our review only covered those articles published in peer-reviewed journals. Our review could be subject to a publication bias if the “gray literature” contains reliable, valid measures of system antecedents for D&amp; I that do not also appear in peer-reviewed articles. Second, our review included only articles that contained the term <italic>health</italic> in the title, abstract, or keyword list. Restricting the search in this way facilitated the review by eliminating articles that did not focus on health-related D&amp; I issues, our principal concern. However, our search might have missed articles that included disease-specific terms such as <italic>diabetes, cancer, stroke</italic>, or <italic>HIV</italic> rather than the broader term <italic>health</italic>. Finally, our review includes only articles that contained a measured outcome relevant to innovation, diffusion, adoption, or implementation. Although we accepted a broad range of outcomes within these domains, we excluded articles that measured outcomes in terms of organizational members’ knowledge, attitudes, or behavioral intentions. Researchers interested in reliable, valid measures of system antecedents relevant to these important precursors to D&amp; I should exercise care in interpreting and using the results of our review.</p>
<p>It is likely that the concerns raised in this review of measures of systems antecedents of D&amp; I are relevant to other organizational constructs, as was noted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1090198111409748">Weiner et al.’s (2008)</xref> evaluation of measures of organizational readiness. It is important for health promotion researchers to recognize that there is a large literature in other fields focusing on organizational assessment beyond the health sector. Inclusion of this literature was beyond the scope of this review, but it may include measures that would be useful in the health context. If we are to build a literature that addresses how to effectively disseminate and implement evidence-based health interventions, we must consider the development and evaluation of a robust set of measures that will serve as the basis of building the field, allowing for comparisons across organizational types and intervention topics, and will allow a robust area of research to develop.</p>
