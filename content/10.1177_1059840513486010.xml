<abstract>
<p>The perspectives of parents of private middle school students regarding the use of school-located immunization programs (SLIPs) are unknown. Parents of private middle school students in a large, urban setting were surveyed (<italic>N</italic> = 1,210) regarding their willingness to use SLIPs. Analyses included frequencies and chi-square analyses. Data from prior work with public school parents were included for comparison. Of the 1,210 questionnaires, 219 were returned; only 19% of respondents reported they were willing to use a SLIP, compared to 41% of public middle school parents. However, 54% of private school parents were willing to consider using SLIPs for influenza vaccine, and 6% would use SLIPs for human papillomavirus vaccine. Hispanic (Mexican) ethnicity (<italic>p</italic> = .014) was associated with greater willingness to utilize SLIPs. Private middle school parents, in this sample, are relatively unwilling to utilize SLIPs compared to public school parents. These data should be considered when implementing SLIPs in the future.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The current recommended childhood and adolescent immunization schedules promulgated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840513486010">CDC, 2012</xref>), the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians call for all adolescents to receive the tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine, three doses of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, and one dose of meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4; with a booster at age 16) at the 11- to 12-year medical visit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840513486010">CDC, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840513486010">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840513486010">“Recommended Childhood,” 2012</xref>). The schedule also recommends annual influenza (flu) vaccination and “catch-up” for any needed measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), Hepatitis A and B, and varicella vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840513486010">CDC, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840513486010">“Recommended Childhood,” 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>School-based immunization programs are being explored as a delivery method for adolescent vaccinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840513486010">Cawley, Hull, &amp; Rousculp, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840513486010">Clevenger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840513486010">Cooper Robbins, Ward, &amp; Skinner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840513486010">Hull &amp; Ambrose, 2011</xref>). The perspectives of parents of public middle school students concerning school-based immunization programs have been assessed and indicate significant willingness to use school-located immunization programs (SLIPs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840513486010">Middleman &amp; Tung, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840513486010">2010b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840513486010">2011</xref>). Little is known about the perspectives of the parents of private middle school students and their willingness to utilize a SLIP. The purpose of this project is to determine the perspectives of private middle school parents regarding SLIPs, their willingness to utilize these programs, and what vaccinations they would allow their child to receive in a school-based immunization program. As SLIPs require the participation, to varying degrees, of school nurses, these data may help nurses, both in public and private schools, guide discussions regarding the feasibility of SLIP implementation in their schools.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1059840513486010" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>During the 2011–2012 school year, questionnaires (<italic>N</italic> = 1,210) were distributed to private middle school parents concerning their perspectives regarding SLIPs. This descriptive study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Baylor College of Medicine.</p>
<sec id="section3-1059840513486010">
<title>Study Population</title>
<p>Using a list of private middle schools located within a large Texas metropolitan area and surrounding communities, 18 private middle schools were contacted via telephone. The 18 schools were selected for relatively large (&gt;100) enrollment of middle school students (Grades 6–8). Only six schools agreed to participate in this study. All but one of the participating schools had some historical religious affiliation, but the degree of religiosity in the school, per their stated curricula, varied with each school.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1059840513486010">
<title>Questionnaire Distribution</title>
<p>Questionnaires were either distributed during school hours to the middle school (sixth–eighth grade) students (three schools), or, per school preference, were distributed via e-mail newsletters the school already had in place (three schools). All schools, with the exception of one, collected the completed surveys at their schools; one school advised parents who wanted to participate to send completed surveys to the principal investigator directly via postal service. The schools that distributed the questionnaire during class instructed students to give the questionnaire to their parents to complete at home. The schools using e-mail sent the questionnaires directly to the parents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1059840513486010">
<title>Questionnaire</title>
<p>The 13-item questionnaire was adapted from a questionnaire distributed to public middle school parents; few items were changed to accommodate the private school setting. Questionnaires were accompanied by a cover letter that briefly described the study, informed parents that participation was voluntary, and noted that all information would be confidential. Questionnaires were offered in English and Spanish.</p>
<p>Demographic data collected included race/ethnicity, number of children for whom the parent/guardian is responsible for, and the primary language spoken at home. Also included was whether the child has a medical home (defined as a regular place to go for medical checkups and immunizations/shots where they have a medical record for the child), time since the last visit to the medical home, site of the last immunization the child received, when the last immunization was given, and possible future sites or locations to receive immunizations. Parents were asked to “check all boxes that apply” for the various locations at which they were willing to access their child’s immunizations: “medical home,” “neighborhood doctor’s office,” “emergency room,” “city or county health clinic,” “mobile clinic,” “school-based program,” “pharmacy,” or “other.” Parents who did not choose “school-based program” as a preference were asked to “check all boxes that apply” regarding the reason: “it is not the school’s business,” “it is not safe,” “I want to be present,” “I want my child’s doctor’s office to have records,” and “other.” These choices were chosen and reviewed by several vaccine experts. Parents were further asked which vaccines they would feel comfortable having their child receive from a SLIP during school hours. Using the same format of “check all boxes that apply,” parents were given the options of Tdap, HPV, Varicella, MMR, Influenza, MCV4, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B vaccines, or other (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended vaccines). Parents were asked if they would be willing to pay for an immunization, and, if yes, how much they would pay per vaccine ($10, $20, $30, $40, or “other”). Finally, parents were asked if they knew if there were any vaccines recommended for 11- to 12-year-olds and if their child was enrolled in the state’s Immunization Information System.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1059840513486010">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>The primary dependent variable was willingness of parents to have their child use a SLIP as a location for vaccinations. Frequency tables and chi-square tests were performed using SPSS 19.0 to determine association between predictors and outcome variables. Significance was defined as a <italic>p </italic>value &lt; .05.</p>
<p>Data from two similar studies conducted previously in the same area among the parents of public middle school students were included in the data tables to more readily compare the data regarding SLIPs obtained from private versus public middle school parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840513486010">Middleman &amp;Tung, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840513486010">2010b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840513486010">2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1059840513486010">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Approximately 1,210 questionnaires were distributed to parents of the six private middle schools that participated in the study. Two hundred and nineteen surveys were returned and included in the analysis. The return rate was 18%. Of note, the return rate varied per distribution method used: 30% for those schools where parents received the questionnaire in paper form from schools and 5% for those schools that e-mailed the questionnaire to parents (questionnaires returned either by hand or by post).</p>
<sec id="section8-1059840513486010">
<title>Study Population</title>
<p>The majority of participants (98.6%) was White, spoke English, and indicated that their child had a regular medical home. Five of the six schools had varying degrees of religious affiliation; further details include that only 63.3% of parents/guardians indicated that they knew if there are vaccines recommended specifically for 11- to 12-year-olds, and 13.9% of participants reported that their child was enrolled in the state’s IIS. Key data regarding the study participants are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059840513486010">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study, exploring the perspectives of private middle school parents regarding the use of SLIPs, demonstrates a relative lack of willingness among parents of private middle school students to utilize SLIPs. Data from this analysis imply that SLIPs may be more successfully utilized in public schools versus private schools. Nearly 100% of the private school parents versus 76% of public school parents indicated that their child had a medical home. Almost all (95%) private school versus 71% of public school parents from a previous study stated their child had had an immunization in the past 2 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840513486010">Middleman &amp; Tung, 2010a</xref>), indicating a significant difference in the potential need for SLIPs across private versus public school settings. Perhaps, the most significant indicator that the need for SLIPs may be greater in public school settings is the data concerning willingness to utilize various nontraditional immunization sites (locations other than the medical home). While only 19% of private school respondents selected school-based immunization programs as a potential vaccination site for their child, 41% of public school parents/guardians indicated that they would use a SLIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840513486010">Middleman &amp; Tung, 2010a</xref>).</p>
<p>As noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1059840513486010">Table 3</xref>, there are some comparable data among public/private middle school parents regarding vaccines they are willing to allow their child to receive in school. Among both public and private school respondents, influenza is the vaccine the majority of parents are willing to have their child receive at school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840513486010">Middleman &amp; Tung, 2010b</xref>). Overall, parents chose the HPV vaccine with the least frequency for administration in a SLIP. Private school parents, in particular, seem even less willing than public school parents to have their child receive it at school. Only 6% of private school participants were willing to have their child receive HPV vaccine at school, compared to 27% of public school parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840513486010">Middleman &amp; Tung, 2010b</xref>). While data are lacking, one possible explanation for the difference in willingness to receive flu versus HPV vaccine via SLIP is that flu vaccine is recommended annually; parents may feel that the vaccine is perhaps “safer” or that the convenience of a SLIP is more important if the vaccine is recommended every year. The lack of willingness related to the HPV vaccine is likely due to the relative “newness” of the vaccine, which contributes to vaccine hesitancy in general.</p>
<p>Another difference noted among private and public school respondents is their knowledge of the recommended vaccines for 11- to 12-year-olds. Sixty-three percent of private school respondents indicated that they knew there were recommended vaccines, compared to only 38% of public school respondents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840513486010">Middleman &amp; Tung, 2010b</xref>). Private school parents reported greater English proficiency, which may contribute to greater knowledge; however, private school parents were also surveyed 3 years after the public school parents, allowing for greater dissemination of information, through exposure to provider education, school education, and peer education.</p>
<p>The only factor associated with site preference among private school parents was ethnicity. As seen in previous studies, Hispanic ethnicity is associated with a greater willingness to use a SLIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840513486010">Middleman &amp; Tung, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840513486010">2010b</xref>). Even though the private school study population differed greatly from the public school parents (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059840513486010">Table 1</xref>), this association remained constant between the different populations. SLIPs may have a greater likelihood for success among schools with higher proportions of Hispanic students; there appears to be a cultural difference in the willingness to utilize school sites for immunization.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There are several limitations to this study. The return rate of 18% and the number of participants, 219, was low, limiting the power and the generalizability of the study findings. The low participation rate is likely due to the several barriers encountered. For example, many private schools had policies against allowing research studies to be conducted in their schools, some expressed concerns about logistics such as distribution, while others noted lack of administrative approval. One school required parents to mail their responses, and all questionnaires sent home with students might not have reached parents. Due to the relative homogeneity of the study population, however, it is likely that responders and nonresponders did not differ significantly in demographics, decreasing the risk of selection bias based on demographic descriptors; the risk of selection bias based on respondents’ increased interest in vaccines in general, of course, remains a potential limitation. All data collected were self-reported, therefore responses cannot be validated. This study was conducted 3 years after the studies among public school parents, making general comparisons between these populations potentially problematic. However, increased time from vaccine recommendations typically results in greater vaccine knowledge and acceptance, as demonstrated by increasing immunization rates from the time of initial vaccine recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059840513486010">National and State Vaccination, 2011</xref>) making the vastly lower rates of willingness to receive vaccines via a SLIP, noted in this study, potentially more striking. Finally, it is important to note that these data pertain only to willingness to use a SLIP; studies have shown that actual behavior relevant to SLIPs may differ from intentions reported in survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840513486010">Middleman &amp; Tung, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusions and Implications</title>
<p>Despite these limitations, these data indicate that private school parents may be less willing to utilize SLIPs in general than public school parents; SLIPs would likely be more effectively utilized in public middle schools. Further study within a larger study sample is needed to more fully understand the willingness of private school parents to use SLIPs.</p>
<p>A school nurse’s role in a SLIP can be one of championing, advocating, or implementing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840513486010">Li, Freedmam, &amp; Boyer-Chu, 2009</xref>), and because of that integral role, a school nurse may find these data beneficial for determining the potential success of a SLIP in a private versus a public school setting. School administrations and nurses will need to take these data into account as well as any current issues pertaining to disease outbreaks and the immediate risk of disease in the community (as alerted by the local health department) when determining whether or not to organize a SLIP in their schools.</p>
