<p>The title certainly raises expectations of a sensational biography to follow. The reader will not be disappointed. Dyce Sombre was the adopted son of Farzana, ‘Begum Sombre’, the ruler from 1778 to 1836 of the state of Sardhana, near Meerut, lying in the <italic>doab</italic> region between the Ganges and its Jamna tributary. Dyce’s adoption into this petty court reflected his biological descent from Walter Reinhardt (a German mercenary soldier, known as ‘Sombre’) and one of his Indian <italic>bibis</italic>. When Reinhardt later took Farzana into his household she, formerly a <italic>nautch</italic> girl, inherited his Sardhana state in 1778 to then become, highly unusually for a Muslim woman, a figure of considerable political importance in the late-eighteenth-, early-nineteenth-century ‘twilight’ years of north Indian princely fortunes. Being childless herself, the Begum made Dyce her favourite on his birth in 1808, baptising him into the Catholic faith she had by then adopted. Brought up at her remarkably eclectic court, where he was known as ‘David Sahib’ (after his godfather, Sir David Ochterlony, the resident of Delhi), he lived a comfortable, rather self-indulgent youth as heir to this state. In 1838 he left for London to embark on a prolonged but vain effort to prove his title to the Sardhana estates which the East India Company had seized opportunistically on the Begum’s recent death.</p>
<p>The study is divided into two parts which follow the life history first of ‘David Sahib’ in Asia (mainly north-west India) from 1808 to 1838, and then of ‘Dyce Sombre’ as he called himself in Europe (mainly London and Paris) until his own death in 1851. The first part is important for setting the stage for his later tragic failures in Europe: of mixed Indian and European ancestry, he received at court a Persianate education in preparation for the duties expected of a minor ruler. However, he also received a veneer of English education, partly in a Protestant boarding school. Living simultaneously with two ‘regular concubines’ (p. 55) during his twenties, and a frequenter also of brothels and gambling dens, his subsequent mis-readings of European gender mores during an ill-fated marriage into the English aristocracy, are the more understandable. There are signs, however, that if the Company had recognised his claims, he might have coped no worse than many other end-of-empire princelings with the competing demands of new colonial and more familiar courtly expectations, for he seemingly retained the affection of his Sardhana servants. Once in London, however, he had quickly attracted scandal by his failed attempts to get his political and financial claims recognised amid the near farcical unwinding of a marriage that ended in his in-laws’ and siblings’ assertion of his insanity, his subsequent incarceration, yet escape to France, from where he launched many futile attempts to reverse the medical and legal judgments on his alleged ‘lunatic’ status.</p>
<p>Michael Fisher’s previous publications on Indian princely states and Indian travellers and settlers in Britain provide excellent credentials for this study. Though he had already devoted half a chapter in his <italic>Counterflows to Colonialism</italic> to outlining Dyce Sombre’s significance, the present monograph allows a much more detailed exploration of his ‘multiple and shifting identities’ (p. 5). Dyce’s diaries and other, sometimes coded, accounts of his own travels, both self-revealing and self-condemning, present a hitherto neglected gift to historians in their detail and frankness, as does the massive collection of legal and medical records generated by his futile efforts to refute his family’s charges of insanity. This study represents a thorough trawling of such primary sources, but is contextualised by a sound understanding of the contemporary social and political scenes, both north Indian and European.</p>
<p>For Fisher is concerned with much more than telling the tragicomic tale of Dyce Sombre’s personal predicament. If the epithet ‘inordinate’ appears four times in the Introduction alone, conjuring some all too familiar Orientalist depictions of the excesses and profligacy of the ‘East’, the driving force of this study is a more serious set of objectives, using Dyce as a key to the understanding of ‘larger issues in Asia and Europe’ through showing the ‘complexity and contingency’ of his life, in order to highlight the ‘constructed and contingent nature’ of many received categories such as racial and national identities, insanity and gender relationships (pp. 4–10). Among these, the study’s placing of Dyce’s case in the context of changing medical diagnoses on the causes and definition of lunacy, and the nexus between lunacy, the law and medicine, is particularly instructive. Dyce’s vulnerability partly reflected assumptions that what was acceptable as behaviour ‘normal’ for an Indian was ‘lunatic’ for an Englishman (though not always for a continental European). In this sense he fell victim to a subconscious moral relativism prevalent at the time. Rather less sympathy for Dyce is evoked by his abortive attempt, soon after arrival in England, to assert himself on the political scene. What turned out a personal humiliation when he was removed from Parliament, having won a seat in 1841 through bribery, comes as a surprising lesson for any who might have assumed that the 1832 Reform Act had successfully disposed of ‘rotten borough’ jobbery, or indeed, that Dadabhai Naoroji was the first Indian to sit in the English parliament.</p>
<p>Feelings are likely to be more mixed on Dyce’s failure to negotiate the slippery and changing mores associated with gender relations (particularly marital) in early Victorian Britain. Though Fisher is certainly not encouraging the reader to take sides between Dyce and his unlikely bride (Mary Anne Jervis, a viscount’s daughter and musician he met shortly after his first arrival in London), it is very tempting to do so, despite the author’s primary purpose of showing ‘changing British concepts about appropriate social and legal gender roles and boundaries’ (p. 9) over this period. For Mary Anne was surely as transgressive of conventional boundaries as Dyce proved himself, allegedly pursuing relationships with aristocratic admirers of her singing both before and during her relationship with Dyce. Their marriage, attractive to her initially because of Dyce’s personal wealth and claims to the Sardhana inheritance, was extraordinary by any standards, marked by his continued visits to prostitutes, her own unconventional behaviour, and underlying all attempts at reconciliation, a deep incompatability of temperament and expectations. There is as yet no published study of Mary Anne in her own right. In this study, while she serves as a foil for her husband’s demise, the appetite is whetted for a fuller exploration of her own psyche and behaviour. Another facet of Dyce that is briefly mentioned in many places but on which further elab-oration would be rewarding, is his standing as a surprisingly ‘cultured’ man of letters. For, we learn that ‘he read widely, keeping a substantial library in English, Persian, and Urdu poetry and prose with him, even during his travels’ (p. 302–303) and ‘expressed his most intimate feelings in Persian’ (p. 6). A seemingly sensitive scholar at one level, yet poetic citations were often accompanied in his diaries by sexually explicit remarks in Persian which cast some doubt on his motivations for keeping up the Persianate culture of his Sardhana initiation.</p>
<p>Fisher finishes his account of Dyce’s extraordinary life by commenting that despite his own efforts, this history ‘continues unresolved’ (p. 327), leaving open for yet further consideration many questions about the manifold meanings of his life. Too modest a summation of a study, surely, which has done much to satisfy in a very readable way the author’s own objective to demonstrate ‘the intricacy and contradictions’ of Dyce Sombre’s ‘myriad social, cultural, political, and personal interactions’ (p. 5) by embedding them in the wider context of important concerns with multiple and shifting identities and values both in colonial India and Victorian Britain.</p>
