<abstract>
<p>With composites finding increased use as primary structures in commercial aircraft, it is necessary to understand the development of damage when a laminate is subject to low-velocity impacts from a variety of sources, which often occur during normal service operations and routine maintenance. In particular, contact with ground service equipment can present a blunt impact to the composite structure. Therefore, the effects of bluntness of an impactor are of interest as this is related to the development of any internal damage in the laminate, or even the surrounding structure, and also affects the visual detectability of an impact event. The objective of this investigation is to determine the effect of impactor radius on the impact damage resistance of composite panels. A low-velocity pendulum impactor was used to strike 200 mm<sup>2</sup> woven glass/epoxy composite plates of 3.18 and 6.35 mm thickness. Hemispherical steel impactor tips of radius 12.7, 50.8, and 152.4 mm were mounted to a piezoelectric force sensor which measures the contacting force history during the impact event. Distinct threshold energy levels defining the onset of delamination and backside fiber breakage have been measured to increase significantly with increasing impactor tip radius due to development of higher contact area.</p>

<p>Since the 1960s, the aerospace industry has been incorporating composites <italic>in lieu</italic> of high performance metals into the primary structures of commercial airframes. While the weight savings and the subsequent increased operating efficiency have been substantial, composites also require some considerations not typically of concern with metals. Of primary interest to this research is the initiation of damage from blunt impact sources (ground service vehicles, maintenance crew-related mishaps such as bumps with ground equipment, and aircraft mishandling such as collisions with posts, hangar walls, and other static objects) since they involve large contact areas that are less likely to result in locally visible signs of damage (e.g., dent, surface cracks). Undetected damage could potentially propagate to critical sizes at a future time so it is imperative that damage formation resulting from low-velocity blunt impacts is well understood.</p>
<p>To investigate low-velocity impacts on composite structures, researchers use analytical models, controlled experiments, and/or numerical simulations of the complex interaction between the impactor and target. Among the analytical models, the Hertzian contact law, spring-mass, and energy balance are used extensively. Hertz contact law states that the contact force is proportional to the indentation depth raised to the 1.5 power and the proportionality constant is, in part, related to the radius of curvature of the impactor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312436991">1</xref></sup> The critical delamination force <italic>P</italic> is also proportional to impactor diameter <italic>D</italic> and panel thickness <italic>h</italic> by the equation:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312436991">2</xref></sup>

where <italic>τ</italic><sub>max</sub> and <italic>k<sub>c</sub></italic> refer to the maximum shear stress and contact stiffness, respectively. The law assumes a hemispherical Hertzian pressure distribution that is greatest at the center and zero at the edges.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312436991">2</xref></sup> The energy balance model, which equates the available kinetic energy of a moving impactor to the energy needed to deform the target, and the equivalent spring-mass models, which represent the impact event by interconnected masses and springs to estimate the time-dependent dynamic behavior of the projectile and target, both show contact force is proportional to the initial velocity of the impactor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312436991">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312436991">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The analytical models can be validated through experimentation. Sutherland and Guedes Soares<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998312436991">3</xref></sup> use the Hertz contact law to describe the initial response of chopped and woven glass fiber composites in quasi-static tests and observed that at higher contact forces, the force versus indentation response change from a power law to a linear relationship. Mili and Necib<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998312436991">4</xref></sup> observe that contact forces and deflection are proportional to impact velocities of 0.53 to 3.10 m/s. Davies et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998312436991">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998312436991">6</xref></sup> observe that Hertzian contact accounts for up to 15% of available impact energy, but only in ‘extreme’ cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998312436991">6</xref></sup> while Zhang,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998312436991">7</xref></sup> observes that contact-induced surface damage is typically ‘highly localized’ and does not enter more than 2 to 3 plies (0.4 mm) into the impact surface for the 4-mm-thick CRFP specimens tested. Choi and Chang<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998312436991">8</xref></sup> show an impact velocity threshold, whereby impacts below a certain velocity level do not cause damage, but impacts at higher speeds cause significant damage. This damage is manifested by panel delamination, which occurs almost instantaneously at energy levels beyond the threshold value, and is attributed to the interlaminar shear stresses developing as the plate bends.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998312436991">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998312436991">8</xref></sup> Sjöblom<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998312436991">9</xref></sup> designates energy and force as the controlling parameters for the initiation of damage in quasi-isotropic plates, a delamination threshold load that Schoeppner and Abrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998312436991">10</xref></sup> verify is proportional to panel thickness raised to the 1.5 power as indicated in Hertzian contact law. Yang and Cantwell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998312436991">11</xref></sup> demonstrate that the damage initiation threshold force does not depend on the dimensions of the composite specimen (for their 50 to 200 mm circular plates) but does increase with plate thickness and impactor radius. Damage area increases proportionally with force, which in turn, is nonlinearly increasing with energy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998312436991">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Damage initiation in composite panels also uses modeling and numeral analysis of the impact phenomenon, often giving an enhanced understanding of the experimental results. Davies and Zhang<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998312436991">5</xref></sup> use a proprietary explicit numerical solver to accurately predict contact force histories and damage area size. Tiberkak et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998312436991">13</xref></sup> calculate the dynamic stresses with nine Gaussian points per element and per layer to predict the onset of matrix cracks. Her and Liang<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998312436991">14</xref></sup> use ANSYS/LS-DYNA finite element software to show contact forces to be proportional to impactor velocity, and the contact period dependent on the stiffness and boundary conditions of the structure. Gong and Lam<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998312436991">15</xref></sup> demonstrate with finite element models that the transient strain response is governed by the contact force history in low-velocity impacts, but do not investigate prediction of critical force related to the onset of damage.</p>
<p>In summary, the existing body of research, through analytical, experimental, and numerical approaches, confirms the existence of a critical load for impacts onto composite structures, demonstrates methods for predicting the onset of damage, and investigates the relationship between contact force and energy. However, the subset of research focused exclusively on damage initiation using blunted impactors is sparse at best. Most use a tip diameter of 12.7 mm in a drop-weight test configuration based on the standardized ‘compression after impact’ test method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998312436991">16</xref></sup> Finn et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998312436991">17</xref></sup> show almost no correlation between impactor radius and delamination area for cross-ply symmetric ICI APC-2 material. Mitrevski et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998312436991">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998312436991">19</xref></sup> indicate that damage threshold limits increase with the degree of bluntness and the hemispherical impactor tips produce a higher peak contact force compared to conical- and ogival-shaped tips. They also tested a flat, 12.7-mm-diameter impactor which produced damage that was difficult to detect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998312436991">20</xref></sup> Shim and Yang<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998312436991">21</xref></sup> tested a 42-mm-diameter impactor and show that the damage area for a sharper 12.7-mm-diameter impactor is larger than the blunter 42-mm-diameter tip and that damage area increases with energy. They discuss a ‘damage severity parameter Q’ to account for the observation by Wu and Shyu<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998312436991">22</xref></sup> that impactor tip radius can be neglected for low-velocity impacts with low contact forces. Although contact force is independent of tip curvature, blunter tips lead to wider force distribution and less bending moment and stresses for the plate; that is, the larger the impactor radius, the lower the induced flexural stresses at impact. Amaro et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998312436991">23</xref></sup> use 12.7- and 20-mm-diameter impact tips and observe that the delamination area is ∼14% greater for the blunter impactor compared to the sharper tip for the same test conditions. To supplement this current body of literature, which indicates that impactor geometry should significantly affect the impact event<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998312436991">24</xref></sup> whereby a sharper impactor causes a greater degree of fiber breakage and delamination compared to a blunter impactor,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998312436991">25</xref></sup> this investigation specifically focuses on the effects of impactor radius on damage formation for low velocity, blunt impacts on fully clamped woven glass/epoxy panels.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0021998312436991"><title>Experimental details</title>
<p>The pendulum impactor shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312436991">Figure 1</xref> is used to generate repeatable (velocity and energy) impact events. As configured, the 1.402 m arm and 5.5 kg total mass permits impacts up to 150 J. Pendulum arm initial position control is achieved through an optical encoder with 0.1° resolution attached to the pivot of the arm. Two 12.7-mm-thick aluminum picture frame fixture halves, each with a 165 mm<sup>2</sup> window opening, hold the test specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312436991">Figure 1</xref>). All impacts occur at the center of the target plate and with incoming velocity that is normal to the impacted surface. The rebounding pendulum is manually restrained, thereby preventing more than one impact event from occurring.
<fig id="fig1-0021998312436991" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Pendulum impactor test setup with 152.4 mm radius tip and 3.18 mm panel.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998312436991-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Piezoelectric dynamic force sensors with 0–5 V range output are used to measure the contact force history. Two different sensors are used, depending on impactor size: a 19-mm-diameter 22 kN max force Dytran model 1050V6 sensor and a 50.8-mm-diameter 111 kN max force Dytran model 1060V5. Three hardened hemispherical (full or partial) tips with radius 12.7, 50.8, and 152.4 mm are mounted in front of the force sensor, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312436991">Figure 2</xref>. The 12.7 mm tip is used with the 1050V6 sensor while the 50.8 mm and 152.4 mm tips are used with the 1060V5 sensor. Each tip has an upper limit on the contact area due to the radius of the sensor; that is, after a certain limit, the panel may fully contact the tip, reaching its outer (hard-edged) boundary. For the energy levels, panel thicknesses, and tip radii considered, the contact area between the impactor and laminate does not reach the area limits, which for the 12.7, 50.8, and 152.4 mm tips are 284, 2027, and 2027 mm<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Also, the mass of these tips, 23.5 g, 262.3 g, and 298.5 g for the 12.7 mm, 50.8 mm, and 152.4 mm radius tips, respectively, were kept minimal to reduce their influence on the measured signal as the force sensor is compressed between the tip and the mass stack (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312436991">Figure 1</xref>). Along with the required sensor and adapter, the total mass for the pendulum impactor was 4.91, 5.48, and 5.51 kg, respectively, for each of the three radius tips. The difference between the 12.7 and 152.4 mm impactor tip setups is 11% and the maximum difference in impact velocities for the exact same energy level is 6%. Force time history data is collected using an oscilloscope (Picoscope 3224) at a sample rate of 1 Mhz.

<p>The test specimens shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312436991">Figure 3</xref> were commercially-available G10/FR4 plain weave E-glass/epoxy panels. The panels were cut to overall dimension 200 × 200 mm<sup>2</sup>, and had either 20 or 40 plies all-0° layups, resulting in a 3.18 or 6.35 mm thickness. The panels have a 416 MPa tensile strength and 28.3 MPa modulus of elasticity as measured from tensile test coupons. Strain gauges (350 Ω Vishay L2A-06-250LW-350) are applied to a select number of 6.35-mm-thick panels. Strain gages are located at the center and at 25 mm offset on the backside of the specimens opposite of the impacted face, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998312436991">Figure 4</xref>, and labeled SG1 and SG2, respectively. Two Vishay 2310B signal conditioning amplifiers with 300 kHz sampling frequency were used in conjunction with an oscilloscope to record the strain and force data at 1 MHz sampling rate.

<sec id="sec3-0021998312436991"><title>Test methodology</title>
<p>The test matrix shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998312436991">Table 1</xref> reports the total number of panels tested for the six different conditions involving two panel thicknesses and three impactor radii. Two different test methods are used to find damage thresholds: ‘sweeping’ and ‘bracketing’. Sweeping is a single panel tested at increasing energy (i.e., multiple hits) levels until failure. While some amount of internal damage does accumulate, this approach nonetheless provides an approximation of the failure limit, which can be investigated further through bracketing. For bracketing tests, single panels are subject to energy levels just below and just above the failure limit (two hits). A new panel is then impacted at the failure limit (single hit) to confirm that this energy level produces initial damage. Both techniques follow the same test protocol and 1–4 panels are tested at the failure limits. The fiberglass panel is centered in the test fixture and securely clamped on all edges by the fixture bolts. Simple energy based calculations convert the desired kinetic energy at impact to a specific angular position (i.e., potential energy level of raised impactor mass) and the pendulum arm is raised to this height. Carbon and graph paper sheets are layered in front of the panel directly in the path of the impactor. A pneumatic trigger mechanism is used to cleanly release the arm and the impactor swings to impact the target. The carbon paper imprint on graph paper layered in front of the plate records the size of the peak contact area, the piezoelectric force sensor records the contact force history, and the optical encoder records the pendulum position history. Velocity just before impact is calculated from the slope of the position data through a linear regression curve fit of the encoder data. This angular velocity of the pendulum is converted into an incoming velocity of the impactor just prior to impact.

<p>Each impactor radius tip produces failure in the composite specimen at unique kinetic energy levels. Panel failure thresholds are defined herein based on two distinct modes of damage. Failure threshold energy 1 (FTE1) is the projectile kinetic energy needed to initiate delamination (initial damage mode) and is localized to the impact site. For the semi-translucent glass/epoxy specimens, the delamination is observable as an internal white region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312436991">Figure 5</xref>). Failure threshold energy 2 (FTE2) is the kinetic energy that defines the onset of fiber breakage and is confirmed by the presence of cracks visible on the panel surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312436991">Figure 5</xref>). The failure threshold energy levels are summarized in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998312436991">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021998312436991">3</xref> along with the number of panels tested at failure.

<p>Both FTE1 and FTE2 increase with increasing panel thickness and tip radius. For the 152.4 mm radius impactor, FTE2 could not be reached below 40 J, and at this point, the tests were stopped to avoid possible damage to the frame and fixture. The data show that two impactors at the same energy level, impacting the same target, but differing only in their tip radius, may not produce the same damage mode. For example, an impact at 8 J on the 3.18-mm-thick panel would produce fiber failure for a 12.7 mm radius tip, delamination for a 50.8 mm radius tip, and no damage for a 152.4 mm radius tip. It is also noted that blunter impactors need more energy than sharper impactors to initiate the same damage mode and subsequently, develop much higher contact forces. The higher force levels, summarized in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0021998312436991">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0021998312436991">5</xref>, are reacted by the surrounding support structure which could lead to potential damage developing in a structure at locations away from the impact site. Thus, structures impacted by a sharp indentor may have only local damage in the immediate impact area whereas structures impacted by a very blunt object may develop damage at locations away from the impact area without any local damage.</p>
<p>The force time history plots corresponding to initiation of damage at FTE1 and FTE2 are shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998312436991">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312436991">7</xref>. The peak contact forces increase with energy as expected. Comparison of the failure threshold forces in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0021998312436991">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0021998312436991">5</xref> shows FTF1 to be increasing significantly (FTF1 for the 152.4 mm is 156% larger than the 12.7 mm) with larger radius tips for the 3.18-mm-thick panel while FTF1 for the 6.35-mm-thick panel shows a more gradual increasing (23.9% for the 152.4 mm over the 12.7 mm) peak force with tip radius. From Hertzian contact models, it is expected that a thicker panel impacted by a blunter tip should raise the critical force threshold of damage. However, the Hertzian contact models may only hold true for the 12.7 mm radius impactor and not the 50.8 and 152.4 mm radius tips which would explain why the results show that the thicker 6.35 mm panel is less affected by impactor geometry than the more compliant 3.18 mm panel.

<p>Plots for the peak contact force as a function of kinetic energy are shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998312436991">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998312436991">9</xref> for the two panel thicknesses. In these plots, ‘FTE 1+’ denotes impacts at energy levels above FTE1 but still below FTE2. For a given panel thickness, the peak contact force is found to follow the same increasing trend with respect to kinetic energy regardless of the impact radius. Since contact force is dependent on the input energy and target stiffness, and stiffness is a characteristic of the panel system (including materials, thickness, and boundary conditions), the peak contact forces for a given panel thickness are expected to be on same curve and independent of impactor tip radius as long as the impact contact area remains much smaller than the total panel area. These results are also expected based on single degree of freedom (SDOF) and energy-balance models. In both cases, contact force is proportional to impactor velocity (and proportional to the square of kinetic energy) and is independent of the impactor tip radius.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312436991">2</xref></sup> The contact forces generated for impacts onto the thick panel are significantly larger than for the thin panel, due to the relatively higher transverse stiffness of the 6.35 mm panel. Greater peak contact forces are developed, in general, for stiffer projectile-to-target interactions.

<p>The maximum contact areas measured by the carbon paper are observed to be circular for all impacts at energy levels up to FTE2, with no observable changes at FTE1, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998312436991">Figure 10(a)</xref>. The contact area changes to ‘peanut’ like in shape at FTE2 and beyond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998312436991">Figure 10(b)</xref>). This transition was also observed by Davies and Zhang.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998312436991">5</xref></sup> The change in contact shape is due to the formation of through-thickness cracks at FTE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312436991">Figure 5</xref>), which creates a ‘hinge’ type deformation geometry, thereby allowing contact to be spread out at two points located away from the contact center point, resulting in the peanut-like shape.

<p>Maximum contact area as a function of energy for each radius tip is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021998312436991">Figures 11</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0021998312436991">13</xref>. All measured contact areas for both panel thicknesses increase with higher energy and larger impactor tip radius. For the 12.7 mm radius tips, the contact areas at energy levels less than FTE1 are slightly higher for the 6.35 mm panel compared to the 3.18 mm panel. This phenomenon is less pronounced for the 50.8 mm radius tip, which shows almost equivalent size contact areas for either the 3.18- or the 6.35-mm-thick panel below FTE1 at 7.5 J (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0021998312436991">Figure 12</xref>). It is not observed for the 152.4 mm radius impactor, which exhibits higher contact areas for the 3.18 mm panel compared to the 6.35 mm panel at all energy levels. These results may be attributed to several sources. For the 12.7 mm radius tip, the thicker panel presents a stiffer target for the impact tip, which causes a higher contact force, a greater impact indentation, and subsequently, a larger contact area compared to the 3.18 mm panel. Although the more compliant 3.18 mm panel may bend locally around the impact tip to give a larger contact area, at the lower energy levels it does not wrap significantly around the impactor tip so the contact area is lower than the stiffer 6.35 mm panel. This effect may also be observed, albeit less pronounced, for the 50.8 mm tip below FTE1. For both 12.7- and 50.8-mm-radius tips impacting at energy levels above FTE1, internal delamination allows for more local compliance and thus the thinner panel conforms more to the impactor tips and shows a much higher contact area (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021998312436991">11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0021998312436991">12</xref>). Contact areas for the 152.4 mm radius impactor are also higher for the 3.18 mm panel compared to the 6.25 mm panel. Further, the difference in contact area size for the two panels is greatest for the 152.4 mm impactor compared to the sharper tips. As the 152.4 mm impactor is significantly blunter than the 12.7 and 50.8 mm radius tips, it may change the contact pressure distribution so that it no longer follows the typical Hertzian response. Coupled with the local deformations of the panel making a larger contact area with the 152.4 mm radius tip than with the smaller 12.7 and 50.8 mm radius tips may explain the dramatic difference in contact areas between the two panels.

<p>Dividing the peak force by maximum contact area for each energy level yields an average contact pressure which, when plotted against energy, shows trends not readily visible in either the force or area plots examined separately. Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0021998312436991">14</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0021998312436991">15</xref> show that the average contact pressure for the 12.7 and 50.8 mm radius impactors increases until a maximum value is reached soon after FTE1, and then decrease thereafter. This inflection can be an indicator of the onset of FTE1 damage. Contact pressure is substantially lower for the 152.4 mm tip when compared with the other two radii as expected, and does not show any maximum or inflection corresponding to FTE1. Considering the low contact pressure, a blunter impactor will be less likely to induce visible surface damage, even at high energy levels since the pressure is not increasing.
<fig id="fig14-0021998312436991" position="float"><label>Figure 14.</label><caption><p>Average contact pressure as a function of energy for all radii and 3.18 mm panel thickness.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998312436991-fig14.tif"/></fig>

<p>The average contact pressure corresponding to FTE1 for all cases, summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0021998312436991">Figure 16</xref>, shows that contact pressure decreases for increasing tip radius <italic>R</italic>. This scaling is due to the proportionally increasing contact area developed as <italic>R</italic> increases. The difference in contact pressure between the two panel thicknesses at FTE1 was found to be dependent on the impactor radius. For the 12.7 mm radius tip, the average pressure is 2.07 times higher for the 6.35-mm-thick panel as opposed to the 3.18-mm-thick panel, while the 50.8 mm radius tip shows a ratio of 2.25 times. By comparison, the 152.4 mm radius tip causes a 4.54 times larger contact pressure for the 6.35-mm-thick panel relative to the 3.18 mm panel. These results give insight on how the tip radius can affect the formation of visible damage since contact pressure can be associated with surface ‘bruising’ of painted surfaces, thereby leaving visibly detectable indications of impacts having occurred (i.e., in the absence of visible fiber failure modes).
<fig id="fig16-0021998312436991" position="float"><label>Figure 16.</label><caption><p>Average contact pressure at FTE1 for all radii.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998312436991-fig16.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>For select tests, strain gages were applied to the backside of a 6.35 mm panel to investigate the effect of impactor bluntness on the deformation response of the composite panel. For each of the three tip radii, the panels were subject to nominal energy levels of 2, 4, 6, and 8 J, which are below FTE1 (no damage). The same tests were repeated with a 152.4 × 152.4 × 25.4 mm<sup>3</sup> thick 70A durometer rubber pad placed in front of the panel to represent a bumper-protected impactor. The pad dimensions are smaller than the window fixture, leaving a 6.35 mm border on all sides. Similar rubber bumper materials are commonly found mounted onto the edges and corners of equipment that can contact an aircraft. Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0021998312436991">17</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-0021998312436991">18</xref> show typical results for 8 J impacts by the 12.7 and 152.4 mm radius tips, respectively. Comparison of the ‘regular’ impacts shows that the larger radius tips develops lower strain for the same peak force and energy (recall force vs. energy being independent of tip radius as shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998312436991">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998312436991">9</xref>) at the center of the panel as measured by SG1. However, roughly the same peak strain develops in gauge SG2 located 25 mm offset from the center, regardless of tip radius. For impacts with the rubber pad in place, higher peak strains are developed by the larger radius impactor tip, a trend that is opposite from the direct-contact, or regular, impacts.
<fig id="fig17-0021998312436991" position="float"><label>Figure 17.</label><caption><p>Strain time history at 8 J for 12.7 mm radius tip, 6.35 mm panel thickness.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998312436991-fig17.tif"/></fig>
<fig id="fig18-0021998312436991" position="float"><label>Figure 18.</label><caption><p>Strain time history at 8 J for 152.4 mm radius tip, 6.35 mm panel thickness.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998312436991-fig18.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The maximum SG1 strain versus impact energy is compared for all tip radii and rubber pad conditions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-0021998312436991">Figure 19</xref>. Strain increases more rapidly with energy for the regular impact condition (no rubber) in comparison to the rubber covered impactor. These results are expected since the rubber pad serves to distribute the impact pressure over a much wider contact area compared to the bare tips. Alternatively, to induce the same strain at the panel center, the rubber covered impactor requires much more energy than the nonrubber impactor.
<fig id="fig19-0021998312436991" position="float"><label>Figure 19.</label><caption><p>Maximum SG1 strain vs energy measures at the panel center.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998312436991-fig19.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The effect of the rubber pad produces an opposite trend in peak strain versus tip radius. For the regular, nonrubber protected impacts, the 152.4 mm tip results in ∼15% lower strains than either the 50.8 or 12.7 mm tips with little difference in peak strains between the 12.7 and 50.8 mm tips. For the rubber protected impacts, the maximum strains are much closer in value to each other, with the 152.4 mm tips actually showing higher peak strains than the 12.7 and 50.8 mm tips. This nonintuitive trend is thought to be due to the fact that smaller radius tips indent more deeply into the rubber pad, producing much more localized deformation of the viscoelastic rubber and thereby dissipating more energy into the rubber layer. For the nearly flat 152.4 mm radius tip, a larger volume of much lower stressed rubber is involved in transferring the impact energy to the panel, and thus, less energy is absorbed by the rubber pad. This leads to higher strains developing in the panel. For the regular impact condition without the rubber pad, the higher peak strain develops for the smaller radius tips due to the greater localized curvature produced during the impactor tip contact interactions with the panel.</p>
<p>Comparing the center (SG1) versus offset location (SG2) peak strains quantifies the degree with which strain drops off as a function of distance from the center of the impact zone. It is effectively a measure of the degree of localization of the impact event, where a higher strain ratio SG1/SG2 indicates a more localized impact response and a low strain ratio implies a more distributed impact. The trends plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20-0021998312436991">Figure 20</xref> show the strain ratio to be higher for the regular impact condition (more localized impact event) compared to the rubber protected condition. The strain ratio of the nonrubber covered impactors is observed to increase with decreasing tip radius, which would cause more localized panel response. By contrast, the rubber protected impacts show very little sensitivity to tip radius (same ratio at each energy level). Strain ratios for the regular impactor also increase with impact energy whereas the rubber covered impacts do not increase (i.e., flat trend). As higher energies involve increasing the impactor velocity, this difference in response indicates that the regular nonrubber impacts show an increasingly dynamic localized response at the plate center. The rubber covered condition distributes the contact pressure to such a degree that no increasing localized response is observed with higher velocity (i.e., energy).

<sec id="sec5-0021998312436991" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Laboratory testing of composite panels has shown that impactor radius strongly affects the formation of damage, with the larger radius impactors (152.4 and 50.8 mm) requiring significantly more energy to create damage than the smallest 12.7 mm radius impactor. Specifically, for the glass/epoxy panels studied, the 152.4 mm radius tip required 1.7 to 4.8 times more energy to initiate damage (FTE1) as compared to the (more conventionally used) 12.7 mm tip. The higher energy corresponds to greater peak contact forces which must be reacted by the surrounding regions, increasing the potential for damage at locations away from the impact site. The thicker panel was less affected by increasing tip radius than the thinner panels, which is in part explained by aspects related to the developed contact area during the impact event. Thinner panels can locally deform more and conform to the geometry of the impactor tip to develop larger contact area. Thus while the measured maximum contact area increased with impactor bluntness, area decreased with panel thickness. While the contact force was found to be independent of impactor radius (for same boundary conditions and panel thickness), the computed average contact pressure was found to be significantly lower for increasing impactor radius. A plot of contact pressure versus impact energy reveals an inflection point corresponding to the onset of damage (FTE1) due to local softening induced by delamination formation. This inflection point, which is not readily visible in either force or contact area versus energy plots, can be used for identifying the onset of FTE1 in the smaller radius impact tips (no inflection observed for the 152.4 mm tip). Finally, strain gage data showed larger radius impactors to excite a less localized target panel response, while the presence of a 25.4 mm thick rubber pad was found to distribute the contact pressure to the degree that no impactor radius dependency was observed.</p>
