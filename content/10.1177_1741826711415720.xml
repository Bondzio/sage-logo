<p><bold>Background:</bold> This study examined whether mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms are associated with increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels in apparently healthy individuals at high risk for coronary artery disease. We investigated in individuals whether: (1) current depressive symptoms were associated with increased hsCRP and IL-6 levels; (2) persistent depressive symptoms at two time points 6 months apart were associated with hsCRP and IL-6; and (3), sex-based differences in inflammation were a function of depressive symptoms.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> We measured depressive symptoms (twice), hsCRP, and IL-6 (follow-up time point) in 84 apparently healthy individuals (52% women) at high cardiac risk.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Patients with persistent depressive symptoms had higher hsCRP, compared to participants without persistent symptoms (5.55 vs. 1.70 mg/l, <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.05, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.09, <italic>d </italic>= 0.67). Participants with current depressive symptoms had higher hsCRP (3.99 vs. 1.70 mg/l, <italic>p </italic>= 0.059) than those without symptoms. Findings remained unchanged after controlling for covariates. Women had higher adjusted hsCRP than men (2.91 vs. 1.87 mg/l, <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.001). When we entered depressive symptoms, the model remained significant, with a significant interaction between sex and symptoms: women with depressive symptoms had higher hsCRP than men with depressive symptoms and than women without symptoms (6.75 vs. 1.11 mg/l). The hypothesized differences were not observed with respect to IL-6, after controlling for body mass index (95% CI−0.77 to 0.73).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Before a first ischaemic coronary event, persistent mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms were associated with increased hsCRP. Women with depressive symptoms had higher hsCRP than men with symptoms.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1741826711415720" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The development of coronary artery disease (CAD) in apparently healthy individuals is multi-factorial. Inflammation has emerged over the past few years as a suspected risk factor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711415720">1</xref></sup><sup>−</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711415720">5</xref></sup> Among the best-established CAD psychosocial risk factors are depressive symptoms. A burgeoning literature shows that, depression is independently associated with cardiac morbidity (e.g., hospitalizations) or mortality in healthy individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711415720">4</xref></sup> Inflammatory processes are an important pathophysiological pathway that could link depressive symptoms to CAD,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711415720">5</xref></sup> in addition to behavioural pathways such as poor diet or smoking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711415720">6</xref></sup> One argument favouring a depression−inflammation relationship is that the hypothalamic−pituitary−adrenal axis hormones are consistently dysregulated in adults with major depression. Indeed, depressive symptoms may disrupt the anti-inflammatory effect of glucocorticoids (e.g., excess cortisol disrupts the negative feedback loop).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711415720">7</xref></sup> This study investigated whether persistent mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms are associated with increased pro-inflammatory markers.</p>
<p>Depressive symptoms are associated with higher acute-phase proteins and pro-inflammatory cytokines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711415720">8</xref></sup><sup>−</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711415720">12</xref></sup> Independent of CAD, recent studies showed that clinical depression is associated with higher high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL) 6 levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711415720">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711415720">14</xref></sup> Kop et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711415720">12</xref></sup> found depressive symptoms to be correlated with higher CRP levels. Lespérance et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711415720">15</xref></sup> showed that depressed patients, not taking statins, had markedly higher CRP levels. In a recent meta-analysis, Howren et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711415720">16</xref></sup> found that: (1) depression, CRP, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, IL-1) are associated in clinical and community samples; and (2) there seems to be a dose−response relationship between depression and inflammatory markers but this association was the strongest in clinically depressed samples. Although Miller et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711415720">17</xref></sup> also found a graded relationship between CRP levels and depressive symptoms, they did not find evidence of a link between clinical depression diagnosis and CRP.</p>
<p>The findings by Empana et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711415720">18</xref></sup> also support an association between depressive mood and inflammation. However, cross-sectional studies using the Whitehall II epidemiological cohort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711415720">19</xref></sup> failed to show an association between depressive mood and inflammatory markers. The episodic nature of depressive symptoms may have accounted for the lack of statistically significant associations. Examining these associations in apparently healthy individuals, at two time points, before an acute coronary syndrome, can help tease apart causal ordering of variables more than in some previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711415720">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711415720">17</xref></sup> Therefore, we evaluated symptoms of depression over a 6-month interval in order to establish the stability of depressed mood among apparently healthy women and men at high risk for CAD. We subsequently examined the relation between depressive symptoms, hsCRP and IL-6. To our knowledge, only two studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711415720">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711415720">18</xref></sup> have examined the relationship between depressive mood and inflammation in initially healthy patients. In addition, there is evidence that the relative risk for CAD linked to CRP is higher for women than men.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711415720">19</xref></sup> Regardless of depression, CRP levels have been found to be higher in women than men.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711415720">19</xref></sup> Other investigations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711415720">20</xref></sup> did not find any sex differences in CRP. There is abundant epidemiological data showing that prevalence and morbidity risk of depression are higher in females from mid-puberty throughout adult life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741826711415720">21</xref></sup> Clearly, we should investigate potential sex-based differences in immune parameters in at-risk individuals. We hypothesized that: (1) individuals with current depressive symptoms would have increased hsCRP and IL-6 levels; (2) individuals with persistent depressive symptoms at two time points 6 months apart would have increased hsCRP and IL-6 levels; and (3) women with depressive symptoms would have higher hsCRP and IL-6 than men with depressive symptoms.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1741826711415720" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title>
<p>The sample was comprised of 84 (out of potentially 86) apparently healthy participants with high cardiac risk factors recruited from a tertiary care cardiac centre. Participants were at ≥15% on the Framingham 10-year absolute risk index (age, sex, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, smoking, and diabetes), free of ischaemic heart event (arrhythmia or unstable angina), and free of a diagnosis of congenital cardiac condition, based on medical records. Exclusion criteria were: taking anti-inflammatory drugs (i.e. aspirin, steroids) known to suppress IL-6,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741826711415720">22</xref></sup> antidepressants given that some reduce inflammation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741826711415720">23</xref></sup> and being on estrogen therapy. The latter is linked to increased hsCRP levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741826711415720">24</xref></sup> From our potential sample of 86 participants, one woman and one man refused to participate because of a busy schedule. The final sample (<italic>n </italic>= 84) consisted of 44 women (52%) and 40 men (48%). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711415720">Table 1</xref> shows women’s and men’s characteristics.

<sec id="sec5-1741826711415720"><title>Depressive symptoms</title>
<p>We measured depressive symptoms with the Beck Depression Inventory, second edition (BDI-II), a 21-item self-report scale, with excellent reliability (average coefficient alpha of 0.91) and validity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741826711415720">25</xref></sup> The BDI-II is one of the most widely used instruments to measure severity of depression components (i.e. affective, cognitive, psychomotor) over the 2 previous weeks. The items rate symptom intensity on a 0–3 scale. The BDI-II was completed twice: at entry to study (T1) and 6 months later (T2). To compare women and men with and without mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms, we used a cut-off of 10 to assign participants to either a group with current symptoms (BDI-II &gt;10, <italic>n </italic>= 18) or to a comparison group (BDI-II ≤10, <italic>n </italic>= 66). The BDI and BDI-II have frequently been used with post-myocardial infarction patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741826711415720">26</xref></sup> and a score ≤10 is considered normal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741826711415720">27</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1741826711415720"><title>Inflammatory markers</title>
<p>We measured serum hsCRP and IL-6 at follow-up (T2). hsCRP levels less than 1 mg/l indicate a low overall cardiac risk. Levels between 1 and 3 mg/l reflect a moderate risk while levels higher than 3 mg/l suggest an elevated risk (about 2–3 times higher than low levels).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741826711415720">28</xref></sup> Circulating IL-6 is found in normal individuals in the 1 pg/ml range, with slight elevations during menstrual cycle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741826711415720">29</xref></sup> Only 12 women were under the average age of menopause (51 years) but their menstrual status was not assessed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1741826711415720"><title>Collection of samples</title>
<p>There is no diurnal variation of hsCRP concentrations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741826711415720">30</xref></sup> To avoid any potential diurnal variation in IL-6, we measured all serum samples in the morning (0830 and 1230 hours at T2 (BDI-II of T2 completed). We instructed participants to have a light breakfast and avoid drinking coffee or smoking. They completed a brief questionnaire, asking about medication, what they ate at their last meal, whether they smoked or had a recent infection/injury. The serum was immediately stored at −80 C until assay.</p>
<p>hsCRP was assessed using a high sensitivity immunoturbidimetric assay on an ABX Pentra 400, a clinical chemistry analyser (HORIBA ABX, Chicksands, Shefford, UK). For the hsCRP assay, the analytic measurement range was 2–380 µl with automatic dilution from 1/2 to 1/22,500. The coefficient of variation values of the ABX Pentra 400 are less than 7.04% (conventional range). The analyser shows good reliability with low sample volume.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741826711415720">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Serum IL-6 was measured with a Quantikine HS enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for human IL-6 kit (R &amp; D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). This solid-phase ELISA is designed to measure human IL-6 in serum, plasma, and urine. The assay has a sensitivity &lt;0.03 pg/ml, an intra-assay variation &lt;8%, and inter-assay variation &lt;10%.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1741826711415720"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>We performed analyses with SPSS version 12.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Significance was defined as <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.05. Tests were two-tailed.</p>
<p>Because of positively skewed distributions, we log transformed the data for the inflammatory markers hsCRP and IL6. The transformations resulted in normal distributions.</p>
<p>Based on previous literature, we specified a priori the following potential covariates: infection within the past 2–3 weeks, medication use such as statins and beta-blockers, age, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, smoking, diabetes mellitus, and BMI. Four participants (two women, two men) reported using statins and beta-blockers. Given their potential to reduce inflammation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1741826711415720">32</xref></sup> we controlled for the latter in the analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1741826711415720"><title>Statistics</title>
<p>To test hypothesis 1, we ran a bivariate Pearson-product-moment correlation coefficient for the entire sample. We then ran two t-tests comparing hsCRP and IL-6 levels respectively in the two groups of individuals with mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms and in individuals without depressive symptoms. To test hypothesis 2, we performed a t-test on hsCRP and IL-6 levels in participants whose depressive symptoms were persistent (BDI-II scores &gt;10 at the two time points) and those without persistent scores (BDI-II &gt;10 at one time or no symptoms at all). To test hypotheses 3 and 4, we investigated hsCRP and IL-6 levels respectively as a function of sex and/or depressive symptoms, using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to control for potentially confounding variables.</p>

<p>Actual mean hsCRP levels were 2.32 mg/l (standard deviation, SD 7.8, median 1.00 mg/l), with half of the sample with levels raised above the conventional clinical cut-off point: 50% of participants had hsCRP levels &lt;1 mg/l, 25% 1−3 mg/l, and 25% &gt;3 mg/l.

Mean current BDI-II score (T2) was 6.43 (SD 5.89, range 0–22). Mean T1 BDI-II score was 6.82 (SD 5.75, range 0–22). Eight women and ten men had current mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms (BDI-II &gt;10). Of these, 12 had persistent symptoms, with BDI-II scores higher than 10 at T1 and T2.

<p>Our study investigated whether depressive symptoms can add ‘fuel to the fire’ of the inflammatory processes involved in early atherosclerosis. Given the finding by Miller et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711415720">17</xref></sup> in early heart syndromes, we investigated whether the severity of depressive mood, as measured by persistent symptoms at two time points 6 months apart, can lead to higher hsCRP and IL-6 in individuals at high risk for CAD. We found that persistent mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms were associated with higher hsCRP levels and the effect size was medium-to-large.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1741826711415720">33</xref></sup> Our findings corroborate those of others with patients who had recent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711415720">15</xref></sup> or earlier acute coronary syndromes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711415720">17</xref></sup> Even if our underlying hypothesis was that depressive symptoms ‘initiate’ inflammation, inflammation can also precede depression. Indeed, depressive symptoms, if persistent or strong enough, might aggravate inflammation, and the latter might further induce depressive mood.</p>
<p>Women had higher adjusted hsCRP levels than men. Despite the very small and non-significant gender difference in BDI-II scores, there was an interaction between sex and current symptoms: women with depressive symptoms had higher hsCRP levels than men. It is not possible to ascertain the reason for the small gender differences in depressive scores in our study. The interaction between sex and depressive symptoms reached statistical significance, despite small gender differences in BDI-II scores and the small number of women with depressive symptoms. Our finding differs from the results of Matthews et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741826711415720">24</xref></sup> of a 5-year longitudinal study of women during transition to menopause in which depressive symptoms were not associated with hsCRP but rather with increased fibrinogen, which facilitates platelet aggregation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711415720">3</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="sec16-1741826711415720"><title>hsCRP, depressive symptoms, and CAD risk?</title>
<p>Newer hsCRP assays detect subtle variations in persistent low-grade inflammation. Longitudinal epidemiological studies with women and men show that hsCRP (which has a heritability of 35–40%) is a strong independent risk factor for the likelihood of rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque; not only in cardiac patients or in patients with multiple risk factors but also, interestingly, in (apparently) healthy individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711415720">2</xref></sup> CAD and hsCRP might be related through chronic infection, obesity, or the pre-existing inflammatory atherosclerotic lesion. Inflammation can be related to both depression and atherosclerosis. Depressive symptoms persisting over 6 months might have had more time to instigate an inflammatory response. If so, it is possible that low-to-moderate depressive symptoms, which do not reach clinical significance for a diagnosis, are more likely to be related to hsCRP levels when they are chronic. hsCRP may add prognostic information at all levels of the Framingham risk. Although hsCRP confers risk in both sexes, prospective data show that, in healthy postmenopausal women, CRP and IL-6 independently provide a two-fold increase in CAD risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741826711415720">34</xref></sup> The clinical significance of increased adjusted hsCRP in women with and without depressive symptoms is unclear.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-1741826711415720"><title>Role of IL-6 in CAD risk?</title>
<p>IL-6 induces hsCRP production. Although hsCRP and IL-6 were highly correlated, which corroborates other findings,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711415720">15</xref></sup> IL-6 was not associated with depressive symptoms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec18-1741826711415720"><title>Strengths and limitations</title>
<p>The data should be interpreted cautiously, as sample was small and there was likely a restricted range in the depression and inflammation scores in this apparently healthy sample. It would have been preferable to measure hsCRP at the beginning of the study as this might have provided an initial look at the possible direction of the relationship between depression and hsCRP. This would have allowed us to better assess the trajectories and test meditational models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711415720">16</xref></sup> Finally, possible bi-directional associations between depressive symptoms and CRP could have limited the interpretability of our findings.</p>

<sec id="sec19-1741826711415720" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In apparently healthy individuals with cardiac risk factors, mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms persistent over 6 months were associated with increased hsCRP. As women with depressive symptoms had higher hsCRP levels than men with symptoms, we suggest that more clinical attention should be given to women at high cardiac risk when they experience depressive mood.</p>
