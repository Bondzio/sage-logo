It covers an extraordinary range of topics from adoption and child custody to sperm donation and no-fault divorce. The book is divided into four major sections: the decline of Victorian marriage law; the impact of the sexual revolution on family law; the rise of freer divorce and its impact on women and children; and family law related to children and the elderly. Although the authors emphasize that family law is largely state law, they also argue that in two domains of individual rights, the right to marry and the right to privacy, the Supreme Court broke new ground. The authors rely on their own extensive research in some areas such as breach of promise lawsuits and divorce, but on the whole, exploit evidence from newspaper stories, law review articles, and appellate court cases. What constitutes family law, the authors acknowledge, is largely a matter of the conventions law professors generally employ: welfare, policy, and trusts and estates are usually not considered family law. The authors challenge the arbitrary divide by considering inheritance law as family law, but elsewhere conform to the general conventions, largely omitting discussion of welfare or social policy law. There is thus a propertied middle-class bias to this history of family law; at the same time, “the state” appears less powerful than it is, in part because social policy law (e.g., pregnancy discrimination law or Social Security law) is sidelined.</p><p>The other bias, or perspective, of the authors is that the law is largely the product of social forces, not a set of rules and doctrines dependent upon legal precedent or the imprint of famous judges. This law-and-society perspective has informed the prodigious scholarly output of Lawrence Friedman, a professor of law at Stanford University. Grossman, a professor of law at Hofstra University, studied with Friedman at Stanford Law school and is most well known for her writing about sexual harassment and same-sex marriage. The major trends the authors discern are the decline in stigma related to many sexual and family matters, a diminuition in the power of the state to confine sex to marriage, and a greater emphasis in family law on the rights of the individual, especially increasing rights for women and children. They argue that family law became more flexible, permissive, and secular over the course of the twentieth century, and as a result, the law began to recognize a diversity of family forms and endorse what they call “expressive individualism.” These developments occurred because of the sexual revolution, expressive individualism, and changes in gender roles. The authors also mention in passing the role of media, scandals, and specific incidents in attracting the attention of lawmakers and judges.</p><p>The book tends to take a broad brush and topical approach to the history of family law. It is fairly clear what the authors have in mind when discussing “the sexual revolution” but “expressive individualism” is a vaguer but commonly invoked phrase, a cause and consequence of social change. Many topics such as marital rape or domestic violence receive a few paragraphs for the sake of coverage, but are not central to the narrative. The authors prefer the frame of a law school rather than history survey: historical context is less important than legal doctrines or special legal cases. Nonetheless, by reading between the lines, it is possible to periodize American family law over more than a century. One comes away with the impression that the Progressive era was period of state intrusion in the family in response to nativism and eugenic fears, that the 1960s was a time of social change and assertion of rights, and that a great deal of family law was made in the late twentieth century. The late twentieth century seems to have a contested character: family law moved in a progressive direction in response to social movements and new reproductive technology but at the same time, backlash movements fought back against more liberal trends in the law. (In conceding that backlash was partly a response to liberal Supreme Court rulings, they concede that the law influences society, not simply that society influences the law.) Harder to pin down is any defining characteristic of the period 1920 and 1960: with the decline of Prohibition, it appears that the state became more reluctant to impose morality, and the sexual revolution of the 1920s helped to destroy the view that women were the innocent victims of male lust and aggression. The authors tend to employ familiar categories of social history and sociology, in characterizing broad changes in marriage as traditional, companionate, and expressive marriage. The legal case, not the individual, receives the most attention. Even within that focus, it is hard to explain the virtual absence of the discussion of <italic>Roe v Wade.</italic> The legalization of abortion by the US Supreme Court in 1973 expanded the right to privacy and women’s rights, but also forever altered family law, revealing that US constitutional law has had a major impact on society and American politics.</p><p>The book is remarkably up-to-date, with discussion of cases of the last decade and a topic of recent vintage such as parental rights of same-sex parents receiving coverage. In an attempt to make the arcane subject of family law accessible to a wider audience, the authors cross the line into the breezy and colloquial, as in a sentence such as “cohabitation was as common as dirt.” Actually, the book is most accessible when it adopts a historical narrative—a rise and decline, as in chapters about heartbalm law suits, the decline of the law of common-law marriage, and the disappearance of collusive divorce, as it was replaced by state laws permitting no-fault divorce. The authors have undertaken an almost impossible task, of synthesizing a huge and diverse literature, discerning broad patterns of change, while acknowledging developments that deviate from the general pattern. This book is a necessary purchase for any one interested in the history of US family law, and will no doubt be read more as an encyclopedia—a particular chapter or topic—rather than in a single reading. The authors avoid predicting whether same-sex marriage will triumph but conclude that the trend in family law toward the recognition of individual rights is irreversible. Overall, the most ready conclusion is that the family law has been pushed and shoved into adapting to social and reproductive change, which sometimes put the breaks on judicial authority, but often expanded the subjective judgment of judges in areas such as child custody.</p></body></article>
