<p>For many in both the news business and in journalism education, Philip Meyer changed the way journalists do their work. It was an elegant, commonsense, and revolutionary idea: apply social science techniques to reporting. The result is a richer, more complete, and generalizable kind of storytelling that Meyer called “precision journalism.”</p>
<p>As Meyer himself likes to tell it, the name he used for the general approach, also the name of his first book, written in 1969, often used to draw chuckles: “<italic>Precision Journalism</italic>? That’s an oxymoron!” Which sometimes would deepen into laughs when Meyer was asked what else he had written, to which he had to reply, “<italic>Ethical Journalism</italic>.” He says he almost added a third oxymoronic title to another academic book on repairing newspapers’ business model, but decided against “Profitable Journalism.”</p>
<p>With this book, however, Meyer tells a different kind of story—his own—describing the autobiographical course of his <italic>Paper Route</italic> from his Swiss forebears’ arrival as Kansas homesteaders in the 1880s, to Meyer’s career in newspapers and as one of the nation’s preeminent journalism scholars and teachers at the University of North Carolina–Chapel Hill. For those who know Meyer’s professional and scholarly work, <italic>Paper Route</italic> offers a charmingly modest and often humorous side to the man, from parents born on neighboring family farms in Washington County, Kansas, and his birth as a Depression-era baby, his college experience at Kansas State, and the start of his journalism career.</p>
<p>Meyers, newlywed, moved to Chapel Hill in the 1950s, where the future godfather of the scientific method took a job as a graduate assistant, learning about his first chi-square: “The formula seemed very complicated to me,” he writes, “and the calculation was pure drudgery.” He was studying political science to prepare for his goal of becoming a Washington correspondent. Meyer says he “remained safely on the traditional, qualitative side” of political science, which was easier than “mastering the chi-square test.”</p>
<p>Meyer voted by absentee ballot in Kansas for Eisenhower, “not suspecting that he was the last Republican I would ever support for national office,” he says, although “Chapel Hill did not make me a liberal all at once.” Meyer had worked for a variety of Kansas papers as both a writer and photographer, but his first newspaper job after the master’s degree at Chapel Hill was at the <italic>Miami Herald</italic>, where an assistant managing editor was a guy from the Midwest named Al Neuharth. He was the <italic>Herald</italic>’s education reporter at $115/week, covering school desegregation and then interviewing the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. after the arrest of eighteen blacks at a whites-only restaurant. Then there was the banning of George Orwell’s <italic>1984</italic> and Aldous Huxley’s <italic>Brave New World</italic> by seventeen high school principals, none of whom had read the books; the books were put back on the library shelves after Meyer’s story.</p>
<p><italic>Paper Route</italic> is not all newsroom war stories, of course. Meyer traces his evolution from the grad student who feared chi-squares, to DC, to Harvard for a Neiman fellowship to work on journalistic use of survey data, to his growing involvement in AAPOR—the American Association for Public Opinion Research. It is fascinating to watch Meyer’s slow growth from the grad student who avoided statistics into one of the nation’s top experts in the use of the scientific method in journalism.</p>
<p>We know how this story comes out, of course, so there’s not much suspense, but it’s interesting to watch as the idea takes hold. At the <italic>Herald</italic>, he says, “we had discussed the possibility of reporting on some interesting social phenomenon. We always ended with a shrug and a lament that there was no way to measure it.”</p>
<p>“Journalists and scientists, I realized, were basically in the same business, discovering and imparting the truth,” he writes. “Now I saw how statistical tools could dredge meaning from large bodies of data.” At Harvard, Meyer got access to computers—“a machine that could do the heavy lifting. As long as I understood what went into the black box and what came out, I could apply statistics to interesting questions,” he says. “It would not give me X-ray vision like Clark Kent, but it did seem like a superpower.”</p>
<p>Meyer began to use his superpower for good—stories based on surveys about race for Knight newspapers in Miami and Detroit changed laws—and then he got a grant for what would turn out to be <italic>Precision Journalism</italic>. But not before Everette Dennis, then a faculty member at K-State, suggested the name instead of Meyer’s working title: <italic>The Application of Social and Behavioral Science Research Methods to the Practice of Journalism</italic>. Whew. Meyer had to reframe and retool his manuscript, because foundations and publishers couldn’t figure out how to market it. It was the now too-familiar conflict between “Green Eyeshades” and “Chi Squares” that continues to afflict town-gown relations in journalism. “Meyer is too far ahead of us,” a reviewer in <italic>The Quill</italic> wrote. “His case rests on association of news and truth that does not exist in the newsroom. News is only accidentally true. …”</p>
<p>That, of course, is exactly what Phil Meyer was trying to remedy in using social science methods to bridge the gap between the news and provable truth. <italic>Precision Journalism</italic> finally came out in 1973, and has gone through four printings. But it was still another sixteen years before Bill Dedman, then of the <italic>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</italic>, won his investigative Pulitzer using Meyer’s technique for his “The Color of Money” series.</p>
<p>Meyer’s <italic>Paper Route</italic>, like himself, is low key and self-deprecating. But this is a lot more than a memoir; it traces an extraordinary career of a man whose early journalistic hero was Clark Kent, a thoughtful guy who is still out ahead of most of us, who developed a superpower that has the potential, at least, to change the way journalism is done, if only we’d use it.</p>
