<p>The study of voice climate in organizations is a recent introduction to the voice literature and much is still unknown about the outcomes associated with voice climate or the processes by which voice climate influences those outcomes. Drawing from social information processing theory, this study casts psychological empowerment as a cognitive mechanism through which shared voice climate perceptions in work groups are translated into individual work outcomes—voice behavior and customer service performance. Based on a sample of 314 full-time employees in 53 work groups, the results of our study suggest that psychological empowerment fully mediates the relationship between voice climate and customer service performance, and it only partially mediates the relationship between voice climate and voice behavior. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings as well as future research directions are discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Voice climate, defined as shared employee perceptions of the extent to which they are encouraged to speak up and make suggestions in the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1059601112463960">Morrison, Wheeler-Smith, &amp; Kamdar, 2011</xref>), is a recent introduction to the voice literature that captures the contextual influences that encourage employee voice. This line of research is the result of the increasing recognition of the benefits specifically associated with employee voice behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1059601112463960">Van Dyne &amp; LePine, 1998</xref>) and a broader recognition of the importance of employee proactivity in today’s organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059601112463960">Frese &amp; Fay, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059601112463960">Ilgen &amp; Pulakos, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1059601112463960">Parker &amp; Collins, 2010</xref>). However, to reap rewards from employee input, the work context must be supportive of such behavior by signaling to employees that their input is valued. Indeed, initial empirical research on voice climate has demonstrated that fostering a climate for voice has a positive effect on employee’s willingness to make suggestions for improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059601112463960">Frazier &amp; Bowler, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1059601112463960">Morrison et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Research results on voice climate suggest that it is a construct worthy of further examination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059601112463960">Morrison, 2011</xref>). Despite the encouraging results related to voice climate and its influence on voice behavior in organizations, much is still unknown about <italic>why</italic> and <italic>how</italic> voice climate influences voice behavior. In order to extend our knowledge of this process, research is needed to examine the psychological mechanisms by which voice climate is translated into work behaviors. In addition, the majority of climate research has typically focused too narrowly on the specific outcomes (i.e., voice behavior) associated with specific climates (i.e., voice climate), which limits our understanding of the broader influence climates have in the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059601112463960">Kuenzi &amp; Schminke, 2009</xref>). For research on voice climate to contribute to the literature, other outcomes beyond speaking up that may result from voice climate should be examined.</p>
<p>With these issues in mind, the purpose of this article is twofold. First, this study posits that psychological empowerment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1059601112463960">Spreitzer, 1995</xref>), an active intrinsic motivational state with its focus on providing employees a sense of control over their work, will serve as a cognitive mechanism through which shared voice climate perceptions are translated into individual work outcomes. By doing so, this article answers calls to broaden our understanding of the motivational processes behind proactive behaviors, such as voice behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1059601112463960">Parker, Bindl, &amp; Strauss, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1059601112463960">Parker &amp; Collins, 2010</xref>). Second, in addition to voice behavior, we focus on customer service performance in our theoretical model as an additional outcome that may result from voice climate’s influence on psychological empowerment. This role-based performance dimension captures the extent to which employees provide high-quality service to customers, interact professionally with them, and anticipate their needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059601112463960">Chen &amp; Klimoski, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>We chose customer service as an important outcome to examine because customer service performance is vital to organizational success as “the service sector accounts for about 70% of aggregate production and employment in OECD economies and continues to grow” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1059601112463960">Wölfl, 2005</xref>, p. 6). Furthermore, because interactions with customers are so important to long-term success of service organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059601112463960">Liao &amp; Chuang, 2004</xref>), customer service has become an important element of defining employee role performance expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059601112463960">Bowen &amp; Waldman, 1999</xref>). Due to their proximal relationship with customers, frontline employees often possess valuable knowledge regarding customer needs and are best in the position to anticipate and respond to those needs. As employees are able to respond to and anticipate customer needs, customer service performance will be enhanced. As such, fostering a proactive work context, such as voice climate, should lead to improved service of the organization’s customers as employees have a sense of control over their work and are able to anticipate and proactively respond to customer needs. For these reasons, we feel that an examination of the influence that voice climate and psychological empowerment have on improving <italic>customer service performance</italic> is both theoretically and practically interesting as this research area develops.</p>
<p>To summarize, our model examines voice climate and its influence on <italic>psychological empowerment</italic>, an active, intrinsic motivational construct. Our study also examines the mediating role of psychological empowerment in the relationships of voice climate with two outcome variables: a citizenship behavior (i.e., voice behavior) and a role-based performance variable (i.e., customer service performance). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1059601112463960">Figure 1</xref> presents the hypothesized model of the current study.</p>

<title>Theoretical Framework and Hypotheses</title>
<p>Social information processing (SIP) theory posits that perceptions of social context in the workplace influence subsequent individual behavior and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1059601112463960">Salancik &amp; Pfeffer, 1978</xref>). Because employees interpret the features of their workplace via social interactions with the intent of making sense of their environment, work context is posited to influence employee behavior through attitudes, perceptions, and employee motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059601112463960">Berger &amp; Luckmann, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1059601112463960">Salancik &amp; Pfeffer, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1059601112463960">Thomas &amp; Velthouse, 1990</xref>). Most important for this study is that in this process of social information processing, employees develop shared perceptions of the extent to which they are encouraged or discouraged to speak up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059601112463960">Morrison &amp; Milliken, 2000</xref>). These shared perceptions then influence subsequent motivation and behavioral outcomes. It is the process by which the social context in the workplace affects employee psychological empowerment and important work outcomes that is of interest in the current study. By integrating SIP theory and past research in the climate literature, we attempt to examine the cognitive mechanisms and behavioral outcomes that are influenced by voice climate.</p>
<sec id="section3-1059601112463960">
<title>Voice Climate</title>
<p>The concept of voice has been defined in a number of ways across a variety of literatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1059601112463960">Wilkinson &amp; Fay, 2011</xref>). The human resources management literature focuses on allowing employees input into work practices (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059601112463960">Boxall &amp; Purcell, 2003</xref>), whereas the industrial relations literature casts voice as a mechanism by which the company and workforce are both represented (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059601112463960">Freeman &amp; Medoff, 1984</xref>). In light of these divergent concepts of voice, it is important to be clear on the focus of voice climate research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1059601112463960">Van Dyne, Ang, &amp; Botero, 2003</xref>). Therefore, the concept of voice utilized in the current study draws from the work of Van Dyne and colleagues (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1059601112463960">Van Dyne, Cummings, &amp; McLean Parks, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1059601112463960">Van Dyne, Graham, &amp; Dienesch, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1059601112463960">Van Dyne &amp; LePine, 1998</xref>). Voice behavior is defined as promotive behavior that emphasizes constructive challenge intended to improve a situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1059601112463960">Van Dyne &amp; LePine, 1998</xref>). Because voice behavior challenges the status quo and has the potential to upset others, group members assess the risks and benefits of engaging in such behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059601112463960">Detert &amp; Burris, 2007</xref>). If the risks are too great, group members will not likely engage in voice behaviors, which may hinder the organization’s long-term viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1059601112463960">Whiting, Podsakoff, &amp; Pierce, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the benefits that may accrue as a result of speaking up, organizations may be interested in creating a climate that encourages voice behaviors, which is labeled <italic>voice climate.</italic> Drawing from previous climate research, voice climate is conceptualized as a specific climate because it has a specific outcome referent<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1059601112463960">1</xref></sup> (i.e., voice behavior; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1059601112463960">Schneider, 1990</xref>). Though research on voice climate is relatively new, there is theoretical basis for the voice climate construct. In their development of climates of silence, which are shared perceptions among employees that speaking up about problems or issues is futile and/or dangerous, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059601112463960">Morrison and Milliken (2000)</xref> proposed that factors in the workplace might hinder speaking up at work. This is in line with prior research suggesting that context will have an influence on one’s willingness to speak up (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059601112463960">Ashford, Rothbard, Piderit, &amp; Dutton, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059601112463960">Detert &amp; Treviño, 2010</xref>). Though Morrison and Milliken’s work focused on factors that may hinder speaking up at work, the theoretical foundation is consistent with our view of voice climate in that it addresses speaking up at work and the perceptions employees share of the acceptability of such behavior.</p>
<p>Recent empirical research has provided support for the construct validity of voice climate. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1059601112463960">Morrison et al. (2011)</xref> found that group perceptions of voice climate influenced individual voice behavior, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059601112463960">Frazier and Bowler (in press)</xref> found that voice climate predicted group voice behavior. Although these results indicate that voice climate does influence speaking up, early research findings suggest that it may have a broader influence on work outcomes. For example, Frazier and Bowler found that voice climate influenced group performance beyond its influence on group voice behavior. Given the limited number of studies on voice climate, there is still much to be learned about the process by which employees translate perceptions of voice climate into work outcomes and the outcomes that may result beyond speaking up.</p>

<sec id="section4-1059601112463960">
<title>Psychological Empowerment</title>
<p>In an effort to understand the process by which voice climate influences outcomes, we examine the role of psychological empowerment as a key motivational mechanism in the voice climate–work outcomes relationship. Psychological empowerment has been cast as a psychological state necessary for employees to possess a sense of control in relation to their work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1059601112463960">Spreitzer, 2008</xref>). Through this intrinsic motivational state, employees perceive that they are able to affect change through their work roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1059601112463960">Spreitzer, 1995</xref>). As such, these feelings of intrinsic motivation are thought to spur empowered workers into an active, rather than passive, role as they carry out their work tasks. Consequently, from a SIP perspective, psychological empowerment is particularly appropriate to serve as an active intrinsic motivational state that translates a proactive work context (i.e., voice climate) into workplace behaviors (i.e., voice behavior and customer service performance).</p>
<p>Drawing from previous work on psychological empowerment, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1059601112463960">Spreitzer (1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1059601112463960">1997</xref>) developed and found support for a higher-order model of psychological empowerment that consists of four underlying cognitions: meaning, competence, self-determination, and impact (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1059601112463960">Seibert, Wang, &amp; Courtright, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1059601112463960">Spreitzer, 2008</xref>, for a review). Though there are four underlying cognitions to the construct, Spreitzer noted that no single dimension captures the range of outcomes of overall psychological empowerment. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1059601112463960">Seibert et al. (2011)</xref> examined this issue in an extensive meta-analysis of empowerment research. Their results suggested that the four underlying dimensions showed little evidence of discriminant validity with the outcomes in the study and the higher-order conceptualization fit the data best in confirmatory factor models. They then concluded that the “use of the unitary psychological empowerment construct is most appropriate” (p. 992). To be consistent with our theoretical model and recent empirical research, the overall empowerment construct is of interest in this study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1059601112463960">
<title>Voice Climate and Psychological Empowerment</title>
<p>Considerable research has demonstrated that shared perceptions about the context of work provide cues of what is or is not acceptable at work (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059601112463960">Kuenzi &amp; Schminke, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1059601112463960">Schneider, 1990</xref>). In developing their case for the psychological empowerment construct, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1059601112463960">Thomas and Velthouse (1990)</xref> suggested that “intrinsic task motivation is asserted to be influenced not solely by external events, but also by the way those events are construed” (p. 669). In other words, the extent to which employees are empowered is likely to be affected by the way employees perceive contextual factors in the workplace. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1059601112463960">Seibert et al. (2011)</xref> provided meta-analytic support for this in demonstrating that sociopolitical support had a positive relationship with psychological empowerment. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059601112463960">Choi (2007)</xref> found that innovative climate was positively related to psychological empowerment. Taken together, past research on work context and employee empowerment indicates that climate perceptions not only provide cues for subsequent motivational states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1059601112463960">Salancik &amp; Pfeffer, 1978</xref>) but may also provide the type of social support necessary to nurture intrinsic motivation in employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1059601112463960">Spreitzer, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The purpose of voice climate is to encourage employees to speak up, and thus, to take a more proactive role in their work. Drawing from SIP theory, voice climate sends the signal to employees that being proactive is acceptable and encouraged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059601112463960">Frazier &amp; Bowler, in press</xref>), thus triggering an active orientation within employees. Psychological empowerment represents such an active orientation to work and will likely be influenced by voice climate. As employees are encouraged to speak up and make suggestions, they will feel that their jobs have meaning and purpose within the work group. They should also perceive that this proactive work context provides them opportunities to demonstrate and increase their competence within their work role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059601112463960">Bandura, 1989</xref>), provide them higher levels of work autonomy, and perceive that they do have an impact on how their work is performed going forward. Taken together, it is posited that voice climate, by encouraging employees to speak up and be proactive at work, will spur employees into an active mindset at work and give them a sense of control over how they conduct their work. Therefore, we hypothesize the following:</p>

<title>Psychological Empowerment and Voice Behavior</title>
<p>Though psychological empowerment has been shown to be related to organizational citizenship behavior (OCB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1059601112463960">Seibert et al., 2011</xref>), to our knowledge no study has examined the influence of psychological empowerment on voice behavior. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059601112463960">Choi (2007)</xref> found that psychological empowerment was positively related to change-oriented OCB, which has some similarity to voice behavior, but is more broadly focused on other issues such as innovation. There is reason to believe that psychological empowerment will positively influence voice behavior, however. Research has demonstrated that employees who invest themselves into their work are more likely to speak up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1059601112463960">O’Driscoll, Pierce, &amp; Coghlan, 2006</xref>). Along these lines, psychologically empowered employees feel a sense of control over their work and will likely want to influence their work by making relevant suggestions for improvement to current policies or practices. Employees who attach greater value to their work, feel highly capable of performing their work, and feel a sense of choice and autonomy to initiate action are also more likely to exhibit proactive behavior, such as engaging in voice behaviors. Finally, since empowered employees are intrinsically motivated, they also will want to find ways of improving their work situations and staying on top of relevant work-related issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1059601112463960">Spreitzer, 1995</xref>). Consequently:</p>

<title>Psychological Empowerment and Customer Service Performance</title>
<p>Past research has suggested that empowered employees are likely to be better performers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059601112463960">Chen &amp; Klimoski, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1059601112463960">Thomas &amp; Velthouse, 1990</xref>) and empirical results have supported this notion (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059601112463960">Chen, Kirkman, Kanfer, Allen, &amp; Rosen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1059601112463960">Liden, Wayne, &amp; Sparrowe, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1059601112463960">Seibert, Silver, &amp; Randolph, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1059601112463960">Seibert et al., 2011</xref>). However, the changing nature of work in modern organizations has led to an increased interest in performance across different work roles in the organization (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059601112463960">Charbonnier-Voirin, El Akremi, &amp; Vandenberghe, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059601112463960">Milkovich &amp; Bourdeau, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1059601112463960">Welbourne, Johnson, &amp; Erez, 1998</xref>). Indeed, even within the same organization, employees may experience different roles within their job functions. For example, some jobs are more customer focused (e.g., sales) whereas others may be more team oriented (e.g., marketing team).</p>
<p>Despite this changing focus on role performance, past empowerment studies have generally chosen to collapse role performance into a broader, aggregated, overall performance construct (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059601112463960">Chen &amp; Klimoski, 2003</xref>). One exception, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059601112463960">Liao, Toya, Lepak, and Hong (2009)</xref>, did find that psychological empowerment was significantly related to service performance. We believe that psychological empowerment will be positively related to customer service performance in the current study, as well. An empowered employee in a customer service role should provide superior service because they are intrinsically motivated and view high levels of customer service as a critical part of their jobs. Empowered employees feel that they have an impact through their work and should view working effectively with customers as a way to influence others. They also feel they have the skills and autonomy necessary to adapt and respond appropriately to customer wants and needs. Taken together, higher levels of empowerment will lead to better performance levels across various work roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1059601112463960">Seibert et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, since empowered employees experience more job satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1059601112463960">Wang &amp; Lee, 2009</xref>) and are more committed to their job (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1059601112463960">Seibert et al., 2011</xref>), they will see customers as more than a source of sales but as an integral part of the organization’s success.

<title>The Mediating Role of Psychological Empowerment</title>
<p>Prior studies have demonstrated the role of psychological empowerment as a mediator of the relationships between work context and work outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059601112463960">Avolio, Zhu, Koh, &amp; Bhatia, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059601112463960">Carless, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1059601112463960">Liden et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1059601112463960">Seibert et al., 2011</xref>). Although research on voice climate has yet to explore the role of employee intrinsic motivation as a mediating mechanism, studies do show that cognitive mechanisms such as psychological ownership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1059601112463960">O’Driscoll et al., 2006</xref>) and self-regulatory processes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059601112463960">Kanfer, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1059601112463960">Wallace &amp; Chen, 2006</xref>) link distal antecedents, such as work context, to individual behaviors in the workplace. Consistent with SIP logic, it is believed that psychological empowerment will fulfill that role, serving as a cognitive motivational mechanism through which shared perceptions of voice climate influence both voice behavior and customer service performance. Thus, we integrate the previous theoretical arguments as a test of the overall hypothetical model of the current study and hypothesize the following:</p>
<list id="list4-1059601112463960" list-type="simple">

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Employees and supervisors from a large building facilities and maintenance organization located in the Midwestern United States agreed to participate in the current research effort in exchange for summary results of the study. The participating organization provides facilities maintenance and support in a large university campus and the customers are the various departments across the university. For this particular organization, customer service is a crucial part of the organization’s mission, and top management viewed the improvement of customer service as a key initiative. In addition, as we discussed the study design prior to data collection, management expressed an interest in fostering a workplace in which employees were more proactive in response to customer needs and in improving organizational functioning. These two points were the driving factors to the design of the current study.</p>
<p>The entire organization was invited to participate in the study, which resulted in a recruited sample consisting of all 502 full-time employees. Prior to the commencement of this study, announcements were included in the organization’s newsletter and top management of the organization indicated support for the project and encouraged employees to participate. Employees in the organization perform a variety of tasks that include physical tasks (e.g., lawn maintenance, custodial work) to more cognitive tasks (e.g., engineering, facilities planning). More specifically, the participants of this study can generally be placed in a broad range of work group types such as general maintenance (e.g., grounds crew, paint), custodial, administrative roles (e.g., mail clerks, project support), specific trades (e.g., carpenters, electricians), engineers, architects, and upper management.</p>

<sec id="section11-1059601112463960">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were deleted if they failed to provide useable data across both time periods. Of the recruited sample, 359 individuals (67% male, 33% female) provided useable self-reported data for a response rate of nearly 72% across the entire organization. We were unable to obtain supervisor ratings of performance for 45 of those individuals, resulting in a final sample of 314 individuals nested into 53 work groups. Following the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059601112463960">George (1990)</xref>, work groups were determined by those members of a work unit that report to a common supervisor. Work group sizes ranged from 2 to 31 with an average size of 5.92 members per group. The average age of the sample was 42.9 (<italic>SD</italic> = 14.23). The sample was 89% Caucasian, 2% African American, 1.3% Hispanic American, and 7.7% Other American. The average tenure in their current work group was 7.76 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 8.99). Surveys were administered over a 2-month period with employees initially completing the measure for voice climate. Approximately 4 weeks later, employees completed the psychological empowerment measure. Supervisor ratings of employee voice behavior and customer service performance were collected 2 weeks after the second data collection from employees.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section13-1059601112463960">
<title>Voice climate</title>
<p>Voice climate was measured with a 6-item scale from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059601112463960">Frazier and Bowler (in press)</xref>, which was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1059601112463960">Van Dyne and LePine (1998)</xref>. The items were worded such that the group was the referent. This referent shift approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059601112463960">Chan, 1998</xref>) is consistent with the definition of voice climate utilized in our study. Responses were made on a 7-point scale anchored by 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> and 7 = <italic>strongly agree.</italic> This voice climate measure captures the shared perceptions held by the entire work group regarding the extent to which the group members felt they were encouraged to speak up and make suggestions. A sample item from the voice climate scale is, “The members of my work group are <italic>encouraged</italic> to develop and make recommendations concerning issues that affect our work.” The 6-item measure of voice climate used in this study yielded an acceptable internal consistency (α = .86).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1059601112463960">
<title>Psychological empowerment</title>
<p>Employees completed the 16-item psychological empowerment scale developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1059601112463960">Spreitzer (1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1059601112463960">1996</xref>). Responses were made on a 7-point scale anchored by 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> and 7 = <italic>strongly agree.</italic> Research has shown that psychological empowerment is a higher-order factor that is comprised of four underlying facets: competence, self-determination, impact, and meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1059601112463960">Spreitzer, 1995</xref>). A sample item of each scale is, “I am confident about my ability to do my job” (competence), “I have significant autonomy in determining how to do my job” (self-determination), “My impact on what happens in my department is large” (impact), and “The work that I do is important to me” (meaning). Given that the focus for the current study was on overall empowerment, the higher-order factor of empowerment was used in all analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059601112463960">Avolio et al., 2004</xref>). The overall scale of psychological empowerment yielded an acceptable internal consistency (α = .94).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1059601112463960">
<title>Voice behavior</title>
<p>Voice behavior was assessed by each employee’s direct supervisor and was measured using the 6-item scale by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1059601112463960">Van Dyne and LePine (1998)</xref>. In discussions with management prior to the commencement of the study, it was determined that direct supervisors would be in the best position to accurately report on employee voice behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059601112463960">LePine, Erez, &amp; Johnson, 2002</xref>). Responses were made on a 7-point scale anchored by 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> and 7 = <italic>strongly agree.</italic> A sample item from this scale is, “This particular employee develops and makes recommendations concerning issues that affect his/her work.” This scale asked the supervisors to rate the actual behaviors of employees. The 6-item measure of voice behavior demonstrated acceptable internal consistency (α = .96).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1059601112463960">
<title>Customer service performance</title>
<p>Customer service performance was assessed by each employee’s direct supervisor and was measured using the 4-item scale from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059601112463960">Chen and Klimoski (2003)</xref>. In deciding how to assess customer service performance, we again spoke with top management. Though ratings of customer service from the customers would have been ideal, the organization had not yet established a formal process by which to elicit customer feedback. The supervisors in this organization had direct contact with customers and were in the best position to provide ratings of their group members based on feedback the supervisors received from the customers and from direct observation of employees interacting with customers. Sample items are “Anticipates customer needs” and “Interacts professionally with customers.” Responses for this scale were made on a 5-point scale anchored by 1 = <italic>needs much improvement</italic> and 5 = <italic>excellent</italic>. The 4-item measure of customer service performance demonstrated acceptable internal consistency (α = .93).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1059601112463960">
<title>Control variables</title>
<p>Recent meta-analytic results showed that tenure and age may have an influence on psychological empowerment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1059601112463960">Seibert et al., 2011</xref>). In an effort to control for the effects of these variables, we include them in our analysis. We also control for the effects of minority status within the group (1 = Caucasian, 0 = non-Caucasian) as it is likely to affect group functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059601112463960">Mannix &amp; Neale, 2005</xref>). Finally, we control for the effects of educational background as it has been shown to influence voice behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1059601112463960">Van Dyne &amp; LePine, 1998</xref>). Education was operationalized as a categorical variable anchored by 1 = <italic>less than high school</italic> and 5 = <italic>master’s degree or higher.</italic></p>

<title>Measurement Models, Data Aggregation, and Initial Analyses</title>
<p>We first performed a series of traditional confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) to examine the distinctiveness of our measures. The first model consisted of seven factors, with each scale loading onto a latent variable, including a four-dimensional conceptualization of psychological empowerment. This model fit the data fairly well with χ<sup>2</sup> = 1155.15 (<italic>df</italic> = 443, <italic>p</italic> = .00), comparative fit index (CFI) = .96, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = .07, and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) = .17. A second model was tested in which empowerment remained a four dimensional construct, but the two work outcomes in this study were combined into one facet. This model was intended to assess the dimensionality of our two outcome variables and this model fit the data significantly worse (χ<sup>2</sup> = 1363.40, <italic>df</italic> = 449, CFI = .95, RMSEA = .09, and SRMR = .18). A third model collapsed psychological empowerment into a single factor while now allowing the outcome variables to load onto their respective factors. This model fit the data poorly as well (χ<sup>2</sup> = 1868.78, <italic>df</italic> = 458, CFI = .92, RMSEA = .11, and SRMR = .18). The final model cast psychological empowerment as a second-order factor consisting of the four underlying facets, while allowing the other variables (i.e., voice climate, voice behavior, and customer service performance) to load onto their respective factors. This model fit the data well, supporting the higher-order conceptualization of empowerment (χ<sup>2</sup> = 860.57, <italic>df</italic> = 460, CFI = .98, RMSEA = .06, and SRMR = .05).</p>
<p>The data for this study are nested in two ways. First, the work groups in this organization were organized by direct supervisor and each employee reported to only one supervisor. Second, supervisors provided performance ratings for all of the employees in their work group. Therefore, there is the possibility that group membership or supervisor effects may influence the results of our analysis. In order to account for this, we next conducted a multilevel CFA. Multilevel CFA provides a more comprehensive view of the data structure and allows researchers to capture the individual and group level influences simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059601112463960">Hirst, Van Knippenberg, &amp; Zhou, 2009</xref>). In this way, we are better able to control for the nested nature of our data (i.e., group membership and supervisors rating multiple employees). We expected the factor structure found on the individual level to be consistent at the group level, so we tested the measurement model from the traditional CFA at both the within and between levels in the multilevel CFA. The results of the multilevel CFA supported the assertion that the factor structure would hold at both levels (χ2 = 1115.61, <italic>df</italic> = 887, RMSEA = .04).</p>
<p>We next turn our attention to the aggregation of the voice climate construct. To justify data aggregation, researchers must show that there is sufficient within-group homogeneity and that there is sufficient dissimilarity between groups. Since voice climate was operationalized as a group-level variable, aggregation statistics were computed for voice climate. The average r<sub>wg(j)</sub> for voice climate was .82 (range: .53 to .97, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.12). The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for voice climate were: ICC(1) = .27, ICC(2) = .69; <italic>F</italic>(52, 261) = 3.23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. These results generally show support for aggregation as r<sub>wg(j)</sub> was above the .70 rule of thumb and the ANOVA (analysis of variance) results showed significant between group differences. Descriptive statistics, reliabilities, and correlations among the study’s individual-level variables are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059601112463960">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Hypothesis Testing</title>
<p>To test the hypotheses of this study, we employed random coefficient modeling (RCM) using MPlus version 6.11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1059601112463960">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2010</xref>). We chose to utilize RCM because of the nested nature of our data. For this type of data, RCM is better suited to test cross-level relationships because the independent error assumption of ordinary least squares regression is often violated due to the nested nature of the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059601112463960">Gavin &amp; Hofmann, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1059601112463960">Mayer &amp; Gavin, 2005</xref>). In the analysis, voice climate was examined at the group level whereas psychological empowerment and both outcome variables were examined at the individual level. The hypotheses were tested via procedures provided to accompany <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1059601112463960">Preacher, Zyphur, and Zhang (2010)</xref>, which allow for the calculation of direct and indirect effects.

Hypothesis 4a predicted that psychological empowerment would mediate the relationship between voice climate and voice behavior. We found only partial support for this hypothesis as voice climate remains a significant predictor of voice behavior when psychological empowerment is added to the model. For customer service performance, voice climate is no longer a significant predictor of customer service performance once psychological empowerment is added to the model. Therefore, Hypothesis 4b was supported.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The study of voice climate in organizations is a recent introduction to the voice literature and much is still unknown about the outcomes associated with voice climate or the processes by which voice climate influences those outcomes. This study addresses these issues and extends our current knowledge of voice climate in the workplace in two important ways. First, it was found that voice climate positively affects voice behavior and customer service performance, findings we believe build and broaden the predictive validity of the <italic>voice climate</italic> construct in regard to important aspects of performance in the workplace. The second way this study advances our understanding of voice climate is through the mediating influence of psychological empowerment. For customer service performance, the relationship between voice climate and customer service performance was mediated by psychological empowerment. In regard to the mediating role of psychological empowerment in the voice climate–voice behavior relationship, the results provide partial support for that hypothesis as voice climate was still a significant direct predictor of voice behavior when psychological empowerment was added to the equation. The next section discusses the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.</p>
<sec id="section22-1059601112463960">
<title>Theoretical Implications</title>
<p>Because of the risks associated with speaking up at work, voice research has begun to examine the role that work context plays in the willingness of employees to speak up (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059601112463960">Detert &amp; Burris, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059601112463960">Detert &amp; Treviño, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059601112463960">Morrison &amp; Milliken, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1059601112463960">Tangirala &amp; Ramanujam, 2008</xref>). This study confirms previous findings that shared perceptions of voice climate do develop and can have a direct influence on individuals speaking up at work (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1059601112463960">Morrison et al., 2011</xref>). This is an important finding because the work of Morrison and colleagues was conducted in India and this demonstrates that the relationship holds in a sample of U.S. workers as well. In addition to the direct relationship between voice climate and voice behavior, we also found that voice climate influences voice behavior indirectly through psychological empowerment. Taken together, these findings highlight the benefits of voice climate as it directly influences speaking up at work while also fostering higher levels of psychological empowerment among employees.</p>
<p>Our findings extend our knowledge of voice climate in the workplace by demonstrating that higher perceptions of voice climate among employees have a positive influence on performance dimensions beyond speaking up. Specifically, employees in workgroups with higher perceptions of voice climate were rated as better performers by their supervisors in a customer service role. It may be that as work groups are encouraged to speak up and be proactive, this proactive mindset permeates other areas of their job, making them more attuned to ways they can improve their own performance across various roles. As such, they are able to effectively perform in a customer service setting.</p>
<p>The results of this study also showed partial support for the mediating role of psychological empowerment in the voice climate–outcomes relationships. This is important for two main reasons. First, it begins to explain the key cognitive mechanisms by which voice climate is translated into behaviors. The study of voice climate has shown that it influences work outcomes at the individual and group level, but we still know little about <italic>why</italic> voice climate matters. This study begins to address this issue by demonstrating that employees who perceive that they are encouraged to speak up and make suggestions feel more empowered in their work. In other words, they find more meaning in their work, feel more competent in performing that work, and better understand the impact of their job. Broadly speaking, encouraging group members to speak up appears to influence the control these members perceive they have as they carry out their work. This is in line with SIP theory suggesting that employee work environment perceptions influence subsequent perceptions and behaviors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1059601112463960">Salancik &amp; Pfeffer, 1978</xref>). As employees feel they are encouraged to speak up at work they are more empowered, leading to improved customer service performance, an increasingly important organizational outcome.</p>
<p>Second, though psychological empowerment has been shown to have a positive impact on individual performance, calls have been made to broaden the range of outcomes associated with empowerment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1059601112463960">Spreitzer, 2008</xref>). The results of this study show that higher levels of psychological empowerment had a positive impact on customer service performance. This finding suggests that empowered employees are more likely to provide better customer service than employees who are less empowered. This confirms past research that suggests that as employees feel more in control over their work, they are more capable of performing across a variety of roles in their organization (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059601112463960">Chen &amp; Klimoski, 2003</xref>). In addition, consistent with prior studies we found that group members who feel more in control of their work are more likely to engage in proactive behaviors such as voice behavior. This is consistent with the intrinsic motivational nature of psychological empowerment in that empowered employees feel more able to affect change at work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1059601112463960">Spreitzer, 1995</xref>). Taken together, these results highlight the performance benefits that can result from fostering empowerment perceptions among employees.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1059601112463960">
<title>Practical Implications</title>
<p>We believe that this study provides some practical suggestions for managers and organizations. First, our results indicate that higher perceptions of voice climate are associated with higher levels of intrinsic motivation, which leads to better customer service performance. Given the emerging importance of customer-focused interactions in today’s workplace, providing high-quality customer service may improve customer satisfaction and loyalty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059601112463960">Liao &amp; Chuang, 2004</xref>). Customers are more likely to be satisfied, loyal, and consequently return to organizations in which they received high quality of customer service. Though this is just one facet of role-based performance, this suggests that organizations may benefit in other ways (beyond speaking up) by <italic>encouraging</italic> employees to speak up and make suggestions. Thus, by encouraging proactive behaviors, managers of customer service units can reap the benefits over the long term. Second, the results show that employee perceptions of voice climate affect employee intrinsic motivation at work. Since an employee’s manager is perhaps the most salient and proximal influence on employee perceptions, managers must be aware of how their behavior influences these perceptions and give employees opportunities to express themselves within the work unit. This can be accomplished by tailoring management training programs that address these issues.</p>
<p>Finally, from the organization’s perspective, the findings of this study suggest that employees who perceive that they are encouraged to speak up are better performers in roles outside of traditional job expectations. Since employee performance expectations have shifted from focusing simply on the specific job tasks to a more broad and multidimensional view of performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059601112463960">Griffin, Neal, &amp; Parker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1059601112463960">Welbourne et al., 1998</xref>), organizations can see those benefits via performance gains in important organizational roles. Organizations can take these findings and implement both formal and informal mechanisms for employees to provide suggestions. This can be done not only by providing formal feedback channels, such as suggestions boxes, but also by holding informal feedback opportunities like “brown bag” lunches. Of course, this all presupposes that these suggestions find their way to those with the authority to affect change. Therefore, organizations must take measures to ensure that suggestions end up in the hands of decision makers who can implement them and that employees are able to see the value added of this implementation.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Research Directions</title>
<p>As with any study, there are limitations that must be acknowledged. First, although the ratings of performance were collected approximately 2 weeks after the second data collection from employees, this time frame limits the causal inferences that can be made about the results of this study. The lag in time, and the fact that supervisors completed performance measures, help address common method variance concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1059601112463960">Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, &amp; Podsakoff, 2003</xref>) between the predictors and the outcomes, but replication of these findings in a longitudinal study would be recommended for future research. In addition, customer ratings and/or objective measures of customer service would have been ideal, but the current setting precluded such ratings. Also, the current setting limits the causal inferences that can be drawn from the results. This was a field study, which does not allow for manipulation of the predictors utilized in the theoretical model. Experimental replications of the findings presented here would increase the ability to make causal inferences. Finally, the current study relied on a single organization from which to collect the data. Generalizing from the results should be cautioned until future research can replicate the findings in other settings.</p>
<p>A number of future research directions result from this study. As mentioned briefly in the limitations section, future research that links voice climate to customer-rated or objective measures of customer service would strengthen the predictive validity of the voice climate construct. Future research that examines the longitudinal relationship between voice behavior and customer service performance is encouraged. It may be that as employees speak up, their ability to provide high-quality customer service also improves over time as the processes and procedures of their work group are improved. Another avenue for future research is to further examine additional mediators in the voice climate–voice behavior relationship. Our results supported partial mediation, which suggests that there may be additional mediators at work in this relationship. Recent theorizing has suggested that employees may develop beliefs about their ability to effectively speak up, called voice efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059601112463960">Kish-Gephart, Detert, Treviño, &amp; Edmondson, 2009</xref>). It may be that voice climate fosters perceptions of voice efficacy that then influence voice behavior. We encourage research to examine this possibility and other potential mediators in this relationship.</p>
<p>Climate researchers have also begun to examine the role of climate strength in the climate–outcome relationship (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1059601112463960">Schneider, Salvaggio, &amp; Subirats, 2002</xref>), and a better understanding of voice climate strength presents an interesting area of future examination. We agree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059601112463960">Morrison (2011)</xref> that the study of how voice climate develops and changes over time is a crucial area of future inquiry. Specific to the current study, it is possible that the implementation or lack of implementation of ideas suggested by employees will influence subsequent empowerment and voice climate perceptions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1059601112463960">2</xref></sup> Finally, a fruitful area of inquiry might be an examination of negative outcomes of voice climate, if such ramifications at all exist. It is our hope that this study spurs future research on voice climate to provide additional insights into the antecedents and outcomes associated with such a climate.</p>
