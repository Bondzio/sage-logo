<abstract>
<p>The status attainment literature suggests that the educational success of parents determines the educational success of their children (Blau and Duncan, 1967). However, the mechanisms by which families determine a child’s education are imperfectly understood. This article tests Lareau’s (2003) parental typology to identify the association between parenting strategies and educational outcomes achieved using the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England (LSYPE) 2004–2006. The findings suggest that class is not a convincing predictor for parenting style, but that use of concerted cultivation parenting strategies does improve the young person’s chances of achieving five GCSEs grade A*–C. These parenting strategies are also a positive predictor of how much a young person enjoys school, a teacher’s perception of their progress in school, their own perceptions of progress in school, their likelihood to apply to university, and whether they believe they will be accepted if they apply.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Despite education reform and expansion there remains inequality in educational attainment. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0038038512450103">Office for National Statistics (2004)</xref> shows that in 2002, 77 per cent of children in England and Wales with parents of professional occupations achieved five or more A* to C grade GCSEs (General Certificate of Secondary Education) which is more than double that of children whose parents are in routine manual occupations (32%). This attainment gap at secondary school has consequences for educational transitions and subsequent labour market outcomes. In order to identify the family factors that contribute to this gap, this article examines the influence of family background and parenting styles on children’s educational outcomes.</p>
<p>This article uses data from the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England (LSYPE) to test the claim made by Lareau that parenting strategies are differentially utilised by parents based on their class background. Furthermore, I will test whether parenting style has a direct influence on educational outcomes net of family background effects for those aged 16 in compulsory education in England.</p>
<p>The first section of the article focuses on the broader literature which surrounds Lareau’s claims, particularly exploring the mechanisms for the educational transfer within families. This is developed further by exploring Lareau’s ideas in more detail before discussing the operationalisation of this test in the methods section. The results section outlines the findings from the principal component analysis, and the logistic regressions before drawing conclusions. In the process, this article analyses some of the challenges of testing a qualitatively derived theory using quantitative data.</p>

<title>Review of Literature</title>
<p>There is much evidence to suggest that social class, independent of ability, has an impact on schooling outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0038038512450103">Crozier, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0038038512450103">Entwistle et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0038038512450103">Hasan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0038038512450103">Jencks et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0038038512450103">Lareau, 1989</xref>). Over time there has been an increase in the link between social background and educational results in the UK; children of non-manual workers are over two and a half times more likely to go to university than children of manual workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0038038512450103">Hirsch, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Conceptually, Bourdieu’s vast body of work informs the theoretical aspects of this article. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0038038512450103">Bourdieu (2000)</xref> argues that the root of educational inequality lies in the unequal distribution of the skills and abilities needed to succeed in education. Cultural capital theory posits that academic success is not simply due to intelligence and ability; rather, the cultural characteristics inherited from the family environment also contribute to academic accomplishment. This theoretical hypothesis explains the unequal academic achievement of children. More specifically, it offers an explanation as to why middle- and upper-class children do well and working-class children do poorly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0038038512450103">Bourdieu, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>For Bourdieu, the mechanism for this familial advantage and disadvantage is through linguistic competency, manners, preferences and orientations and culture more generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0038038512450103">Bourdieu, 1977</xref>). There are three types of cultural capital: embodied, institutionalised and objectified. The accumulation of embodied cultural capital starts in early childhood and is transferred through teaching either by hired professionals or by parental investment of time. During this teaching the child is exposed to cultural distinctions and preferences. Cultural capital in its institutionalised form is found in formal educational qualifications as a measure of capital attainment. In addition to this, Bourdieu argues that cultural capital exists in an objectified state within goods such as books, art and learning materials. Bourdieu suggests that parental influence instils an awareness of status culture signals at an early age in children, which enables individuals to indicate their memberships in particular status groups. This cultural signalling provides these groups with an advantage by allowing them to make more rapid progress within institutions.</p>
<p>The simplicity of cultural capital theory has attracted its critics – not least because it is difficult to test empirically due to the ambiguity of definition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0038038512450103">Kingston, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0038038512450103">Lamont and Lareau, 1988</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0038038512450103">Sullivan (2001)</xref> operationalised cultural capital and tested the cultural capital of pupils <italic>and</italic> the cultural capital of their parents. She tested their knowledge of famous cultural figures and vocabulary, and asked about their participation in activities such as reading, going to art galleries, listening to music and going to concerts and the theatre. Despite only concentrating on high culture aspects of the theory, Sullivan was able to find some empirical support for cultural capital. She found that cultural capital is unequally distributed by class and education and, perhaps more importantly, that parents are the source of this cultural capital. She argued that cultural capital is just one way that middle-class parents secure an educational advantage for their children.</p>
<p>Like Sullivan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0038038512450103">Lareau’s work (2003)</xref> examined the manifestation of cultural capital. Lareau focused on American primary schools and investigated the interactions between the school, parents and the child. She argued that these interactions form parental strategies, through which culture is transmitted, and which influence their children’s education. Lareau suggested that parenting styles are demarcated along the lines of social class and identifies a parenting typology from the ethnographic study of 12 families. Lareau’s parenting style typology comprises of two strategies: one of concerted cultivation attributed to the middle classes; the other of accomplishment of natural growth used by the working classes. These strategies operate on a spectrum of high and low levels of linguistic culture and communication; interventions in institutions; and organisation of daily life. High levels denote a concerted cultivation strategy and low levels denote a natural growth strategy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0038038512450103">
<title>Linguistic Culture and Communication</title>
<p>The linguistic culture of the family is one element of the concerted cultivation and natural growth scale. Lareau suggests that the language the middle-class families use differs from the language used in working-class families. Specifically, she says that the middle classes are more likely to use reasoning language and to negotiate with the child, whilst working-class families are more likely to issue directives. She also notes that in middle-class homes ‘there is a steady stream of speech, interrupted by periods of silence (as opposed to the pattern in working class and poor homes, in which periods of silence are punctuated by speech)’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0038038512450103">2003</xref>: 110).</p>
<p>The relationship between family, language and schooling is not a new area of study and it is clear that Lareau has drawn on the work of writers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0038038512450103">Bernstein (1971)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0038038512450103">Heath (1983)</xref>. Bernstein was a proponent of the view that distinct linguistic codes are adopted by families from different social classes. His development of code theory posited that the working classes typically used restricted language codes, which are dependent and particular. The middle classes also used restricted codes, but additionally utilised elaborated language codes, which are independent and universal.</p>
<p>After comparing the different speech patterns of a number of families, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0038038512450103">Heath (1983)</xref> concluded that the language strategies adopted by parents have implications for children’s academic development. Lareau draws a similar conclusion, based on her identification of the functional style of language used by the working classes to issue directives. Conversely, middle-class family members were observed discussing the meaning of the words and drew enjoyment from the language itself. This approach to language teaches children to express themselves well and to develop negotiation skills. For Lareau therefore, higher frequency and better quality communication contribute to the concerted cultivation strategy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0038038512450103">
<title>Interventions in Institutions</title>
<p>There is a body of literature which links greater parental involvement in their children’s lives with improved educational outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0038038512450103">Blau and Duncan, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0038038512450103">Crozier, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0038038512450103">Reay, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0038038512450103">Vincent, 1996</xref>). Lareau argues that parents are required to have certain skills or resources in order to comply with the requests of the school and the expectations of the role of the parent. She argues that the congruence between concerted cultivation parenting styles and school expectations provides middle-class children with an educational advantage. The strategy of natural growth does not align as well with school expectations.</p>
<p>An important resource for the child is the ability of their parents to intervene in institutions and to negotiate to find a better fit to suit the child’s needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0038038512450103">Coleman, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0038038512450103">Lareau, 1989</xref>). The ability to intervene depends on social class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0038038512450103">Vincent, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0038038512450103">1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0038038512450103">Vincent (1997)</xref> found that working-class parents find it difficult to express their concerns because of the inequality of power between teachers and parents. The reason for this is that working-class parents fear being humiliated or excluded from the process as they frequently reported not understanding what was being discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0038038512450103">Crozier, 2000</xref>). Crozier also identified that among working-class parents there was some resistance to being seen as a ‘pushy parent’.</p>
<p>Lareau presents evidence that middle-class parents actively teach their children how to assert themselves to adults in authority in addition to intervening on their child’s behalf. This cultivated behaviour is in direct opposition to working-class parents’ interactions with institutions. Implicit in this discussion is that being an involved parent can improve educational experiences and achievement of children and reduce inequalities. However, the parents who are the most involved are often the ones whose children need the least assistance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0038038512450103">
<title>Organisation of Daily Life</title>
<p>Lareau argues that one of the hallmarks of the middle-class parenting style is that parents actively seek to cultivate their children through the organisation of daily life. She observed that middle-class parents value organised activity as they believe it allows their children to shape the talents and skills that will help to develop a robust sense of self. The working classes, in contrast, are focused on feeding, housing and clothing their children. Lareau notes that some children find their highly scheduled life exhausting and stressful compared to the more relaxed lifestyle of working-class children who have more unstructured time. This view is supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0038038512450103">Rosenfeld and Wise (2000)</xref>, who suggest that pressure on children can cause anxiety and stress due to the high expectations. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0038038512450103">Arendell (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0038038512450103">Hays (1996)</xref> argue that participation in extracurricular activities impacts positively on the future success of children in terms of education and labour market outcomes. Participation in extracurricular activities requires economic, time and organisational investments, which may differ by class, family structure and income.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0038038512450103">
<title>Previous Research</title>
<p>Evidence of the link between socioeconomic status and parenting strategies is purported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0038038512450103">Kohn (1977)</xref>, who described the relationship between work-related values and parenting values of the classes. He found that middle-class parents are more likely to value children’s self-direction, whilst working-class parents are more likely to emphasise their conformity to external authority. This highlights what he sees as the main difference between the classes – the middle-class self-governing style prepares children for the positions of authority; the working-class deferential style prepares children for positions of subordination.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0038038512450103">Baumrind (1978)</xref> argued that there are three parenting styles: the authoritarian style follows strict conventional directive; the authoritative style wields authority but in a democratic, negotiable way; and the permissive style allows children to set their own boundaries (this can be either caring or neglectful). Although Baumrind did not express a link between parenting style and class, recent research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0038038512450103">Chan and Koo (2011)</xref> tested for a relationship. They found that using Baumrind’s typology, parenting style is not associated with parental education or class after controlling for family structure. But they did find an association between parenting style on a number of objective outcomes, including academic achievement and school enrolment.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0038038512450103">Bodovski and Farkas (2008)</xref> tested the concerted cultivation strategy of Lareau’s theory on elementary school data from the USA. Their findings suggest that parental socioeconomic status is positively and very strongly associated with concerted cultivation, and that concerted cultivation impacts on test scores and the teacher’s judgement of student language and literacy skills. The direct effect of concerted cultivation on achievement is modest in size, but their work does imply that Lareau’s theory has some explanatory power.</p>
<p>This article seeks to contribute to this field of research by examining what proportion of variation in examination results for young people aged 16 in England can be explained by parenting styles. Young people begin to negotiate a greater degree of autonomy and experience more external influences from peers. Nevertheless, parents are still influential in schooling, development and life choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0038038512450103">Harris, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0038038512450103">Muller, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0038038512450103">Schneider and Stevenson, 1999</xref>). Teenagers are a useful group on which to focus as, although cultural capital is instilled at a young age, the advantages appear later in life. Further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0038038512450103">DiMaggio and Mohr (1985)</xref> found that cultural capital is stable throughout life. Therefore the study of adolescent outcomes is a legitimate way to estimate the prior impact of parenting styles.</p>

<title>Methods and Data</title>
<p>The LSYPE study began in 2004 when the respondents had just embarked on the first year of their GCSE course of study, aged 13–14. The data waves cover March 2004 to September 2006 inclusive. At wave one 15,770 households were interviewed, 13,539 households at wave two and 12,439 households at wave three. The data are useful for operationalising Lareau’s theory as they offer parent, young person and teacher perspectives and can be linked to the National Pupil Database which provides individual and school level data including standardised test scores for GCSE results. The other advantage to using the LSYPE is that the measures of concerted cultivation are taken from wave one and wave two, while the measures of educational success are taken from wave three. The measuring of concerted cultivation prior to the measuring of GCSE results goes some way to establish the temporal stages involved in the transfer of cultural capital.</p>
<p>The study population is young people who attend maintained schools, independent schools and Pupil Referral Units (PRUs) in England.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0038038512450103">1</xref></sup> Ethnic minority students were over sampled. Home-schooled students, boarders and children residing in the UK for education only are excluded from the sample. The sample uses a two-stage model design, where the institutions were selected first and then students were selected from within these schools. This presents a possible clustering effect of results due to school difference. This can be treated by estimating robust cluster variance around schools.</p>
<p>The weighting guidance for the LSYPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0038038512450103">Ward and D’Souza, 2008</xref>) was followed in order to reduce bias. After merging the data waves, seven variables were selected based on applicability for Lareau’s theory of concerted cultivation. The survey questions and response categories for these variables are noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0038038512450103">Table 1</xref> (before scaling).</p>

<p>These variables were selected as they capture some of the theoretical aspects of concerted cultivation. Although imperfect measures, they provide a theoretical base to test parenting styles. Measuring communication using the LSYPE in the manner that Lareau conceptualises it is a challenge. For Lareau, linguistic culture captures the use of positive language, negotiation and reasoning as well as the frequency of discussion and communication between parent and child. With these data the quality of communication cannot be captured, but they do adequately capture the frequency and ease of communication between parent and child assessed by the young person. Specifically, the questions asked relate to how often they talk about school with their parents and how often the young person talks to their mother or father about things that are important to them.</p>
<p>For involvement in institutions Lareau’s theory relates to the degree of parental interventions when seeking an advantage for their child and whether they actively teach their children that they should have a sense of entitlement when dealing with authority. Again, this measure is difficult to capture using nationally representative data; however, the LSYPE does ask questions about the parents’ feelings towards their involvement in their school life and whether they have the knowledge to be able to help with their child’s education. The knowledge variable may not directly capture degree of intervention, but I would argue that without knowledge, successful intervention is not possible.</p>
<p>The measures which capture organisation of daily life are questions which relate to the frequency of private and supplementary classes. The private lessons are there to support school subjects through additional tuition, such as maths and science. The supplementary lessons relate to extracurricular activities outside of normal school lessons, such as football or piano lessons. The frequency of these activities in the last 12 months enables us to get a sense of the degree of structure to the young person’s time. These measures of organisation of daily life are not only cultural as they also involve some economic transfer either through direct payment for the lessons, or through travel costs or augmented costs, such as the cost of safety equipment, books or clothing. Parents with more economic resource are more able to afford to send their children to these classes than families with lower income. In order to try to address this, income is included as a control.</p>
<p>The response categories of these measures were standardised on a scale of one to five, one representing the lowest concerted cultivation activity (i.e. natural growth strategies with low levels of communication, involvement and organisation of daily life) and five representing the highest concerted cultivation activity (i.e. concerted cultivation with high levels of communication, involvement and organisation of daily life). In order to identify underlying components, these variables are entered into a principal component analysis (PCA). This, in line with Lareau’s conception of the theory, makes concerted cultivation a matter of degree; rather than creating a binary variable (concerted cultivation: low/high) this five-point scale allows for more variation of behaviour within and between classes. The PCA-reduced variables are then used in regressions to identify whether the parental strategy of concerted cultivation correlates with class, and whether the use of a particular parental strategy impacts positively on GCSE results, and on other subjective measures.</p>
<p>The selected measure for capturing GCSE results is a binary measure of whether the young person achieved five GCSEs grade A*–C, including English and Mathematics. This is a useful measure for capturing exam results as it is used as a government benchmark for educational achievement and quality of schools. In addition to this, it is also a prerequisite for students to progress to further courses of study, such as A Levels, which are required for accession to university.</p>
<p>Family structure will be controlled for, as this may have an ameliorating effect on outcomes as is the case in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0038038512450103">Chan and Koo, 2011</xref>). The LSYPE has two measures of family structure: a binary measure of step family or not; and a measure which identifies the legal status of the main parent in the household. In addition to this, number of siblings will be controlled for in line with Blake’s resource dilution theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038038512450103">1981</xref>).</p>
<p>As noted, there are some limitations about the variables which are used to try to capture the elements of Lareau’s theory. This is due to the adaptive requirements needed to operationalise a complex, qualitatively derived theory so that it can be tested on a large and rich quantitative dataset. There is a possible conceptual stretch as a result of shifting the concepts of class and parenting in an American context to an English one. Middle-class parenting values in Lareau’s theory focus on support through communication, intervention and organisation; however, the degree to which this framework is a ‘good fit’ in the English context is a matter for debate. For the purpose of this transatlantic theoretical test, it is assumed that the abstract concepts are similar enough to at least warrant a test of their efficacy in England. Lareau’s theory therefore is used as a starting framework to try to understand some of the parenting strategies which may incur an advantage for their children’s education. Establishing causal ordering also presents a challenge to this study. However, the use of longitudinal data goes some way to determine ordering, by establishing inputs at wave one and two, then using the dependent variables at wave three.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The PCA was applied to all seven variables. The data rotation identified three shared composite variables with an Eigenvalue of one or more which have underlying similarities. These composite variables can be considered measures of Lareau’s theory of parenting style and they are labelled: communication with young person; involvement in institutions; and organisation of daily life. The components identified by the PCA will be used in the following statistical analyses as measures of concerted cultivation.</p>

<title>H1: Socioeconomic status is a significant predictor for use of concerted cultivation strategies</title>
<p>Lareau purports that the degree to which parents adopt a particular parental strategy, such as concerted cultivation, varies by class. In order to test this, multivariate regressions were used to identify the association between each of the three concerted cultivation measures and measures of parental class, parental education, family structure, gender, ethnicity and family size and each of the three concerted cultivation measures. These concerted cultivation measures are on a standardised scale of one to five, five being the highest level of concerted cultivation (e.g. most involved, most open to communication, most frequent extracurricular activities organised). The results are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0038038512450103">Table 2</xref>.</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>The table reveals there is no class gradient with respect to the extent of communication between parents and young people as reported by the young person. Only lower service workers and unemployed parents are statistically significantly different to the reference category of higher service class, with those from lower service class yielding a positive coefficient of 0.09 and the unemployed parents less likely to communicate with their children (a coefficient of −0.12). Parental education does not significantly predict the ease of communication in the parent–child relationship; those parents with no qualifications yield a coefficient of −0.13 compared to parents with higher education qualifications, but all other parental controls are not statistically significant. Family structure does seem to have a strong effect; young people who are members of a step family yield a negative coefficient of −0.32 compared to families who are not step families as the communication scale shifts by a unit of one. Compared to those who live with married parents, young people who do not live with either of their biological parents are least likely to communicate frequently (−1.99), followed by those who live with lone fathers (−1.36), those who live with lone mothers (−0.95) and finally those who live with cohabiting parents (−0.29). Girls are more communicative with their parents than boys (0.17) and white children speak more easily with their parents than non-white children (0.10). As family size increases the ease of communication decreases. The complete model predicts 15 per cent of the communication aspect of the relationship between parent and child.</p>
<p>The model which predicts the degree of involvement in institutions does not identify a statistically significant class relationship. Parental education is not a strong predictor of involvement in institutions. Step families are not significantly different to non-step families. However, children who live with lone fathers, lone mothers and those who live with neither of their parents all have positive coefficients of 0.28, 0.13 and 0.72 respectively, compared to married parents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0038038512450103">2</xref></sup> Cohabiting parents are not significantly different to married parents in terms of degree of involvement in institutions. White families are less likely to report feeling involved in institutions and the number of children in the family does not strongly influence the degree of involvement up to four children; however, those with five and six or more children yield a statistically significant reduction. The relationship between class and parental involvement does not follow a clear trend for the degree of being involved in institutions; this model predicts only 2 per cent.</p>
<p>Organisation of daily life supports Lareau’s prediction that the higher classes are more likely to schedule their children’s leisure time with organised activities. This variable is composed of questions relating to supplementary classes and private tuition. Lower service workers record a coefficient of −0.11, small employers −0.14, intermediate class −0.16, supervisors −0.25, semi-routine workers −0.26, routine workers −0.36 and the unemployed −0.28 points lower than the reference category of higher service class as organisation of daily life increases by one. Parental education also has a significant linear relationship with the organisation of daily life measures. Those from step families are less likely to have their life organised in this way compared to those who are not living with a step family (−0.11), and those who live with a lone mother yield a coefficient of −0.15. The other family structure controls are not significantly different to married parents. There is no identifiable gender difference and white families are less likely to organise their child’s day compared to non-white families. Family size also seems to have some effect on the organisation of daily life with three or more children seeing a significant reduction. This complete model explains 1 per cent of the variance.</p>
<p>The findings show that the participation in these parental strategies is not differentiated by class with the exception of organisation of daily life, controlling for family background, gender, ethnicity and family size.</p>

<title>H2: Concerted cultivation strategies are positively associated with GCSE grades</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0038038512450103">Table 3</xref> tests the impact of parenting style on GCSE grades. The dependent variable of interest is a binary measure of whether the young person achieved five GCSEs with grades A*–C including English and Maths. This measure of GCSE attainment is used as a government benchmark to capture school and student performance and is often a prerequisite to continue study at higher levels, for example National Diplomas or A Levels. The results, which are shown in odds ratios, are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0038038512450103">Table 3</xref>. A unit increase in communication increases the likelihood of achieving five good GCSE grades by 33 per cent, parents reporting that they are involved in the young person’s schooling increase the likelihood by 7 per cent and having parents structure the young person’s time increases the likelihood by 47 per cent, before any family background and environment controls are added (Specification 1). This model shows that organisation of daily life is the most powerful predictor of achieving five good GCSE results, which may have an impact on progression.</p>

<p>When further controls are added for parental class and parental education (Specification 2), the parenting styles coefficients reduce slightly. There is a strong positive relationship between class and the likelihood of achieving five A*–C GCSEs including English and Maths. Furthermore, with regard to parental education, there is a strong association between parents’ education and the educational outcomes of children.</p>
<p>When family structure, gender and ethnicity are included, the odds ratios of the parental strategies change slightly: there is a reduction to 22 per cent for communication; a slight increase to 8 per cent for involvement in institutions; and a reduction to 29 per cent for organisation of daily life (Specification 3). Children from step families are 31 per cent less likely to achieve five good GCSE grades compared to those not from step families. The odds of achieving five GCSEs A*–C is reduced if their parents cohabit (25% less likely), if they live with a lone farther (56% less likely), if they live with a lone mother (33% less likely) and if they live with neither of their biological parents (76% less likely), compared to children whose parents are married. Girls are 40 per cent more likely than boys to achieve five GCSEs A*–C and white children are 11 per cent less likely than non-white children to achieve GCSEs A*–C including English and Maths.</p>
<p>Specification 4 models education when income and family size are added. This captures part of the familial resource at home. There is evidence of a family size effect, as family size increases, educational attainment is reduced. Income significantly predicts education attained. After these controls are added, frequency and ease of communication between the young person and their parents increase the odds of achieving five GCSEs A*–C by 19 per cent; parental involvement in schooling increases the odds of achieving five GCSEs A*–C by 9 per cent; and organisation of daily life increases it by 27 per cent.</p>
<p>In summary, the strategy of concerted cultivation, which sees clear and frequent communication between child and parent, involvement in institutions and structuring of leisure time yields higher GCSE scores. Adopting these parenting strategies predicts an increase in the odds of achieving five A*–C GCSE grades including English and Maths. Therefore support for hypothesis two is found.</p>

<sec id="section12-0038038512450103">
<title>H3: Concerted cultivation strategies are positively associated with subjective measures of educational achievement</title>
<p>The LSYPE contains a number of subjective measures of achievement, including whether the young person feels that they are doing well in school, whether their teacher thinks they are doing well, whether the young person likes being at school, the likelihood of the young person applying to university and whether the young person believes that they will be accepted to university if they apply. These measures are recoded to create a binary response for each dependent variable.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0038038512450103">Table 4</xref> shows the results from logistic regressions with predicting five different subjective measures controlling for actual GCSE achievement. Specification 1 has the dependent variable of whether the young person feels that they are doing well in school, controlling for background measures as before and for GCSE results. The findings suggest that, with all controls, two out of three concerted cultivation measures are statistically significant and positive. The odds of the young person feeling that they are doing well at school are around 1.35 times greater as a person’s value on the ‘parent-child communication’ variable increases by one unit. Involvement in institutions shows a small positive effect, with odds of 1.07. Organisation of daily life does not yield a statistically significant result.</p>

<p>The subjective measure of whether or not the teacher thinks the young person is doing well in school is tested in Specification 2. The odds that a teacher thinks that the young person is doing well in school are 1.41 times greater as a person’s value on the communication variable increases by one. There is a small effect for involvement in institutions at 1.07 and organisation of daily life has no statistically significant effect.</p>
<p>Young people seem to enjoy school more if their parents engage with concerted cultivation strategies (Specification 3). This is important as studies have found a link between enjoyment and achievement at school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0038038512450103">Vignoles and Meschi, 2004</xref>). As the communication scale increases by one, the odds of the young person liking school are 1.35; for involvement in institutions the odds are 1.09; and for organisation in daily life the odds are 1.09; these are all statistically significant. Concerted cultivation increases the young person’s enjoyment of school.</p>
<p>Whether the young person plans to apply to university can be seen as a measure of educational aspiration. The findings (Specification 4) suggest that all aspects of concerted cultivation have a positive and significant effect on likelihood of applying to university, recording odds of 1.31 for communication, 1.04 for involvement in institutions and 1.33 for organisation of daily life as the variable units increase by one.</p>
<p>Finally, Specification 5 shows whether the young person feels they will be accepted into university if they apply. This dependent variable can be reasonably interpreted as a subjective measure of self-belief. The results show that the odds of the young person feeling they will be accepted to university if they apply are 1.35 times greater as a person’s value on the communication with young person scale increases by one; the odds for involvement in institutions are 1.10; and the odds for organisation of daily life are 1.27. All of these results are statistically significant.</p>
<p>There is strong support for H3 as the findings suggest that the communication with young person variable has a positive and significant effect on the five measures of subjective achievement. Involvement in institutions has a smaller but statistically significant positive effect on the odds for all five measures. Organisation of daily life has a significant positive effect on three of the measures including enjoyment of school and the university measures of aspiration and self-belief.</p>

<title>Summary and Discussion</title>
<p>Lareau’s conception of parenting styles sees the operation of concerted cultivation as having a high participation in communication with the young person, involvement in institutions and organisation of the child’s daily life. The findings show that communication and involvement in institutions do not vary by social class. However, the frequency of organising the young person’s daily life is strongly correlated with parental social class and parental education, even after controlling for income and other family background indicators. Organisation of daily life was found to be the most influential of the parenting strategies, increasing the odds of achieving five GCSEs A*–C including English and Maths by 27 per cent, net of family background and other relevant controls. With respect to the other elements, communication increases the odds by 19 per cent and involvement in institutions by 27 per cent. For the subjective measures, communication has the strongest effect across self-perception, teacher’s perception, whether students like school, likelihood of applying to university and self-belief of acceptance. Involvement in institutions has a small but positive effect for all measures, while organisation of daily life only has an effect on school enjoyment and the university measures of aspiration and confidence.</p>
<p>These parenting strategies are related to an educational advantage for children in terms of exam results and subjective measures. However, parents do not equally choose to adopt these strategies, particularly organisation of daily life, and therefore the advantage is not equally bestowed. Parents who select to use these strategies may do so if they are particularly child centred, have a strong preference for education, or wish their child to learn multiple skills. Therefore it may be that these strategies do not have a direct effect, but that it is the underlying preference of the parents which incurs the advantage. As a result of this ambiguity, it is not clear to what extent these parenting strategies would have a positive impact on educational outcomes if parents of all classes are ‘artificially’ encouraged to adopt them.</p>
<p>Communication and involvement in institutions were found to be not strongly influenced by parental class. Frequency and ease of communication between parent and child may improve language ability, which may improve the child’s ability to navigate through the institution. Furthermore the adult–child exchanges many encourage logic and reasoning in the child, providing an increased opportunity to develop analytical skills. Lastly, it may be the case that the ease and frequency of communication is evidence of parental support and warmth which may improve the self-perception and confidence of the young person. The communication measure does not capture the quality of language used in these exchanges as much of the theoretical literature dictates, but it does suggest that having strong parent–child relationships with easy and frequent communication can have an influential effect on educational attainment.</p>
<p>Involvement in institutions is the least influential in terms of subjective and objective measures of educational attainment although it is statistically significant. Some parents may feel more involved in their child’s schooling if their child has behavioural issues which demand more parental participation. Due to its complexity, this type of involvement may ameliorate the average impact on subjective and objective measures. Children whose parents feel they are involved in their schooling and have the knowledge to help them see an increase in their odds of achieving five GCSEs A*–C by 8 per cent. If we take this result at face value this result shows that class does not predict the degree of involvement in institutions and the advantage of this particular parental strategy is a relatively small one.</p>
<p>Child-rearing methods are a way to transmit culture but preferences for parenting style are not all differentially associated by class. However, I find that parenting strategies do have an impact on education measures. Education and examinations are not neutral institutions – they are orientated to value certain behaviours, skills and knowledge. This provides an educational advantage for those children who have been exposed to these behaviours from a young age and an exclusionary disadvantage to those who have not.</p>
<p>Many questions remain unanswered by this research and therefore further work is required in different cultural and geographic fields. Of specific interest is ethnicity, which is beyond the scope of this current article. Comparing ethnic practices of parenting would provide further insight into how the adoption and influence of these cultural practices might vary. Finally, future research should examine whether there are differential advantages to adopting these behaviours between groups.</p>
