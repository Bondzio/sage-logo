<abstract>
<p>This study aimed to compare the perception of short vs. long vowel contrasts in Japanese and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) by four groups of listeners differing in their linguistic backgrounds: native Arabic (NA), native Japanese (NJ), non-native Japanese (NNJ) and Australian English (OZ) speakers. The NNJ and OZ groups shared the first language (L1), but differed in their familiarity with Japanese. In both Japanese and MSA, vowel length is phonemic. In contrast, vowel duration plays a more limited (although not insignificant) role in English. Of interest was the discrimination accuracy of NNJ listeners who learned Japanese as a second (L2) or foreign language in adulthood. As expected, the NA and NJ groups discriminated their L1 contrasts more accurately than all the other groups, but the NNJ listeners showed a significant shift in their perceptual behaviour and outperformed the OZ listeners who have no knowledge of Japanese in discriminating the Japanese vowel length contrasts. Furthermore, NNJ was the only group who did not differ in their discrimination accuracy for the Arabic and Japanese stimuli. Taken together, the results obtained in this study suggest that NNJ learned to discriminate Japanese vowel length contrasts to some extent, but the learning did not carry over cross-linguistically to the processing of vowel length contrasts in an unknown language.</p>

<title>I Introduction</title>
<p>Japanese and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0267658311435870">1</xref></sup>) have 5 (/i e a o u/) and 3 (/i a u/) vowels, respectively, and each of them can be either short or long, i.e. the length contrast is phonemic in both languages (e.g. <italic>nodo</italic> ‘throat’ vs. <italic>noodo</italic> ‘density’ for Japanese; <italic>bir</italic> ‘charity’ vs. <italic>biir</italic> ‘well, fountain’ for MSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267658311435870">Alghamdi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0267658311435870">Kaye, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0267658311435870">Mitleb, 1984b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0267658311435870">Nasr, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0267658311435870">Vance, 1986</xref>). Thus, the ‘short’ and ‘long’ categories are expected to be a familiar concept for native listeners of these two languages. By extension, this might lead to an expectation that native Arabic and Japanese listeners can exploit the knowledge from their first language (L1) and process vowel length contrasts in each other’s language efficiently despite lack of knowledge of the target language. If, however, there are measurable cross-language differences in how vowel length contrasts are phonetically realized in Arabic and Japanese, the positive L1 transfer may not occur as one might expect.</p>
<p>Prominent theories of cross-language speech perception such as the Perceptual Assimilation Model (PAM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267658311435870">Best, 1995</xref>) and the Speech Learning Model (SLM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267658311435870">Flege, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267658311435870">2003</xref>) highlight the importance of the perceived relationship between native and non-native sounds in how those sounds are discriminated and eventually learned. In the case of Arabic and Japanese, it is not yet clear how similar or dissimilar the two length categories might be cross-linguistically. However, recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0267658311435870">Tsukada, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0267658311435870">2012</xref>) have shown that the perception of Arabic and Japanese short and long vowels by native listeners of these languages was optimal only in their own L1 and not in the ‘unknown’ language. The present study focused on the perception of the same vowel length contrasts by two groups of English-speaking listeners living in Sydney, Australia who differed in their experience with Japanese. One of them was non-native learners of Japanese (NNJ) and the other was Australian English speakers (OZ) with no experience with Japanese.</p>
<p>The main purposes of the study were to build on recent research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0267658311435870">Tsukada, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0267658311435870">2012</xref>) investigating the perception of native and non-native vowel length contrasts by native Arabic (NA) and native Japanese (NJ) listeners and to explore if and to what extent NNJ diverged from OZ and approximated to NJ as a result of their second (L2)/foreign language learning. Thus, perception experiments were designed and conducted to test the direct as opposed to indirect effects of L2 learning on vowel length perception. The direct effect was measured by how NNJ listeners respond to vowel length contrasts in Japanese, and the indirect effect was measured by how the same listeners respond to unknown vowel length contrasts in MSA. Gaining a better understanding on cross-language perception by diverse groups of listeners has both theoretical and practical significance.</p>
<p>Of theoretical importance is an issue of plasticity in cross-language speech perception. There is a suggestion that perceptual category boundary may be hard to change even if L2 proficiency improved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0267658311435870">Kurihara, 2006</xref>). For adult learners who have a firmly established L1 system, their existing categories may interfere with realignment of category boundary. This might be responsible for ‘foreign accent’ which is prevalent in adult L2 learners. If, however, the human auditory system remains plastic even in adulthood as proposed in the SLM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267658311435870">Flege, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267658311435870">2003</xref>), NNJ listeners may be measurably different from OZ listeners or listeners who have no experience with languages that employ phonemic length contrasts (e.g. Finnish, Italian, Thai, etc.) in their perceptual behaviours. Furthermore, by directly comparing NJ and NNJ listeners’ response patterns, we could address the question of if and to what extent long-term cognitive representations might change as a result of L2 learning.</p>
<p>On the practical side, a substantial number of non-native learners study Japanese in and outside Japan. Of particular relevance to the present study, Australia has the fourth largest number (at 275,710) of Japanese language learners after Korea, China and Indonesia as of 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0267658311435870">The Japan Foundation, 2011</xref>). Of all the languages taught in the Australian educational system, Japanese had the largest number of student enrolments in 2006 followed by Italian and Indonesian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0267658311435870">Lo Bianco and Slaughter, 2009</xref>). Thus, there are ample opportunities for Japanese language teachers and researchers to investigate various aspects of L2 Japanese and inform teaching in classrooms.</p>
<p>It is well documented that L1 interference is more likely to occur in the acquisition of phonetics and phonology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0267658311435870">Toda, 2003</xref>). Just like the /l/–/r/ contrast that poses considerable difficulty for Japanese learners of English (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267658311435870">Aoyama et al., 2004</xref>), the acquisition of length contrasts (or more broadly, special mora as briefly described below) is a thorny issue in the Japanese language teaching/learning, and it has been investigated by numerous L2 speech researchers, Japanese language teachers and phoneticians among others (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0267658311435870">Han, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0267658311435870">Hirata, 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0267658311435870">Hirata and Kelly, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0267658311435870">Hisagi and Strange, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0267658311435870">Oguma, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0267658311435870">Tajima et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0267658311435870">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0267658311435870">Toda, 2003</xref>). Japanese uses two rhythmic units, i.e. mora and syllable, and both of them are relevant to the Japanese phonology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0267658311435870">Kubozono, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0267658311435870">1999</xref>). To cite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0267658311435870">Nakayama et al. (2006</xref>, p. 1):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>A mora is a subsyllabic unit that determines the weight of a syllable. A regular mora is also a syllable, which is either V (vowel) or CV (consonant–vowel). In addition, there are three types of morae (called special morae), which are perceived as having the same length as regular morae by Japanese speakers although they do not constitute syllables, viz. moraic consonants (i.e. the first part of geminate consonant or a moraic nasal), e.g. /Q/ in /kaQta/ (<italic>katta</italic> ‘bought’), /N/ in /hoN/ (<italic>hon</italic> ‘book’), or the second half of a long vowel or a diphthong, e.g. /R/ of /keRki/ (<italic>keeki</italic> ‘economy’).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is known that the perceptual judgements of length contrasts are influenced by various factors such as accent (pitch movement) and the position of the contrast within a word. While the syllable structure is fairly simple in Japanese (predominantly V or CV), the perception/production of length contrasts is known to be difficult for learners of Japanese from various L1 backgrounds including English. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0267658311435870">Hirata (2004b)</xref> found that native English-speaking listeners identified the number of moras in words that do not contain long sounds more accurately than in words that do contain long sounds. The acquisition of special mora (e.g. the first mora of the geminate stop (/p/) in <italic>happa</italic> ‘leaf’) is problematic in L1 Japanese, as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0267658311435870">Ito and Tatsumi, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0267658311435870">Toda, 2003</xref>; however, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0267658311435870">Sato et al., 2010</xref>). On the other hand, it appears that there is limited research on non-native perception and/or production of the Arabic vowel length contrasts (however, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0267658311435870">Tsukada, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0267658311435870">2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Numerous studies have reported on the robust L1 effect on cross-language speech perception and production. This leads to the expectation that when Arabic and Japanese speakers learn a new language, their L1 speech characteristics may transfer to the target language. Indeed, it has been reported that, in Arabic-accented English, the /i/–/<sc>i</sc>/ contrast is exaggerated as if the Arabic speakers were using their own L1 vowel length contrast, i.e. /iː/–/i/ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267658311435870">Flege and Port, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0267658311435870">Munro, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0267658311435870">Shahin, 2002</xref>). This type of transfer of L1 temporal characteristics is frequently observed in speakers from various language backgrounds such as Japanese and Thai speakers of L2 English (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0267658311435870">Tsukada, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0267658311435870">2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The Arabic and Japanese sound systems may appear wide apart. However, there are some phonetic characteristics that are common between the two languages. As mentioned above, the first is that they both have short vs. long contrasts that are phonemic. In both languages, duration is the primary, though may not be the sole, acoustic correlate for the length contrasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267658311435870">Alghamdi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0267658311435870">Hirata and Tsukada, 2009</xref>). Averaged across different phonetic contexts, the duration of the short vowel takes up roughly 32% to 42% of that of the long vowel in Japanese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0267658311435870">Hirata, 2004a)</xref> and 40% to 65% in MSA (for Saudi, Sudanese and Egyptian Arabic, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267658311435870">Alghamdi, 1998</xref>; for Jordanian Arabic, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0267658311435870">Mitleb, 1984b</xref>). The effect of vowel length on vowel quality has been investigated in a few studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267658311435870">Alghamdi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0267658311435870">Hirata and Tsukada, 2009</xref>). Although some cross-dialectal differences in vowel quality have been reported in MSA, phonemic short and long vowels in different dialects are clearly differentiated durationally (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267658311435870">Alghamdi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267658311435870">Cowan, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267658311435870">de Jong and Zawaydeh, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267658311435870">Drozdík, 1973</xref>). Phonemic long vowels were shown to occupy a more peripheral portion of the acoustic vowel space than their short counterparts in both Japanese and MSA. While longer vowels tend to be more peripheral than shorter vowels in many languages, the extent to which shorter vowels reduce or centralize appears to be language specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0267658311435870">Engstrand and Krull, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0267658311435870">Fletcher, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0267658311435870">Lindblom, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0267658311435870">Tsukada and Roengpitya, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Another acoustic phonetic characteristic that Japanese and MSA have in common is that they both appear to lack a well-known voicing effect of the consonant on the duration of the preceding vowel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0267658311435870">Mitleb, 1984a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0267658311435870">Tsukada, 1999</xref>). This voicing effect has been widely reported in English and some other languages and vowels (e.g. /<sc>i</sc>/ in ‘hid’) followed by a voiced consonant tend to be longer than vowels followed by a voiceless consonant (/<sc>i</sc>/ in ‘hit’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267658311435870">Chen, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0267658311435870">House and Fairbanks, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0267658311435870">Peterson and Lehiste, 1960</xref>). Both native Arabic and Japanese speakers of English have been observed to show a limited voicing effect of the consonant on the preceding vowel, possibly as a reflection of their L1 timing characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267658311435870">Flege and Port, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0267658311435870">Tsukada, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The question of interest addressed in the present study was whether NNJ and OZ differ in their perceptual discrimination of Japanese and MSA vowel length contrasts. Of particular interest was determining:</p>

<title>1 Stimuli preparation</title>
<p>The same speech materials spoken by the same speakers as those reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0267658311435870">Tsukada (2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0267658311435870">2012)</xref> are used for this study. Specifically, native speakers of Arabic and Japanese participated in the recording sessions lasting between 45 and 60 minutes. Eight (4 males, 4 females) native Japanese speakers with a mean age of 25.4 years were recorded in the sound-treated room in the Department of Linguistics, University of Kobe, Japan. With the exception of one participant who had lived in the USA for 11 months, none of them had lived overseas for an extended period of time. These speakers primarily came from the Western part of Japan including Ehime, Fukuoka, Hyogo, Kagawa, Kanagawa and Tottori prefectures. Vowel length is phonemic to all these speakers.</p>
<p>Seven (4 males, 3 females) native Arabic speakers with a mean age of 40 years were recorded in the audio-visual recording studio and the Centre for Language Sciences (CLaS) recording studio at Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia. They were all born in Arabic-speaking countries and had lived in Sydney for 12 years on average at the time of recording. All of them had completed secondary or tertiary education in Arabic-speaking countries prior to their arrival in Sydney. One of them was an Arabic language teacher with many years of experience. She was teaching Arabic at universities in Sydney while conducting her PhD studies in linguistics. Another was a professional speaker/educator in the community. Thus, generally speaking, having obtained higher education in native Arabic-speaking countries, the speakers were deemed to possess a substantial knowledge of MSA. As expected of long-term residents of Sydney, most of these Arabic speakers spoke English fluently. However, they had an unmistakable foreign accent in their English.</p>
<p>The Arabic speakers’ dialectal backgrounds were Lebanese (<italic>n</italic> = 4) and Saudi Arabic (<italic>n</italic> = 3). Vowel length is phonemic in both of these colloquial varieties of Arabic. While some cross-dialectal differences in vowel quality have been reported, phonemic short and long vowels in different dialects are clearly distinguished durationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267658311435870">Alghamdi, 1998</xref>). All speakers were paid $30 Australian dollars (or the equivalent amount in Japanese yen) for their participation.</p>
<p>Speakers read CV<sub>1</sub>CV<sub>2</sub>(n) words in Japanese and CV<sub>1</sub>C words in MSA (where V<sub>1</sub> was either a short or long vowel in each language). While this discrepancy is not desirable, the occurrence of the CVC sequence is quite limited in Japanese unlike Arabic. Furthermore, given that vowel length is neutralized in open syllables including the word-final position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0267658311435870">Thelwall and Sa’Adeddin, 1990</xref>), it was not an option to use CVCV words in Arabic to match the syllable structure across the two languages.</p>
<p>Test words (all real words) were presented visually to each speaker in randomized orders on the computer screen one word at a time. All words were written using appropriate Japanese or MSA script, which explicitly encodes vowel length in the standard orthography. Thus, there was no lack of clarity as to how each word should be read by mature, native speakers. The speakers were asked to read the target words naturally at their self-selected normal speaking rate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0267658311435870">2</xref></sup> All speakers read the target words twice in isolation and once in a short carrier sentence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0267658311435870">3</xref></sup> This was to examine the effect of speaking style/context on the speech production at a later stage in a separate study.</p>
<p>Some of the Japanese word pairs used in this study differed by more than just vowel length, namely, pitch pattern and the extent of vowel devoicing<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0267658311435870">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0267658311435870">5</xref></sup>; however, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267658311435870">Beckman (1986)</xref> for very small effects of pitch accent on vowel duration. Likewise, some of the Arabic word pairs differed in the presence or absence of the advanced tongue root (ATR) feature.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0267658311435870">6</xref></sup> This irregularity in the stimuli needs to be rectified in subsequent studies. If and how this apparent confounding in the stimuli affected native and non-native listeners’ ability to discriminate vowel length contrast is an empirical question that needs to be addressed in future research. However, it would not be unreasonable to assume that vowel duration was one of the major cues to the length category that was used differentially by native and non-native listeners of quantity-sensitive languages.

<p>The recorded speech materials were digitized at 44.1 kHz and the target words were segmented and stored in separate files. Tokens produced in a carrier sentence were used as stimuli. Prior to the presentation in the perception experiments, each sound file was normalized to 50% of the peak amplitude following the procedures used in previous speech research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267658311435870">Aoyama et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267658311435870">Flege and MacKay, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0267658311435870">Guion et al., 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>2 Listeners</title>
<p>Four groups of listeners participated. They were 15 native speakers of Japanese (NJ: 2 males, 13 females), 17 non-native speakers of Japanese (NNJ: 6 males, 11 females), 7 native speakers of Arabic (NA: 3 males, 4 females) and 17 native speakers of Australian English (OZ: 5 males, 12 females). Characteristics of the NA, NJ and OZ groups are reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0267658311435870">Tsukada, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0267658311435870">2012</xref>). To briefly reiterate, 6 of the NA listeners were postgraduate students or staff members at Macquarie University and one was a member of the community in Sydney. Their dialectal backgrounds were Egyptian (<italic>n</italic> = 1), Iraqi (<italic>n</italic> = 1), and Lebanese Arabic (<italic>n</italic> = 5). The OZ listeners were recruited from the student and staff population at Macquarie University. Some of them participated in the study for course credit in linguistics units. With the exception of one NJ participant who was a staff member, all the NJ listeners were enrolled in the MA in translation and interpreting course in the Department of Linguistics at Macquarie University. They originally came from different parts of Japan including Hokkaido, Tokyo, Aichi, Kanagawa, Miyagi, Tochigi and Yamaguchi prefectures. Vowel length is phonemic to all these NJ listeners.</p>
<p>The NNJ listeners were previously or currently enrolled in the 200- or 300-level (intermediate) Japanese language course (approximately 160–320 hours of instruction) or training to be a Japanese language teacher in the Department of Education at Macquarie University. They were either mono- (<italic>n</italic> = 9) or bilingual<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0267658311435870">9</xref></sup> (<italic>n</italic> = 8) speakers of Australian English. The bilingual Australian English participants were either born in Australia to migrant parents or came to Australia as young children. Thus, they had spent their entire life or the majority of their life in Australia. Only those bilinguals whose dominant language was English according to self-report were included in this study to make them as comparable to the OZ group as possible. Bilinguals’ other languages were Cantonese or Korean. This profile of participants is typical of the Japanese language classroom in a multi-cultural city such as Sydney. It should be pointed out that neither Cantonese nor Korean (for the younger generation, in particular) uses vowel length contrastively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267658311435870">Bent et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0267658311435870">Lee and Ramsey, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0267658311435870">Sohn, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0267658311435870">Zee, 1991</xref>; for some generations in Korea that may still retain vowel length contrasts, see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0267658311435870">Lee, 1993</xref>). Although it would have been desirable to control for NNJ listeners’ L1 more tightly, it was not possible, as they participated on the basis of their availability, and no screening was carried out. This needs to be corrected in future research.</p>
<p>Participants were tested individually in a session lasting between 30 and 40 minutes in the speech perception lab in the CLaS or a quiet classroom at Macquarie University. They heard the stimuli at self-selected level over the high-quality headphones (Bose Quiet Comfort 2 acoustic noise cancelling headphones). They had up to 3 seconds to respond to each stimulus and were asked to guess if uncertain.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0267658311435870">10</xref></sup> Each trial was played only once. According to self-report, all listeners had normal hearing and did not have any language deficiency in their L1. Participants were paid $20 Australian dollars for their participation.</p>

<sec id="section5-0267658311435870">
<title>3 Procedures</title>
<p>The participants’ perception of vowel length contrasts in Japanese and MSA was assessed in a categorial AXB test. This is a two-alternative forced-choice task frequently employed in previous speech perception research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0267658311435870">Harnsberger, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0267658311435870">Højen and Flege, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0267658311435870">Tsukada, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0267658311435870">2012</xref>). The stimuli were presented in triads as described below.</p>
<p>In the AXB test, the first (A) and third (B) tokens always come from different categories and the listeners need to decide whether the second token (X) belongs to the same category as A (e.g. ‘sit<sub>2</sub>’–‘sit<sub>1</sub>’– ‘seat<sub>3</sub>’) or B (e.g. ‘hit<sub>3</sub>’–‘heat<sub>1</sub>’–‘heat<sub>2</sub>’) (where the subscripts indicate different talkers).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0267658311435870">11</xref></sup> In the instructions read out to all listeners by the experimenter, they were explicitly alerted to variation in vowel duration. Within a trial, three tokens were always spoken by different speakers of the same sex. Thus, X was never physically identical to either A or B. This was to ensure that the listeners focus on relevant phonetic characteristics that group two tokens as members of the same category without being distracted by audible but phonetically irrelevant within-category variation (e.g. in voice quality). All possible AB combinations (i.e. AAB, ABB, BAA and BBA) were tested. The mean durational values of the short and long vowels in the stimulus tokens presented to the listeners were 97 ms and 208 ms for Arabic and 74 ms and 174 ms for Japanese, respectively (for further acoustic characteristics of the stimuli, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0267658311435870">Tsukada, 2011</xref>: <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0267658311435870">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Stimuli were blocked by language (Japanese, MSA) and the order of presentation was counterbalanced across listeners. A total of 125 trials for Japanese and 100 trials for MSA were presented. The first 5 and 4 trials in each language were for practice and were not analysed. The listeners’ discrimination accuracy as expressed in the percent correct scores was used as the dependent variable in statistical analyses as in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0267658311435870">Tsukada, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0267658311435870">2012</xref>).</p>

<title>III Results</title>
<p>The overall pattern of results can be summarized as follows. The NJ listeners hardly made any mistakes and were practically at ceiling when they heard the Japanese length contrasts (<italic>M</italic> = 98%, <italic>sd</italic> = 2%, range = 94%–100%), but they were less accurate in discrimininating the MSA contrasts (<italic>M</italic> = 80%, <italic>sd</italic> = 6%, range = 66%–89%). The NA listeners showed a mirror image of the NJ group in that they were much more accurate in discriminating their L1 Arabic contrasts (<italic>M</italic> = 92%, <italic>sd</italic> = 4%, range = 87%–99%) than the unknown Japanese contrasts (<italic>M</italic> = 75%, <italic>sd</italic> = 5%, range = 68%–81%). The OZ group was also more accurate in discriminating length contrasts in Arabic (<italic>M</italic> = 82%, <italic>sd</italic> = 5%, range = 72%–93%) than in Japanese (<italic>M</italic> = 75%, <italic>sd</italic> = 5%, range = 68%–82%) although they had no experience in either language. NNJ was the only group that did not differ in their discrimination accuracy for the two stimulus languages (Japanese: <italic>M</italic> = 83%, <italic>sd</italic> = 10%, range = 63%–96% vs. MSA: <italic>M</italic> = 82%, <italic>sd</italic> = 5%, range = 72%–95%). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267658311435870">Figure 1</xref> shows the mean percent correct discrimination scores for the four groups of listeners. All groups were well above chance and the listeners were not insensitive to durational variations (for analogous results on the perception of lexical tones by Mandarin- and French-speaking listeners, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0267658311435870">Hallé et al., 2004</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The mean correct discrimination scores (%) were submitted to a two-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance), in which Group (NJ, NNJ, NA, OZ) served as a between-subjects factor and Stimulus language (Japanese, MSA) as a within-subjects factor. The main effect of Group reached significance (<italic>F</italic>(3, 52) = 11.8, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and so did the two-way interaction (<italic>F</italic>(3, 52) = 52.0, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), but not the main effect of Stimulus language. The simple effect of Group was significant for both Arabic and Japanese stimuli (Arabic: <italic>F</italic>(3, 52) = 8.2, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, Japanese: <italic>F</italic>(3, 52) = 37.3, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). As expected, the NA and NJ listeners were more accurate than all the other groups in discriminating the vowel length contrast in their L1. As for the Arabic stimuli, only the native vs. non-native difference reached significance (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and there was no difference among the OZ, NNJ and NJ groups. As for the Japanese stimuli, on the other hand, the NNJ listeners were significantly more accurate than the OZ (but not NA) listeners in discriminating Japanese vowel length contrasts (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). While this positive effect of Japanese language learning is a notable finding, only two out of the 17 NNJ listeners fell within the range set by the NJ listeners (94.2% to 100%) for the Japanese stimuli, giving further evidence that vowel length contrasts are not easy for adult learners to discriminate accurately. The native advantage over the non-native groups is clearly seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267658311435870">Figure 1</xref>.</p>
<p>The simple effect of Stimulus language was significant for all listener groups except for NNJ (<italic>F</italic>(1, 52) = 19.2%–98.1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). In other words, when averaged across all the 17 listeners, NNJ group’s discrimination accuracy did not differ for the Japanese and MSA stimuli. Further, they showed larger variability than other listeners in discriminating the Japanese stimuli, possibly suggesting a developmental stage and a transient nature of their interlanguage. Although merely a speculation at this stage, the individual differences may have been caused by various factors (both linguistic and non-linguistic) such as learners’ motivation, previous learning experience and so forth.</p>
<p>Of the 17 NNJ listeners, 11 showed more accurate discrimination for the Japanese than the MSA stimuli. Of the 17 OZ listeners, on the other hand, 16 showed more accurate discrimination for the MSA than the Japanese stimuli. It needs to be pointed out that NNJ and OZ, the two groups who share the same L1, could have been one group before the NNJ listeners started learning the Japanese language. This can be interpreted as a major impact of Japanese language learning on the NNJ listeners, which resulted in the shift in their perceptual organization or cognitive representations. There is the possibility that, if the NNJ listeners continue to advance their Japanese language studies, in the foreseeable future they might show a clear effect of Stimulus language, but in the opposite direction and farther away from the OZ group and in the same direction and towards the NJ group. Clearly, this needs to be investigated in future research by using a longitudinal design.</p>
<p>An interesting empirical question is whether the NNJ listeners might improve their sensitivity to Arabic length contrasts as they become more proficient in Japanese. The answer could be yes and no. We observed that NA and NJ who are native speakers of quantity sensitive languages did not show optimal discrimination in the other, unknown language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0267658311435870">Tsukada, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0267658311435870">2012</xref>). If the transfer of L1 phonetic knowledge is hampered even for native speakers, it may be more challenging for non-native learners to first make use of the cues needed to decode Japanese contrasts and then to utilize them in another language that is totally unknown to them. However, it may be the transfer of <italic>L1</italic> (but not L2 or subsequent foreign language(s) such as L3 or L4) knowledge that is disrupted (for a discussion of various factors affecting L2/foreign language acquisition, see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0267658311435870">Ortega, 2009</xref>). In other words, the NNJ listeners who do not speak Arabic or Japanese as their L1 may not be bound by the L1 interference and may be able to transfer their foreign language learning positively to a new language. This is because – having experienced L2 learning and gained access to another language beyond their L1 – the NNJ listeners may not automatically associate their L1 with the new language(s) that they encounter. Instead, they may be more inclined to apply and re-activate their L2 learning experience to the processing of the subsequent language(s). In this context, it may be the first foreign language rather than the L1 that exerts a greater influence on the NNJ listeners’ cross-language speech perception.</p>
<p>Although it was not the main focus of the study, in order to better understand the listeners’ response patterns, the results were examined according to the length category (i.e. short vs. long) of the target token (X) presented in the AXB test. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0267658311435870">Figures 2 and 3</xref> show the mean percent correct discrimination scores for the four groups of listeners as a function of length categories. This analysis provided further insights into how different groups of listeners responded to vowels belonging to different length categories. For the Arabic contrasts, every group including NA was more accurate when the target vowel was short than when it was long. This was more obvious for the NJ (82% for short vs. 77% for long) and NNJ (85% for short vs. 79% for long) groups than for the other two groups (OZ: 83% for short vs. 81% for long, NA: 93% for short vs. 90% for long), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0267658311435870">Figures 2 and 3</xref>, respectively. For the Japanese contrasts, it was only the OZ listeners who showed a length-based bias in their discrimination accuracy. While OZ showed poorer discrimination accuracy when the target vowel was long (71%) than when it was short (79%), NNJ was equally accurate for the vowels of two length categories (81% for short vs. 80% for long). This can be taken as evidence that specific learning did occur for the NNJ listeners who diverged from the OZ listeners by overcoming the difficulty of identifying long Japanese vowels as such. So once again, the NNJ listeners differentiated themselves from the OZ listeners and behaved more like the NJ listeners.</p>

<p>In sum, the NA and NJ groups were much more accurate in discriminating vowel length contrasts in their L1 than in the unknown language, whereas the NNJ group did not differ in their discrimination accuracy of the Japanese and MSA contrasts. An interesting difference emerged between NNJ and OZ in how they responded to the target vowels that belong to different length categories.</p>

<title>IV Discussion</title>
<p>This study examined the discrimination of vowel length contrasts in Japanese and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) by four groups of listeners differing in their L1 and/or linguistic experience: native Arabic (NA), native Japanese (NJ), non-native Japanese (NNJ) and Australian English (OZ) speakers. As expected, the NNJ listeners discriminated the Japanese contrasts much less accurately than did the NJ listeners (83% vs. 98%), but the two groups did not differ significantly for the MSA contrasts (80% for NJ vs. 82% for NNJ). Seventeen OZ listeners with no knowledge of either Japanese or MSA were more accurate in MSA (82%) than in Japanese (75%) contrasts. Thus, when non-native listeners (NJ, NNJ, OZ) listened to the Arabic stimuli, there was no between-group difference. This was not the case when non-native listeners (NA, NNJ, OZ) listened to the Japanese stimuli. The results for the Japanese stimuli may not be surprising, because the NNJ listeners were learning Japanese. However, what differentiated the NNJ listeners from other listeners was the pattern of discrimination scores for the two stimulus languages.</p>
<p>As briefly mentioned in Section III, while every OZ listener except for one showed better discrimination for MSA than for Japanese, the pattern of results was more mixed for the 17 NNJ listeners with six of them clearly showing better discrimination (i.e. difference of more than 5%) for Japanese than MSA, and four showing the reverse pattern. The remaining seven NNJ listeners discriminated the length contrasts in the two languages equally well (or poorly). More data need to be collected from NNJ and OZ listeners who are tightly matched except for their experience with Japanese to determine whether or not this shift or the state of flux for the NNJ listeners may be attributable to their Japanese learning experience in adulthood.</p>
<p>It may be somewhat surprising that the NJ listeners did not have an advantage over the NNJ listeners when they heard the MSA contrasts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0267658311435870">Tsukada (2012)</xref> provided various possible explanations for the lack of positive L1 transfer (e.g. task demand, extent of categoricity of length contrasts). As mentioned in Section I, both Japanese and MSA use duration contrastively for the identification of the vowels. This may lead to the expectation that the NJ listeners in this study should be able to exploit the knowledge from their L1 Japanese and process short vs. long vowel contrasts in MSA efficiently despite imperfect (or more precisely non-existent) knowledge of MSA.</p>
<p>In this context, it is worth noting that, although vowel length is phonemic in both Japanese and MSA, perceptual salience of the vowel length contrasts may not be equivalent depending on how the contrasts are phonetically realized.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0267658311435870">12</xref></sup> Judging from the vowel duration ratio reported in previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267658311435870">Alghamdi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0267658311435870">Hirata, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0267658311435870">Mitleb, 1984b</xref>), it appears that the length contrasts may be more distinct in Japanese (short-to-long vowel ratio: 0.32–0.42) than in MSA (short-to-long vowel ratio: 0.4–0.65). In a recent study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0267658311435870">Tsukada (2012)</xref> suggests that, if there are subtle but measurable cross-language phonetic differences, realignment of category boundary may be necessary for the accurate perception of non-native sounds. Adult listeners’ firmly established L1 categories may interfere with the processing of similar (but not identical) sounds as would be predicted by the SLM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267658311435870">Flege, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267658311435870">2003</xref>). The NJ listeners’ less optimal discrimination of the MSA vowel length contrasts may also be related to the different syllable structure and/or lexical knowledge of the stimuli. For instance, in Japanese, the occurrence of the CVC sequence is quite limited unlike MSA. It is plausible that this imbalance negatively affected the NJ listeners’ discrimination accuracy of the MSA stimuli.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, in terms of the vowel duration ratio, the two length categories may be acoustically less distinct in MSA than in Japanese. However, the identification of vowels may be compensated for by the possibly larger spectral differences between the short and long vowels in MSA than Japanese at least for the native speakers of the language. For non-native listeners with no knowledge of the phonology of the target language, the information on spectral cues might not be available and of help in the discrimination of vowel length contrasts. This relates to the issue of cue weighting and it has been suggested that the way in which information across acoustic dimensions is integrated depends on listeners’ previous linguistic experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0267658311435870">Holt and Lotto, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The finding that the NNJ listeners were not inferior to the NJ listeners in discriminating the MSA length contrasts, at first glance, appears to suggest that familiarity with phonetic characteristics in a recently acquired language (i.e. Japanese) may facilitate the processing of sounds in an unknown language (i.e. Arabic) with ‘similar’ phonetic characteristics. However, the OZ listeners with no knowledge of either Japanese or MSA showed virtually the same discrimination accuracy for the MSA stimuli (82%) as the NJ (80%) and NNJ listeners (82%). This apparent lack of between-group difference for the MSA stimuli may nevertheless be related to the participants’ L1, as vowel length is reported to be contrastive for some vowel pairs such as /a–∧/ and /i–<sc>i</sc>/ in Australian English (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267658311435870">Cox, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267658311435870">Cox and Palethorpe, 2007</xref>). Several acoustic phonetic studies lead one to conclude that vowel duration plays a larger role in Australian English (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267658311435870">Cochrane, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267658311435870">Cox, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267658311435870">Fletcher and McVeigh, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0267658311435870">Ingram and Park, 1997</xref>) than in some other varieties of English such as American English (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0267658311435870">Hillenbrand et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0267658311435870">House, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0267658311435870">Peterson and Lehiste, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0267658311435870">Strange et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0267658311435870">2005</xref>). In other words, not only the listeners’ L1, but their L1 varieties (American vs. Australian English) may have played a role in cross-language speech perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267658311435870">Chládková and Podlipský, 2011</xref>). Alternatively, English-speaking listeners with or without the knowledge of Japanese did not differ substantially in their discrimination accuracy for the MSA stimuli, possibly because the CVC words in MSA were less dissimilar to English words than the Japanese stimulus words (CVCV(n)), i.e. Arabic words may be more likely than Japanese words to be accepted as potential English words.</p>
<p>It is necessary to test more listeners who have no experience with Japanese to confirm or disconfirm that the MSA contrasts are generally more discriminable than the Japanese contrasts for any (non-Japanese) listener regardless of their linguistic experience. In this respect, it would be even more revealing to test non-native Japanese listeners whose L1 does not utilize duration for the identification of vowels (e.g. Spanish).</p>

<title>V Conclusions</title>
<p>The primary aim of the experiment reported in this study was to examine NNJ listeners’ discrimination of vowel length contrasts in Arabic and Japanese with a view to exploring if and how learning Japanese might influence their cross-language speech perception. This was achieved by comparing groups of listeners who differ systematically with respect to their experience with Japanese and another quantity-sensitive language, Arabic.</p>
<p>Familiarity with phonemic vowel length contrasts in L1 or subsequently acquired languages may not automatically result in accurate discrimination of ‘similar’ contrasts in an unknown language. The NA and NJ listeners clearly made more discrimination errors when they responded to the contrasts in the unknown language. The results obtained from the NNJ listeners suggest that experience learning Japanese led to a shift in their long-term phonological representations and measurably differentiated them from the OZ listeners. Despite this evidence for plasticity, the NNJ listeners were substantially less accurate than the NJ listeners in discriminating the Japanese vowel length contrasts. If and how this limited learning can eventually be overcome is an important question for future research.</p>

<p>Although a thorough description of various varieties of Arabic is beyond the scope of the present study, it should be noted that there is a clear distinction between colloquial varieties and MSA (which has no native speakers). However, vowel length is contrastive in both, and parallel findings could be expected in the colloquial varieties and MSA.</p>
</fn>

<p>In future research, it would be desirable to provide a model of normal speaking rate that the speakers should follow.</p>

<p>The carrier sentences were:</p>
<p>次は ___ と言います。</p>
<p>‘Next I say the word ___’   (for Japanese)</p>
<p>بتكأ انا ___ًاڝ۠ أ</p>
<p>‘I write ___ as well’    (for MSA)</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn4-0267658311435870">
<label>4.</label>
<p>Only short vowels would potentially devoice under certain circumstances, in particular at fast/normal speaking rate or in casual speech. Should a listener fail to group fully voiced and voiceless short vowels together and group fully voiced short and long vowels together based on the voicing criterion, we could safely assume that the listener is not sensitive to the length contrast.</p>

<p>An anonymous reviewer pointed out that the familiarity of the Japanese target words should have been controlled for. Although this is an issue that needs to be rectified in future research, it was not possible to select words that are equally familiar to every listener.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn8-0267658311435870">
<label>8.</label>
<p>An anonymous reviewer pointed out that (1) words from colloquial varieties of Arabic (not MSA) are included and that (2) consonant length is omitted for some words used in this study. These errors were accidentally overlooked at the time of stimuli preparation. However, the inclusion of these words is unlikely to nullify the value of this study, as the focus was to examine how the listeners respond to contrastive vowel length in known and/or unknown languages. Furthermore, the listeners were explicitly instructed to pay attention to the vowel sound of each word.</p>

<p>‘Bilingual’ in this context means that the speaker is competent or functional in English and some other language excluding Japanese.</p>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn10-0267658311435870">

<p>The exact number of guess answers was not counted in this forced-choice task, since there is no guarantee that the listeners accurately report when they did or did not guess their answers.</p>

<p>This was the example used in the instructions with every listener. However, the listeners were reminded that the actual speech sounds presented would not be English and that they would hear two languages that may be unfamiliar to them.</p>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn12-0267658311435870">
<label>12.</label>
<p>Although it is beyond the scope of this study, I agree with an anonymous reviewer that the difference in the phonetic realization of short vs. long contrasts between Arabic and Japanese needs to be clarified by detailed acoustic analyses of the stimuli.</p>
