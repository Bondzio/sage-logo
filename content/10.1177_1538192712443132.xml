<p>A well-established principle in the literature on learning, which maintains that variability of practice enhances long-term retention, served as the foundation of a summer program intended to ameliorate reading skills in incoming freshmen. During a 4-week period, students received reading instruction in the context of four areas: humanities, social/behavioral sciences, natural/physical sciences and visual arts. Reading scores increased for most participants from pre- to post-testing. Attitudes towards basic skills such as reading, writing, cooperative work and public speaking also improved from pre- to post-testing.</p>

<title>Resumen</title>
<p>Uno de los principios bases de la investigación sobre el aprendizaje, el cual propone que la versatilidad en la práctica mejora la retención, sirve como fundamento para apoyar el programa de verano que intenta enriquecer las destrezas de lectura para los estudiantes universitarios de primer año. Durante las cuatro semanas del curso, los estudiantes reciben instrucción de lectura en cuatro áreas específicas: humanidades, ciencias sociales y de comportamiento, ciencias naturales y físicas y las artes visuales. Las calificaciones de los exámenes preliminares y posteriores demostraron que la escritura mejoró en la mayoría de los participantes. Los resultados también mostraron una mejora en las aptitudes hacia las destrezas básicas como la lectura, redacción, trabajo cooperativo y hablar en público.</p>

<p>Diversity in the freshman population at minority-serving institutions, such as New Mexico Highlands University (NMHU), assumes different forms, including educational preparation, socioeconomic background, linguistic experience, and cultural/ethnic upbringing, all of which demand accommodation without compromising standards (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538192712443132">Alvarez, 1991</xref>). Reading skills embody a facet of the diversity in educational preparation of incoming freshmen that is particularly critical to performance in introductory courses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538192712443132">Cox, Friesner, &amp; Khayum, 2003</xref>). Such courses represent the first serious roadblock in students’ college careers mostly because they introduce large amounts of quite unfamiliar information within a short period of time. As such, introductory courses are a two-edged sword. Although they offer instructors and administrators an early opportunity to identify students “at risk” of academic failure, they strengthen in such students the impression of insurmountable academic demands.</p>
<p>The present article describes a summer bridge program (a type of pipeline intervention; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1538192712443132">Strayhorn, 2011</xref>), entitled the Reading Acceleration Program (RAP), which was developed to ameliorate freshmen’s performance in introductory courses by targeting reading skills. RAP was offered to incoming freshmen as a 4-week educational program, during which students received intensive reading instruction and were exposed to a variety of activities intended to make academic reading accessible and interesting. For the purpose of program design and evaluation, reading skills were operationally defined as the use of orthographic, phonological, semantic, and syntactic knowledge to yield literal and inferential comprehension of written text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538192712443132">Frederiksen, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538192712443132">McKoon &amp; Ratcliff, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1538192712443132">Vellutino, Tunmer, Jaccard, &amp; Chen, 2007</xref>). The program was designed to reflect a well-established principle in the literature on learning, according to which variability of practice can enhance long-term retention (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538192712443132">Goode, Geraci, &amp; Roediger, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1538192712443132">McDaniel &amp; Masson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1538192712443132">Schmidt &amp; Bjork, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1538192712443132">Wulf &amp; Schmidt, 1988</xref>). Hence, reading was taught in four content areas: humanities, social/behavioral sciences, natural/physical sciences, and visual arts. In light of the robust correlation between reading and writing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538192712443132">Fitzgerald &amp; Shanahan, 2000</xref>) and of the critical role played by the latter in college, writing was relied upon as a means for sustaining reading skills under the principle of variable practice. Consequently, RAP exhibited variability of practice not only in the content of the readings, but also in the modes of training, allowing reading to be practiced either directly, through reading assignments, or indirectly, through writing assignments connected with students’ readings. Exposure to academic disciplines through faculty’s demonstrations and lectures was another means of introducing variability to skill training by offering students the opportunity to practice reading from a variety of sources, including slides, instructions for conducting lab activities, maps, and so on.</p>
<p>The ancillary principle upon which RAP relied was that comprehension of a written message requires that the reader combine information from the text being read with knowledge already known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538192712443132">McKoon &amp; Ratcliff, 1992</xref>). Therefore, particular care was taken to identify instructional materials and activities within the four selected content areas that would promote conceptual integration (i.e., the establishment of links within recently acquired concepts and between such concepts and preexisting knowledge; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538192712443132">Carr &amp; Dagenbach, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538192712443132">Dagenbach, Horst, &amp; Carr, 1990</xref>). The goal of conceptual integration was implemented through instructional materials related to students’ experiences (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538192712443132">Alvarez, 1991</xref>), faculty’s demonstrations pertaining to the understanding of natural resources (e.g., water, soil) and human characteristics (e.g., DNA), and interactions with city officials illustrating the issues faced by rural communities.</p>
<p>It is important to note here that research evidence on summer bridge programs, such as RAP, is sparse and mixed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538192712443132">Ackermann, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538192712443132">Garcia, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538192712443132">Miller, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1538192712443132">Santa Rita &amp; Bacote, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1538192712443132">Strayhorn, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1538192712443132">Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1538192712443132">Rutschow &amp; Schneider, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1538192712443132">Zuniga, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, although the objectives are usually clearly stated (e.g., improving reading skills), it is difficult to discern the underlying learning principles that justify the heterogeneity of approaches and implementations that have been used. In contrast, because the selection of training exercises for RAP was explicitly guided by the principle of variable practice and the ancillary principle of conceptual integration, such principles were assumed to be the primary sources of the program’s impact on reading skills.</p>
<p>Not only the sources of success and failure of different programs are difficult to identify in past research but also comparability of outcomes is complicated by the heterogeneity of approaches, implementations, and measurements (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1538192712443132">Utterback, 1998</xref>). The extent to which the content of practice in reading and other skills matches cultural and social differences is also largely ignored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538192712443132">Alvarez, 1991</xref>). Similar issues are presented by pipeline programs offered during the regular academic year, often available to students since the first semester of enrollment (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1538192712443132">Tierney &amp; Garcia, 2011</xref>). An insight into the complexity of assessment of pipeline programs is presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538192712443132">Abrams and Podojil Jernigan (1984)</xref> who reported that the number of hours spent in a reading and study skill program was a reasonably good predictor of fall GPA of students provisionally admitted. Concurrently, these students were required to take classes with a low teacher-to-student ratio and were offered peer tutoring. The lack of specificity of the nature and content of the practice of study and reading skills and the complexity of the activities offered make the identification of the sources of the program’s success difficult. Furthermore, given the subjectivity of college grades and their likely inflation, it is unclear whether the correlation between GPA and number of hours spent in the program means anything beyond the fact that increased attendance may reflect increased motivation. Indeed, although most students improved their reading scores from pre- to post-test (as measured by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538192712443132">Nelson &amp; Denny Reading test, 1973</xref>), approximately two thirds of their scores did not reach college level.</p>
<p>We attempted to address some of the issues that emerged in earlier research by not only developing an explicit rationale for RAP’s pedagogical approach (as described above) but also offering clarity in program evaluation. The latter relied largely on a pre–post design. Primary dependent measures were reading scores on the COMPASS reading placement test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538192712443132">ACT, 2006</xref>) and on a test specifically designed to assess students’ literal and inferential comprehension (hereafter labeled <italic>NMHU reading test</italic>). Another means of evaluation was the comparison of performance on the latter test between RAP participants and a control group of nonparticipants whose ACT reading scores were matched to those obtained by RAP participants at the start of the program. Of course, interventions focused on the training of a specific skill (i.e., reading) might affect other skills as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1538192712443132">Schmidt &amp; Bjork, 1992</xref>). Consequently, it was thought that, although prima facie evidence of RAP’s success would be improvements in reading scores from pre- to post-testing, changes in students’ self-evaluation of a variety of skills (e.g., reading, writing, cooperation, etc.), metacognitive awareness, test anxiety, and reading habits and patterns would illustrate the breadth of the influence that RAP had on skills other than the one specifically targeted.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were selected from a pool of 344 incoming freshmen whose COMPASS reading placement test scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538192712443132">ACT, 2006</xref>) ranged between 52 and 90 (<italic>M</italic> = 67.76, 0-100 scale; comparable ACT reading scores: 12-22). Recruitment relied on repeated phone calls and invitation letters to parents and students. The selected sample included 17 students (age range: 17-20) of heterogeneous ethnicity: 5 students of Hispanic descent, 5 Native Americans, 5 Mexican Americans/Mexicans, and 2 Caucasians. Nine were female and 8 were male. Most students’ primary residence was New Mexico with the exception of two students from Arizona, one from California, and one from Texas. The selected sample was representative of the larger pool in reference to ethnicity, age, reading placement test scores, and primary residence. In contrast, men and women received equal representation in the sample, whereas women were overrepresented in the larger pool.</p>
<p>A sample of freshmen who did not participate in RAP was selected for comparison purposes. Freshmen from the fall semester of the previous academic year had to have taken the NMHU reading test at the end of a regularly taught introductory English course in order to be considered for selection. Inclusion in the control group was based on matching freshmen on ACT reading scores at the start of college, and, whenever possible, on subject variables such as gender, ethnicity, age, and state of primary residence. Mean score for the control group was 14.65 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.37), whereas the mean score for the RAP group was 14.71 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.69), <italic>t</italic> &lt; 1, <italic>ns</italic>.</p>

<title>Procedure and Evaluation Materials</title>
<p>For 4 weeks, students received intensive reading instruction and were exposed to a variety of activities intended to make academic reading accessible and interesting. Given the critical role played by writing in college and its high correlation with reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538192712443132">Fitzgerald &amp; Shanahan, 2000</xref>), writing assignments connected with students’ reading assignments were also routinely administered. Students attended class 8 hours a day, Monday through Thursday, and 4 hours on Friday. During weekends, they met NMHU faculty and community leaders or took educational field trips. Thus, at the completion of the program, students received 144 hours of formal instruction (36 hours x 4 weeks), completed approximately 40 hours of homework activities (10 hours x 4 weeks), and devoted a minimum of 20 hours to subject-oriented activities (2 hours x 10 meetings with faculty/community leaders).</p>
<p>Reading was taught in the context of four areas: humanities, social/behavioral sciences, natural/physical sciences, and visual arts (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538192712443132">Horning, 2007</xref>). In the morning, instruction mostly focused on promoting basic reading skills by means of case studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1538192712443132">Robinson &amp; Altman, 2009</xref>). In the afternoon, reading was specifically focused on one of the four content areas described above, and it included texts of different levels of complexity, from magazine/newspaper articles to peer-reviewed journal articles. As practice progressed, materials from magazines/newspapers were gradually replaced by journal articles. Four key abilities were explicitly practiced: (1) literal comprehension of text, and (2) synthesis of information and selection of information from text for inferential processing (i.e., going beyond the information given), including (3) interpretation and (4) application of knowledge. In the morning, one of two English instructors was primarily responsible for pedagogy with the support of a teaching assistant, whereas in the afternoon, a teaching assistant delivered pedagogy with the faculty serving as support. English instructors were selected for their expertise in teaching introductory English courses, whereas teaching assistants were selected for their expertise in one of the content areas. During weekends, students met NMHU faculty and community leaders. The goal was to broaden the implementation of the principle of varied practice by introducing students to a diverse array of academic disciplines and community issues. Meetings with NMHU faculty and community leaders consisted of lectures, demonstrations, and, at times, written practical applications of acquired knowledge. Educational trips were offered to acquaint students with the surrounding landscape and communities.</p>
<p>At the start and end of the program, self-assessment and performance measures were administered. Self-assessment measures included the Metacognitive Awareness Inventory (MAI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1538192712443132">Schraw &amp; Dennison, 1994</xref>), the Test Anxiety Inventory (TAI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1538192712443132">Taylor &amp; Deane, 2002</xref>), a questionnaire on reading habits and patterns (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1538192712443132">Scales &amp; Rhee, 2001</xref>), and a survey pertaining to self-evaluation of skills. MAI was intended to assess students’ knowledge of cognition (i.e., knowledge of oneself as a learner, and knowledge of learning strategies, including how, why, and when to use them) and regulation of cognition (i.e., planning, information management strategies, comprehension monitoring, strategies for correcting errors, and assessment; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538192712443132">Artzt &amp; Armour-Thomas, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538192712443132">Baker, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1538192712443132">Schraw &amp; Dennison, 1994</xref>). It contained 52 statements, each rated on a 100-mm continuum from “false” to “true”. TAI was intended to asses self-reported test anxiety through 20 statements, each requiring a rating on a 5-point scale from “never” to “always” of how often the respondent had experienced a specific symptom of anxiety before, during, or after examinations. TAI contained statements pertaining to two scales, one assessing cognitive concerns about the consequences of failure (apprehension), and the other measuring reactions of the autonomic nervous system (emotionality). The Reading Habits and Reading Patterns Questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1538192712443132">Scales &amp; Rhee, 2001</xref>) included statements on reading habits (i.e., frequency and content of reading) and reading patterns before, during, and after reading (i.e., strategies that readers may use to enhance comprehension). Statements regarding frequency of reading or use of strategies were rated on a 5-point scale from “never” to “very often,” whereas those regarding content involved item selection from a list of available choices. Lastly, the survey pertaining to self-evaluation of skills (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538192712443132">Martinez, Lindline, Petronis, &amp; Pilotti, in press</xref>) mentioned activities critical to success in college such as reading, writing, public speaking, working with others, and conducting literature reviews. It required respondents to evaluate statements referring to their ability to perform each activity and their comfort with the activity (self-evaluation of one’s competence). It also required respondents to estimate the difficulty and enjoyment arising from performing the activity. All ratings entailed the use of a 5-point scale from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree.”</p>
<p>In addition to the self-assessment measures described above, an in-house test was also administered to appraise reading skills. The NMHU reading test, which was untimed, first required students to read text (i.e., 29 paragraphs related to a specific issue) and then answer a series of reading comprehension questions. Questions were statements that students had to recognize as pertaining to information directly stated in the text or information related to the gist of the text (40% of the score on a 100-point range). The test then required students to summarize the issue discussed in the text, including main argument(s) and supporting evidence (60% of the score). Answers were scored for content to measure comprehension skills at the literal and inferential levels.</p>
<p>Another in-house test was administered to assess writing (hereafter named the NMHU writing sample test). It required students to read a case study from a textbook (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1538192712443132">Robinson &amp; Altman, 2009</xref>) and then write a 4- to 5-page essay exhibiting an evaluation of points of view and a thesis or recommendation supported by evidence. Essays were evaluated according to two criteria: writer’s ability to sustain a controlling idea (focus), and his or her ability to illustrate evidence in support of the idea (development). Each criterion was scored on a scale from 1 to 6, leading to a maximum score of 12 for a “flawless essay” (highest ratings for sustaining a controlling idea/thesis and offering evidence in support of such idea).</p>
<p>At the end of the program, all of the pre-test measures listed above were administered again. The COMPASS reading placement test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538192712443132">ACT, 2006</xref>) was also administered along with a project evaluation questionnaire. The project evaluation questionnaire was devised to assess how students perceived pedagogy delivered by instructors and teaching assistants, demonstrations offered by faculty, and extracurricular activities (e.g., educational field trips). Evaluations were to be performed on a 5-point scale from “poor” to “excellent.”</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Results are considered significant at the .05 level. They are organized into two categories: performance measures and self-evaluation measures. Descriptive statistics reported below include all participants unless otherwise indicated. In the rare cases in which fewer than 17 students are reported, the missing data refer to students who were absent at the time of testing. The performance of students in the selected sample with similar demographic and initial performance characteristics was used to estimate missing data.

<title>Performance Measures</title>
<p>Mean <italic>COMPASS reading placement</italic> pre-test score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538192712443132">ACT, 2006</xref>; scale: 0-100) was 67.76 (ACT equivalent value: 14). Scores ranged from 52 to 90 (<italic>SD</italic> = 9.99, equivalent ACT range: 12-22). Mean COMPASS post-test score was 77.81 (ACT equivalent value: 17). Scores ranged from 64 to 92 (<italic>SD</italic> = 7.40, equivalent ACT range: 14-23). One student did not take the post-test. The improvement from pre- to post-test for the remaining students was significant, <italic>t</italic>(15) = 4.11, <italic>p</italic> = .001. Fourteen students improved their score (range: 1-26 points), and two had a lower score (range: 2-7 points).</p>
<p>Mean overall <italic>NMHU reading pre-test score</italic> (scale: 0-100) was 55.24 (<italic>SD</italic> = 12.03), whereas the corresponding mean post-test score was 70.80 (<italic>SD</italic> = 9.19), illustrating a significant increment, <italic>t</italic>(14) = 6.39, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Two students did not take the post-test. Scores ranged from 25 to 77 on the pre-test and from 52 to 86 on the post-test. Fourteen students improved their score (range: 4-28), whereas one lowered it (5 points). We also examined the pre- and post- scores of the 10 Hispanic students (those who classified themselves as being of Hispanic descent or Mexican Americans/Mexicans) separately. The pattern of outcomes displayed by the larger sample was observed in this subsample,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1538192712443132">1</xref></sup> thereby justifying analyses based on the entire group of RAP students.</p>
<p>NMHU post-test reading scores of RAP students were compared to those of a control group of nonparticipants with matched ACT reading scores at the start of the preceding fall semester. Selection for the control group targeted students who took the NMHU reading test at the end of a regularly taught introductory English course. The mean reading score of the control group was 69.12 (<italic>SD</italic> = 13.85), whereas the mean score of RAP students was 70.80 (<italic>SD</italic> = 9.19). Scores of the control group ranged from 49 to 93. Results of the comparison indicated that the two groups did not differ significantly, <italic>t</italic> &lt; 1, <italic>ns</italic>.</p>
<p>An examination of students’ essays written for the <italic>NMHU writing sample test</italic> at the start and end of the program indicated gains across all students, with the exception of one student whose performance remained stable, <italic>t</italic>(15) = 3.55, <italic>p</italic> = .003. The mean score of the 16 students who took the NMHU writing sample pre-test (scale: 0-12) was 5.50 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.73, range: 4-7), whereas the mean score of the 16 students who took the post-test was 8.36 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.32, range: 6.0-10.5). The scores for the two criteria were combined because they yielded similar results. Because of gains across all students with the exception of one, it was decided that assessment of students’ writing at the end of the program was to be conducted against the criterion adopted for the larger NMHU student population. To this end, essays written for the NMHU writing sample test were evaluated by two raters trained to use the assessment criteria. Interraters reliability was <italic>r</italic>
<sub><italic>s</italic></sub> = .88, <italic>p &lt; .</italic>001. Values produced by the two raters were averaged to estimate students’ writing. A one-sample <italic>t</italic> test demonstrated that RAP students’ combined post-test scores were above or equal to 7, which raters determined (based on performance of a larger pool of NMHU students) to be the minimum score for successful performance, <italic>t</italic>(15) = 4.12, <italic>p</italic> = .001. Of the 16 students who took the test, two scored below 7 (i.e., 6.75 and 6.00).</p>

<title>Self-Evaluation Measures</title>
<p>All self-evaluation instruments were completed anonymously. As a result, comparisons involved two sets of data, before and after the program, as if produced by two groups of individuals.</p>
<p><italic>Metacognitive Awareness Inventory</italic> (MAI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1538192712443132">Schraw &amp; Dennison, 1994</xref>) scores were organized into knowledge of cognition and regulation of cognition (scale: 0-100). For knowledge of cognition, mean pre-test score was 60.55 (<italic>SD</italic> = 17.21) and post-test score was 68.84 (<italic>SD</italic> = 13.27). For regulation of cognition, mean pre-test score was 59.53 (<italic>SD</italic> = 20.71) and post-test score was 61.59 (<italic>SD</italic> = 16.16). For either category of responses, there was a nonsignificant trend in the direction of an improvement, <italic>t</italic>s ≤ 1.57.</p>
<p><italic>Test Anxiety Inventory</italic> (TAI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1538192712443132">Taylor &amp; Deane, 2002</xref>) scores were organized into emotionality and apprehension measures (scale: 0 = <italic>never</italic> to 4 = <italic>always</italic>). For emotionality, median pre-test score was 2.75 and post-test score was 2.00. For apprehension, mean pre-test score was 2.50 and post-test score was 2.00. For either category of responses, there was a nonsignificant trend in the direction of a decrement in test anxiety, <italic>U</italic> = 138, <italic>z</italic> = −1.01, <italic>ns</italic>, and <italic>U</italic> = 160, <italic>z</italic> = −0.31, <italic>ns</italic>, respectively.</p>
<p>The <italic>questionnaire on reading habits and patterns</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1538192712443132">Scales &amp; Rhee, 2001</xref>) contained statements on reading patterns before, during, and after reading (i.e., strategies that readers may use to enhance comprehension) and frequency of reading. Ratings, which relied on a scale from “never” to “very often,” did not produce any significant differences between pre- and post-administration. This outcome may be related to the absence of a change or to the absence of awareness of a change.</p>
<p>Statements regarding content, which involved item selection from a list of available choices, including newspapers, magazines novels, religious materials, comics, and so on, illustrated a trend toward increased reading of magazines and religious materials. This trend may be the byproduct of the content of the instruction, whereby students were introduced to a variety of magazine articles related to the four content areas covered by the program and entertained discussions of a case study involving the First Amendment.</p>
<p>The <italic>survey pertaining to self-evaluation of skills</italic> relied on a scale from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree” to evaluate activities critical to success in college. Increase comfort with and perceived competence in reading (<italic>U</italic> = 75.00, <italic>z</italic> = −2.61, <italic>p</italic> = .009, and <italic>U</italic> = 91.50, <italic>z</italic> = −2.01, <italic>p</italic> = .045, respectively) and writing (<italic>U</italic> = 75.00, <italic>z</italic> = −2.71, <italic>p</italic> = .012, and <italic>U</italic> = 60.50, <italic>z</italic> = −3.13, <italic>p</italic> = .002, respectively) were reported from pre- to post-test (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538192712443132">Figure 1</xref>). Students also reported improvements in their comfort with public speaking, <italic>U</italic> = 54.00, <italic>z</italic> = −3.11, <italic>p</italic> = .002, their ability to work with others, <italic>U</italic> = 76.00, <italic>z</italic> = −2.47, <italic>p</italic> = .014, and their perceived competence in conducting a literature review using online databases, <italic>U</italic> = 71.50, <italic>z</italic> = −2.66, <italic>p</italic> = .008 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538192712443132">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Project Evaluation Questionnaire</title>
<p>The project evaluation questionnaire was administered at the end of the program. Its goal was to assess how students perceived the pedagogy delivered by instructors and teaching assistants, demonstrations and lectures offered by faculty, and extracurricular activities (e.g., educational field trips). The questionnaire required evaluations to be performed on a 5-point scale, including <italic>poor, fair, good, very good</italic>, and <italic>excellent</italic>. If “poor” and “fair” are considered negative evaluations, then students’ ratings of their overall experience with the program were all positive with the exception of one “fair” evaluation. Ratings of instruction and demonstrations/lectures offered by faculty consisted of all positive evaluations. Four students rated educational field activities as fair, whereas all others expressed positive evaluations.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>RAP was intended to improve reading skills of incoming freshmen during the summer that preceded the start of the academic year. Change was observed in the reading skills of most participants. Overall, there was no significant difference between reading performance of RAP students at the end of the program and reading performance of students of the control group after one semester of a regular introductory English course. Writing skills also appeared to improve from the start to the end of the program, even though RAP pedagogy was aimed at reading. Furthermore, better attitudes toward reading, writing, and other academically valuable activities were detected at the end of the program. In sum, RAP offered a demonstration that previously established patterns of behavior and attitudes toward such behaviors are not impossible to change through an intensive 4-week program offering concentrated, but varied practice. Of course, preservation of newly established skills requires intensive practice within a supportive environment where such practice is meaningful. It is reasonable to expect freshmen to take a considerable number of introductory classes, which present large amounts of quite unfamiliar information within a short period of time. As such, introductory classes might offer RAP participants intensive reading practice following the completion of the program, ensuring the preservation of newly acquired skills.</p>
<p>The findings of the present investigation offer concrete suggestions for institutional policies regarding the development and implementation of pipeline programs, including those offered prior to formal enrollment and those made available during the regular academic year. Voluntary programs, whereby instruction is focused on specific skills, concentrated, and limited in duration, can successfully eliminate the stigma of “remedial education” and enhance academic preparation. Content of programs may involve a variety of disciplines and focus on reading, writing, or both, depending on the needs of the participants. Most important, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538192712443132">Alvarez (1991)</xref> for Hispanic students, acknowledgment of and respect for cultural heritage and subtle differences are to be embedded in the curriculum of each program to ensure meaningfulness to students and pedagogical effectiveness.</p>
<p>Although the program was advertised to a large number of incoming freshmen, only a limited number of students responded. It is reasonable to assume that such students were motivated to ensure their success in college, questioning whether RAP would be equally successful with a sample of students who are less aware of their reading skills and of the critical role that reading plays in college courses. The comparison with a control group of students who had completed a regularly taught introductory English course appears to put this question to rest. Although the sample of participants was limited, the range of initial reading skills (as illustrated by the COMPASS reading placement test) was heterogeneous. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1538192712443132">Figure 3</xref> illustrates the gains and losses from pre- to post-tests in relation to the initial scores. As expected, greater gains tended to be exhibited by students who had less than stellar scores, <italic>r</italic>(16) <italic>=</italic> –.585, <italic>p</italic> = .017. Although expected, this finding also suggests that the program may have to be adjusted for students with better reading skills. Last, it is reasonable to assume that a byproduct of demonstrations/lectures by NMHU faculty may be greater familiarity with academic disciplines, potentially informing participants of the choices available to them for the purpose of major and career selections. Informal conversations with participants, however, indicated that although major selection did not appear to have been influenced by the demonstrations/lectures, disciplines earlier unknown were perceived with a sense of familiarity and curiosity at the end of the program.</p>
