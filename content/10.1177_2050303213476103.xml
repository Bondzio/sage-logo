<p>As critical research on religion, the study of colonialism and religion directs attention to religious creativity within the asymmetrical power relations of contact zones, intercultural relations, and diasporic circulations. Taking the imperial ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics as a point of departure, this article recalls how the drama of the colonizing Prospero and the colonized Caliban has been a template for analyzing religion under colonial conditions. Like Shakespeare’s enchanted isle, colonizing and colonized religion have been shaped by oceans, with the Mediterranean, Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific worlds emerging as crucial units of analysis. As a contribution to a symposium on critical approaches to the study of religion, this article indicates some of the important landmarks, sea changes, and analytical possibilities in the study of colonialism and religion.</p>

<p>On 27 July 2012, at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics, directed by filmmaker Danny Boyle, the world watched a tribute to Great Britain that bore traces of imperialism, colonialism, and religion. Following a single tone from the Olympic Bell and patriotic hymns, a pageant unfolded that displayed the four-stage stadial model of human progress. Developed in the European Enlightenment, this stadial model was adopted by liberal imperialists during the nineteenth century as a warrant for the British Empire. Beginning with the savagery of hunter-gatherers, human development proceeded through the barbarism of pastoralists and the culture of agriculturalists to culminate in urban civilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2050303213476103">Calloway, 2008</xref>: 77; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2050303213476103">Mantena, 2010</xref>: 59; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2050303213476103">Pocock, 2005</xref>). In the Olympic opening ceremony, this stadial theory was illustrated by savage drumming, the migration from farms to cities, and the revolution of commerce and industry. This tableau of human evolution was launched by the actor Kenneth Branagh playing the part of the great civil engineer, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, the pioneer of the Industrial Revolution, the architect of modern Britain, who recited from Shakespeare’s <italic>The Tempest</italic>:
<disp-quote>
<p>Be not afeard. The isle is full of noises,</p>
<p>Sounds, and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.</p>
<p>Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments</p>
<p>Will hum about mine ears, and sometime voices</p>
<p>That, if I then had waked after long sleep,</p>
<p>Will make me sleep again. And then, in dreaming,</p>
<p>The clouds methought would open and show riches</p>
<p>Ready to drop upon me, that when I waked,</p>
<p>I cried to dream again. (III.ii.133–141)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Strangely, Brunel, the magician of urban civilization, the modern Prospero, appropriated the words of Prospero’s “savage and deformed slave,” Caliban (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2050303213476103">International Olympic Committee, 2012a</xref>). Originally performed in 1611 when the English were colonizing Virginia and Guyana, <italic>The Tempest</italic>, as Peter Hulme has observed, “has its finger on what is most essential in the dialectic between colonizer and colonized” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2050303213476103">Hulme, 1986</xref>: 123). Under the spell of Prospero’s magic, the indigenous Caliban was dispossessed of the island he inherited, exploited for his labor, forced to speak (and curse) in an alien language, and subject to new dreams of redemption. Whereas the psychoanalyst Octave Mannoni developed a problematic theory of inherent colonial dependency in <italic>Prospero and Caliban</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2050303213476103">Mannoni, 1956 [1950]</xref>), anticolonial theorists, especially in the Americas, adopted the master−slave dialectic in <italic>The Tempest</italic> as a template for analyzing colonial situations. Under colonialism, as Barbara Bush has noted, “‘Prospero and Caliban,’ colonizer and colonized, were locked in complex spirals of power and dependence, collaboration and resistance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2050303213476103">Bush, 2006</xref>: 144). By stealing Caliban’s lines, Brunel introduced an imperial display of colonizing power, which was underwritten by an ideology of human progress from savagery to civilization. This imperial performance was finalized in the closing ceremony, in which Caliban’s same lines were repeated by Winston Churchill before the athletes from all the nations of the world filed into the stadium to fit within the pattern of the flag of the United Kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2050303213476103">International Olympic Committee, 2012b</xref>).</p>
<p>What does any of this have to do with religion? Founder of the modern Olympics, Pierre de Coubertin, was clear that his International Olympic Committee was presiding over a religion, a <italic>religio athletae</italic>, a <italic>Muskelreligion</italic>, to be celebrated through a recurring sacred festival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2050303213476103">Alkemeyer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2050303213476103">De Coubertin, 2000</xref>: 580). In the era from Brunel to Churchill, which has often been regarded as an age of secularizing modernity, many new “religions” emerged in Great Britain. John Stuart Mill, for example, promoted the “religion of humanity” proposed by Auguste Comte, the father of scientific positivism, who traced an evolutionary progression from magic, through religion, to science, which would culminate in a religion of humanity based on altruism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2050303213476103">Wernick, 2004</xref>). The religion of humanity, Mill argued, “is not only entitled to be called a religion: it is a better religion than any of those which are ordinarily called by that title” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2050303213476103">Raeder, 2002</xref>: 253). Making a religion out of science, Thomas Huxley proclaimed himself as the bishop of the church scientific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2050303213476103">Livingstone, 2009</xref>: 351), whereas Francis Galton argued for a religion of eugenics, led by “prophets and high priests of civilization,” which would purify and thereby redeem the human population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2050303213476103">Herrick, 2008</xref>: 103–105). Making a religion out of imperial expansion, devotees of the British Empire could equate imperialism with religion, as in Alfred Milner’s religion of empire or John Buchan’s “church of empire,” which also promised universal redemption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2050303213476103">Sandison, 1967</xref>: 25–45; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2050303213476103">Schwarz, 2011</xref>: 93). On the colonized peripheries of empire, this implicit religion of the United Kingdom was often displayed. In Africa, as the historian Terence Ranger has observed, “the ‘theology’ of an omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent monarchy [was] almost the sole ingredient of imperial ideology as it was represented to Africans” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2050303213476103">Ranger, 1983</xref>: 212). Imperial mastery, in this sense, was not legitimated by religion; it was religion.</p>
<p>During the five hundred years of European colonization of the world, imperial pageantry has been displayed in rituals of power, those “ceremonies of possession” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2050303213476103">Seed, 1995</xref>) that provided a sacral warrant for the political domination, economic exploitation, territorial containment, and missionizing imposition of alien beliefs, practices, and values on indigenous people. Like Prospero’s magic book, the Bible, the “white men’s magic” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2050303213476103">Wimbush, 2012</xref>), was an instrument of colonizing power, giving rise to the common anticolonial aphorism, which Eduardo Mondlane invoked in opening <italic>The Struggle for Mozambique</italic>: “When the whites came to our country we had the land, and they had the Bible; now we have the Bible and they have the land” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2050303213476103">Mondlane, 1969</xref>: 23). In colonial situations, religion was invoked to certify ownership of land, from the Roman Catholic division of the New World into Spanish and Portuguese spheres, through the Protestant doctrine, refined by John Locke, of <italic>nulla terris</italic>, empty land, which deemed any territory empty of human habitation and available for European possession if the land was not being cultivated through settled agriculture. “This island’s mine by Sycorax, my mother,” Caliban exclaimed, asserting his indigenous ancestral ownership against Prospero, “Which thou tak’st from me” (I.11.331–332). Prospero had taken control through the power of his book.</p>
<p>The opposition between Prospero and Caliban, colonizer and colonized, has often been rendered as a dualism. “The colonial world is a Manichean world,” as Frantz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2050303213476103">Fanon held (1963: 41)</xref>. Recent research on religion and colonialism, however, has explored the complex ways in which religion has been fashioned and refashioned in the asymmetrical power relations of colonial contact zones. In Southern Africa, for example, whereas Christian missionaries redefined their gospel in opposition to indigenous practices of initiation, polygyny, and ancestral sacrifices, Africans sacralized their ancestors in reinforcing indigenous claims on land that were under threat by colonialism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2050303213476103">Landau, 2010</xref>: 235). In Southwestern Nigeria, under colonial conditions, Yoruba ethnic, cultural, and religious identities were made in Africa and remade in the Atlantic world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2050303213476103">Peel, 2000</xref>). In Madagascar, where the Malagasy revolt in 1947 against French colonial rule provided the impetus for Mannoni’s <italic>Prospero and Caliban</italic>, ancestral rituals have continued to mediate the history and memory of colonialism, as Jennifer Cole has observed, embodying and enacting “the creative ways in which Malagasy in different parts of the island reacted to colonial intrusions and transformations alike” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2050303213476103">Cole, 2001</xref>: 11). These relational strategies of religious self-fashioning were worked out in local negotiations over meaning and power. Not a Manichean dualism, these relations were hybrid, simultaneously alien and indigenous. As religion in motion—crossing seas, entering new territories—imperial religion was not imported as a pure product to be consumed; indigenous religion was not inevitably destroyed, damaged, or defiled by the colonial encounter. Certainly, colonial violence against indigenous religions, such as the aggressive “extirpation of idolatries” in the Americas, has featured in this history of interreligious engagement. In the name of a civilizing mission, colonization might directly attack local religious beliefs and practices, as in the case of Prospero, at least as rendered by the great Shakespearean scholar G. Wilson Knight, who celebrated him as an emblem of Great Britain’s “colonizing, especially her will to raise savage peoples from superstition and blood-sacrifice, taboos and witchcraft and the attendant fears and slaveries, to a more enlightened existence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2050303213476103">Knight, 1966 [1947]: 255</xref>). But recent research has moved beyond the stark opposition between submission and resistance, which poised Caliban between either conversion to the religion of the book or adherence to ancestral heritage, to explore the dynamics of religious creativity under colonial conditions.</p>
<p>For anticolonial activists in the Americas, Caliban has been recast as the hero of the colonial encounter, a hero of hybridity, “our mestizo America,” according to the Cuban philologist Roberto Fernández Retamor in his influential essay, “Caliban” (1989 [1971]), and a hero of diaspora, an African slave struggling for liberation as he appears in <italic>Une tempête</italic> by the Martinican poet and politician <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2050303213476103">Aimé Césaire (1985 [1969]</xref>). Not creating Calypso Calibans, with a Caribbean flavor, these recastings have been political interventions in imperial and colonial myth-making. Explaining his project as a dramatic revision of the opposition between the civilized and the primitive, Césaire observed:
<disp-quote>
<p>I was trying to “de-mythify” the tale. To me Prospero is the complete totalitarian. I am always surprised when others consider him the wise man who “forgives.” What is most obvious, even in Shakespeare’s version, is the man’s absolute will to power. Prospero is the man of cold reason, the man of methodical conquest—in other words, a portrait of the “enlightened” European. And I see the whole play in such terms: the “civilized” European world coming face to face for the first time with the world of primitivism and magic. Let’s not hide the fact that in Europe the world of reason has inevitably led to various kinds of totalitarianism. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2050303213476103">Belhassen, 1972</xref>: 176)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Although Césaire’s Caliban refused Prospero’s image of him as a savage and rejected the legitimacy of Prospero’s civilizing mission, Césaire deconstructed the colonial opposition between the primitive and the civilized by having Caliban proclaim, “Uhuru!,” change his name to “X”, and invoke the Yoruba deity, Shango. At the play’s conclusion, as Prospero remains on the island, as if imprisoned, Caliban X is heard singing, “FREEDOM HI-DAY FREEDOM HI-DAY!” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2050303213476103">Césaire, 1985 [1969]: 68</xref>).</p>
<p>The opposition between the savage and the civilized might have been established by imperial theory and colonial practices, but it was constantly being undermined by the fluid nature of colonial encounters and exchanges that generated new ways of remythifying the relations between Prospero and Caliban in colonial situations. Césaire’s Caliban suggests some of the important ways in which religion has been linked with anticolonialism in new nationalist movements, transnational connections, and diasporic circulations. Under the slogan, “Uhuru,” anticolonial struggles for liberation in Africa often announced new dreams of redemption. If colonialism was the furnace in which an indigenous nationalism might be forged, religion could provide a template for national redemption, as we find in the motto of Ghanaian liberator, Kwame Nkrumah: “Seek ye first the political kingdom and all other things will be added to you” (adapting Mt 6:33). Adopting the name, “X,” in solidarity with Black Muslims in the United States indicated how a history of colonialism, enslavement, and oppression could be sublated, simultaneously erased and retained in memory, while providing a basis for new forms of interreligious solidarity beyond colonial borders. The Yoruba god Shango, god of storms, who was interpreted by W. E. B. Du Bois as a deity of African political sovereignty, stronger in Africa than the Aryan Thor or the Semitic Jehovah (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2050303213476103">Chidester, 2007</xref>), has circulated widely throughout the Atlantic world, demonstrating diasporic religious creativity as an important legacy of colonialism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2050303213476103">Johnson, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Shakespeare’s enchanted isle in <italic>The Tempest</italic>, an island of indeterminate location in both the Mediterranean and Atlantic worlds, was actually made out of migrations and circulations, exiles and shipwrecks, across oceans. For the study of religion and colonialism, the ocean has become a crucial unit of analysis. Like the fetish in the Atlantic world, which emerged out of mercantile and eventually colonial encounters in West Africa, the cargo in the Pacific world, with all its dream-like riches, has served as an emblem for the creativity and contestation of religion under colonial conditions. As Sugata Bose has proposed, the Indian Ocean is the basic unit of analysis that must be adopted for understanding religion under British colonialism in South Asia. By focusing on the land, scholars have developed revealing insights into the imperial and colonial impact on religion in India. Drawing historically informed generalizations, Partha <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2050303213476103">Chatterjee (1993: 6)</xref> found that the political, public, and material force of British colonization had inspired Hindus to emphasize the “inner” or “spiritual domain” of their religion, whereas Gauri <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2050303213476103">Viswanathan (1995: 185–186)</xref> has argued that the British colonial administration entrenched a legislated social identity for religion that for Hindus diminished the importance of private religious belief or experience. Both of these generalizations, apparently contradictory, might both be true. Under colonial conditions, Hindus worked out new spiritual aspirations and social allegiances. However, perhaps too much weight has been given to the spirit of empire and the social engineering of colonialism. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2050303213476103">Bose (2009: 270)</xref> has argued, before the arrival of the British the Indian Ocean had long been a region of “multiple and competing universalisms.” Not simply a confrontation between a universalizing Christian civilization and local traditions, the colonial encounter introduced another universalism into the mix of religious discourses, practices, and associations. Beyond imperial control, religious life under colonial conditions circulated in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>As critical research on religion, the study of religion and colonialism might be nothing more nor less than the study of religion. After all, as Raymond Williams noted, the keyword, “culture,” from the Latin root <italic>colere</italic>, is etymologically linked with <italic>colonus</italic> and <italic>cult</italic>, with inhabiting a colony and honoring with worship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2050303213476103">Williams, 1985</xref>: 87). Culture, religion, and colonization, therefore, might be aspects of the same mix. That configuration might run deep in human prehistory, perhaps appearing as early as <italic>homo sapiens</italic> confronting Neanderthals in Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2050303213476103">Lewis-Williams, 2002</xref>), but it is definitely central to European claims on the imperial heritage of ancient Rome. In one of Shakespeare’s principal sources, <italic>The Aeneid</italic>, the Roman gods are honored by the “great-souled” Aeneas because he will “crush wild peoples and set up laws for men and build walls” (I.63–64). Overseen and underwritten by religion, colonization has often been exacted upon “wild peoples” but also undermined by indigenous renegotiations of alien impositions. In the colonial contact zones between imperial ambitions and indigenous responses, religious creativity has been generated out of the “long conversation” between colonizers and colonized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2050303213476103">Comaroff and Comaroff, 1991</xref>), the reevaluation of agency, words, and things in colonial exchanges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2050303213476103">Keane, 2007</xref>), and the many ways in which people have found to be modern in a world that includes gods and spirits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2050303213476103">Chakrabarty, 2007 [2000]</xref>: 12–16). Attending to asymmetrical power relations, research on religion and colonialism has been a fertile field for linking meaning and power, not by reducing meaning to structures of domination, but by analyzing meaning in networks, webs, or arteries of circulation, on land and at sea, in which religious discourses, practices, and associations have been both enabling and disabling. As a colonial term, the very word, “religion,” must also be a focus of critical research, interrogating the term’s colonial productions and deployments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2050303213476103">Chidester, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2050303213476103">King, 1999</xref>) against the background of its imperial aspirations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2050303213476103">Chidester, forthcoming</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2050303213476103">Masuzawa, 2005</xref>). But we also can attend to the many different ways in which indigenous people in colonial situations have made something out of the keyword <italic>religion</italic> for their own intellectual, social, and political projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2050303213476103">Chidester, 2013</xref>). At the very least, such critical investigation of religion will depart from the stadial theory of human progress from savagery to civilization enacted in the opening ceremony of the London Olympics and the implicit opposition between the sub-human savagery of Caliban and the human civilization of Prospero, Brunel, and Churchill. By “depart,” here, I mean to reject, but I also mean to return to these theories of structural opposition and temporal progression as points of departure for critical analysis in the study of religion.</p>
