<p>This section of the journal contains news and notes (N&amp;N) from the above associations. Each association sends its N&amp;N when it has news to convey. The N&amp;N usually contain information about the association’s development (such as a new board), recent or upcoming conferences, other activities (such as workshops), and contact details.</p>
<p>Until this issue, the N&amp;N have appeared more or less every issue, that is, six times a year. However, the number of N&amp;N received from the various associations has dwindled over the last couple of years. Therefore, the last issues of 2012 will contain no N&amp;N, except for contact details for each of the associations. Instead, associations will be asked to send a yearly mini-report for the last year with highlights for the upcoming year. This is scheduled to appear in the first issue of 2013 – Vol 44, N° 1.</p>

<p>In Japan, today’s serious-games movement, especially the use of digital games, has been drawing attention in the education field. Additionally, analog games have also markedly risen in popularity. One example of this is the revival of the traditional games GO and SHOGI. Although these are abstract games that do not attempt to teach specific content (e.g., environmental problems or communication skills), they have received a relatively positive reception by elementary schools. The reason for this may be two-fold. First, their abstract quality is believed to improve children’s cognitive skills, especially abstract thinking. Second, although the term game is associated with fun and is therefore negatively perceived by schools, traditional games such as these seldom have such negative associations.</p>
<p>The use of commercial games, whether analog or digital, for serious educational purposes offers two advantages. First, it leads to voluntary and natural learning, as these games are more enjoyable than are most of the games that have been designed solely for educational use. Second, because the games are sold in stores, they are more widely available, leading to increased opportunities to play.</p>
<p>I should also mention a new trend. Commercial game designers, including those who design digital games, have started to teach courses on game design and the use of games for educational purposes in Japanese universities. This may be a step toward the integration of games played for fun with those used for education.</p>
<p>The next national autumn conference is scheduled for October 20 and 21, 2012, at Aoyama Gakuin University, in Tokyo. Please go to our web site for more details - <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jasag.org/">http://www.jasag.org/</ext-link>.</p>

<p>The 4th ThaiSim international conference, Reality and learning in educational games: Looking forward to ASEAN, was held from 19 to 21 April, 2012, at Mahidol University, Kanjanaburi Campus, Thailand. It was a small conference, but efficient and wonderful. We had 32 papers and about 200 participants. Our presenters and participants came from both Thailand and around the world, such as Japan, France, Spain and UK. Some of our presentations were as follows. David Wortley from Immersive Technology Strategies, UK, did his keynote paper on The future of games and learning technologies: Reflecting on our changing relationship with technology, and he also showed us a movie that he had produced by himself in the first hours of the conference. David Crookall, Université de Nice Sophia Antipolis, France, and Rungrawee Samawathdana, Chulalongkorn University, Thailand, conducted their opening keynote presentation entitled: Setting the scene: Hands-on participation in a cross-cultural encounter, which was useful for all teachers. Ryoju Hamada from Tohoku University, Japan and his team presented his game Collaboration between Japanese and Thai Universities to create practical management education by the tangible business game, which demonstrated cooperation between two countries successfully. Amparo García-Carbonell and Frances Watts, Universitat Politècnica de València, Spain, presented their educational game, EMOTIONS AT PLAY, which was very practical because all of their audiences could follow and use it later. We also were lucky to have Hidehiko Kanegae, Ritsumeikan University, Japan, be present via a live, real-time, video conference between Japan and Thailand, to deliver his keynote, entitled How could a simulator integrate reality of policy parameters? All in all, our participants enjoyed the conference and made new friends.</p>
