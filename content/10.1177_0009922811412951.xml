<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Falciparum malaria is one of the most common parasitic diseases causing much morbidity and mortality in the tropics, including India. The spectrum of malaria may range from simple pyrexia to severe complicated forms, including cerebral malaria. Cardiac involvement in malaria is rare and is predominantly limited to the pericardium and conduction system of the heart. Documentation of parasitic antigen in the pericardial fluid confirms the association of malaria and pericardial effusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811412951">1</xref></sup></p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 5-year-old boy, resident of Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh was admitted with history of high-grade fever and incremental pallor over 5 days. The fever was associated with vomiting and single episode of epistaxis. There was no history of any other orificial bleed. There was no neurological obtundation. The urine output was normal.</p>
<p>On examination, the child was febrile with an axillary temperature of 103°F. The pulse rate was 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 30 breaths per minute, and blood pressure was 100/76 mm Hg. He had severe pallor and petechiae were present over the chest and abdomen. Icterus was absent and there was no active bleeding from any site. There were no signs of volume overload.</p>
<p>Hepatomegaly was absent and spleen was palpable 4 cm in the long axis. There were no features suggestive of alteration in sensorium.</p>
<p>Investigations revealed a hemoglobin of 4.5 g%, total leukocyte count of 7700/mm<sup>3</sup>, and platelet count of 45 000/mm<sup>3</sup>. Peripheral smear showed gametocytes and schizonts of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>; rapid malarial antigen test was also positive for <italic>P falciparum</italic>. Renal function tests were normal with blood urea of 22 mg/dL and serum creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL. Random blood glucose was 76 mg%. Liver function tests and blood gas analysis were normal. Coagulation profile revealed an international normalized ratio of 1.2.</p>
<p>The patient was diagnosed to have severe malaria. He was started on intravenous artesunate and supportive therapy was given with oxygen, antipyretics, and intravenous fluids. The child was also transfused with 10 mL/kg of packed red blood cells.</p>
<p>After about 24 hours of initiation of treatment, there was reduction in spikes of fever. However, he continued to have tachycardia and tachypnea with appearance of hepatomegaly (4 cm below the right costal margin). Auscultation revealed a pericardial rub in the apical area. Chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly and chest ultrasonography showed presence of 6 mm fluid in pericardial cavity. Echocardiogram confirmed the presence of pericarditis and electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-T wave depression. Pericardial tap demonstrated clear fluid. Protein was 1.8 gm/dL and sugar was 96 mg/dL on biochemical examination of pericardial fluid. Malarial antigen was positive in the aspirated fluid. Gram stain did not show any organism and pericardial fluid culture was sterile after 48 hours of incubation. Blood culture of the patient was also sterile.</p>
<p>The child was continued on supportive management and intravenous artesunate was continued with continuous vital monitoring. The pericardial rub disappeared over the next 48 hours, with normalization of heart rate and respiratory rate. The liver regressed with concomitant improvement of the pericardial effusion. A repeat echocardiogram was performed, which showed no signs of pericarditis. The electrogardiogram abnormalities also normalized over the duration of illness. Complete resolution of effusion was associated with defervescence.</p>
<p>Antimalarial treatment was completed with 7 days of artesunate. Doxycycline was added and a stat dose of primaquine given in compliance with the antimalarial guidelines of 2010 issued by the World Health Organization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922811412951">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The major complications of severe malaria include cerebral malaria, pulmonary edema, acute renal failure, severe anemia, and/or bleeding. Acidosis and hypoglycemia are the most common metabolic complications. Any of these complications can develop rapidly and progress to death within hours or days. The case fatality of <italic>P falciparum</italic> malaria is approximately 1% and this accounts for 1 to 3 million deaths per year all over the world; 80% of these deaths are caused by cerebral malaria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922811412951">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Cardiac involvement in malaria has not been studied widely. Cardiovascular complications are rarely seen. Involvement of the pericardium and myoelectrical system of the heart is seen if cardiac complications occur. Cardiac tamponade occurring as a complication of <italic>P falciparum</italic> has been reported in a 30-year-old patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811412951">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a prospective study conducted in 22 adult patients suffering from malaria, ECG abnormalities were seen in 5 of the patients and pericardial effusion in 2 of the cohort. These findings were seen to resolve during follow up.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811412951">4</xref></sup> We are not aware of any previous published case in literature reporting this association in pediatric population.</p>
<p>The mechanism of the development of pericardial effusion is not very clear. One possible explanation may be the locally elevated cytokine levels. Day et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922811412951">5</xref></sup> have shown that cytokines produced locally in particular tissue during malarial infection may be regulated by the degree of regional parasitic sequestration. Probably regional sequestration of parasites in pericardium may explain the isolated pericardial effusion in our case. Documentation of parasitic antigen in the pericardial fluid confirms the association of malaria and pericardial effusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811412951">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In our case, demonstration of malarial antigen in ericardial fluid and subsequent disappearance of ericardial effusion with the clinical response to antimalarial treatment were strong pointers to a malarial etiology.</p>
<p>We conclude that development of pericardial effusion may be seen with falciparum malaria. This is crucial, as pericarditis if not diagnosed and managed promptly may be a potentially fatal complication, in what is otherwise a curable disease.</p>
