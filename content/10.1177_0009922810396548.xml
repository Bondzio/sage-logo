<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The number of communication channels has expanded greatly with the advent of new technologies, such as cell phones; however, when patients receive vast amounts of information at high speeds, it is often disconnected from meaning or purpose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922810396548">1</xref></sup> In addition, nearly half of American adults have difficulty comprehending health information,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922810396548">2</xref></sup> which taken out of context, or not fully understood, can be useless or potentially dangerous. This is why it is important for physicians to understand patient health literacy, defined as “a constellation of skills, including the ability to perform basic reading and numerical tasks required to function in the health care environment.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922810396548">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Patients with low health literacy find it more challenging to comprehend and use health information effectively, including following up on medical appointments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922810396548">2</xref></sup> In addition, children of parents with low health literacy are at risk for unmet health care needs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922810396548">4</xref></sup> Due to the complicated nature of the child immunization schedule and the penetration of mobile phones among hard-to-reach populations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922810396548">5</xref></sup> one strategy for improving immunization rates could be text messaging reminders,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922810396548">6</xref></sup> a concept already endorsed by parents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922810396548">7</xref></sup> The purpose of this study was to evaluate physician perceptions of patient health literacy rates as part of a feasibility study for a text messaging intervention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0009922810396548" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A survey was conducted with immunization providers in a single metropolitan area to determine the openness of physicians regarding using text messages for child immunization reminders. Surveys were administered by e-mail, fax, and phone to 149 physicians.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922810396548">8</xref></sup> The institutional review board–approved survey included questions regarding demographics, current communication channels for disseminating information to parents, perceived patient literacy levels, and ability to translate health information into action. Written comments were categorized using emergent coding procedures. Willingness to implement a text messaging system is described by Hart et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922810396548">7</xref></sup></p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Surveys were completed by 102 physicians (68%). The majority were male (60; 64%), White, non-Hispanic (78; 81%), with a mean age of 48 years (SD = 9). Most (60; 64%) reported having been in practice for 10 to 29 years, followed by 30 to 50 years (18; 20%) and 0 to 9 years (15; 16%). Physicians’ specializations were pediatrics (23; 24%) or family medicine (70; 73%). Percentages less than 100% indicate missing data.</p>
<p>Nearly all (94; 92%) physicians communicated immunizations schedules to parents; and 89% (91) reminded parents about their child’s next immunization. Method for communication included verbally during appointments (89; 86%), followed by handout or appointment card (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922810396548">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Respondents (96; 64%) believed the majority of their adult patients, or parents of patients, had adequate health literacy and could complete health-related tasks (ie, follow health care instructions, comprehend medical literature including prescriptions). However, 90% (87) still thought it important to consider the readability level of the handouts/brochures.</p>
<p>To further assess physician perception of patient health literacy regarding immunizations, participants were asked to examine the following statement modified from an FDA handout for parents.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The DTaP vaccine protects against the bacterial infections diphtheria, tetanus (Lockjaw), and pertussis (whooping cough). Tripedia, Infanrix, and DAPTACEL are licensed for use in children 6 weeks to 7 years old. Diphtheria can infect the throat, causing a thick covering that can lead to problems with breathing, paralysis, or heart failure. Tetanus can cause painful tightening of the muscles, seizures, and paralysis. Whooping cough causes severe coughing spells and can lead to pneumonia, seizures, brain damage, and death. Common side effects of the DTaP Vaccine include mild fever, redness, soreness or swelling at the injection site, fussiness, or crying more than usual. Tell your health care provider beforehand if your child is moderately or severely ill, has had a severe reaction to a previous shot, or has a known sensitivity to ingredients of the vaccine, including latex.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Most respondents (94; 96.9%) thought this information was important for parents to know and that the majority of parents could understand the information (69; 71.1%). When asked to further comment on parental comprehension of this information, dominant themes for responses included (<italic>a</italic>) lack of understanding of information, (<italic>b</italic>) use of the Internet for information seeking, and (<italic>c</italic>) additional information needed.</p>
<p>Written responses indicated an overall hesitancy regarding patient ability to understand the information. Several physicians stated, “Terms need to be ‘laymanized’” and “I think it’s all important but lots to read for most people.” Another respondent wrote,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I think there is lack of understanding from this communication regarding the risk/benefit when the immunization is compared to the illness. For instance, none of these patients have seen someone with Diphtheria, Tetanus, or Whooping Cough and do not understand the incredible risk from the disease itself.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Several other comments addressed the need for clarification or expansion of the disease pathology. The use of the Internet for information seeking was also noted. One physician wrote,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>‘Dr Google’ has been a big deterrent to completing or even initiating vaccinations as parents can ‘Google’ the topic and find overwhelmingly scary stories in overwhelming numbers. Now it requires more time to de-educate myths and fears than it does to discuss benefits and schedules.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Additional responses demonstrated the physicians’ opinions that patients “use the Internet and gather whatever information they desire for their own use in regards to their child’s health” and that interested patients “have checked the Internet already.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0009922810396548" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Overall, our results suggest physicians believed the majority of their patients were capable of health literacy–based tasks. In addition, the majority of physicians thought their patients could comprehend the information from the FDA, which is presented at a 12th-grade reading level; this is much higher than the suggested readability level for the general population. However, many written comments indicated physicians are not sure of patient understanding of basic information. Research has shown many people are not capable of health literacy–based tasks,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922810396548">9</xref></sup> suggesting the physician comments are a better reflection of reality than their overall assessments of patient health literacy.</p>
<p>Research continues to suggest that the availability of information on the Internet (regardless of accuracy) has affected physician–patient communication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922810396548">10</xref></sup> Indeed, the Internet continues to provide current information regarding health. However, most patients simply do not have the health literacy skills to critically evaluate and apply the information.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922810396548">2</xref></sup> As stated by respondents for this study, physicians continue to “de-educate myths” during clinical encounters. In a period of expanding communication tools such as the Internet and text messaging, physicians need to have an adequate understanding of patient health literacy in order to appropriately communicate with patients.</p>
<p>This research has several limitations: (<italic>a</italic>) the study sample was from a single Midwestern community; (<italic>b</italic>) sample size, while adequate, may not be generalizable to other geographic regions; and (<italic>c</italic>) the survey instrument was not tested for reliability. However, the questions were assessed by a team of health literacy and communication experts and had high face validity.</p>
<p>In conclusion, most physicians are interested in patient understanding and currently communicate to patients the importance of immunizations. However, the results of this study suggest physicians may not be aware of their patients’ ability to comprehend health information. Parents may need continued reminders or supplemental information (at the appropriate literacy level) after the office visit to remind them to make follow-up appointments. Additionally, physicians may need education on identifying patient health literacy levels and communicating effectively. Health literacy should be addressed when developing interventions to improve physician–patient communication, such as text messaging.</p>
