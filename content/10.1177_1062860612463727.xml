<abstract>
<p>The overarching mission of prehospital emergency medical services (EMS) is to deliver lifesaving care for people when their needs are greatest. Fulfilling this mission is challenged by threats to patient and provider safety. The EMS setting is a high-risk one because care is delivered rapidly in the out-of-hospital setting where resources of benefit to patients are limited. There is growing evidence that safety culture varies widely across EMS agencies. A poor safety culture may manifest as error in medication, back injuries, and other poor outcomes for patient and provider. Recently, federal and national leaders of EMS (ie, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) have made improving EMS safety culture a national priority. Unfortunately, few initiatives can help local EMS leaders achieve that priority. The authors describe the successful EMS Champs Fellowship program, supported by the Jewish Healthcare Foundation, designed to train EMS leaders to improve safety for patients and providers.</p>

<p>Emergency medical services (EMS) is an important provider of out-of-hospital emergency and nonemergent health care. The need or demand for EMS is unplanned, and patients may present with a complex trauma or medical emergencies susceptible to an error or adverse event (AE). Annually, EMS will see 36 million patients and transport 28 million to a hospital or other facility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1062860612463727">1</xref></sup> Every minute in the United States, paramedics and emergency medical technicians (EMTs) transport 35 patients to the emergency department.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1062860612463727">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The magnitude of errors and AEs in EMS is unknown, and the causes of errors are poorly understood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1062860612463727">3</xref></sup> Some commonly identified errors and AEs include the following: poor management of patient airways,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1062860612463727">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1062860612463727"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1062860612463727">6</xref></sup> unspecified deviation from protocol,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1062860612463727">7</xref></sup> medication errors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1062860612463727">8</xref></sup> mishandling of patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1062860612463727">9</xref></sup> extended pauses during cardiac resuscitation (ie, not pushing on the chest during cardiopulmonary resuscitation),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1062860612463727">10</xref></sup> and failure to manage pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1062860612463727">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Paramedics and EMTs are at increased risk of poor safety outcomes. One study calculated that the incidence of occupational fatality among EMS workers is 2.5 times greater than for the general working public.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1062860612463727">11</xref></sup> Sprains and strains related to lifting and moving patients are common and a leading cause of injury in EMS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1062860612463727">12</xref></sup> Paramedics and EMTs are often exposed to blood and blood-borne pathogens,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1062860612463727">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1062860612463727">14</xref></sup> and reports of violence against EMS workers is increasing, posing safety risks for patients and providers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1062860612463727">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1062860612463727">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Poor teamwork behaviors have been linked to negative patient outcomes in a variety of health care settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1062860612463727">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1062860612463727"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1062860612463727"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1062860612463727">20</xref></sup> Teamwork is vitally important for EMS where the delivery of care is based on teams of 2 (a dyad) outside of the hospital. Partners must work well together under pressure to recognize threats and overcome obstacles while separated from clinician colleagues such as physicians, respiratory technicians, nurses, and other providers with an expanded scope of practice. Unfortunately, there is evidence that not all EMS dyads work well together. Paramedics and EMTs can be judgmental of their teammate’s integrity, patient empathy, and skills.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1062860612463727">21</xref></sup> Many fail to develop positive teamwork behaviors such as trust, backup behavior, and closed-loop communication because of an inability to maintain the dyad as a result of absences, sick leave, and turnover. The average EMS worker accumulates more than 19 different partners annually, with some having more than 50 different partners in 1 year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1062860612463727">22</xref></sup> Lack of familiarity between EMS clinician partners may lead to poor team performance and poorer safety outcomes for patient and provider.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1062860612463727">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1062860612463727">24</xref></sup> Additional threats to safety that have received limited attention include the common lack of exposure that paramedics and EMTs have to their assigned medical control physician,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1062860612463727">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1062860612463727">26</xref></sup> lack of highly trained EMS leaders, poor sleep, fatigue,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1062860612463727">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1062860612463727">28</xref></sup> and ambulance crashes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1062860612463727">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Efforts to address these threats and safety in EMS in general have been limited. The EMS industry is a decade behind the rest of medicine and health care in taking action against preventable error and AEs. Outside of EMS, many efforts to improve safety begin with improving an understanding of safety culture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1062860612463727">30</xref></sup> An association between safety culture and poor safety outcomes was recently identified in a sample of EMS agencies, as was wide variation in safety culture scores across EMS agencies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1062860612463727">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1062860612463727"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1062860612463727">33</xref></sup> In response, several organizations have supported efforts to improve EMS patient and provider safety. In 2010, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Office of EMS contracted with the American College of Emergency Physicians to embark on a 3-year project to develop a national strategy to improve EMS safety culture nationwide (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.EMScultureofsafety.org">www.EMScultureofsafety.org</ext-link>). In that same year, the Jewish Healthcare Foundation (JHF) funded 18 paramedics, emergency physicians, and prehospital registered nurses to complete a 12-month fellowship program designed to teach, guide, and support champions for safety improvement in EMS. In this article, the authors describe the JHF EMS Safety/Quality Champions (JHF EMS Champs) Fellowship, highlight the curriculum, and summarize lessons learned from this experience in engaging EMS leaders in other communities for safety improvement.</p>
<sec id="section1-1062860612463727">
<title>The JHF EMS Champs Fellowship Program</title>
<p>The JHF is a public charity supporting research, education, and a grant program that aims to advance the safety and quality of clinical care and the health of populations. To accomplish these aims, the JHF created the Pittsburgh Regional Health Initiative in 1998, Health Careers Futures in 2003, and the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform in 2008. The JHF is also a founding member of the Network for Regional Healthcare Improvement, an organization that aims to improve the value and lower the cost of health care through the support of regional collaboratives.</p>
<p>In 2001, the JHF developed a program to support the education and training of emerging leaders in health care. Known as the JHF Health Sciences Fellowship Program, it was designed to fill gaps in professional training and help prepare trainees to reform the way care is delivered through an intensive exposure to problems and barriers identified in the literature and by leaders in medicine. The JHF wanted the program to provide trainees with tools and resources to solve problems identified at the local level by the trainees in their respective units, floors, departments, or organizations. The JHF program has since grown into 2 separate fellowship tracks, known now as the Patient Safety Fellowship and the Jonas Salk Fellowship.</p>
<p>The JHF has established numerous partnerships to grow and improve its fellowships. Partnerships have been established with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the National Library of Medicine, the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, and other foundations. The partnerships have facilitated growth in JHF programs and affected care through continued training and education of clinicians of all types and roles as well as nonclinicians. Over time, the JHF has established new programs specific to the needs and unique roles of different clinicians and other health care personnel. These programs include the Nurse Navigators program, the Physician Champions program, the Librarian Fellowship program, and the Pharmacy Agents for Change program.</p>
<p>As previously described, the EMS setting is high risk and high reward for patients and providers. Staff at the JHF acknowledged the presence of risks in the EMS setting, including a great deal of uncertainty, stress, and other threats to patient and provider safety. Staff recognized the rewards, including the safe delivery of the critically ill or injured patient. The JHF EMS Champs Fellowship program was born through a series of meetings between JHF and EMS leaders in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Pittsburgh area is home to more than 50 individual EMS companies; a leading authority in EMS education and training, the Center for Emergency Medicine; and the University of Pittsburgh’s School of Medicine Department of Emergency Medicine, a national leader in research on safety in the EMS environment. The program fellowship was created after leaders from EMS and the JHF recognized a lack of any known program for training EMS leaders and clinicians and equipping these leaders with the tools and resources to improve safety and quality of care. Leaders agreed that the program’s creation was needed, given the scope of EMS in the United States and its impact on 36 million patients annually.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1062860612463727">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The curriculum for the JHF EMS Champs Fellowship includes training fellows in Perfecting Patient Care (PPC), a course developed by the JHF for process improvement in health care. Program parameters were inspired by the work of W. Edwards Deming, an American engineer and mathematician recognized for improving manufacturing in Japan following World War II. Deming’s principles were applied to the Toyota Production System and later to the popular Lean methodology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1062860612463727">34</xref></sup> The JHF EMS Champs Fellowship includes seminars that highlight principles adapted from Lean, including entrusting frontline personnel to solve problems, improve quality, reduce costs, and create a culture of support.</p>
<p>Fellowship staff felt that the PPC method was ideal for EMS fellows because it would assist trainees in addressing problems prevalent in high-risk settings where systems of care are not well defined, lack standardization, are potentially rife with work-arounds and deviations from protocol, and experience high employee turnover. Key characteristics of the PPC method implemented in the fellowship include short training and education sessions on how to define, identify, and apply techniques in the following:</p>

<list-item><p>Respect for employees through ensuring they have what they need when they need it in order to succeed</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Teamwork</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The PPC method emphasizes identification and elimination of errors, inefficiency, and waste in complex systems through process improvement and standardization. Instructors emphasize that all processes must consider the needs, wants, and safety of the customer (ie, the patient). The EMS frontline clinicians are encouraged to work in clinical teams, apply problem solving, and aim to engage coworkers in quality improvement research and process improvement at the front line. Furthermore, the PPC method and instruction places great importance on sharing discoveries with colleagues and gaining buy-in from organizational leadership to ensure that they take responsibility for supporting these efforts for the long term.</p>
<p>The EMS fellows received PPC training via a unique and dynamic online resource known as Tomorrow’s HealthCare (THC). The resource provides online education and training, a document warehouse/library, and a forum for sharing experiences and stories. The THC resource provided flexibility for trainees who often were too busy to attend multiple face-to-face meetings during the fellowship. Each fellow was provided access to THC, which allowed for drawing “process maps” and annotating the maps with known or suspected threats to safety or quality outcomes. Fellows were instructed via telephone, online chats, message boards, and in face-to-face meetings to apply these process maps. In this context, apply refers to instructing fellows to be meticulous in their approach to addressing the safety issues. Specifically, fellows were instructed to use their process maps as an aid in (1) affirming the existing practices and activities outlined in process maps that may inhibit or threaten safety and (2) identifying potential solutions. The key benefit of THC was enabling fellows to lead development of improvement programs tailored to threats and rewards unique to the fellow’s organization.</p>
<p>Using tools learned from PPC training, fellows proposed a variety of projects on which they subsequently worked in teams (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1062860612463727">Table 1</xref>). Fellows were instructed to focus their projects on a fellow-identified problem from within their organization that compromised the safety or quality of patient care or worker health and safety. Fellows began by developing process maps with annotation, including known or suspected threats to creating a safe environment for patients and providers. Program leaders instructed fellows to use these process maps as a guide for their work and a method/tool to evaluate progress. The projects chosen by fellows varied and addressed both patient and provider safety. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1062860612463727">Figure 1</xref> for a sample process map developed by fellows as initial steps for addressing safety within their respective organizations. The map highlights the mental step-by-step processes and thinking of fellows while problem solving.</p>

<title>Lessons Learned</title>
<p>The overarching goal of the JHF EMS Champs Fellowship program was to educate, train, and foster a cadre of safety-conscious EMS professionals. The fellowship’s leadership felt training frontline EMS professionals was ideal and may provide the desired impact in EMS agencies: improving safety culture. This approach was not without its challenges.</p>
<p>First, officials met numerous challenges with training fellows in PPC using the THC online resource. Overall use of the online THC resource was limited, which was attributed to the THC resource being in its infancy. Even though the tool was new, the JHF EMS Champs maximized opportunities to populate the EMS Community with appropriate wide-ranging EMS safety and quality content. This content survives the fellowship and will benefit a larger audience of EMS providers moving forward. The program may be improved with further testing and adjustment following an evaluation of its use in other cohorts.</p>
<p>Second, fellows met several challenges while attempting to identify and define problems germane to safety within their organizations. In most cases, fellows were attempting to address a problem that was considered “too big and too complicated.” These improvement opportunities are often referred to as “world peace” problems. For example, 2 fellows sought to improve teamwork throughout their organization. Fellows were frustrated with the lack of research conducted in EMS on the topic of teamwork. They were disappointed with the absence of a prescription, lessons learned, or best practices for improving teamwork for EMS clinicians within EMS organizations. Fellows perceived this lack of research specific to EMS as a barrier to moving forward. Solutions for these fellows were identified through multiple sessions with coaches and fellowship officials. Coaches instructed the fellows to “take a step back” and recognize that their frustration was part of the learning process. Fellows and coaches worked together to identify a feasible solution that could be accomplished during the 1-year fellowship program. Coaches emphasized that a key goal of the fellowship was to instill and support the fellows’ motivation to make improvements and become actors of change within their organizations.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, the fellows praised the face-to-face interactions described as helpful toward reinforcing key concepts and as beneficial for clarifying next steps. Fellows indicated a desire to have more face-to-face meetings but recognized the time constraints for all as a limiting factor.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Prior to the JHF EMS Champs Fellowship program, the RAND corporation provided a third-party evaluation of the JHF Champions program and PPC training and concluded that fellows trained as JHF champions achieved a higher level of quality improvement success than individuals in similar positions who did not receive this training. Their evaluation was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and included structured interviews with PPC fellows from 30 organizations. RAND investigators used a standardized process to code respondent interview data and quantified dosage of participant PPC training and organizational progress post fellowship. Findings showed variation in training opportunities, with some fellows receiving additional training and coaching post fellowship from within their respective organizations. Organizations with multiple fellows experienced a greater number of projects initiated and completed than organizations with fewer fellow trainees. Qualitative findings from the fellows interviewed highlight trainees crediting their fellowship with providing them a framework for developing, testing, implementing, and completing quality and safety programs. The RAND study concluded that training alone did not equip a fellow with the expertise needed to lead and complete an organizational quality and safety program. Training combined with coaching assisted fellows to overcome obstacles and acquire the skills, knowledge, and introductory level of expertise needed to support fellow-driven pursuits of improving quality and safety. A future evaluation focused on the JHF EMS Champs Fellowship program is needed to determine if similar successes are achievable in this unique population of health care workers.</p>
<p>The JHF Champions program is not the first to train clinicians and nonclinicians to be leaders and advocates of safety and quality in health care organizations. Since 2002, the Health Research &amp; Educational Trust (HRET) has supported training and education of new leaders in safety and quality. The HRET Patient Safety Leadership Program is supported by numerous safety-focused organizations, including the National Patient Safety Foundation. The Emergency Medicine Patient Safety Foundation is but 1 foundation that provides financial support for emergency medicine clinicians to attend the HRET program and become leaders in safety.</p>
<p>Like the HRET program, the JHF Champions program aims to improve the delivery of health care to be safer and of higher quality through training and education of health care’s next generation of leaders. The JHF Champions program is unique in that it is the first to provide targeted support and training to a cohort of EMS clinicians. The JHF EMS Champs Fellowship program may serve as a model for other foundations across the United States that seek to improve the quality and safety of prehospital EMS care.</p>
