<abstract>
<p>This article reflects on the place of technology in the ethnography of global manufacturing and puts relationships with tools and machines back into debates about the production of gender in transnational labour processes. Much ethnography of the global factory, I argue, has over-determined or underexplored worker engagements with their immediate material environment, with implications for the role of technology in the production of gendered persons and selves. This article outlines a different approach, derived from theories of technology as performance or technique, to explore the relationship between Telugu masculinity and machines on the floor of a large diamond factory in one of India’s special economic zones. In doing so it opens new dialogue between the ethnography of work and labour and the social study of technology.</p>

<body>
<p>Over the past 30 years rapid export-led industrialization in Asia and Latin America has led ethnographers to conceptualize particular kinds of links between gender and technology in the global factory. Considerable attention has been focused on the apparatus of modern manufacturing as it has been transposed to new locations andthe effects of assembly line technology on new workers, particularly women. Ibegin this article by re-reading several influential ethnographies and arguing that the relationship between technology and gender has remained under-explored. In some accounts the relationship has been framed by a theory of technology as power or ideology. In others technology has remained a static part of the global factory's material environment, external to that assemblage of relationships through which persons, selves and subjects are produced. At stake in this discussion is the way we understand the materiality of global workspaces and I ask what might be gained from social and anthropological theories of technology as performance and technique for understanding the transformation of gendered persons and social relationships.</p>
<p>In the second half of the article I explore these ideas through my own ethnographic fieldwork at a European-owned factory in India that mass-manufactures small, round consumer diamonds for a global clientele. In 2005 I spent 12 months being trained to perform minute, specific, cutting and polishing tasks on the factory'sproduction line and I use my participation in the labour process as a method of interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1466138111410621">Stoller, 2005</xref>). As I discovered, to become proficient at a single repetitive manual task was to acquire a technological intimacy with tools and machines, a kind of ‘carnal knowledge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1466138111410621">Wacquant, 2005</xref>) or ‘material consciousness' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1466138111410621">Sennett, 2008</xref>). Just as the young Telugu men who were employed here performed their masculinity through embodied and perceptual relationships to an array of diamond cutting equipment, so too their performances reconstituted old tools and machines as technologies of contemporary global manufacturing.</p>
<sec id="sec1-1466138111410621"><title>Theories of technology and technique in the global factory</title>
<p>Ethnographic accounts of technology in the global factory remain rooted in Marxist debates about the labour process. In these debates technology materializes the interests of capital, with technological decisions and innovations driven by struggles between capitalists to remain competitive by keeping labour costs low and increasing controls over the labour process. This analysis has been underpinned by a critical narrative of capitalist modernity as the alienation of conceptual knowledge from the practical dexterity required to make things, and the reduction of work to a technical instrumentality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1466138111410621">Braverman, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1466138111410621">Carrier, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1466138111410621">Herzfeld, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1466138111410621">Sennett, 2008</xref>). InHarry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1466138111410621">Braverman's (1974)</xref> classic account, the combination of scientific management and Fordist models of industrial organization left the modern labourer with nothing but a specific dexterity, ‘a reinterpreted and woefully inadequate concept of skill, ‘‘speed as skill’’, etc.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1466138111410621">Braverman, 1974</xref>: 443).</p>
<p>As transnational capital harnessed new generations of women workers to Fordist assembly lines, feminist scholars established a corrective to these debates by showing that labour processes were not independent of gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1466138111410621">Marchand and Runyan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1466138111410621">Nash and Fernandez-Kelly, 1983</xref>). Their analyses of the new international division of labour drew on feminist theories of technology that showed tools and machines to materialize gendered social relations and reproduce gender ideologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1466138111410621">Cockburn, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1466138111410621">1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1466138111410621">Wajcman, 2000</xref>). These accounts made industrial technology in transnational labour processes synonymous with imperialism and patriarchy. The global factory became a site in which first world technology was imposed upon the third world woman, colonizing her working body, and in which the assembly line was revealed as a source of male authority and power (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1466138111410621">Peña, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Aihwa Ong's (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1466138111410621">1987a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1466138111410621">1987b</xref>) ethnography of microelectronics factories in Malaysia's export-manufacturing zones made a seminal contribution to this literature. Ong saw her approach to gender and technology as a corrective to more functionalist accounts (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1466138111410621">Lim, 1983</xref>) in which machines subordinated an essentialized category ‘women’ to the interests of transnational capital. Drawing variously from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1466138111410621">Foucault (1977)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1466138111410621">Haraway (1987)</xref>, Ong showed how manufacturing technology in Malaysia's new factories re-ordered and reconstituted Malay women in novel ways. The microelectronics assembly line, she argued, exerted material and symbolic control over women by ‘disassembling’ and ‘reassembling’ gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1466138111410621">Ong, 1987b: 621</xref>). The minute division of work into a sequence of repetitive tasks and the construction of these tasks as inherently suited to female workers, Ong argued, recoded the Malay woman not only by making her an extension, adjunct or appendage of the machine but also by transforming gendered subjectivities, hierarchies and meanings. In Ong's ethnography a dominant recoding was always contested and technology becomes both a vehicle of power and an object of resistance. On the factory floor workers jammed machines and were subjected to spirit attacks that Ong described as a ‘language of protest’, ‘expressions of both fear and resistance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1466138111410621">Ong, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Pun <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1466138111410621">Ngai's first-person account (2005)</xref> of assembly line work producing microelectronic components for consumer navigation systems in China's Shenzhen economic zone echoes Ong's account. Ngai describes China's global factories as disciplinary machines that are designed to transform workers into ‘bodies without minds’, ‘mindless bodies’ (p. 83). Pinned down by the assembly line in a fixed location to complete a single, specific task, she writes, the body of the Chinese <italic>dagonmei</italic> (migrant worker) becomes ‘a cog in the machine’, a tool or object through which the capitalist extends their agency. All the individual has to do, she writes, is to follow a sequence of instructions with precision. ‘If one were attentive and disciplined enough, one needed only to mechanically repeat specific body movements’ (pp.82–3). Of course, this production machine also has its fault lines. Where there is power, Ngai writes, there is room for escape, defiance and transgression, and she documents how women synchronize silent slow-downs and coordinate bouts of ‘collective illness’ when the assembly line speed is set too high (pp. 92–3).</p>
<p>What these ethnographies have in common, as critics once argued of Marxist and feminist accounts of the labour process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1466138111410621">Pfaffenberger, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1466138111410621">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1466138111410621">Wacjman, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1466138111410621">2010</xref>), is a theory of technology as power, causal, one-way and deterministic. Even as they emphasize workers’ agency and resistance to capitalist discipline, both ethnographies essentialize technology as a relatively stable external force. They show assembly line technology to embody a set of ethics, interests and values that remain independent of a worker's interaction and engagement with them. The knowledge required to engage with tools and machines appears to reside within them, as a set of a priori rules or scripts that preconfigure the body's movements. To labour means to accept these rules or oppose them, to acquiesce or resist. In both cases resistance is formulated <italic>in spite of</italic> and not <italic>through</italic> technology: acts of resistance all involve cutting, limiting or severing ties with tools and machines, either by turning them off, slowing them down, or walking away from them. In accounts like these, technology remains materially and symbolically unchanged through use.</p>
<p>Within science and technology studies scholars also recognized that class and gender are written into or inscribed in technology, but they conceived of technology as far more indeterminate and contingent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1466138111410621">Akrich, 1992</xref>; Bijker and Law, 1989; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1466138111410621">Bijker and Pinch, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1466138111410621">Cockburn, 1994</xref>). Here, when users interact with a pre-inscribed technological artefact they challenge and renegotiate its meanings and materiality, adapting or domesticating it for use, and opening the way to divergent interpretations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1466138111410621">Bray, 2007</xref>; Wacjman, 2000). What is meant by technology here is always understood as a process or activity – material objects are unstable and incomplete, never given or finished, but always being made, brought into being through use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1466138111410621">Dobres and Hoffman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1466138111410621">Naji, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Just as social studies of technology understand that material artefacts, instruments and devices are to be transformed through use, so too they recognize that the body, person, and social relationships of users are changed through their relationships to technology. Within this field scholars have drawn on Judith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1466138111410621">Butler's (1990)</xref> notion of gender as performance to explore how masculinities and femininities are made and achieved through technology. In Butler's terms gender is always a doing and the gendered subject does not pre-exist the deed (p. 25), a formulation that feminist theories of technology have applied to the constant relationship of gendered subjects with technological devices, artefacts and objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1466138111410621">Wacjman, 1991</xref>). If gender can be said to be constituted only through its expression or performance, so too can technology. For things to work, they must perform, and this performance requires both material and human elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1466138111410621">Law and Singleton, 2000</xref>). In this light, scholars have re-conceptualized the relationship between gender and technology as a dynamic or dialectic one of ‘mutual shaping’ or co-production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1466138111410621">Bray, 2007</xref>; Cockburn and Ormrod, 2003; Wacjman, 2000, 2010). Where femininities and masculinities acquire their meaning and character in relationship to technology, so too technology is gendered and configured through use.</p>
<p>Although global factory ethnography always reminds us that labourers are also users, actively engaged with the material and symbolic dimensions of their tools and machines, few ethnographers have entered into dialogue with debates within the social study of technology. As ethnographers have presented ever more nuanced analyses of the production of gender in global labour processes, technology seems to have faded from view. In her comparative study of <italic>maquiladora</italic> factories on the US–Mexico border, Leslie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1466138111410621">Salzinger (2003)</xref> has shown how diverse meanings of femininity and masculinity are shaped on the shop floor – both through the coding, labelling and naming of spaces, bodies, tools and tasks, and through the shifting, dynamic relationships between co-workers and managers. In many ways, however,her account of the labour process remains hedged around the materiality of the shop floor. As they manufacture hospital garments, televisions and wire automobile harnesses, the Mexican women and men in her shop floor studies are constantly engaging with artefacts. Salzinger pays close attention to the ways that these things are spoken about, framed, and signified. However, workers’ physical, sensory engagement with and embodied practical knowledge of their tools, machines, and materials do not become part of the ‘relational process’ (p. 20) through which gendered persons and selves are produced.</p>
<p>In other accounts technology falls further out of the spotlight. In studies of Sri Lanka's global garment factories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1466138111410621">Hewamanne, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1466138111410621">Lynch, 2007</xref>), for example, sewing machines remain a static part of an industrial backdrop, warranting a brief description before becoming props around which gendered identities are performed. Meanwhile, in her comparative study of export manufacturing units in south China, Ching Kwan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1466138111410621">Lee (1998)</xref> suggests that questions about technology may be relevant in male dominated workspaces where workers celebrate their technical mastery and prowess but less significant for understanding experiences and subjectivities in female dominated workspaces (p. 25). So, as she explores the ways that family and kinship relationships shape the subjective and consensual experience of work for young Chinese women, she leaves technology out of the equation altogether.</p>
<p>If ethnographers have rarely explored embodied relationships to technology in the global factory perhaps it is because the body of the global factory worker is rarely conceived of as a ‘sentient, practising, tool wielding body’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1466138111410621">Marchand, 2010</xref>: 2). As the anthropologist Tim <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1466138111410621">Ingold (2000)</xref> has argued, Marxist narratives of alienation and deskilling have done much to eclipse the embodied, sensory, perceptual character of labour in contemporary industrial workspaces. To imagine that acts of making can be reduced to technical execution, Ingold has written, is to reproduce a mechanistic, cognitivist, logocentric paradigm that separates knowledge from practice, and separates work from the context of sensory experience (ibid, p. 318). Within industrial sociology scholars have frequently sought out a more phenomenological perspective on the labour process that is not premised on the alienation of body from mind, and Ingold's arguments have recently given these calls fresh impetus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1466138111410621">Hockey and Allen-Collinson, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In his writings on material culture and skill, Ingold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1466138111410621">1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1466138111410621">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1466138111410621">2001</xref>) draws from a francophone anthropology of technology. In this tradition technology is a conjuncture of material artefacts and instruments with senses, feelings, gestures and movements, or what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1466138111410621">Marcel Mauss (1973</xref> [1936]) called ‘techniques of the body’. Following in this vein, Ingold urges us to see technology as a perceptual, embodied and knowing engagement with the material environment and to see agency, design, and intentionality as immanent in acts of use and making, irrespective of the ways in which that process is being directed, controlled or managed. Ingold's writing pushes us to see that even the most mundane assembly line tasks are never a sequence of identical, rule-governed movements or mechanical motions. Instead, each repetition demands to be understood as a constantly attentive, perceptual engagement with the material environment involving qualities of care, judgement and dexterity. Whatever the assembly line worker does <italic>to</italic> things, as Ingold might put it, they ‘feel as they work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1466138111410621">Ingold, 2001</xref>: 21).</p>
<p>Of course, the body's acquisition of techniques also takes place in complex, social learning environments. The specialized division of labour that characterizes large-scale modern manufacturing also creates ‘communities of practice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1466138111410621">Lave and Wenger, 1991</xref>) who share tasks and tools in common. A growing body of anthropological literature on apprenticeship reminds us that, within these communities, skills or techniques for using tools and machines are transmitted through physical display and demonstration, observation, imitation and mimesis as much as direct experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1466138111410621">Coy, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1466138111410621">Marchand, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1466138111410621">Wacquant, 2004</xref>). These embodied modes of learning are never only technical in content and studies of apprenticeship in diverse craft contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1466138111410621">Naji, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1466138111410621">O’Connor, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1466138111410621">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1466138111410621">Venkatesan, 2010</xref>) offer ethnographers of the global factory important cues for exploring how novice workers acquire normative values, ethics and ideologies of work at the same time as they acquire a practical know-how (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1466138111410621">Prentice, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In the remainder of this article I draw on the arguments and literature sketched out above to interpret my own ethnographic fieldwork at a subcontracting plant for the global diamond industry in south India. The factory in question employed a large number of young Telugu men, who celebrated their knowledge and technical mastery of tools and machines as socially and culturally desirable. Placing their experiences in the wider context of education and unemployment, I show how intimate relationships with technology were central to the production and performance of gender here, in ways that transformed and shaped the labour process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1466138111410621"><title>Worldwide Diamonds</title>
<p>The popular image of a diamond that has been cut and polished by a single craftsman is little more than a marketing myth. Today's consumer diamonds are mass-produced on an industrial scale, the majority of them in India. In 2008, before the global financial crisis led to a crash in world markets for consumer diamonds, an estimated 1.3 million people were employed in India to cut and polish what was, in terms of volume, 92 percent of all diamonds traded on world markets. Over the past 20 years diamond manufacturing in India has gradually been scaled up, with large factories replacing small workshops and competition between diamond traders leading to the increased application of Taylorist management principals and Fordist models of industrial organization. Attracted by prodigious tax exemptions on imported raw materials, diamond manufacturers have become prominent investors in India's new economic zones. There are currently more than 400 planned and operational zones across India, and between 2002 and 2007 gem and jewellery production inside them grew faster than textiles, garments and micro-electronic components. Diamond manufacturing work in this offshore economy is invariably low-waged and labour-intensive, casual and insecure, vulnerable to the vicissitudes of the market and to social divisions of labour based on gender, caste and class.</p>
<p>In 1997 a consortium of European diamond industrialists opened a new factory inside an economic zone in the Telugu speaking, south Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. Their new factory, Worldwide Diamonds, was to be a classic subcontractor, offering low cost cutting and polishing services to European and North American clients. By the millennium it had undercut all of its major competitors to become one of the world's leading low cost, high volume producers of small sized, medium-quality diamonds. In 2000 Worldwide Diamonds’ success saw one of its former clients, an Israeli company, establish their own factory in the same zone, and these investors turned a provincial corner of India with no indigenous tradition of gemstone cutting or polishing into a hub for the global diamond industry. The two companies recruited high caste graduate students from urban engineering campuses as managers and hired young men and women predominantly from scheduled and backward caste communities to cut and polish diamonds. By 2005 they employed some 2500 people, three-quarters of them young Telugu men, and they manufactured 28,000 carats of consumer diamonds each month, with an export value of approximately $8 million.</p>
<p>In December 2004 I put on a tie, walked into Worldwide Diamonds and asked to speak to the factory's general manager. Enrolled on a doctoral programme in anthropology at a British university, I had developed a research project that set out to explore the social politics of work in India's new economic zones from the inside. Looking to emulate a long tradition in industrial ethnography, this was the moment I hoped to gain access to the global shop floor as a participant observer. Myresearch project had been conceived with this particular factory in mind. In 2002 the intimidation of labour organizers here had led to the factory being investigated by the UN's International Labour Organization and, as I saw it, Worldwide Diamonds offered one a unique window onto the emergent politics of work in India's offshore economy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1466138111410621"><title>Technology as an intermediary</title>
<p>Ushered into an air-conditioned office, I was introduced to the factory's general manager, a Scotsman who was one of four Europeans employed here as senior executives. I presented a letter of introduction from a professor at a local Indian university, handed over a proposal that explained my research in cautious terms as astudy of ‘workplace culture’ and explained my methodological interest in becoming an unpaid participant in the factory's work processes. To my considerable surprise he was amenable to my request and, after checking my references, agreed that Icould begin work in one of the factory's manufacturing departments. I was given acarte blanche, with no requests for anonymity and no limits on my research. Like the early pioneers of industrial ethnography, the general manager imagined that having a social scientist around would have a positive effect on the factory's dynamics.‘It’ll be like having a shrink on site,’ he told me. What soon began as a provisional arrangement for three months was gradually extended to 12 and over the next year, for as many six-day weeks as I could muster, I joined more than 600 people as they arrived at Worldwide Diamonds’ entrance for the 6 a.m. A shift and left with them as another 600 people arrived for the 2 p.m. B shift.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly perhaps, for a white boy in a factory that was owned and operated by a coterie of white Europeans, when I first arrived on the shop floor many workers assumed that I had been sent there as a spy rather than a shrink. I had naively assumed it would be easy to differentiate myself from its middle-aged executives. Iwas in the same age group as the factory's majority workforce, I spoke good Telugu, and I took great care to explain my intentions as an anthropologist. Inevitably, however, some of my early interactions were awkward and uncomfortable, suspicious and unfriendly.</p>
<p>As participatory factory ethnographies often implicitly demonstrate, it is with increased technical competence that both novice and researcher alike establish rapport, respect, trust, friendship, solidarity and complicity with their co-workers and informants. Relationships between people in the industrial workplace are frequently negotiated through relationships with technology. So too my commitment to becoming part of the labour process transformed my relationships with the young men around me. With technological intimacy, competency and expertise came a social intimacy that did much to dispel the rumours and assumptions about my presence here and, as I became a competent participant in work groups on the factory floor, so too I became a participant in people's lives off it. As I discovered, in a factory where workers are defined by their specialized knowledge of tasks, tools and materials, technology can be an important intermediary.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1466138111410621"><title>A technical education</title>
<p>Three weeks after my original meeting, in early January 2005, I got up before dawn, left the small room I was renting in a local housing colony and stood in the dark at the side of the road with an assorted group of sleepy figures waiting for the company bus to collect them. Few of India's zones have accommodation or dormitory facilities and the young men employed at Worldwide Diamonds lived at home with their families, in caste segregated farming and fishing villages or in township colonies along a busy coastal highway. Those who lived furthest away travelled for up to two hours by bicycle, auto-rickshaw or bus to make the factory's A shift.</p>
<p>The export-manufacturing zone in which Worldwide Diamonds was built lies between Andhra Pradesh's intensively farmed coastal districts and the port city of Vizag (Visakhapatnam). Between the 1960s and 1980s massive public investments in shipbuilding, steel and petrochemicals saw this city become one India's fastest growing urban centres. By the early 1990s, however, the restructuring of India's state-owned enterprises had brought about deindustrialization, stagnation and unemployment. The zone that opened outside the city in 1997 created the first new factory jobs here for a decade and was trumpeted by local politicians and planners as an engine of growth that would revitalize the provincial economy. Like all of India's zones, however, it would make the conditions of informality and precariousness that characterized most economic activity in the region into a foundation for global manufacturing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1466138111410621">Cross, 2010b</xref>).</p>
<p>Worldwide Diamonds was one of the first investors in the zone. The hiring strategy of its European executives and high caste Indian managers (all of them men) was explicitly concerned with the question of labour control. Managers profiled workers by age and class, looking for people under the age of 20 whose families had few assets or whose fathers were ill, severely indebted or dead on the presumption that this demographic was particularly malleable and docile. ‘Young people are open,’ managers told me in interviews. ‘We can give them new inputs, we can give them new thoughts. We can mould them.’ ‘They can be built from scratch.’ Furthermore, they explained, ‘needy people with aged fathers really need jobs and they won't go on strike’. At the same time, ideas about the complex, technical nature of diamond cutting and polishing also found these managers looking for workers with a minimum educational qualification, their academic certificate acting as what Pierre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1466138111410621">Bourdieu (1979)</xref> called a formal guarantee of competence. ‘Anyone with two hands can work here,’ I was told. ‘But they also have to have logical thinking, so they can catch the work.’ If these preferences and decisions appeared neutral in gender terms it is because, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1466138111410621">Salzinger (2004)</xref> has written, masculinity has an accrued capacity to stand in for the general. In India's diamond industry, as in Mexico's <italic>maquila</italic> sector, the undifferentiated worker is a man and recruitment policies are underpinned by associations between masculinity, machines and technical rationality that code diamond cutting and polishing as male.</p>
<p>Against the backdrop of Vizag's deindustrialization and the preferences of its managers, Worldwide Diamonds tapped into a local labour market dominated by educated but unemployed young men from ‘backwards’ and ‘scheduled’ castes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1466138111410621">Cross, 2009</xref>). Historically these communities had been tied to forms of peasant agriculture or defined by a rural caste-based occupation. Most of the young men employed at Worldwide Diamonds, however, had grown up in households with diversified livelihood strategies that included forms of casual waged labour in therural and urban informal economy as well as entrepreneurial forms of self-employment like home-based tailoring or the petty production of street food. Many of these young men were also first-born sons and, like elsewhere in India, their families had invested heavily in their education as a pathway to social and economic mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1466138111410621">Jeffrey et al., 2008</xref>). All of them had attended a Telugu medium government school until they were aged 16, usually the first member of their family to have done so. And a majority of them had gone on to complete a two-year part-time course in a local, private industrial training institute, which represents the cheapest most accessible form of secondary level education in India.</p>
<p>Recruited for work inside Vizag's economic zone, these young Telugu men were confronted by a discrepancy between the promise of their education and their actual employment outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1466138111410621">Cross, 2009</xref>). The terms and conditions of low waged, labour intensive and insecure work here made it difficult to achieve the kinds of long-term stability and security that would allow them to fashion themselves as successful householders or providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1466138111410621">Osella and Osella, 2006</xref>). In many respects the experienceof work at Worldwide Diamonds was a space that crystallized feelings of disenfranchisement, discontent and failure. Yet relationships with technology on the factory floor also created new arenas in which men could achieve alternative forms of masculine success, recognition and personal authentication.</p>
<p>As young men at Worldwide Diamonds learned to use, handle and control cutting and polishing tools for the first time, their experiences were embedded in a wider set of associations. Modernist associations of technology with progress and development have been central to projects of post-colonial nation-building in India and continue to be immensely salient in everyday experiences of gender, education and employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1466138111410621">Bray, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1466138111410621">Prakash, 1999</xref>). Nowhere is this more evident than in the country's industrial training institutes. Conceived by Jawaharlal Nehru in the 1950s under the slogan ‘building the youth, building the nation’, these institutes were originally intended to equip young men for specific jobs in public sector industries by training them in welding, mechanics, plumbing and electronics. Today's privately run technical institutes have perpetuated this legacy, capitalizing on continued associations between applied technological knowledge, personal development and employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1466138111410621">Cross, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>For some labour process scholars the production of technological masculinity in this context might be described as compensatory, a term that frames the production of gendered identities, subjects and selves as cultural recompense for economic marginality and wage-labour relationships. Debates in the social and anthropological study of technology and theories of technology as performance and technique, however, push us to see how social and symbolic relationships to tools and machines can create their own contexts of meaning.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1466138111410621"><title>The preparation department</title>
<p>Worldwide Diamonds’ manufacturing process was divided into a sequence of sorting, sawing, cutting and polishing operations that took place across five different departments. It had been agreed that I would begin my placement in the factory's Preparation Department, where around 150 people were employed on each shift to turn tiny, angular fragments of dirty-looking rock into crystal clear, round stones with a familiar and recognizable diamond shape. The department was a huge and poorly ventilated space split into three machine sections by shoulder high sheets of hardboard. In each section rows of workers dressed in identical blue uniforms used an array of hand tools – magnifying glasses (loupes), grinding sticks, and grips for holding diamonds (tangs) – as well as electrically-powered spindle machines and polishing wheels to complete a single specific task. Down the centre of the department ran the cornering section aisle, where all superfluous, unwanted diamond was ground away from the edges of rough stones. On one side was the bruiting section, where diamonds were given their perfectly round circumference. On the other side was blocking, where stones were given eight basic side facets, a smooth, flat table facet, and a sharp pointed ‘culet’ facet. Each section operated under the watchful eyeof a monitor, themselves former workers who had been promoted onto the first rung of a supervisory ladder.</p>
<p>The machine sections were separated from a quality control cabin by a Perspex glass wall, where rows of workers examined diamond after diamond for flaws and irregularities, meticulously weighing and grading each stone. Diamonds were collected and deposited by workers from windows in the wall of the quality control cabin. Rough stones moved across the shop floor in paper envelopes labelled with electronic barcodes, enabling the location of individual stones to be identified at the touch of a button. Florescent strip lights illuminated each machine section from above and the white glare immersed the space in officious and artificial brightness. The entire workspace was kept under video surveillance by a system of closed circuit television cameras, which were constantly monitored by a security officer who sat offthe factory floor.</p>
<p>When I arrived at the beginning of my first shift the department's manager, a young Telugu Brahmin man, was expecting me. He was one of 15 department managers, all of them high caste Indians, and all of them bearers of a graduate degree in engineering or an MBA. After a brief wait while the department manager checked that each section had come online, I was walked into the cornering section and introduced to Laxman, the section monitor. Within 10 minutes I had been sat down on a stool in the middle of the section aisle and my training had begun. Over the course of the year I rotated between the Preparation Department's three machine sections, but my introduction to the A shift began in cornering.</p>
<p>Over the following pages I describe the immersion of a new worker into the cornering section and the processes through which they acquired an embodied practical knowledge of tools and machines. In doing so I reflect on the ways that this learning process shaped what Telugu men came to know about their technical skills, themselves, and the world around them. Here, as in Soumhya <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1466138111410621">Venkatesan's (2010)</xref> ethnography of craft workers in south India, learning a skill is also to learn the value of that skill. Venkatesan describes how, as weavers in the small town of Pattamadai learn to handle the looms and cloth necessary to produce woven mats, they come to look upon this knowledge as an accursed wisdom – a loaded marker of immobility, powerlessness and low status. Venkatesan challenges notions of craftsmanship or craft work as an end in itself, reminding us that a craftsperson's relationship to technology can be purely instrumental: a means to an end that generates use-value only through exchange. As the young Telugu men at Worldwide Diamonds learned to cut and polish stones they challenged this conceptual dichotomy in the opposite way, showing how a labourer's relationship to technology on a global production line can become an end in itself.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1466138111410621"><title>Apprentices on the A shift</title>
<p>In January 2005 the cornering section's A shift was made up of 15 men aged between 18 and 28. They included Prakash, Srinivas, Srinu-ninety-two, Kondom Rao, Appalla Raju and Little Suresh, “each of whom had spent more than two years working here, and three more recent recruits, like Ganesh, who joined the workforce a matter of weeks before I did.” In many respects my entry into the cornering section followed the same trajectory as these newly hired workers. Arriving at the factory's security desk at the beginning of their very first shift, they had been quickly dispatched to the Preparation Department and ushered into the cornering section. Worldwide Diamonds had no formal induction programme, and on the factory floor responsibility for their training was left entirely to their section monitors, who would introduce them to their task and the equipment they needed to complete it (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1466138111410621">Figure 1</xref>).
<fig id="fig1-1466138111410621" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>From left to right: spindle machine, polishing stick, mallet, and spanner.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1466138111410621-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Cornering a diamond involved using three hand-tools: a spanner, a mallet, and wooden girdling or rounding stick and an electrically-powered single spindle or girdling machine to grind away the angular edges of a rough stones until its circumference had become ‘more or less eighty percent round’. Each worker sat at a different spindle machine, spaced at arm’s length intervals along two white-lacquered workbenches that ran down each side of the cornering section aisle. The spindles were roughly the size and shape of a sewing machine, with a foot pedal used to control the speed. At one end was an opening or mouthpiece that could be opened and closed with the spanner. Diamonds were inserted into the spindle's mouthpiece on the end of a small brass cylinder, a pot or dop, to which they had been cemented. When the machine was turned on, the diamond spun around on its axis at approximately 500 rotations per minute. This rapidly rotating stone could then be ground down by rubbing it with a small wedge of grey-black synthetic carbonate, known as a ‘sharp’, which was attached to the end of the hand-held stick.</p>
<p>Depending on the stone, cornering a diamond was expected to take between two and five minutes. The monthly wage for cornering section workers was divided into two. The fixed portion was a basic wage that began at 1200 rupees (approximately £15) per month, rising by 250 rupees with each subsequent year of work. The variable portion was an incentive or piece rate wage, that was calculated by the number and carat size of stones that workers produced. Big diamonds took longer to corner, and were paid accordingly.</p>
<p>On his first day in the cornering section a new trainee was told to do nothing but ‘watch and observe’ a senior worker. So it was that, on my first day, Laxman asked me to sit alongside Prakash, the section's oldest worker, saying: ‘Whenever a new person comes here, I tell them: respect your seniors first. Now pay close attention, just watch what Prakash does.’ In this way the social order of the shop floor section was impressed upon the novice from the outset. Here, they were taught, was a hierarchy constituted by experience and skill, hard work and toil, as distinct from those hierarchies of caste and class that were reproduced in the division of labour between management and labour.</p>
<p>On my second day in the section Laxman sat me at my own machine and showed me how to operate the spindle machine and how to ensure that a diamond rotatedprecisely on its axis by balancing the spindle wheel. This task, he taught me, involved giving the wheel a short series of taps with the mallet. Each tap could knock the wheel too far, however, and nudging the axis into position required a delicate judgment. He pointed as the unbalanced stone rose and fell on its axis. ‘You have to hit the wheel here, to knock it into place,’ and he raised the mallet in his right hand: ‘See! Look! Hit!’ (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1466138111410621">Figure 2</xref>).
<fig id="fig2-1466138111410621" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Laxman showing me how to balance a spindle wheel with the mallet.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1466138111410621-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>On my third day in the section I was allowed to pick up a grinding stick for the first time. The stick measured from the tip of an index finger to the elbow, and had a considerable weight. Laxman showed me how to hold it, tucked under my right arm and gripped loosely in my right hand, and how to manipulate the sharp against the diamond. ‘When you touch it you have to get a feel for the stone,’ Laxman said. ‘You have to feel how the stone is.’</p>
<p>On the floor of the cornering section the trainee's progression from clumsiness to dexterity took place not through the internalization of rules or externally imposed designs but, as Tim Ingold argued, through the gradual attunement of movement and perception. It was through repeated practical trials that a new worker got the ‘feel of things’, learning to ‘fine tune’ his movements, and achieving the ‘rhythmic fluency of the accomplished practitioner’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1466138111410621">Ingold, 2001</xref>: 22). This transformation erased distinctions between the rational and the emotional, the corporeal and the mental, producing what Loïc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1466138111410621">Wacquant (2004</xref>: 462) has called a ‘sensuous, situated ‘‘knowing-how-to’’’.</p>
<p>With practice, a novice would begin to appreciate subtle differences in the appearance of a diamond as he operated on it. Over time, hunched over the spindle, he could begin to discern the telltale signs of contact on the surface of a stone. When the diamond was touched by the sharp it made a coarse cutting sound, as if from a miniature pneumatic drill, and if the stone was ground against the grain, a vibration reverberated through the stick. In this work, as Erin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1466138111410621">O’Connor (2006</xref>: 182) has written in her ethnographic account of glassblowing, tools become hands, extensions of an operator through which they can feel and respond to their materials.</p>
<p>One of the cornering section's trainees, Ganesh, made this indivisibility of corporeal and cognitive processes strikingly apparent one day as he called out to me across the section aisle, looking up as he used his right hand to operate the spindle machine and his left hand to push the grinding stick backwards and forwards against the diamond, ‘<italic>Prati rojulu chestunaante prati rojulu tilustondi’</italic> – Everyday I’m doing, everyday I’m knowing.</p>
<p>My field-notes from the first few weeks I spent in the cornering section record a daily routine of comments, advice and instruction from the section's more experienced workers. Appalla Raju or Kondom Rao regularly leant over their machines to offer me corrections. ‘Here! Hold your loupe like this,’ or ‘No! You should put the stick against your body like that.’ Gradually, however, their advice segued into other kinds of comments and questions and I came to understand that conversations about things overlapped with conversations about people. As they learned how to corner diamonds, new workers also learned how to laugh and joke at the high-caste graduate managers, sniggering at their inability to use the spindle machine or failure to understand how to hold the stick. ‘Those people don't know how to do anything,’ was the familiar jibe, ‘all they know is how to give directions.’ ‘Why do those people even need soap to wash their hands?’ Kondom Rao once muttered to his section mates as they gathered around a small washbasin in the men's toilet at the end of a shift to rub the oil off their calloused palms. Cloistered together in the cornering section, experiences of education and intimate engagements with tools and machinesoutlined the contours of a particular kind of masculinity, one that valorized technical competency as a more desirable masculine attribute or quality than those intellectual and white-collar skills that command status and higher salaries. ‘They don't even know how to start a machine.’ ‘Do you want to know the difference between us and managers?’ Raju once asked me. ‘They’re the people who just look atdiamonds,’ and he lifted his fingers up to his eyes, as if inspecting a stone with a magnifying loupe. ‘But the people in here are workers’ – and he rolled up his sleeve to clench his left bicep, wrapping his right hand around the muscle and gripping it tightly in emphasis.</p>
<p>The specialized division of labour at Worldwide Diamonds meant that few people on the shop floor had anything approaching a full comprehension of the entire diamond manufacturing process. Trained to perform a single task, most of the cornering section workers had little idea how to carry out other tasks around them. ‘Ihave a basic idea how to do it,’ Srinu Ninety Two and Little Suresh told me, describing the bruiting and blocking work taking place either side of them on the factory floor, ‘but I can't, you know, really do it.’ Yet none of these men treated their specialized knowhow as a limited, partial or shallow version of some total corpus of knowledge. Instead they appeared committed to the idea that cornering was a fraction of the whole; as if each single repetitive task involved in the mass production of diamonds was a scalar version of diamond manufacturing in its entirety. As they learnt to complete the sequence of operations necessary to corner a diamond they made their practical knowledge and technical mastery the grounds of male status, agency and power. In this gendering of tasks and tools, the work of using or making came to acquire a value in itself; technological intimacy generating its own rewards, pleasures and satisfactions.</p>
<p>On countless occasions outside the factory, in a village or in a highway township, Ilistened as the cornering section men described their work to me, or friends and relatives. In public and private speech acts they asserted their technical knowledgeand expertise as members of a unique occupational community. In this respect, diamond polishing generated its own prestige. The gendered satisfaction that could be derived from the knowledge of cornering was inseparable from their knowledge of the value of diamond as a commodity. ‘Sometimes,’ Prakash once said: ‘I feel proud that I am one of the only people around here to know about diamond processing. The stones we make are real diamonds, not artificial diamonds. There are over one million people in Vizag, but how many of them know how to make diamonds? Almost none. Nobody else can do what we can do. What we do here is secret. We can't discuss it with people outside. If people come to know the process by which cornering is done, or from cornering to bruiting, then competitors may be able to copy this company's secrets. I don't even tell my wife how they are made. I just tell her to tell people that her husband is working in diamonds and that she should be proud.’</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1466138111410621"><title>Technological adaptations</title>
<p>These intimate relationships between the cornering section workers, their tools and machines altered their meanings and practical operation. The machines and tools used for cutting and polishing gemstones have remained relatively unchanged over the past century. Large-scale diamond manufacturing today relies upon the same combination of handheld tools and single head or single spindle girdling machines that were used in small artisanal workshops 50 years ago in Belgium. Designed and built with the comparatively light requirements of workshop manufacture in mind, the spindles in the cornering section were never intended for heavy and continuous use, and the demands of the global factory went far beyond that for which they had been constructed.</p>
<p>Under the strain of mass production their axles slipped, their spindle wheels wobbled, they became clogged with oil and dust, and they slowed down. Age and use meant that each spindle machine had different characteristics. Some ran faster, some leaked more oil, some ran more smoothly, affecting how a diamond was spun and how much force was required to keep it balanced. Similarly the wooden grinding sticks exhibited slight differences in weight, length and diameter, requiring an operator to adjust his grip or posture accordingly. A lack of attention or responsiveness to these physical properties was imparted directly to the diamond. Too much pressure and there was a risk of cracking, breaking or over-grinding a rough diamond or over-cornering it on one side. Too little pressure and it would take too long to grind down the diamond, reducing an individual's productivity and his piece rate wage. It was the constant sensitivity and responsiveness of the worker to these operational characteristics that transformed these tools into technologies of mass production.</p>
<p>With time a new trainee became increasingly alert to the physical properties of his tools and machines, and more attached to them. As cornering workers became accommodated to a particular spindle machine or grinding stick they lay claim to it, stencilling or scratching their initials, names and employee numbers onto their surfaces like territorial signatures (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1466138111410621">Figure 3</xref>). Disputes over tools and machine parts were common, especially with new workers. When I randomly picked up a heavy wooden grinding stick one morning, for example, Srinivas was quick to march over and take itout of my hands. Inspecting it closely, he pointed out the marks he had scratched into the wood at one end. ‘This is mine,’ he said thrusting an alternative in my direction. ‘It's the one I've used since the beginning. I got accustomed [<italic>alavatu</italic>] to it.’
<fig id="fig3-1466138111410621" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>A spindle machine with diamond, showing Kondom Rao's signatures, his employee number and initials.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1466138111410621-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>These signatures were suggestive of the way that the factory's technology was adapted for use, as workers responded to the demands of the piece rate regime. Being a successful piece rate producer required workers to understand and master the peculiarities of a particular spindle or stick. Any sudden switch of machine or tool required a period of re-adjustment that cost time and money. Inevitably, under such circumstances, people claimed a special attachment to those tools with which they had become most familiar, personalizing them and customizing them to their specific needs and requirements. The spanners, mallets, polishing sticks and spindle machines strewn across the cornering section bore traces of many other users, on the factory's B shift, just as they carried memories of former workers who had once been part of the work group. This process of accommodation was even more strikingly apparent in the non-secular relationship of the cornering section workers to their tools and machines.</p>
<p>Next to every spindle machine in the cornering section could be found a small, almost inconspicuous, religious icon [<italic>boma</italic>]. Among the most popular images were those of the Hindu Goddess Durga or holy men like Sai Baba. Some were no bigger than passport photos, some were the size of a playing card, some had been cut from magazines and some were purchased. Some were wedged into cracks down the side of machines, others had been taped to a nearby wall or sideboard (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1466138111410621">Figure 4</xref>). Allthe section's men were practising Hindus, for whom these religious images materialize the deities they represent, becoming literally God in image form. Once a year, on the ninth and final day of <italic>Durga Navratrilu,</italic> one of the biggest lunar festivals in the Hindu calendar, the associations between these images and technology were made explicit. On this occasion each section in the preparation department performed <italic>Ayudha Puja</italic>, offering prayers, thanks and praise to the Goddess Durga in return for protection from their tools, equipment and machinery.
<fig id="fig4-1466138111410621" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>An image of Durga above a spindle machine in the cornering section.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1466138111410621-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>At the heart of the <italic>Ayudha Puja</italic> is a belief that tools and machines are capable of exerting a powerful and potentially malevolent influence unless they are properly adapted or tamed for use through correct ritual practice. For India's labour historians such beliefs and practices have an anomalous place in the modern industrial workplace (Chakrabarty, 1997; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1466138111410621">Siddiqqi, 2000</xref>). Yet the risks, vulnerabilities, disparities and insecurities created by contemporary globalization and political economy are widely understood by anthropologists to create and revive religious, superstitious and occult relations to technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1466138111410621">Comaroff and Comaroff, 2005</xref>). Production regimes in today's global factories, for example, demand that machines and equipment be pushed to new levels of productivity. Ching Kwan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1466138111410621">Lee's (2007)</xref> study of labour struggles in contemporary China, for example, records a horrificlitany of broken fingers, crushed hands and severed limbs caused by hyper-intensively operated machinery in export manufacturing units. At Worldwide Diamonds cutting and polishing work created a range of health and safety issues, including eye injuries from fragments of stone and respiratory ailments linked to diamond dust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1466138111410621">Cross, 2010a</xref>). Over an eight-year period there had been at least two serious incidents in the cornering section, one of which resulted in a serious head injury after a worker got his hair caught in a spindle. In factories like this, actions that adapt potentially dangerous technology for use and ameliorate the risks to users can seem more pertinent than ever. This is precisely what the practice of tool worship appears to do, within the structures of meaning, cultural idioms and ritual framework of popular Hinduism.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1466138111410621"><title>All in the game</title>
<p>Over the days, weeks and months I spent in the cornering section I gradually became aware of the idiosyncratic ways that the men around me had of handling technology. I eventually noticed that none of the section's experienced workers bothered using the mallet to balance their spindle, as Laxman had fastidiously taught me. Instead they cut a couple of seconds off the task by balancing the wheel with a short, hard knock from the wooden stick that was already in their hands. Likewise, no experienced worker slowed the spindle wheel with the braking pedal that lay beneath the table. Instead they pushed down hard on the moving wheel with the palm of their left hand, allowing them to stop and start it without any time lag. These shortcuts or invented modifications allowed people to make gains in speed and efficiency, and were essential if a cornering section worker wanted to reach the daily levels of production that would guarantee them a minimum level of acceptable pay (approximately 3500 rupees or £35 a month).</p>
<p>Yet in the cornering section shortcuts were never only about an economy of movements: the shortcut was also style. Successfully incorporating a shortcut into a sequence of movements and actions was a public display of skill and technical prowess. At the heart of a seemingly endless repetition of movements and gestures lay aesthetic and non-instrumental embellishments in technique, flourishes of superior skill and judgement that expressed an individual's ability to control his machines and tools. To loosen the spindle's mouth with a breakneck spanner twist and change the stone in an apparently single fluid motion was a practised, precise and satisfying achievement that distinguished the trainee from the senior, the amateur from the expert. To see these shortcuts as stylistic signatures is to see the repetitive movements and gestures involved in cornering a diamond not just as expressions of technical competency and skill but also as performances, the doing of gender, through which the cornering section's young workers made and achieved themselves as men.</p>
<p>Any desire that I had to participate in Worldwide Diamonds' labour process soon became compelling for reasons beyond methodology. On the factory floor workers turned their repetitive manual tasks into games that they could play with each other and with themselves. Churning out stones became tests of skill, with each stone becoming a personal challenge and the day's rate of production or final output becoming something of a competition between workers. Technical competency was a precondition for playing and, like any novice, as I gained proficiency Ibegan to participate.</p>
<p>After a couple of weeks my interactions in the cornering section become interspersed with the same question – ‘How much production, Jamie?’ ‘How many stones?’ ‘What have you done?’ The day that I cut the corners off 10 stones was a day of intense personal pride, followed over the next few weeks by frustration at my slow progress. People around me were sympathetic. Srinu-Ninety-Two tried to comfort me, saying, ‘Don't worry, Jamie. This is only your learning phase.’ The day that I completed 21 stones in one shift I was teased for not making more. ‘Yesterday you did 19 stones and said you would do 23 today,’ Little Suresh said. ‘But you see… You didn't tell the truth!’ The first day that I cut the corners of 22 stones by 8 a.m. in the morning, I was quick to tell Ramu, who seemed genuinely impressed. ‘That's great,’ he said, ‘maybe you’ll make even 44 or 45 today.’ At the end of a slow day when I was tired and deeply reluctant to cut and polish diamonds that I didn't really have to, Appella Raju turned to me with sarcasm. ‘Oh Jamie! Today you’ve produced <italic>soooo</italic> much! What happened? OK. No problem, tomorrow you can make more.’ But at the end of my first month in the section, when my daily production tally had reached an average of 35 stones, there was widespread surprise and encouragement from around the cornering section. Laxman took the opportunity to urge me on. ‘OK. Now you have some idea about production. Now, try to improve.’</p>
<p>Encouraged by the piece rate as much as by the promise of respect and recognitionfrom their co-workers, enthusiastic new entrants into the cornering section oftenstruggled to ramp up their productivity as quickly as possible. The factory's managers tried to encourage this competitive spirit by compiling section-wide data on individual performance, pinning up graphs and spreadsheets on a department notice board and offering certificates for those who reached monthly production highs. Reflecting on her own apprenticeship in Trinidad's export-oriented garment industry, Rebecca <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1466138111410621">Prentice (2008)</xref> shows how it is through the acquisition of embodied knowledge in the industrial workplace that the body is inculcated with the structuring ideologies of modern production regimes. As she shows, learning to sew in contemporary Trinidad is also to learn to see garment work as ‘individually motivated self-employment’.</p>
<p>In India too, we might argue, the acquisition of practical skills and embodied technical knowledge under piece rate labour regimes finds workers learning to be competitive and entrepreneurial individuals. But in a factory like Worldwide Diamonds, we can also see that as workers learn to become producers in these environments they also learn the virtues of mutual aid. At the same time as a novice in the cornering section, for example, acquired the skills to participate in the game of production he also learned to tether his ambition, restricting his zeal, output and productivity. With technical mastery came obligations and responsibilities. Just as the novice came to understand that the piece rate regime encouraged competition and individual achievement, he also learned that remaining a successful producer entailed co-operation.</p>
<p>Men like Ramu and Kondom Rao, with over three years of factory work experience each, had first-hand experience of changes to the factory's piece rate wage system and understood all too well how managerial decisions had increased thephysical demands of work. In the past, as individual section workers had raised their individual productivity to new highs, looking for a higher monthly wage packet, the company had lowered the piece rate, compelling people to work faster to maintain their earlier wage levels. ‘Nowadays,’ Ramu explained, ‘we are making more but the salary has stayed the same. Before, even without this pressure, I was working. I was doing this work. But now every two hours, all I hear are calls for Production! Production!’</p>
<p>This awareness of management strategy was transmitted to new trainees as they acquired an embodied practical knowledge of tools and machines. As Ramu and Kondom Rao encouraged new trainees like Ganesh to see productivity as the basis of respect and recognition, they also defined what constituted a normal or acceptable level of production. A trainee who over-exerted himself or raised his output above the average was reined in with side comments about ‘working too hard’ or ‘burning themselves out’ or was openly criticized for sacrificing ‘quality for quantity’. Meanwhile Ramu and Kondom Rao presented their average rate of 80 stones per day as the highest that was it was possible to achieve without encountering some deterioration in ‘quality’. Any more, they taught, and the quality of stones would fall to unacceptable levels. Laxman, the section monitor, was complicit in their efforts. By emphasizing to newcomers the correct ways of handling or using tools he helped to conceal from a managerial gaze the shortcuts that enabled workers to exert greater control over their rate and pace of work.</p>
<p>As a new worker spurred himself on towards a daily average of 80 stones, he also learned to leverage his knowledge and to pace his output evenly over the eight-hour shift. Playing the game was about knowing how to maximize individual output but also about putting this knowledge to use in ways that limited future demands. Immersed in a working environment that valorized productivity, new trainees came to understand that individual output also had to be restrained: an outcome which decreased monetary gains for the individual but which also established a collective defence against further intensifications of the labour process.</p>
<p>In Michael <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1466138111410621">Burawoy's (1982)</xref> influential account of work on the floor of an Illinois factory making engine parts for a multinational agricultural machinery corporation, it is precisely in the games that workers play that they manufacture their own consent to the labour process. Technology is central to Burawoy's account: it is technological intimacy that allows workers to participate in what Burowoy called the game of ‘making out’ and derive what Burawoy called ‘relative satisfactions’ or non-economic values. Yet because Burawoy sees technology as materializing the rules and outcomes of capitalist production, by playing the game and forging relationships to tools and machines workers also accepted and reproduced their status quo. In this Marxist analysis, technology is an enchanting or mystifying cultural artefact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1466138111410621">Mollona, 2009</xref>) that obscures and depoliticizes workers’ subordination to market forces and market-oriented calculations and workers’ technological intimacy serves only to interpolate them as consenting subjects in the labour process.</p>
<p>As I have sought to show, however, such arguments foster a closed interpretation of technology, not open to the possibility that meanings and values might be transformed and reshaped through use, or that these engagements might reconstitute rather than simply reproduce capital's social relationships, or that engagements with tools and machines in the global factory can generate their own contexts of human experience. The games played by workers in the cornering section demand to be understood as creative performances. Through their intimate knowledge of and relationship to technology, young men performed a particular form of masculinity, one informed by lived experiences of education and caste, that celebrated toughness, endurance and mechanical skill as much as collaboration and solidarity and enabled them to achieve personal affirmation and recognition as men. In a world in which their ability to guarantee stable and secure economic futures often appeared negligible, tools and machines were also extensions of selves, through which it was possible for a young man to express and confirm his ability to act.</p>

<sec id="sec9-1466138111410621"><title>Re-engaging with technology in the global factory</title>
<p>The global factory is frequently imagined and represented as a space in which the human body's capacities for sensory perception are harnessed to a market-oriented logic, and in which processes of alienation and deskilling reach their contemporary apotheosis. For anthropologist Michael <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1466138111410621">Herzfeld (2007</xref>: 210) this is a world in which all ‘habits of embodiment are redirected to the fulfilment of Fordist or Talyorist quotas’ and in which the ‘enchantment of lived experience is recast as productive efficiency and precision’. As I have argued in this article, such dystopian visions lock embodied engagements with technology into a single context of human experience, a context that is structured only by the labour relationship and in which the sum total of a person's encounter with technology is the alignment of their body, person and relationships with the interests, intentions and designs of capital. While engagements with technology on the shop floor of a global factory recreate the conditions for capitalist production, these processes of social reproduction do not preclude the possibility that engagements with tools and machines can generate other contexts of human experience. Even in an industrial labour process that is characterized by a menial, highly specialized division of labour and where work is characterized by incredible rigour, insecurity, exploitative conditions and inadequate pay, people are involved in active, affective and perceptual relationships with the material apparatus of production. Theories of technology as power or ideology or of capitalist modernity as a process of continued alienation and deskilling offer little scope for conceptualizing how these intimate or embodied engagements transform both persons and things. Re-engaging with tools and machines in the global factory is to explore how gendered persons and selves are produced in an intimate relationship with the material apparatus of production, and it is to ask how labour transforms the meanings, understandings and performance of industrial technology.</p>
