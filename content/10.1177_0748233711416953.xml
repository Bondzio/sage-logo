<abstract>
<p>Enzymes with hydroxylating activity on alkanes have potential application as biotransformation catalysts in chemical and pharmaceutical industry. Genome of <italic>Alcanivorax borkumensis</italic>, a marine bacterium with hydrocarbon dissimilation activity, contains at least two P450 monooxygenases and two nonheme monooxygenases, AlkB1 and AlkB2, respectively. Presumably, all these enzymes possess alkane hydroxylating activity. Both AlkB1 and AlkB2 are membrane proteins. Two accessory proteins, rubredoxin and rubredoxin reductase, supply the reducing equivalent from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reduced (NADPH to hydroxylases. Rubredoxin reductase catalyses the reduction of rubredoxin by oxidation of NADPH, and rubredoxin transfers the electrons to the alkane hydroxylase to complete the hydroxylation reaction. Here, we sought to investigate the expression of <italic>alkB1</italic> gene in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Therefore, we amplified <italic>alkB1</italic> gene from <italic>A. borkumensis</italic> genome by polymerase chain reaction and cloned it in the expression vector pET26 upstream of His-tag sequence. Predisposed BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed by the recombinant vector. At last, expression of recombinant enzyme was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. Regarding the potential ability of this enzyme in hydroxylation of long-chained alkanes, the application of it would be studied in petroleum downstream industries.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Various types of marine microorganisms are isolated with the ability to metabolize hydrocarbons including crude oil. Among these organisms, <italic>Alcanivarax barkumensis</italic> SK2 is a gram-negative proteobacter first reported from Borkum island in North Sea in 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748233711416953">Kasai et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748233711416953">van Beilen et al., 2005</xref>). Due to the unique nutritional dependence of this bacterium on hydrocarbon, populations of <italic>A. borkumensis</italic> were found as the main constituent of microbial population in oil-polluted marine environments all around the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748233711416953">Harayama et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748233711416953">Kasai et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The C–H bond is chemically stable and requires high activation energy (435 KJ Mol<sup>–1</sup>) in catalytic reactions. Hydroxylating the terminal methyl group of alkanes is the first and key enzymatic reaction in the pathways for extracting energy from this class of molecules, leading to the generation of primary alcohols. The alkane hydroxylating system is composed of three components, hydroxylase, rubredoxin and rubredoxin reductase. This enzyme complex is able to oxidize long- and medium-chain alkanes, using reductive equivalents from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reduced (NADH) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reduced (NADPH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0748233711416953">Ayala and Torres, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748233711416953">Udit et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>There are two annotated alkane hydroxylase genes, namely <italic>alkB1</italic> and <italic>alkB2</italic>, in published genome of <italic>A. borkumensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748233711416953">Schneiker et al., 2006</xref>). Alkane hydroxylase-1 (ALKB1) efficiently oxidizes medium-chain (C5–C12) alkanes, while alkane hydroxylase-2 (ALKB2) oxidizes medium-chain (C8–C16) alkanes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748233711416953">Smits et al., 2003</xref>). Both ALKB1 and ALKB2 are membrane diiron monooxygenases. These enzymes have potentially numerous applications in the transformation of hydrocarbons.</p>
<p>Regarding the function of ALKB1 enzyme in alkane metabolism and in order to apply this enzyme potentially to produce high value-added fine chemicals from relatively cheap hydrocarbon compounds, the ability of recombinant <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells in expression of ALKB1 was examined. The absence of alcohol oxidation enzymes in <italic>E. coli</italic> prevents the conversion of newly synthesized alcohol into corresponding aldehyde and fatty acid. Therefore, production of a recombinant alkB1 is superior to the employment of native strain with downstream enzymes.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section3-0748233711416953">
<title>Medium and growth conditions</title>
<p>
<italic>A. borkumensis</italic> SK2 was grown at room temperature in artificial seawater medium (pH 7–7.5) with the following compositions: NaCl (23 g/l), MgSO<sub>4</sub>.7H<sub>2</sub>O (5.8 g/l), MgCl<sub>2</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O (6.16 g/l), CaCl<sub>2</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O (1.47 g/l), Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>.7H<sub>2</sub>O (0.89 g/l), NaNO<sub>3</sub> (5 g/l) and FeSO<sub>4</sub>.7H<sub>2</sub>O (0.03 g/l) for 24 h. This basal medium was supplemented with remnant oil (0.25%; 15 °American Petroleum Institute [API]) as the sole source of carbon.</p>
<p>Primers based on ALKB1 are coded by ABO_2707 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748233711416953">Hara et al., 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>A. borkumensis SK 2 genomic DNA extraction</title>
<p>Genomic DNA extraction kit (Metabion, Germany) was applied to extract genomic DNA of <italic>A. borkumensis</italic>. The extraction method was according to recommendation provided by the supplier. Briefly, cells from 1.5 ml overnight culture were pelleted and were lysed and the genome was dissolved in 30 µl double-distilled water and stored at –20°C for further applications.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0748233711416953">
<title>AlkB-1 amplification</title>
<p>A total of 2 ng of purified genomic DNA was used as template in a PCR containing 2.5 µL 10× buffer, 200 µM deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) and 0.5 U <italic>pfu</italic> DNA polymerase (Fermentase GmbH, Germany) with 20 pmol of each forward primer (ALKB1-F1; 5′CATATGTCAGAGAACATTTTAACC3′) and reverse primer (ALKB1-R2; 5′TTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGGTGTTTGGCAACGGTTG3′) in a final volume of 25 µL. The primers were designed based on the deposited <italic>alkB-1</italic> sequence (ABO_2707), with forward primer having a <italic>Nde</italic>I restriction site (underlined) and the reverse primer having the 6xHis-tag sequence. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) steps included 1 min at 94°C, 30 cycles of 30 sec at 94°C, 40 sec at 50°C and 2 min at 68°C, and one cycle of 10 min at 72°C.</p>

<sec id="section6-0748233711416953">
<title>Cloning of the PCR product</title>
<p>The PCR product (˜1300 bp) was purified by High Pure PCR Purification kit (Roche, Germany) and then cloned into <italic>EcoRV</italic> linearized pGEM_5ZF vector (Promega, Fitchburg, Wisconsin) by T4 DNA ligase for 16 min at 22°C. Competent DH5α cells were transformed with ligation mixture and some white colonies were screened for the presence of AlkB1 DNA. One of the recombinant plasmids, named pGEM_ALKB1, was <italic>Nde</italic>I/<italic>Sal</italic>I double-digested and the alkB1 fragment was ligated into <italic>Nde</italic>I/<italic>Sal</italic>I double-digested pET-26b(+) plasmid. Again, competent DH5α cells were transformed with the second ligation mixture and some colonies from kanamycin containing plate were screened for the presence of AlkB1 DNA. Afterward, the above said bacteria were cultured on Luria–Bertani (LB) media containing kanamycin. One of the positive plasmids was called pET26_ALKB1 and was used for further sequencing and expression experiments.</p>

<sec id="section7-0748233711416953">
<title>Expression of recombinant ALKB1 in E. coli (BL21) cells</title>
<p>After confirming recombinant pET26_ALKB1 plasmid sequence, predisposed cells of <italic>E. coli</italic> (BL21) were transformed by the plasmid. Then, a colony of newly cultured <italic>E. coli</italic> (BL21) cells, containing pET26_ALKB1 vector, was cultured in a liquid LB culturing condition, containing kanamycin, at 37°C for 16 min at 200 rpm. Then, the cells were grown at 37°C at 200 rpm in the medium containing 19.95 g/l KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 6 g/l (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 1.2 g/l MgSO<sub>4</sub>. 7H<sub>2</sub>O, 10 g/l glucose, 10 g/l peptone and 0.5 ml of stock solution of trace elements supplemented with kanamycin at final concentration of 50 μg/ml until the cell density reached OD<sub>600nm</sub> (Optical Density at 600 nm) of 0.6. Afterward, the expression of protein was inducted by adding isopropyl thiogalactoside (IPTG) at final concentration of 0.5 mM at 30°C for time intervals indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748233711416953">Figure 3</xref>. In order to study the expression of recombinant protein, it was sampled from cultured condition at different times before and after the induction. The samples were kept at –20°C until preparing for the experiment.</p>

<sec id="section8-0748233711416953">
<title>Preparing the sample for sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) vertical electrophoresis</title>
<p>The bacterial cells produced from 1 ml cellular culturing have been settled by centrifuging at 8000 rpm, at room temperature for 5 min. The sediment of the bacterial cells was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS 1×). After adding a certain amount of sample solvent 6× (pH = 6.8), it is boiled for 3 min. A certain amount of sample solvent 6× (pH = 6.8) was added to the supernatant and was boiled for 3 min. The prepared samples were studied by SDS-PAGE.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0748233711416953">
<title>Solutions and buffers used for Western blotting</title>
<p>The solutions used for Western blotting are transfer buffer (pH = 8.3), Tris buffered saline (TBS), Tween/Trion, TBS buffer (pH = 7.5), TBS-Tween buffer (pH = 7.5), buffer (pH = 7.5) and staining solution. After preparing the samples for SDS-PAGE and electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto the nitrocellulose membrane by placing the gel over the membrane. The membrane of nitrocellulose was washed twice (pH = 4.5) for 10 min. Afterward, the membrane was incubated at room temperature in blocking buffer for 1 hr. After this level, the membrane was washed by TBS-Tween/Trion buffer for 10 min. Then, the membrane was incubated in blocking buffer containing diluted (1:200) ‘Anti-His-tag’ antibody conjugated with Horse Radish Peroxidase (HRP) at room temperature, and agitated for 2 hr. Then, the membrane was washed (3x) in TBS-Tween/Triton buffer and TBS buffer (2x). At last, 18 mg substrate (4-chloro-1-naphthol) was dissolved in 6 ml methanol to which 24 ml of TBS buffer was added. This mixture was poured on the nitrocellulose membrane to which 60 ml of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (30%) was added. The solution was rocked until the color development was stabilized. After termination of the reaction and appearance of bands, the membrane was washed with distilled water.</p>

<title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>Electrophoresis of PCR product on 1% agarose gel shows a band at the area of 1200 base pair (bp), which was completely predictable as corresponding to the sequence of <italic>ALKB1</italic> gene as deposited in NCBI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748233711416953">Figure 1</xref>
, lane 6). Both the PCR product and the cloning vector were digested with the same restriction enzyme (<italic>EcoRV</italic>) to produce compatible ends for litigation reaction. Following gel purification of both fragments, they were litigated to form the recombinant vector. The recombinant vectors containing the ALKB1 in the correct direction were selected by digestion with <italic>Bgl</italic>I. The cloning vector used in this research is pGEM_5ZF. The vector pGEM_5ZF has 3001 bp, and the recombinant vector pGEM_ALKB1 was of the size 4216 bp after the ALKB1 was inserted into it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748233711416953">Figure 1</xref>, lane 3). In order to confirm the presence of ALKB1 gene piece in recombinant pGEM_ALKB1, two techniques, colony PCR and enzyme cutting by restriction enzyme <italic>Bgl</italic>I, were exercised for 3 hr. In colony PCR reaction, pGEM_ALKB1 was used as a pattern and the primers ALKB1_F1 and ALKB1_R1 were the same as before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748233711416953">Figure 1</xref>, lane 7). The <italic>Bgl</italic>I has two cutting sites in the gene <italic>ALKB1</italic> of which one of them is at nucleotide 665 and the other is at nucleotide 864. Also, it has three cutting sites in nucleotides 39, 1515 and 2834 in the vector pGEM_5ZF. In case of the presence of the considered gene, four pieces would be obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748233711416953">Figure 1</xref>, lane 4). Both confirming tests show the accuracy of cloning. After cloning the gene <italic>ALKB1</italic> into the vector and confirming by studying the expression, the gene <italic>ALKB1</italic> was taken out of the recombinant vector pGEM_ALKB1 using the enzymes <italic>Sal</italic>I and <italic>Nde</italic>I through the expression vector pET-26b(+) to be cloned in lower part of promoter T7. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748233711416953">Figure 2</xref>
, lane 5, indicates gene <italic>ALKB1</italic> after simultaneous cutting with <italic>Sal</italic>I and <italic>Nde</italic>I. As it is observed, a part of cut recombinant plasmid in lane 6 and a piece of gene related to the gene <italic>ALKB1</italic> (1215 bp) have been separated, and the upper band with the size of 3000 bp belongs to plasmid pGEM_5ZF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748233711416953">Figure 2</xref>, lane 6).</p>

<p>The ALKB1 gene was expressed in pET-26b(+). The ligation reaction between the double digested ALKB1/SalI+NdeI and pET-26b/SalI+NdeI double digested, resulted in the recombinant vector pET26_ALKB1 (˜6600 bp).

<p>In this research 5% (volume-by-volume [v/v]) of bacteria cultured overnight was used for insemination and an optical density (OD) of 0.6 was selected as the proper cellular density. Usually 16–24 h is required for producing enzyme and the production rate is maximized during this time. According to the reports of this research, temperature of 30°C and 150 rpm are used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748233711416953">van Beilen et al., 2005</xref>). Also, the studies show that ALKB1 is a protein containing nonheme diiron, which is connected to the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748233711416953">Smits et al., 2002</xref>), and the expression is stimulated in delayed exponential phase. When the rate of growth is decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748233711416953">Marín et al., 2003</xref>), the expression of recombinant protein is accomplished in the peripelasmic or extracellular space and only minor expression is observed in the cytoplasm of expressed cell. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748233711416953">Figure 3</xref> confirms these assumptions based on our SDS-PAGE results.</p>
<p>Also, for studying the presence of (His)6_tag_tail that is placed at the end of the protein ALKB1, Western blot test with Anti-HRP conjugate was done. Hence, the appeared band of 46 kDa is related to the protein ALKB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0748233711416953">Figure 4</xref>

<p>In conclusion, the expression of alkane hydroxylase-1 (ALKB1) in recombinant <italic>E. coli</italic> system will pave the way for a better understanding of the catalytic mechanism of this interesting non-heme oxygenases. Availability of other hydroxylazing enzymes (Miri et al., 2008) and accessory proteins (rubredoxin and rubredoxin reductase) will lead to development of decontamination systems for a fast and environmentally friendly approach to bioremediation of oil contaminated water and soil (Rojo, 2009). Furthermore, there are other applications including biotransformation of common starting materials into fine chemical production via this enzyme system.</p>
