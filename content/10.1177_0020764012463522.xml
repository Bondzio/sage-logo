<p>There is no doubt that schizophrenia is one of the most debilitating psychiatric disorders. It has been argued that about one-third of patients with schizophrenia will not respond to anti-psychotic medication. The challenge therefore for the researcher and clinician alike is first to know who is not likely to respond to treatment and what criteria can be used to choose appropriate medication and other interventions. Treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) differs from poor-outcome schizophrenia. This multi-authored edited volume, which appears in the series Advances in Biological Psychiatry, brings together a group of international experts to explore concepts of therapy-resistant schizophrenia, potential causative factors and neurobiology of the condition, and disease management and treatment strategies.</p>
<p>The concept of TRS is in itself difficult to define as schizophrenia itself is a chronic disease and long-term studies report that 80%–90% of patients will develop some type of social or occupational function. Historically, TRS was defined as having had at least three different chemical classes of anti-psychotics with doses equivalent to 1,000 mgm/day of chlorpromazine for a period of six weeks without significant improvement. Subsequently, significant improvement has been described as a reduction of 20% in the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores. The book’s first two chapters provide an overview of concepts and assessment. Assessment steps will look at reviewing both the history and the symptoms and treatment adherence issues. Obviously many of the symptoms will rely on observation or self-report – the later itself becoming a problem. The neuropsychology of TRS is described in the third chapter, with clear neuropsychological domains and tests. Genetic studies provide evidence of the potential contributing factors to TRS. Neuroimaging studies can help the clinician understand the role of altered brain morphology. Duration of untreated psychosis and premorbid functioning and their role in influencing TRS deserve further research and attention. Quite rightly, the largest section of the book is devoted to treatment. Lambert provides a helpful review of resistance to treatment, taking into account treatment factors such as incorrect doses and other pharmacokinetic factors, patient factors and illness factors. The role of clozapine and its applications are described in a subsequent chapter, as are electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).</p>
<p>This volume offers a useful and helpful summary on managing difficult patients who may dishearten teams and clinicians. Two minor quibbles: first, the title of the volume is <italic>therapy-resistant</italic> but the focus is on treatment-resistant; second, therapy should include psychotherapy paradigms in a supportive context, which is missing here.</p>
