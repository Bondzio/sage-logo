<p>63.4279 ALLEN, Nicholas; BARA, Judith; BARTLE, John — <bold>Rules, strategies and words: the content of the 2010 [UK] prime ministerial debates</bold>. <italic>Political Studies</italic> 61, Suppl. 1, Apr. 2013: 92–113.</p>
<p>This article investigates the verbal content of the 2010 prime ministerial debates using computer-aided text-analysis (CATA) and functional analysis. It provides reliable measures of what the leaders said, develops our theoretical understanding of televised debates in British elections, opens up the 2010 debates for potential comparison with others, and provides additional evidence by which the democratic value of the debates might be assessed. It demonstrates that the leaders focused more on policy than on personality, that most content was devoted to positive reasons for supporting parties rather than negative attacks on opponents, and that there was variation in the attention paid to general themes and specific issues and in the nature of the leaders’ appeals to voters. The findings offer qualified support for issue-ownership and functional theories. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>63.4280 ARIKAN, Gizem — <bold>Values, religiosity and support for redistribution and social policy in Turkey</bold>. <italic>Turkish Studies</italic> 14(1), March 2013: 34–52.</p>
<p>This paper investigates the individual-level factors that influence support for social redistribution and social policy in Turkey by focusing on the role of core values and religiosity. The analysis of data from Round 4 of European Social Surveys shows that self-transcendence and conservation values enhance support for government provision of social safety nets. Different aspects of religiosity have different effects on attitudes toward redistribution and social policy, with self-identified religiosity having a positive and social religious behavior having a negative effect on support for government responsibility in providing social insurance.

<p>63.4281 ARTER, David — <bold>The “hows,” not the “whys” or the “wherefores”: the role of intra-party competition in the 2011 breakthrough of the True Finns [Finland]</bold>. <italic>Scandinavian Political Studies</italic> 36(2), June 2013: 99–120.</p>
<p>The True Finn Party (PS) claimed nearly one-fifth of the vote and almost the same proportion of parliamentary seats at the April 2011 Finnish general election. It registered the largest gains made by any party in postwar Finnish history. This article, however, is concerned more with how the substantial PS vote was mobilized than with how much was mobilized. The idea is not to identify the primary causes of the PS's national breakthrough, but to explore the internal dynamics of party's explosive growth and the process of translating a large prospective vote into “hard votes” through the ballot boxes. The focus is on district-level nomination strategies, the range of candidate types, the mechanics of vote optimization and the distribution of the personal vote. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>63.4282 BARKER, David C.; BEARCE, David H. — <bold>End-times theology, the shadow of the future, and [US] public resistance to addressing global climate change</bold>. <italic>Political Research Quarterly</italic> 66(2), June 2013: 267–279.</p>
<p>The authors examine US public attitudes regarding global climate change, addressing the puzzle of why support for governmental action on this front is tepid relative to what existing theories predict. Introducing the theoretical concept of relative sociotropic time horizons, the authors show that believers in Christian end-times theology are less likely to support policies designed to curb global warming than are other Americans. They then provide robustness checks by analyzing other policy attitudes. In so doing, the authors provide empirical evidence to suggest that citizens possessing shorter “shadows of the future” often resist policies trading short-term costs for hypothetical long-term benefits.

<p>63.4283 BASINGER, Scott J. — <bold>Scandals and congressional elections [USA] in the post-Watergate era</bold>. <italic>Political Research Quarterly</italic> 66(2), June 2013: 385–398.</p>
<p>Since Watergate, more than two hundred fifty members of the [US] House of Representatives have been involved in various scandals. The author finds that roughly 40 percent of incumbents did not “survive” their scandal. Incumbents who stood for re-election lost 5 percent of the general election vote-share, on average, but the electoral repercussions vary across types of scandals and could be magnified in the presence of a quality challenger. A scandal-tainted incumbent defending his or her seat does not necessarily fare better than an untainted open-seat candidate, a finding that provides a justification for stronger ethics rules.

<p>63.4284 BEISSINGER, Mark R. — <bold>Russian civil societies: conventional and “virtual”</bold>. <italic>Taiwan Journal of Democracy</italic> 8(2), Dec. 2012: 91–104.</p>
<p>Recent developments in Russian politics challenge the traditional understanding of civil society. In hybrid regimes like Russia, conventional civil society is often weak. But as recent events in Russia demonstrate, with the rise of the internet, “virtual” civil society — fostered through dense networks of online interaction — may function as a substitute, providing the basis for civic activism even in the presence of an anemic conventional civil society. This mixture of weak conventional civil society and robust “virtual” civil society imparts a particular dynamic to state-society relations within hybrid regimes in the internet age. “Virtual” civil society breeds weak political organization and a false sense of representativeness within political oppositions, at the same time as injecting a greater degree of volatility into politics and presenting incumbent regimes with particular challenges for repression.

<p>63.4285 BERNHARD, Michael; KAYA, Ruchan — <bold>Civil society and regime type in European post-communist countries: the perspective two decades after 1989–1991</bold>. <italic>Taiwan Journal of Democracy</italic> 8(2), Dec. 2012: 113–125.</p>
<p>This essay addresses two controversies on the relationship between civil society and democratization in post-communist countries. It contradicts a tendency to dismiss civil society as a myth, ideology, or framing device for social movements and instead demonstrates that civil society is a real material force that has played a critical role in democratic breakthroughs in the region. It also criticizes the tendency to characterize post-communist civil society as either strong or weak in a blanket fashion. Instead, it shows that looking at differences in the strength of civil society at moments of transition is a good indicator of how durable that transition will be. This is illustrated with empirical work on both the breakthrough years of 1989–1991 and the period of the color revolutions in the 2000s. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4359]</p>
<p>63.4286 BHANDARU, Deepa — <bold>Is white normativity racist? Michel Foucault and post-civil rights [US] racism</bold>. <italic>Polity</italic> 45(2), Apr. 2013: 223–244.</p>
<p>Even though the American Civil Rights Movement consolidated the norm of racial equality, material inequality between whites and non-whites has persisted. The norm of racial equality, meanwhile, has generated a crisis in locating and combating contemporary racism. M. Foucault's concept of power and his lesser-known work on racism allow us to think through this crisis. His arguments suggest that racism in the post-Civil Rights era operates largely through the abandonment of non-whites to a state of war, which liberal democratic societies, via the social contract, are organized to prevent. Rather than waging war on non-whites, post-Civil Rights America normalizes whiteness. This normalization exposes non-whites to death or the risk of death by forcing them both to fend for themselves and to battle one another, as well as the elements, in a struggle for survival.

<p>63.4287 BLENCOWE, Claire — <bold>Biopolitical authority, objectivity and the groundwork of modern citizenship</bold>. <italic>Journal of Political Power</italic> 6(1), 2013: 9–28.</p>
<p>Authority is a powerful concept for coming to terms with the diversity of power. This article reframes the concept of “authority” and articulates its continued relevance in a context of radical contingency and biopolitics. It argues that authority is essentially objectivist. Biopolitics is conceived as a historical process of constituting biological life and economic forces as objectivity. The paper addresses the question of whether biological-type relations destroy or foster capacities for politics. Arguing against H. Arendt's diagnosis of the fate of authority in modernity, the article maintains that biological knowledges and economism create new groundworks of politics, citizenship and authority. This suggests that politics is instigated not simply through breaking given aesthetic orders (dissensus), but also through aesthetic productions of objectivity.

<p>63.4288 BLOEMRAAD, Irene; SCHÖNWÄLDER, Karen — <bold>Immigrant and ethnic minority representation in Europe: conceptual challenges and theoretical approaches</bold>. <italic>West European Politics</italic> 36(3), 2013: 564–579.</p>
<p>This article introduces the symposium on the representation of immigrant-origin and ethnic minorities in Europe. It argues for the importance of research on this topic, noting the large, established populations of immigrant-origin citizens and their descendants across Western European countries and these minorities’ underrepresentation in elected bodies. Current research gaps concern both empirical knowledge and the theoretical conceptualization of immigrant and ethnic minority political involvement. The article argues that existing research on representation needs to be extended to suit the cases of immigrants and ethnic minorities. It provides a brief overview of each contribution to the symposium. [R] [Introduction to a symposium of the same titlen edited by the authors.

<p>First, this essay argues that belying the optimistic and pessimistic generalizations characterizing the early debates on the transformation, both successes and failures of building capitalist democracy abound in post-socialist Eastern Europe. Second, within the group of successfully transforming countries, there has been a difference between the specific resources — associated with popular demands for social welfare and regained national identity — on which transformative elites relied to preempt or tame disruptive contention and elicit support for capitalist democracy. Third, it is argued that European integration and economic transnationalization have had varied effect on the dynamics of civil-society development and democratic consolidation across the region and over time.

<p>63.4290 BOUMANS, Jelle W.; BOOMGAARDEN, Hajo G.; VLIEGENTHART, Rens — <bold>Media personalisation in context: a cross-national comparison between the UK and the Netherlands, 1992–2007</bold>. <italic>Political Studies</italic> 61, Suppl. 1, Apr. 2013: 198–216.</p>
<p>To investigate long-term trends in personalization, this study draws on a unique data-set that is composed of Dutch and British newspaper articles from a sixteen-year period. The evidence suggests that personalization is present in both countries, but its realization differs in each country: where the UK is characterized by a concentration of attention towards the prominent offices and the Prime Minister, the Netherlands has seen an increased visibility of the “non-prominent” Cabinet members. The study [then] investigates the impact of various events on the visibility levels of the most prominent ministerial functions, with particular attention paid to the Prime Minister. Leaders appear not to be more in the foreground during national crises. Finally, the explanatory power of events for determining the visibility of Cabinet members does not seem to increase in importance over time. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>63.4291 BOWLER, Shaun; DONOVAN, Todd — <bold>Civic duty and turnout in the UK referendum on AV [electoral reform]: what shapes the duty to vote?</bold> <italic>Electoral Studies</italic> 32(2), June 2013: 265–273.</p>
<p>This paper examines the question of what shapes a voter's sense of duty to vote. We begin with a standard model of turnout at the 2011 British electoral system referendum. We show that the respondent's assessment of whether it is a citizen's duty to vote on referendums adds substantial explanatory power to a basic model of turnout. From here we examine what drives that sense of duty. We find that assessments of duty are structured by evaluations of politics and politicians. Low interest in politics, low political efficacy, and low regard for politicians correspond with less support for the idea that citizens have a duty to vote on referendums and at other elections.

<p>French President Hollande's declared ambition to revert to a predictable foreign policy based on sustainable compromises amounts to more than a tactical criticism of the impulsive, short-term behavior of his predecessor. France sees itself obliged to reflect upon its foreign and security policy, not least due to reasons linked to its economic and European policies.

<p>Nazi discourse on womens’ role since its inception until its breakdown was by no means original. Its inflexibility makes of it a peculiar case in Western history. Once it took over power, National-Socialism became an outstanding case of all the anti-modernist currents opposing the emancipation of women. Starting in 1933 its praxis was addressed to worshiping maternity and domesticity, the true womens’ realm, as well as keeping them away from the public sphere, the mens’ realm. Any attempt to bridge the private and the public spheres, was stigmatized as “antinatural”. The argument relies on original documents, most of all the writings and discourses of Adolf Hitler and the <italic>Reichsfrauenführerin</italic>, Gertrud Scholtz-Klink. [R]</p>
<p>63.4294 CHAMBERLAIN, Adam — <bold>Fusion ballots and the question of organisational type</bold>. <italic>Representation</italic> 49(1), Apr. 2013: 45–54.</p>
<p>The differences between political parties and interest groups are well-defined. However, how do minor parties that rely on fusion, or the cross-nomination of candidates from other parties, view themselves? To study this, I conducted interviews with prominent party officials in three minor parties in the state of New York [USA], where fusion politics is the norm. The evidence suggests that minor-party officials develop partisan attachments and view success as being based primarily on winning office. [R]</p>

<p>This paper explores the issue-salience of social welfare for disabled people in electoral politics with reference to party manifestos in Westminster and regional elections in the UK. Innovative aspects include mixed methods analysis of multi-tier elections on a cross-cutting issue. The findings reveal an initial post-war clinical-medical approach to welfare and the subsequent emergence of a policy discourse of rights, legal protection and equality as part of growing electoral competition over policy aimed at disabled people. It is argued that the formative role played by party manifestos needs to be incorporated into contemporary study of the politics of disability. [R]</p>
<p>63.4296 CHANG, Alex; CHU Yun-han; WELSH, Bridget — <bold>Southeast Asia: sources of regime support</bold>. <italic>Journal of Democracy</italic> 24(2), Apr. 2013: 150–164.</p>
<p>The authors’ empirical analysis shows both commonalities and variations in the sources of regime support in Southeast Asian countries. Most regimes in the region draw political legitimacy from perceptions that their governance is effective and marked by integrity. These findings lend support to the argument that regime legitimacy — when it is won and when it is lost — is rooted in the output side of the political system. Yet delivering economic prosperity alone will not suffice. In order for political regimes in Southeast Asia to win over their people, they must control corruption, respect the rule of law, treat all citizens fairly and equally, expand public services, and be responsive to what the people need. The region's young democracies are not exempt from these requirements. [R]</p>
<p>63.4297 CÍSAŘ, Ondřej — <bold>The diffusion of public interest mobilisation: a historical sociology perspective on advocates without members in the post-communist Czech Republic</bold>. <italic>East European Politics</italic> 29(1), March 2013: 69–82.</p>
<p>The paper proposes an explanation for the boom in advocacy organizations in the Czech Republic after the collapse of the Communist regime in 1989. There has been a major increase in the number of professional advocacy organizations, accompanied by an influx of “post-materialist” issues. In the first half of 1990s, American and European state and non-state actors promoted these issues. Since the end of 1990s, EU funds have taken over as the most important source of funding. Foreign funding has thus created conditions conducive to the emergence and development of advocacy-based activism in the Czech Republic. Moreover, advocacy organizations are presented as the locus of a new type of politically oriented activism, which is no longer based on mobilization, but rather on transactions. [R]</p>

<p>The scholarly literature provides mixed guidance on the question of whether DREs or optical scan systems inspire greater confidence. We bring new evidence to bear on the debate using a unique exit poll and a nationally representative survey, both of which examine a wide range of voting experiences. Having detailed information about voting experiences enables us to investigate both the direct effects of DRE/optical scan voting and the indirect effects through voting experiences. Doing so reveals new information about the relationships between voting technology, voting experiences, and voter confidence. Indeed, the type of machine one uses has very different direct and indirect effects on voter confidence — a finding that may help explain scholarly disagreement over voters’ reactions to different types of voting machines.

<p>The 2012 round of Scottish local elections, held as a stand-alone contest, under STV, provides a clearer indication of how STV has impacted on political behavior than the previous round in 2007 which was held concurrently with elections to the Scottish parliament. Utilizing aggregate ward-level data, this article presents a preliminary analysis of how parties and voters have adapted to the new system. It finds that voters have adapted well to STV, and that party loyalties remain important under the new system even if voters have considerably more choice. [R]</p>

<p>This paper uses data gathered in the British Election Study's 2011 AV Referendum Survey to investigate the impact of party leader images on referendum voting. Some analysts have argued that these effects are heterogeneous, being stronger for voters with lower levels of political knowledge. In contrast, consistent with recent research in experimental economics and political psychology, we hypothesize that more knowledgeable voters rely more heavily on leader heuristics than do less knowledgeable individuals. Using multivariate statistical techniques developed for interpreting interaction effects in nonlinear models, analyses indicate that a political knowledge index focusing on the electoral system does not have statistically significant effects on referendum voting. However, voters’ knowledge of leaders’ positions on AV does interact with leader images. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4343]</p>

<p>Britain has participated in several military interventions in recent years. This article analyzes public opinion towards the most recent intervention in Libya in 2011, looking at three different aspects of the topic. First, it examines differences in cross-national attitudes towards military action in Libya among NATO countries. It then looks in detail at which social groups were more or less likely to approve of British involvement, comparing this with group attitudes towards Britain's role in Afghanistan and Iraq. Third, it assesses how public opinion shifted during the course of the action in Libya, looking at three key indicators of the popular mood: whether Britain was right or wrong to take military action; how well the war is going; and assessments of D. Cameron's handling of the conflict. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>There has been very little examination of the Conservative Party's grassroots in the postwar period. What literature there is comes predominantly from the top-down focus of national politics and revolves around four disputed images. (1) High-levels of membership are associated with commendable engagement with formal politics. (2) Local associations are presented as inconsequential but autonomous. (3) Activists are seen as uninterested in ideology and focused on campaigning and social activity. (4) Associations are presented as dominated by women precisely because of their primarily social nature. This article examines the debates about these conventional images through an analysis of the rival Conservative factions in two Newcastle-upon-Tyne Associations, the location of probably the most divisive splits in 20th-c. Conservatism. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>At the 2010 UK election, Labour proposed a referendum on changing the House of Commons electoral system from single-member plurality to the Alternative Vote. Subsequently, a coalition was formed between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, yet it was Labour's policy on electoral reform that was implemented. The paper explains why this proved to be politically convenient for Labour's opponents. At the same time, however, holding the referendum reflected an emergent <italic>de facto</italic> convention that significant constitutional change should be introduced only after it has secured popular endorsement. The paper assesses whether the dynamics of public opinion during the AV referendum suggests that voters’ eventual decisions about constitutional questions reflect their views about the merits of the relevant arguments.

<p>I [examine] the preparation of the election manifestos for the German state level election in Baden-Württemberg in 2006. The empirical analysis consists first of interviews with key actors in the preparation process and secondly of a comparison between the manifesto proposals the party leaderships presented to the party conferences and the final versions. Based on the interview findings, I introduce a stylized model of manifesto preparation. The results show that the process was comparatively similar across parties, but there were differences especially with regard to the involvement of party members prior to the party conference stage.

<p>Since 1965, Britain's major political parties have radically and repeatedly changed the ways in which they choose their leaders. Consistent with trends in other English-speaking “Westminster” countries, they have expanded their leadership selectorates beyond parliamentary elites to include party members and, in the case of the Labour Party, affiliated organizations, principally trade unions and their members. This article explains, briefly, why these changes occurred. It then assesses the extent to which the “democratization” of party leadership selection in British politics has resulted in more (or less) competitive contests. The British experience of “democratization” has been mixed, both in terms of the number of candidates involved and in respect of the outcomes, which have ranged from “coronations” to “close encounters”. For the parties themselves and their leaders, the consequences of “democratization” have been similarly mixed. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Political representation in the UK continues to be dominated by white, middle-aged, middle-class men, but several equalities groups now have an established presence in national political institutions. This article draws on research with stakeholder organizations, lobby groups for under-represented groups within political parties, former, current and unsuccessful candidates and sitting and former elected politicians conducted prior to the 2010 General Election. It finds that where aspiring candidates from under-represented groups have been selected, it was because they were “acceptably different” conforming to aspects of the “archetypal candidate”. We argue that increasingly dominant professionalized “pathways” into national politics have allowed greater diversity, but remain narrow and exclusionary. Progress is less a reflection of a more open political system, instead representing accommodation of still under-represented groups to, and by, the existing system.

<p>63.4307 EKIERT, Grzegorz — <bold>The illiberal challenge in post-communist Europe: surprises and puzzles</bold>. <italic>Taiwan Journal of Democracy</italic> 8(2), Dec. 2012: 63–77.</p>
<p>While states in Central and Eastern Europe have experienced long and costly transitions away from communism and the resulting economic and social dislocations were some of the most severe in the 20th c., the expected popular revolt against liberal economic policies never materialized. The current financial and sovereign debt crisis puts renewed strain on economies in the region and forces austerity policies that again raise the specter of political extremism. Yet, despite such economic adversities and costs, political mobilization around illiberal ideas and against democracy and markets has been surprisingly marginal. This essay suggests that illiberal movements are gaining ground only in countries where they are supported by authoritarian states and in periods when illiberal political parties are in power.

<p>This article provides an experimental analysis of the role emotions play in Turkish voters’ political attitudes and behavior with respect to the Syria crisis. By examining the political effects of emotions, this article contributes to the discussion on Turkish voters’ political attitudes and political behavior.

<p>This issue contributes to Turkish politics literature through a novel, unexplored aspect of Turkish political behavior. Primarily motivated by behavioral theories, political psychology offers a key perspective to explore and disentangle the multifactorial and multidimensional nature of Turkish political behavior. This introduction gives an account of the general motivation behind this issue by discussing its goals, providing a history of the political psychology discipline, introducing the articles, and outlining political psychology-related work in Turkey.

<p>63.4310 ERIŞEN, Elif — <bold>The impact of party identification and socially supplied disagreement on electoral choices in Turkey</bold>. <italic>Turkish Studies</italic> 14(1), March 2013: 53–73.</p>
<p>The relative impacts of social influence and political party affiliation on electoral choices depend on the maturity of the political party system. In established democracies, political party affiliation has a decisive impact on electoral choices, whereas in democratizing countries political discussion influences over-time volatility in electoral outcomes. This paper investigates the significance of both factors on individual attitudes toward political candidates in Turkey. Findings from an experiment where social disagreement and candidate political party affiliation are manipulated indicate that young voters are sensitive to both partisan cues and socially supplied disagreement in forming and changing their attitudes toward political candidates. The results also show that, unlike most developing countries with weak parties, party label in Turkey is an important heuristic for making electoral choices.

<p>We examine the significance of leadership, economic problems and immigration for defection from voting Labour over the period 2005–2010. Vote-switching at different points throughout the electoral cycle is estimated using discrete-time event-history analysis models. Contrary to established expectations, political leadership and economic evaluations had similar effects on defection when T. Blair was still in place, and the economy was still growing. In contrast, later, vote-switching derived more noticeably from concerns over immigration or dislike of G. Brown. The emergence of immigration as a source of electoral punishment for Labour appears to derive from a particular dissatisfaction with the government's performance on an issue of rising salience; by comparison the economic crisis may well have been sufficiently global to have weakened attributions of responsibility to the government.

<p>This paper presents the first investigation of whether direct democracy supplements or undermines the attendance of demonstrations as a form of protest behavior. A first approach assumes that direct democracy is associated with fewer protests, as they function as a valve that integrates voters’ opinions, preferences, and emotions into the political process. A competing hypothesis proposes a positive relationship between direct democracy and this unconventional form of political participation due to educative effects. Drawing on individual data from recent Swiss Electoral Studies, we apply multilevel analysis and estimate a hierarchical model of the effect of the presence as well as the use of direct democratic institutions on individual protest behavior. Our empirical findings suggest that the political opportunity of direct democracy is associated with a lower individual probability to attend demonstrations. [R]</p>

<p>B. Obama's 2008 presidential victory in the US triggered a debate in Europe and the UK as to whether someone from an ethnic minority could achieve similar success in national politics. The 2010 [UK] General Election saw a small increase in ethnic minority candidates, but a near doubling of the number of black and Asian members of parliament (MPs) in the House of Commons. During 2010 and 2011, the University of Manchester organized a seminar series on ethnic minorities’ political representation in Britain. This symposium features some of the highlights of that series. This article summarizes some of the key arguments. [R] [Introduction to a series of articles on “Ethnic representation in Britain,” edited by the authors.

<p>Identifying the effects of political endorsements has historically been difficult. Before the 2008 Democratic presidential primary, B. Obama was endorsed by talk-show host Oprah Winfrey. We assess the impact of this endorsement using, as measures of Winfrey's influence, subscriptions to her magazine and sales of books she recommends. We find that her endorsement increased Obama's votes and financial contributions, and also increased overall voter turnout. No connection is found between the measures of Oprah's influence and previous elections, nor with underlying political preferences. Our results suggest that Winfrey's endorsement was responsible for approximately 1 million additional votes for Obama. [R]</p>

<p>This article examines rising social and political tensions in Qatar as a result of mounting public concerns over Westernization in general and American political and military influence in particular. A survey of 1,000 Qatari citizens in 2011 demonstrates that those Qataris who are most oriented against the US also hold much more negative views of their own government, and are less likely to defer to its policy decisions. Partly as a result, two blockbuster policy moves last year — a 60% rise in Qatari salaries and the announcement of the country's first-ever parliamentary elections in 2013 — not only have failed to provide a boost in popular opinion toward the government, but in fact popular orientations toward the government are even more negative [than] before the decisions were announced in 2011.

<p>The developmental model of voter turnout posits that the propensity to vote (or abstain) is a habit acquired during the period of a young adult's socialization to the electoral process. Once acquired, the habit tends to persist and the individual becomes fairly “immune” to the potential influences hypothesized to affect turnout. In particular, Franklin proposes that electoral context will have a strong impact on those who have no or little experience of voting (or abstaining) in democratic elections but virtually no impact on those whose “electoral experience” is more substantial. Tests of the above crucial hypothesis have focused mostly on the heterogeneous effects of electoral competitiveness (election closeness) on turnout. I point to potential drawbacks of the tests performed so far [and] propose a superior test of experience-conditioned impact of closeness on turnout. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The tripolar competition between the left, the moderate right and the far right was one of the keystones of the electoral order that emerged in France in 1984. Sharply challenged by N. Sarkozy in 2007, the electoral divide between the UMP and the FN was not restored in 2012 despite the recovery of the far right and the high score of Marine Le Pen in the presidential election. While the FN remains isolated in the party system, we argue that the radicalization of the UMP on immigration, law and order, and national identity has confirmed dramatic changes in the geographical distribution and the logics of moderate-right voting. These two dynamics indicate that the UMP electorate and the FN electorate have become closer together. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4349]</p>

<p>I use a computerized experiment to test whether elected officials differ from everyday citizens in how they use information to make political choices. Ninety state and local level elected officials took part in the study, as did 179 adults from the general population. I tracked participants’ information use as they attempted to solve two hypothetical public policy problems. The data show that while elected officials differ from everyday citizens in their demographics and in the consistency of their political views, these groups did not differ systematically in their depth of information search, their proclivity to compare choice alternatives, or their depth of information processing. These findings held across two different public policy scenarios, controlling for differences in political knowledge, education, and elective experience. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article assesses the key factors that influenced the intention to vote in the 2007 presidential election in Kenya, using data from a survey and other external datasets. Ethnicity was found to be one of the main factors. However, access to private and public goods, poverty and differences in wealth across ethnic groups also mattered, depending on how the voter claimed to be self-identified. Those who self-identified in terms of their ethnicity were influenced the most by access to services such as schools, health clinics and police stations, evidence suggesting that voters use ethnicity as a proxy to gauge which candidates will give them greater access to services provided by the state.

<p>We develop an argument about the role of personal economic experiences in the formation of policy attitudes that we validate using a distinctive opinion survey of our own design, fielded not long after the onset of the Great Recession. The survey tracks citizens’ economic experiences, expectations, and policy attitudes within multiple domains of risk (employment, medical care, family, and wealth arrangements). These investigations show that economic insecurity systematically and substantially affects citizens’ attitudes toward government's role. Citizens’ economic worries largely track exposure to substantial economic shocks. Citizens’ policy attitudes in turn appear highly responsive to economic worries, as well as to the experience of economic shocks — with worries and shocks creating greater support for government policies that buffer the relevant economic risk.

<p>The ascendance of the left in Latin America has sparked new interest in the politicization of social class. What factors should scholars consider in choosing and constructing measures of social class in survey research? To what degree can measurement affect results? This article evaluates several common measures in terms of validity and reliability. It then shows that alternative measures produce strikingly different results when examining class voting in Venezuela's 2006 presidential election. Simple measures of household income or wealth, which fare poorly in validity assessment, suggest minimal levels of class voting. Various socioeconomic scales that also incorporate data on education and, in some cases, weights for household composition, suggest very high levels of class voting. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>American politics scholars typically conceptualize representation narrowly as mass-elite policy responsiveness, with many studies identifying factors that hinder that relationship. These findings contrast with the high reelection rates in American legislatures. I show that policy is only one of several dimensions through which legislators provide representation. I unify policy, service, allocation, and descriptive representation in a model of legislators’ priorities and then test it with survey experiments administered to 1,175 state legislators. I posit that legislators systematically emphasize different dimensions to further the goal of reelection. Results show that legislative institutions, district demand, and individual traits structure legislators’ strategic representational priorities. [R]</p>

<p>In the literature, two competing claims can be found on the relationship between political trust and political participation. While some authors argue that trust is a prerequisite for any form of participation to occur, others claim that distrust can be a motivating factor for participation in non-institutionalized forms of participation. The social movement literature suggests that political trust will have these behavioral consequences only if it is associated with sufficiently high levels of political efficacy. We rely on the results of the 2006 European Social Survey for an in-depth analysis of the relationship between political trust and participation in 25 countries. The multilevel regression shows that while political trust is positively associated with institutionalized participation, it is negatively associated with non-institutionalized participation.

<p>Within the literature on the relation between membership in voluntary associations and tolerance, three theoretical perspectives can be distinguished. The socialization perspective assumes that the interaction within association leads to higher levels of tolerance; the self-selection perspective suggests that tolerant actors are more likely to join associations; while the selection and adaption model predicts that the group culture within an association will have a specific effect on members’ attitudes. We use a two-year panel study among Belgian adolescents to ascertain the empirical merits of these three approaches. Results show that not all associations have an effect on the reduction of prejudice, but that this effect is limited to specific associations. A structural equation model furthermore suggests that socialization effects are significantly stronger than self-selection effects. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article draws on longitudinal, ethnographic data gathered in rural Nicaragua over a two-decade period to examine the ideological and political implications of neoliberalism in the prefigurative, grassroots stages of social mobilization. It contrasts divergent path-dependent processes of accommodation and resistance to neoliberalism as Nicaraguan peasants have moved from collectivism to individual farming, with an emphasis on interpretive processes. This study explores how market processes both serve as an external grievance and operate internally in rural communities to reconfigure rural social relations and individual and collective identities. It also develops concepts and interpretations that may be applied more broadly to analyze links between deepening market processes and the forms and content of social movement responses to deteriorating economic conditions.

<p>North Africa and the Middle East were noticeably devoid of popular democracy movements, until early 2011. But with technologies like mobile phones and the internet, people sharing an interest in democracy built extensive networks and activated collective action movements for political change. What might have made regimes more susceptible than others to these uprisings, and what might explain the relative successes of some movements over others? What role does information technology have in the modern recipe for democratization? Weighing multiple political, economic, demographic, and cultural conditions, we find that information infrastructure — especially mobile phone use — consistently appears as one of the key ingredients in parsimonious models for the conjoined combinations of causes behind regime fragility and social movement success.

<p>Theories of instrumental ethnic voting in new democracies propose that voters support co-ethnic politicians because they expect politicians to favor their co-ethnics once in office. But many goods that politicians deliver to voters are locally non-excludable in rural areas, so the local presence of an ethnic group associated with a politician should affect a rural voter's assessment of how likely she is to benefit from that politician's election. Using geocoded polling-station-level election results alongside survey data from Ghana, we show that otherwise similar voters are less likely to vote for the party of their own ethnic group, and more likely to support a party associated with another group, when the local ethnic geography favors the other group. This result helps account for the imperfect correlation between ethnicity and vote-choice in African democracies. [R, abr.]</p>

According to data from the ESRC-funded Scottish Election Study 2011, the SNP won its majority for that most mundane of electoral reasons: most voters thought that the party would do a better job in office than its rivals, including its chief rival, the Labour Party.

<p>Studies of recent British general elections have shown that the amount spent by candidates on their local campaigns was closely linked to the outcome in their constituencies; the more they spent the better their performance. Such research was hampered, however, by the short period for which spending returns were available; campaigning begins long before then. The 2010 election was the first for which candidate spending data were available for a longer period, when candidates could spend about two-and-a-half times as much as the legal limit for the “short campaign” immediately preceding election day. This first detailed analysis of those data addresses variations in the amount spent across constituencies and their impact, focusing on whether spending on the two campaign periods had separate and independent impacts.

<p>This study analyzes changes in individual evaluations of [the US] Congress immediately before and after enactment of national health care reform in 2010.

The results show enactment polarized citizens’ evaluations of Congress, with supporters of the bill increasing their approval of Congress and opponents decreasing.

Second, compared to Turks, they hold higher trust in international institutions. Finally, contrary to the studies on the winner/loser debate in long-standing democracies, winners in general and Kurdish winners, those who voted for the Justice and Development Party, the winning party in the 2007 election — are not distinguishable in their level of trust in political institutions from the rest of society.

<p>South Korea's twenty-five-year-old democracy is a “contentious” one, in which important public matters are often debated and decided through direct contention and confrontation between civil society and the state, without mediation through political parties as is usually the case in many Western “representative” democracies. Popular protests and street demonstrations continue to be a preferred form of political expression in South Korean democracy. The other aspect of Korea's very active civil society is underinstitutionalized and ineffectual political parties. Whether underdeveloped political parties prove to be a temporary problem in an innovative experiment with creating a new type of “contentious democracy,” or a fatal flaw that will undermine South Korean democracy, remains to be seen.

<p>This study examines the moderated relationship between pro-social motivation and job satisfaction. Using data from the cross-national 2005 ISSP survey (14 countries, N = 10,630), it confirms that the relationship between pro-social motivation and job satisfaction is moderated by perceived usefulness of the job for society and other people. Usefulness again depends on the individual's employment sector (public versus private), and this public-private difference in perceived usefulness also varies between different welfare state regimes. This indicates that sector differences in how pro-social motivation affects job satisfaction depends on the broader institutional context, and the article therefore contributes important knowledge for the recruitment and retention of motivated and satisfied employees in a period of changing public-private responsibilities in the provision of welfare services.

While the two main contenders had vigorously fought to occupy the lead position in the first round of voting, for several months Hollande had consistently been the clear leader in the opinion polls to win the decisive run-off. Sarkozy was the first incumbent candidate not to gain pole position in the first round and only the second not to secure reelection, emulating the failure of V. Giscard d'Estaing in 1981.

<p>Criticisms of the system by which the American political parties select their candidates focus on issues of representativeness: how choices are dominated by relatively small numbers of ideologically extreme primary voters, or how residents of small states voting early in the process have disproportionate influence.

Using natural variation in citizens’ levels of political information, I show that citizens who are informed about the partisan alignment of issues have a preference-distribution similar to that of Congress, even after the sample is reweighted to resemble the entire public in their political, social, and demographic characteristics via matching. In contrast, using a survey experiment, I show that cue and argument treatments only partially reduce the discrepancy between the views expressed by the public and the voting behavior of Congress on the same issues.

<p>The study of referendum voting follows much the same format as for general election voting. Influences on vote, however, are likely to differ significantly. Referendums decide issues, while general elections determine which party or parties will form the government. Parties are often divided on referendum issues and these issues tend to be of low salience. General elections, however, are contested by long-established parties on highly salient issues. Using panel data from the British Election Study and the 2011 Alternative Vote Referendum Study, we find that voters place different weights on party identification, issue positions, government and leader evaluations when voting in general elections and referendums, but the evidence for differential campaign effects is limited.

<p>The UK's second nationwide referendum, held in May 2011, offers rich opportunities for analyzing the dynamics of a referendum campaign. The articles gathered together in this symposium address three themes. The first concerns the determinants and dynamics of public opinion during a referendum campaign, the second relates to the potential for interaction between the referendum and simultaneous elections, and the third focuses on coverage of the referendum in the media. Following a brief outline of the background to the referendum, this paper introduces the contribution that each article makes to these themes.

<p>Recently published research contends that concern about immigration is weakening the British political system by creating distrust in the elites and institutions in this system. Some may challenge this finding because the public opinion data used to illustrate this relationship is limited to the period of the recent Labour government, raising the possibility that it was an artifact of that era and thus may no longer hold. Using the most recent round of the European Social Survey (2010–2011), this paper investigates whether this finding holds in the present era. The findings indicate that under the current Conservative-Liberal Democratic government, concern about immigration is still related to negative perceptions of the political system.

<p>This article examines why the political integration and representation of ethnic minority groups may develop along different paths. Taking Amsterdam as a case study, it compares two of the city's most predominant immigrant groups: Turks, who have taken a group-based incorporation strategy, and Moroccans, who have followed a more individualist assimilation strategy. The distinct trajectories have produced a relatively high proportion of Turkish-origin elected officials, while individuals of Moroccan origin feature more prominently in executive office, exercising power over day-to-day decisions. The article proposes that whereas features of the electoral system determine which opportunities exist for immigrants to participate in the political process, it is the structure of an immigrant group that affects the ability of members to seize such opportunities.

<p>This article assesses the seven presidential elections held in Ireland between 1945 and 2011, dividing them into two categories: the four contests from 1945 to 1973 and the three contests from 1990 to 2011. The first category reflects the entirely stable and predictable pattern of party competition that represented politics in Ireland after Fianna Fáil first came to power in 1932. The second category reflects a type of politics in Ireland where presidential elections took place against a backdrop of a changing party system and an increasingly volatile electorate, where ties of party loyalty would loosen substantially over a 20-year period. The presidential contests of 1990, 1997 and 2011 all show evidence of increasing voter disconnect from the party system, and a shift away from the defining features of previous presidential elections.

<p>In the 2012 presidential election, the strong level of turnout broke with the cycle of abstention that had characterized all mid-term elections during N. Sarkozy's presidency. Nevertheless, compared to the 2007 presidential election, turnout decreased among all sections of the population. This article draws on recent electoral surveys conducted by the Cevipof to examine changes in electoral turnout according to the sociological and political characteristics of the different electorates. Comparing the last three presidential elections (2002, 2007 and 2012), it evaluates the shares of sociological and political abstention.

<p>Using data collected from a survey experiment, we examine whether information about the nature of the interactions between the [US] Supreme Court and Congress influences respondents’ assessments of the Court. We find that political sophistication is key to understanding how individuals incorporate the separation of powers context into their evaluations of the Court. Political sophisticates give the Court its highest assessments when told that the Court and Congress are often in disagreement, and that Congress is most responsible for this disagreement. Assessments of the Court are significantly lower, however, when sophisticates believe that high levels of disagreement between the Court and Congress are due to the Court's actions and when these respondents believe that the Court and Congress agree a high proportion of the time.

<p>This article re-examines the politics of engagement of the UK mental health service-user and survivor movement by focusing upon the mental health “expert-by-experience”. Using qualitative data, I illustrate how the service-user and survivor movement is able to draw upon an experiential authority that is rooted in practices of self-help and peer-support. I do this by bringing an experimentalist reading of self-help and peer-support practices into dialogue with a model of traditional authority. As such, the personal can be linked up to the political in ways that emphasize the value of self-help and support practices as forms of political participation, while highlighting modes of engagement that are predicated on the capacities, rather than the needs, of the movement.

<p>Irish presidential elections have sometimes been characterized as part of a “culture war,” where different sides of a cultural and policy space compete for the “soul of Ireland”. Alternatively, voters might choose on the basis of partisan loyalties, candidate characteristics, or as a way of punishing, rewarding or influencing government. This article argues that the 2011 presidential election was almost an ideology-free zone where candidates’ positions on specific issues were less important than their ability to withstand character tests. Despite Higgins's landslide victory, his support was soft, and only came to him after all other candidates had been effectively eliminated from contention by allegations during the campaign.

<p>Recent deliberative democracy experiments have been designed to increase the representativeness of the participants’ sample in terms of the larger population. Sampling and recruitment have assumed a significant role for the success of a deliberative event and the external validity of the results produced during the whole dialogic-deliberative process. Despite the attention to the selection of participants and the use of control systems based on the main socio-demographic variables, people who accept to participate in a deliberative experiment show important differences when compared with individuals who refuse to take part. These differences can significantly affect the qualitative results of the experiment. The article examines the profile of participants in two deliberative polls held in Turin (“The Citizens’ consultation”) and Brussels (“Europolis”) between 2007 and 2009. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>We report the results of a pilot study of the political views and activities of the top one percent or so of US wealth-holders. We find that they are extremely active politically and that they are much more conservative than the American public as a whole with respect to important policies concerning taxation, economic regulation, and especially social welfare programs. Variation within this wealthy group suggests that the top one-tenth of one percent of wealth-holders (people with $40 million or more in net worth) may tend to hold still more conservative views that are even more distinct from those of the general public. We suggest that these distinctive policy preferences may help account for why certain public policies in the US appear to deviate from what the majority of US citizens wants the government to do.

<p>I examine whether associations and other types of social networks contribute to democratic citizenship across East Asia. The analysis shows that association membership is only faintly related to generalized trust and toleration of social diversity, raising doubts about the role of associations as schools for the development of civic virtues. In contrast, association membership is consistently related to modes of political participation, confirming the thesis that associations serve as schools for political activism. The findings suggest that the role of civil society for promoting democracy may vary, depending upon the dimensions of democratic citizenship. For a better understanding of associations as schools of democracy, empirical research should disentangle dimensions of developmental or socialization effects, which may not always go handin-hand.

Respect received much of its support from Muslim voters, although the mere presence of Muslims in a given area was not enough for Respect candidates to get elected. Indeed, despite criticism of the party for courting only Muslims, it did not aim to draw its support from these voters alone. Moreover, its reliance on young people and investment in local campaigning on specific political issues were often in opposition to the traditional ethnic politics. [R]</p>

<p>Two types of data are used to address separate but related questions about the 2011 referendum on the parliamentary voting system.

Second, aggregate data at local authority-level compares participation in and voting preferences at the two electoral events. The combination of evidence suggests that while having coincident local elections helped to boost turnout in the referendum, the impact of local-level campaigning on the referendum outcome was marginal at best.

The famous “we are the 99%” slogan contained a bold claim to construct a new historic bloc. This claim was however not backed up by a corresponding political effort: the movement was not yet able (and willing) to construct its own political formation of a new network type and thus remained stuck on the corporatist level of identity politics.

<p>This paper analyzes the quality of debate surrounding the UK's 2011 electoral reform referendum as represented in the print media. It first considers how debate quality in the context of a referendum campaign may best be conceptualized. It then uses content analysis of media coverage to investigate three aspects of that debate: its quantity; the balance between Yes and No arguments; and the quality of reason-giving. It finds that the quantity of debate was comparable to other recent electoral reform referendums. Coverage was predominantly, but not overwhelmingly, hostile to change. The different indicators of the quality of reason-giving present a mixed picture. The paper considers how the analysis could be extended through further comparison with other cases.

The article maps and explains variations in the extent to which BAME MPs use the Chamber to articulate issues relevant to minority constituents. We compare the content of all parliamentary questions for written answer asked by BAME MPs between May 2005 and December 2011 to the questions asked by a matching sample of non-minority legislators. We find that BAME MPs ask more questions relating to the problems and rights of ethnic minorities in, and immigration to, the UK. However, all British MPs are responsive to the interests of minority constituents where these are geographically concentrated. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4313]</p>

<p>Since at least 2005, Mexico has confronted a severe security crisis that threatens to undermine its rule of law and democracy. An effective police response has been hindered by frustrated citizens who do not report crime, come forward with information, serve as witnesses, or support their police. This foments a vicious cycle whereby insecurity and corruption foster dissatisfaction, which yields further insecurity and corruption. Breaking this cycle requires a better understanding of why citizens are dissatisfied with their police. One view holds that discontent is due to police corruption, but a somewhat rival perspective contends that citizens are primarily concerned with security outcomes. This study uses comparative survey data from 14 major Mexican cities to test these potentially rival approaches. [R, abr.]</p>

Why would large numbers of those entitled to accountability and truth express a preference to “forgive and forget”?

<p>By about 1940, economically-liberal northern white [US] Democratic voters were substantially more pro-civil rights than were economically-conservative northern Republican voters. While partisanship and civil rights views were unrelated among southern whites, economic conservatives were more racially conservative than their economically liberal counterparts, even in the south. These findings suggest that there was a connection between attitudes towards the economic programs of the New Deal and racial liberalism early on, well before national party elites took distinct positions on civil rights. Along with grassroots pressure from African-American voters who increasingly voted Democratic in the 1930s-1940s, this change among white voters likely contributed to northern Democratic politicians’ gradual embrace of civil rights liberalism and Republican politicians’ interest in forging a coalition with conservative white southerners.

The article first outlines immigrant representation in Germany's states over time. It then discusses several possible explanations for the striking variation between states. Rather than one key factor, it is found that interactions between demographic, institutional, cultural and political conditions account for different levels of immigrant representation in Germany's state parliaments.

The results show that knowledge about party positions is very heterogeneous and the amount of misinformation is high. [R, abr.]</p>

The literature on social movements and contentious politics addresses situations of threats or grievances that lead actors to mobilize for collective action.

<p>I address the impact of decentralization on the nationalization of party systems. Many scholars have argued that when a country decentralizes, candidates have greater incentives to compete locally and party system nationalization is eroded. I argue that the impact of decentralization on the nationalization of party systems is conditional on the extent to which electoral law encourages personal voting. When electoral laws are candidate-centered, party labels are not very relevant in politicians’ (re-)election; this makes candidates more likely to compete locally in a decentralized country and to weaken party system nationalization. Through two different indices of nationalization and statistical techniques, I test the robustness of this argument by drawing on data from national legislative elections held in seventeen Western European countries.

To this end, we review 90 empirical studies of individual-level voter turnout in national elections published in ten topjournals during the past decade (2000–2010).

<p>The authors examine the effect of religiosity on intended and recalled voter turnout in presidential elections. They argue that the trade-off between time spent in worship and time spent in political activities, specifically voter turnout, is strongest for mainline Protestants, weaker for Catholics, and nonexistent for evangelical Protestants. Evangelical Protestants increasingly recognize the connection between their religious beliefs and politics, with the result that they have formed a habit of voting. This argument has important implications for American voting behavior literature. Going beyond partisan voting patterns, the findings demonstrate that evangelical Protestants manifest unique patterns as they relate to turnout patterns. [R]</p>

<p>The 2010 election proved critical for ethnic minority representation in Britain. The number of minority MPs reached an unprecedented high. Furthermore, the virtual monopoly of the Labour party on minority parliamentary representation ended. In explaining this development, this article — instead of discussing disadvantages facing minority candidates — [examines] the role of the political parties. It argues that a new commitment to increased minority representation exists and shows, on the basis of new data, that in the 2010 election both Labour and Conservatives employed a variety of strategies for increasing ethnic minority representation. The strategy to select more minority candidates in “white” seats was not only a key to increasing the numbers of minority MPs, but also signals a departure from the traditional pattern of ethnic minority politicians being elected by ethnic minorities.

<p>There are many reasons why political parties can take the racial and ethnic minority voters for granted in Britain. They vote overwhelmingly and loyally for the left-wing parties, have fewer resources than white voters and they mostly live in geographical clusters giving them electoral leverage in a limited number of seats. Yet, minorities participate as much as the white population and seem to do more so in areas of ethnic concentration. Using the British Election Study, Ethnic Minorities British Election Study, British campaign spending data and the electoral agent's survey from 2010 election, we explore the relationship between party campaigning, individual mobilization and ethnic population density. We find that although minorities perceive less contact, parties campaign just as hard (or harder) in areas of minority concentration and they target minority voters in these areas.

<p>Western democracies, with their increasingly diverse racial and ethnic populations, are seeing more political candidates who are non-white. How do these non-white candidates fare at the ballot box? Does their non-white status mean they gain or lose votes? Do their challengers gain or lose votes? In recent work on the US case, it appears that candidate B. Obama lost votes in 2008 because of his non-white status. The research question we address here is whether, in the context of the 2010 UK parliamentary elections, the race or ethnicity of the candidates played a role in the vote totals. What we find is that, while in some ways race does not matter, in other ways it does. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4313]</p>

<p>This essay makes two key arguments. The first is that pre-emptive politics often rely on strategies of rhetorical irony to cultivate perceptions of reasonableness, humility, and dialectical transcendence. As such, I expand the rhetorical conception of S. Skowronek's “political time” thesis to reveal its dimensions as a Burkean “ironic development”. The second argument is that B. Obama's rhetorical strategy more directly fits the typology of pre-emptive presidents than that of reconstructive presidents, making him far more comparable in “political time” with R. Nixon than with R. Reagan. I analyze the two presidential candidates’ rhetoric in their first winning campaigns for the presidency to discern the extent of these parallels and reveal the applicability of an ironist political style in preemptive electoral situations.

<p>There is a debate in the literature on referendum voting as to whether these occasions are opportunities for voters to express issue-preferences in the absence of partisan politics or whether they simply serve as referendums on the current government. In part, this latter, second-order account is assumed to be driven by the amount and content of media coverage, and hence information about the referendum, that is available to voters. We address the second-order question and demonstrate that holding elections concurrently both reduces the amount of media attention to the second-order contest — the AV referendum in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland where national elections were held — and moderates media priming, thereby affecting the salient cues in the decision-making of voters in those contexts.

<p>Deterministic explanations rooted in structural endowments, whether material or social, that are present only at the beginning of an organization's evolution, cannot account for change over time. To fully understand the variation in the outcomes of counterinsurgent campaigns against similarly armed non-state actors, it is necessary to take a step backward in the casual chain to examine how these resources were acquired in the first place. A comparison between Hezbollah's resource-acquisition strategies during its earlier years and during the period leading up to the July War allows for an analysis of this dynamic. While during the Lebanese civil war, the movement's coercive behavior limited its performance, its reduced use of coercion after the civil war meant that by 2006, the movement was far more effective.

<p>Examining trends from 1952 to 2004 demonstrates that the electorate is now more opinionated about the parties than in the recent past, but that a significant portion of the increase is in the form of negative statements about an individual's party — there are fewer indifferent individuals, but the electorate is not overwhelmingly more one-sided, instead there has been an increase in both the proportion of one-sided and ambivalent individuals. It is next examined if the intensity of one's ideological and partisan self-identification influences how they respond to elite polarization. The results suggest that non-ideologues and pure independents are more likely to be indifferent; all other groups have shown a decline in the likelihood of being indifferent and an increase in ambivalence.

<p>Differences between white and Black, Asian and other minority ethnic (BAME) local election candidates in Britain are examined using survey data. BAME candidates are more likely to be younger and better educated but fewer women are recruited from among this group. Such candidates are electorally inexperienced, have stronger ties with community-related organizations and are more likely to make their own decision to stand for election rather than being approached by a fellow party member. Community ties are also evident when respondents are asked about their support network upon becoming a candidate with almost two-thirds of BAME candidates experiencing positive support from this quarter.

<p>[French] Voting and voters have changed. The growing level of hesitation, the ups and downs of turnout but also of partisan support are clear proof. This article [examines] this “new deal” by presenting and using the voting probability questions. These questions present a very different portrait of voters than the one drawn by the classical voting intentions questions. Negative logic of voting appears as is the space of voting possibilities of individuals. Furthermore, they shed new light on the dynamics of the 2012 presidential campaign and on the ongoing ideological reconfiguration both on the left and on the right. These analyses are based on the <italic>TriÉlec</italic> surveys conducted between July 2011 and March 2012. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4349]</p>

<p>France lags behind most other Western countries in its degree of ethnic representation, despite the longstanding presence of non-Western minorities in the country. French politicians and the public usually justify this situation by arguing that there are no such things as ethnic minorities in France, and therefore no particular ‘ethnic minority’ interests. Consequently, there is no need to be concerned about ethnic representation; class representation is enough. More recently, attention has centred on the presence of Islam. This frame biases political attention to religious issues related to ethnic minorities, leaving aside major problems such as racial discrimination. In contrast, this article argues that France is very similar to America when it comes to ethnic politics, particularly when analysing the political orientations of non-Western minorities. Without a proper voice to articulate their claims, ethnic minorities see their interests neglected in favour of other issues. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4288]</p>

<p>The rise of Salafism in Tunisia confirms the appeal that Political Islam enjoys across the Arab world.

<p>When the close working relationship between Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and Reza Shah Pahlavi under the common goal of secular modernization ended with the Islamic Revolution of 1979, Iran actively tried to destabilize Turkey's secular regime by arming and supporting the separatist Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), hoping to soften Turkey's secularist resistance to the ideals of the Islamic Revolution. Turkey's Sunni Islamists tried to actively cultivate relations with their sectarian “other,” Shiite Iran. Nevertheless, two critical events changed Turkish-Iranian relations for the better: Turkey's threat to invade Syria in 1998 and the 2003 Iraq War and the subsequent deterioration of US-Turkish relations. As a direct product of the Arab Spring, however, Turkish Islamists’ outlook towards Syria and Iran also changed. [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4108]</p>

<p>This time-series study combines a content-analysis of media appearances of the right-wing populist leader G. Wilders in 2006 with his party's popularity in the polls. The content-analysis focuses on three aspects of the media coverage: (1) visibility, (2) whether he articulates a vision for the future, and (3) his self-confidence. Wilders was selected because as a leader without a party he represents the most likely case to find media effects. Var-analysis showed a significant positive effect of “vision” on media attention, and a negative effect of popularity in the polls on visibility in the media. Yet, the study finds little support for the “leadership hypothesis,” and thus contributes to literature showing that the effects of the representation of political leaders in the media are more limited than often assumed.

<p>Historically, women had been relegated to the private realm, not being allowed to have access to the public sphere where civil society developed. Eventually, women were acknowledged as legal subjects. Nevertheless, the women's presence in the public sphere is still limited and obstructed.

Formal advances in legislation are not enough to guarantee equity, until there is improvement in “empowerment”. [R, abr.]</p>

After reviewing different types of campaigning strategies and introducing a new and distinct strategy, this descriptive and exploratory study focuses on political candidates’ use of micro-blogging and online social networking (i.e., Twitter) from a longitudinal, social network, and ideological perspective. The results clearly show that most candidates in 2009 still used <italic>Twitter</italic> reluctantly. Those who used Twitter did so predominantly for electoral campaigning and only sparingly for continuous campaigning. Candidates from progressive parties are the most active users of Twitter as a campaigning tool, whereas conservatives are virtually absent online. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Campaigning in the British Electoral System Referendum of 2011 provoked much controversy. Accusations of negativity and dissemination of misinformation came from both sides. Using panel data spanning the crucial period of the campaign, this paper examines shifts in perceptions and intentions associated with information and opinion. First, it takes into account “baseline” effects such as initial partisan cues. Then, in the context of criticism of the low quality information content of the campaign, it asks how much changes in the attitudes of respondents affected electoral system opinion, and the extent to which these changes reflected learning and the provision of information or misinformation. The roles of the Electoral Commission, television coverage, and newspapers are also examined. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4343]</p>

<p>There has been a scarcity of work examining the political consequences of discrete emotions. This article examines the political effects of several emotions: anger, sadness, fear, and enthusiasm. Emotional ads should influence whether voters become politically active. To test this, two experiments were administered. The first examines emotional responses to campaign messages; the second tests whether emotions influence political participation. The results indicate anger is mobilizing, by increasing participatory intentions and factors related to participate. This result is then replicated using ad-tracking data. The findings indicate that emotions are an important factor in studying campaign effects. [R]</p>

<p>This article explores how the potent, alluring image of J. Kennedy was constructed. It examines how, even before reaching the White House, Kennedy was able to develop a multi-faceted image as a man of letters, military hero, precocious politician, erotic symbol and symbol of the family. The importance of image to the outcome of the 1960 presidential campaign is assessed. His presidency is examined for the way it reinforced ideas about him that had come to the fore before he became chief executive. The impact of the assassination is considered for the way it created the Camelot mythology that came to adorn Kennedy's posthumous reputation. How Kennedy's image was sustained from the time of the assassination to recent years is also be examined. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>How does party support converge on the eventual election outcome? Do preferences evolve in a patterned and understandable way? What role does the official election campaign period play? We outline an empirical analysis relating poll results over the course of the election cycle and the final vote for the three main political parties. Then we examine the relationship relying on vote-intention polls for the seventeen British general elections between 1950 and 2010. Predictably, polls become increasingly informative about the vote over the election cycle. More surprisingly, early polls contain substantial information about the final outcome, much more than we see in presidential and congressional elections in the US. The final outcome in Britain comes into focus over the long campaign and is largely in place well before the official election campaign begins. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The essay reviews scholarly debates on civil society in contemporary China and points out the assumptions and the lack of empirical knowledge about normative orientations and collective identity among Chinese social activists and NGO leaders. It investigates the level of collectiveness within the civil-society sector by examining the political orientations among activists and their alliances with intellectuals who clearly hold competing principles and ideologies. The main findings suggest a Chinese-style developmental trajectory of civil society that is different from the Eastern-Central European experience prior to the 1990s.

<p>The past two decades have witnessed the unprecedented proliferation of civil-society organizations across China. Yet this proliferation has led neither to the formation of a strong political opposition, nor to any organized anti-systemic social movement. I argue that this is due to the unique characteristics of the post-Mao Chinese civil society — including its functional depoliticization, conformity to the ruling regime, supplemental role in service-provision, symbiotic relationship with the local authorities, as well as the lack of an engaged intelligentsia who can provide guidance and assume leadership. Combining with the consistent partystate control and the distance between Chinese civil society and the country's burgeoning contentious movements at the grassroots, the inherent weaknesses of contemporary Chinese civil society may have predetermined its limited potential in affecting systematic political change.

<p>Public preferences on immigration and attitudes toward the EU have been shown to be closely related. To better understand this relationship, people's opposition to immigration should be differentiated based on the ethnicity of the prospective immigrant group. Specifically, in the case of Germany, Turkish immigrants constitute a special case. The results of the original survey experiment conducted in Germany suggest that, controlling for other explanations, categorizing immigration attitudes by ethnic group reveals that fear of EU enlargement and future Turkish immigration is actually a more important reason for Euroskepticism than has been shown so far. That is, people's opposition to immigrants from Turkey explains their overall Euroskepticism much better than their attitudes toward immigrants from within EU member states.

Evidence from field research suggests that minority council elections reflect the situation of intra-ethnic competition and provide an additional arena for ethnic outbidding for new ethnic parties.

<p>The article analyzes executive-legislative relations in Uruguay between 1985 and 2005. Even after controlling for ideological affinity and acknowledging that ideology affects presence in the cabinet, legislators whose factions hold ministerial positions behave in a more pro-government way than their ideology would predict. This result not only shows that coalitions “work” but suggests that they work because the presidents use resources under their control to attract support from legislators. This article presents a systematic analysis of executivelegislative relations in multiparty settings that builds on the finding that non-ideologically contiguous coalitions often form to separate the ideological from the strategic determinants of legislative behavior.
