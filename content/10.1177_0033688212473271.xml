<abstract>
<p>This pilot study explores language development among a class of L2 students who were required to transcribe and reflect upon spoken performances. The class was given tasks for self and peer-evaluation and afforded the opportunity to assume more responsibility for assessing language development of both themselves and their peers. Several studies (Lynch, 2001; Lynch, 2007; Mennim, 2003) have promoted the use of student transcription activities to help students make their output ‘more comprehensible, elaborate or sophisticated’ (Stillwell et al., 2010: 446) and reflection and reflective learning models have been described as key psychological components of autonomy (Benson, 2011: 104; Kohonen,1992). In examining these concepts, this study focuses on students’ perceived input, or noticing of weaknesses in their speaking skills as evidenced through transcription activities. The research shows how transcription and reflective practice can help support the development of noticing, arguably a key element in the autonomous acquisition of new language and language development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The noticing hypothesis states that ‘what learners notice in input is what becomes intake for learning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0033688212473271">Schmidt, 1995</xref>: 20) and that becoming aware of the regularities which govern the use of language structures aids in the internalization of these patterns. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0033688212473271">Schmidt and Frota (1986)</xref> further suggest that in order for input to become intake, learners are required to ‘make a comparison between their observed input and typical output based on their current interlanguage system’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0033688212473271">Cross, 2002</xref>). In other words, students must observe or, to use Schmidt and Frota’s term, ‘notice the gap’ between their current skill set and what they wish to learn, and in doing so be able to ‘reflect on what is noticed, endeavour to understand its significance and experience insight’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0033688212473271">Cross, 2002</xref>). However, noticing need not be a purely passive activity and indeed the teacher has a role to help students to notice appropriate/inappropriate language structures they are unlikely to notice on their own, by means of pedagogical tasks that can encourage oral output that can be examined. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0033688212473271">Swain (1995</xref>: 125-26), in addressing the importance of output in the language development process, argues that:
<disp-quote>
<p>in producing the target language (vocally or subvocally) learners may notice a gap between what they <italic>want</italic> to say and what they <italic>can</italic> say, leading them to recognize what they do not know, or know only partially. In other words, under some circumstances, the activity of producing the target language may prompt second language learners to consciously recognize some of their linguistic problems; it may bring to their attention something they need to discover about their L2.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Swain here is promoting reflection on oral output, but with the onus put upon the students to notice the gap between planned and actual performance. According to Swain, the noticing of the gap in output may (sometimes) lead students to become aware of areas to improve and subsequently to effect repair. However, the experience of the author is that students seldom incline to reflect upon their output and unless guided to do so by the teacher, may miss opportunities to develop their language competence by themselves. The argument of this paper is that the introduction of autonomous practices, engendered through transcription activities and reflective practice might allow students greater opportunity to reflect upon their own and their classmates’ performance and begin to incorporate more collaborative elements, such as inviting others to share their opinions or to demonstrate misunderstanding into their speech. In addition, this study examined whether the use of these activities would complement the collaborative environment of the class and promote peer evaluation and feedback.</p>

<sec id="section2-0033688212473271">
<title>Learner Autonomy and Reflective Practice</title>
<p>Rather than requiring the process of transferring the reins of responsibility for learning to the learner in a one-step process, autonomy is recognized as being a complex and difficult process when individual personalities and learning traits are taken into account. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0033688212473271">Benson (2011</xref>: 124), autonomy and autonomous learning is ‘learning in which the learners demonstrate a capacity to control their learning’ and in which autonomous behaviour is developed through practice in modes of learning which help to promote self-direction. This is not to belittle the teacher’s role in the classroom or to synonimize autonomy with self-instruction, nor does it suggest a one-size-fits-all mode of learning but rather it proposes that the creation of a programme in which the capacity for autonomous activity exists might aid in the development of the autonomous learner. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0033688212473271">Little (1997</xref>: 94) contends that a key psychological component of autonomy is conscious reflection ‘for the single reason that all formal learning is the result of deliberate intention’. Reflection is seen as a vital component within a cyclical process of learning, such as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0033688212473271">Kohonen’s (1992</xref>: 29) experiential language learning theory in which much value is placed on a feedback loop, ‘a continuous recycling of experience, reflection, conceptualization and active experimentation’. The experiential model encourages authentic language use, rather than, for example, reproductions of text-based exchanges, and for this authentic language to be shared in a ‘team environment where learners celebrate each others’ successes and provide assistance to each other [which is] likely to promote more positive peer relationships, social support … higher self esteem and academic achievements’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0033688212473271">1992</xref>: 34). For Kohonen, the concept of self-evaluation alone or with peers in cooperative learning groups is the key to developing confident learners who can celebrate the act of successful communication with their peers. The theory places importance and value on learners’ subjective experiences, attitudes and feelings regarding their own learning, proposing that by enhancing the learners’ own view of themselves and their developing abilities, they may become better learners.</p>
<p>When considering the nature of (negative) feedback offered to students in the L2 classroom, real-time strategies may be employed. Examples of this are explicit feedback, in which teacher or peers correct a speaker, or implicit feedback, such as when a teacher will simply recast or rephrase erroneous speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0033688212473271">Sakai, 2011</xref>). In examining the processes of self-correction, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0033688212473271">Swain and Lapkin’s 1995</xref> study examined students’ voiced reflection while writing in an L2 (in the case of that study, French). That study revealed the mental processing patterns of the students as they paid attention to form in their output. The exercise required and allowed the students to consolidate their existing L2 knowledge and even to ‘work out a new solution, resulting in new, reprocessed output’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0033688212473271">Swain and Lapkin, 1995</xref>: 386). A potential downside to these models of correction, however, is that the advice given and the mental processes being measured are occurring in real time. By contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0033688212473271">Lynch (2007</xref>: 311-12) proposes that ‘learners understandably focus their attention on the content of what they are about to say, rather than on potentially helpful signals from their interlocutor about what they have already said’. With this idea in mind, it was considered that reflection on post-talk language use through visible reproduction of the speakers output via transcription activities would increase opportunities for students to notice errors, allowing for deeper, reflective processing of the errors encountered. In other words, an utterance which might have sounded error-free in the original performance could be revealed to be problematic once the speech is committed to the written page. It was believed that transcription would be a task that, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0033688212473271">Lynch (2007)</xref> found, would be both simple to administer and manage, taking up little class time and with little need for instruction. This study therefore focused on autonomous reflection of spoken utterances post speaking performance and on co-constructed solutions to problematic utterances provided through group discussions of output.</p>
<p>This preliminary foray into the effectiveness and viability of autonomous study through transcription and reflective practice asked the following research questions:</p>
<list id="list1-0033688212473271" list-type="roman-lower">
<list-item><p>Through transcription tasks, do students become aware of weaknesses in their speaking?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Through subsequent recordings and transcriptions, are these weaknesses revisited and/or remedied?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Do students perceive the task to be beneficial?</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0033688212473271" sec-type="methods">
<title>Setting and Method</title>
<p>The students in the study were university sophomore double-language majors. The students were studying in the International Languages and Communication (ILC) department of a private university in Chiba, Japan. The class consisted of 23 female and five male students, studying a content-based curriculum. The students had been in the same classroom group since the first semester and had formed tight-knit groups of individuals who sat together in many of the classes they shared.</p>
<p>Every second week over a period of ten weeks, a series of contentious questions and topics were posed, which it was hoped would be of pertinence and interest to and therefore promote interaction among these students. Examples are: ‘<italic>The drinking age should be lowered to 18’ and ‘University students should be encouraged to wear a uniform’</italic>. By not introducing the themes before the recording, it was hoped that spontaneous student/student conversation could be evoked and captured on the recordings. It was also hoped that the short amount of time given over to the recording and discussion process described below would ensure that the study did not interfere with the students’ regular curriculum in place.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0033688212473271">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>The students from each class were divided into groups of five or six and the conversation of each group stemming from the set question/topic was recorded onto MP3 recorders. The students were recorded for six minutes, with the teacher in charge of the timing, indicating the beginning and ending of the recording period, or when to press ‘record’ and ‘stop’ on the recorders. Following the recording, the class proceeded with the regular curriculum as normal. After the class, the recordings were uploaded to the class’ Moodle page, under specific group names. The students were asked to access their group’s MP3 recording outside of class time and transcribe the complete spoken interactions of their group along with a completed associated comment sheet (see below and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0033688212473271">Appendix i</xref>) within one week. Students reported that on average, the transcription tasks took approximately 35 minutes to complete. Regarding transcription protocol, the students were required to write the name of the speaker next to that person’s utterance, and write the speech <italic>ad verbatim</italic> in English or Japanese. The only other direction given to the students regarding the transcription convention was for them to mark three dots […] to indicate long pauses made during an utterance. It was hoped that these transcription conventions would be simple enough for all students to follow and remember. To verify this supposition, the students were required to carry out an initial dummy recording and transcribe it in class as a group. The students were asked to check that their group’s annotations were identical. The teacher also checked these in class to verify that all students had transcribed as the task required. Regular in-class checking of the completed transcription sheets showed that all students in the class continued to follow the conventions as directed. Finally, a levy of 20 percent of the students’ final grade was placed on completion of the 5 transcription sheets, to help encourage completion by all members of the class. None of the students in the class had carried out any transcription activities of this type previously although they had carried out some teacher-led dictation practice exercises (in which students were asked to transcribe a part of speech spoken by a teacher) once a week for one semester in their freshman year. In this freshman class, however, no transcription conventions had been taught.</p>
<p>In addition to the transcriptions, students were guided to notice different aspects of their group conversation by writing their responses to the following questions and prompts on an attached comments sheet:</p>
<list id="list2-0033688212473271" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>How many words did you say?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Was this more or fewer than your classmates?</p>
<p><italic>(these 2 sections were gauged by a simple word-count of students’ own and their group member’s utterances)</italic></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Think of one good thing about your English speaking (example: Good pronunciation? Didn’t use Japanese? Didn’t pause (unnaturally)? Spoke naturally? Fluent?)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Think of one good thing about the English speaking of your group members. (example: Good pronunciation? Didn’t use Japanese? Didn’t pause (unnaturally)? Spoke naturally? Fluent?)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Do you think your spoken performance after doing the task improved over last time? Why do you think so?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Think of something about your spoken performance that you would like to improve next time.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Before each subsequent recording, the students were asked in a learner-led and learner-centred feedback session to share the comments they had made regarding the recording performances with their group. It was hoped that this session would allow students to reflect once more on their own weaknesses, give support and suggestions regarding salient strong and weak points in each others’ output and incorporate these comments into future performances. The students did not hand the transcription or comment sheets to the teacher until the end of the research period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0033688212473271">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>At the end of the ten-week research period, the five transcription and comment sheets were collected from each student and the comments were examined for subjective analysis of each student’s performance. The first finding is that all students were able to highlight weaknesses in their speaking throughout the research period. Each comment below comes from a different group in the class:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Kenji:</speaker>
<p>‘I’d like to improve my pronunciation – I was surprised at my bad English, but this time I could notice that. Also I want to improve my listening skill – I sometimes couldn’t listen to our conversation.’</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Saki:</speaker>
<p>‘My pronunciation is very bad and my speaking is too slow. Next time I want to speak clearly for easy to listen.’</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Yujiro:</speaker>
<p>‘I had many mistakes for grammar and vocabulary and my speaking was unnatural.’</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Miyuki:</speaker>
<p>‘It was not good because I couldn’t speak enough.’</p>
</speech>
<p>In addition to speaking performance, the students also noticed weaknesses in their group work during the recording:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Manami:</speaker>
<p>‘I noticed that when I speak something, I cannot finish sentences. We needed to pay attention to our group members in order to say our opinions.’</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Haruka:</speaker>
<p>‘(student x) made quick responses when somebody said something. I think it is very good because when somebody makes quick responses, I would be able to know that the person is listening to me.’</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Maasa:</speaker>
<p>‘I want to adopt this time’s good point from other persons. I want to try to say comment, reactions, questions.’</p>
</speech>
<p>The students’ responses overwhelmingly focused on the good points of their group members’ performances and how they might learn from those members, rather than praising their own performance.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Yuka:</speaker>
<p>‘I thought (student x) was good because her speaking was natural and she could say many words in one time. I wanna be like her who can say many opinions.’</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Tomoki:</speaker>
<p>‘I think (student x) speaks effectively. It’s not fluent but it’s important to improve our English.’</p>
</speech>
<p>Possible reasons for this relate to the Japanese cultural values of <italic>honne</italic> (the expression of one’s true feelings in actions or words), <italic>tatamae</italic> (socially tuned motives, intentions or speech) and <italic>aimai</italic> – a state of mind which favours group harmony and compromise. It might be surmised that a situation in which the spirit of <italic>aimai</italic> is neglected is to go against established social norms, and that to ‘… express oneself distinctly carries the assumption that one’s partner knows nothing, so clear expression can be considered impolite’ (Morimoto cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0033688212473271">Davies and Ikeno, 2002</xref>:11). Clearly, in seeking to address these issues in future classes and research, the large number of variables at play in the sociocultural context of the classroom will have to be taken into account.</p>
<p>Examination of student comments revealed that the group feedback sessions and revisiting their own comments regarding what they would like to improve upon in subsequent recordings was effective in promoting improvement in areas the students had identified as weaknesses. The following comments are taken from students’ sequential recording sessions:</p>
<list id="list3-0033688212473271" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Kana (taken from comments regarding recording 3)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>‘I think I could improve my pronunciation little bit. And didn’t pause but I said few words not long sentence.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Kana (taken from comments regarding recording 4)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>‘My pronunciation is getting better I think. And I think less pausing in our conversation.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Kana (taken from comments regarding recording 5)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>‘I could say little bit longer sentence. That’s nice to keep conversation, I think. My group member spoke longer sentence without pause. That’s real conversation.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Chie (taken from comments regarding recording 1)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>‘I didn’t use Japanese. I didn’t pause. I’d like to speak more in the next speaking journal. I also want to try to speak sentences, not just words.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Chie (taken from comments regarding recording 3)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>‘I spoke more than last time and tried speaking sentences.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Chie (taken from comments regarding recording 5)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>‘I was able to say my opinion using sentence, not just words or short sentences’.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Nao (taken from comments regarding recording 2)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>‘This time a chance which say my opinions were increase. If I can speak English more naturally and say long sentence, I’ll be able to make more good conversation so I want to try in the next time.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Nao (taken from comments regarding recording 4)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>‘I wasn’t naturally and made a lot of mistakes about grammar. I thought this time was bad speaking for me so next time I’ll try to say opinion first and I should take part more in the talking.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Nao (taken from comments regarding recording 5)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>‘This time I said long sentences than last time!!! So I could improve my speaking.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Other students mentioned ways in which they thought they might be able to improve in subsequent performances:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Mai:</speaker>
<p>‘I’d like to improve my pronunciation seriously. I’ll go to the language centre’.</p>
</speech>
<p>Examination of the comments showed that students felt positive about transcribing, citing using the process as useful in being able to gauge improvement in their performance.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Hide:</speaker>
<p>‘I said longer sentences than last time, so I could improve my speaking.’</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Misaki:</speaker>
<p>‘I exerted myself to speak naturally and a lot. I became don’t be afraid mistakes because I could speak more. Also I can know my mistakes’.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Shoko:</speaker>
<p>‘I could take a positive attitude than before because I listen carefully and tell the opinion and I could speak more naturally. This way is good way to know our weak point, I think’.</p>
</speech>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although it was hoped that group dynamics and feedback sessions would assist in creating an atmosphere in which all group members would feel willing to contribute to the discussion at hand, it is important to assume that individual performances within each group may have affected group performance. This may have occurred by having more gifted/vocal L2 speakers act as a catalyst to encourage the other group members to participate to a lesser or greater degree in different recording sessions. In addition, the willingness of students to engage with each other in the subject material which had been set could have affected participation. That is, if students <italic>were</italic> motivated to talk about the teacher-created materials, they might have interacted ‘successfully’ and extended the activity by seeking interaction from other members and thus increasing their output and opportunities for targeted ‘improvements’ in subsequent performances. However, if the students were unmotivated by the task, they might have simply looked to complete it without concern for discussion, progression or extension of the topic. Being expected to ‘perform’ at a specified point and for a certain amount of time, distinct from the regular content and rhythm of the class, might also have impeded performance. Clearly, the group dynamics at play and variations and reactions to the topics posed as springboards for communication will need to be examined in future studies.</p>
<p>Future research, outside the scope of this article, will also seek to address improvements and adjustments to the methodology with the following variables to be considered:</p>
<list id="list4-0033688212473271" list-type="roman-lower">
<list-item><p>Although one of the intentions of the study was to try to limit the time taken up by the recording and discussion process, it would be of value to draw students’ attention to the results of the study and to assist in helping students better pinpoint weaknesses made in their output. In its current state, students are merely noticing their errors and are asked, in a rather abstract manner, to consider correcting/improving them in future performances. Consolidation through materials or tasks, as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0033688212473271">Skehan (2003</xref>: 149), could help ‘enable them to relate to aspects of language which have been made more salient, and, where gaps have been noticed, to realizations of how such gaps can be filled’.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The transcription activity could be used in a variety of classroom scenarios, rather than simply ‘staged’ activities such as in this study which could uncover other situational student errors.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Videotaping performances might show pertinent group dynamics such as dominant speakers and use of gestures to convey meaning, which may not be evident from examination of the recordings or written transcripts alone. Feedback sessions regarding these video recordings could help students better understand their performance in the activity under examination and aid in greater participation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>More extensive discourse analysis could be carried out on the student recordings, examining cross-linguistic choices and signs of conspicuous cognitive activity, as students seek out the ‘correct’ word. These findings could help students better identify weaknesses and/or inform future classroom instruction.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Students could be observed and recorded during the group feedback sessions and these observations and recordings shared with the students to aid in demonstrating how a more meaningful exchange of ideas might be generated.</p></list-item>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The aim of this preliminary study has been to examine the benefits of introducing autonomous practice through transcription and reflective practice to the classroom. The task constructs and data analysis have been relatively elementary but the study clearly shows promise regarding the benefits perceived by students. The comments from the class under study showed students finding value in noticing through transcription tasks and in reflecting on their output. The comments indicate that activities that promoted reflective practice and which gave students the opportunity to reflect upon ways on which to improve their interaction and evaluate self and peer performance offered them a previously undiscovered avenue of responsibility that was positively perceived.</p>
