<p>We are greatly indebted to Dr Gillian Eriksson for the time she has spent as Guest Editor for this issue, and also for the deep, front-line expertise she has brought to the articles based on a range of new learning/teaching technologies, and various modes of virtual learning. It is fitting that an issue of <italic>Gifted Education International</italic> addresses concerns and programs that set new trends for future learning and teaching, and we feel that this particular issue tackles cutting-edge issues of virtual education.</p>
<p>However, we need to balance the educational potential now offered by the technological world with the potential of the power of humanity collectively expressed through affective and spiritual relationships. The interaction between teacher and learner must be a living, dynamic one: the teacher must actively engage with the learner and the learner must realise that the teacher believes in his/her capacity to learn.</p>
<p>Gillian Eriksson reviews the current and future trends with regard to intelligent search engines, virtual selves, biological monitors, new language terms and abbreviations, expert systems, individuals constructing information, resurgence of ethnic connections and asynchronous learning. Her paper examines how these current innovations have produced social and educational changes that have, and will continue to, impact and transform our students around the world, our teaching practices and our concepts of giftedness. She examines school reform, reviews the latest thinking on the impact of new technology on the brain and examines trends in technology. The latter part of Eriksson’s paper examines the impact of new technologies on gifted education in terms of the six Ps: the Power, the Person, the Places, the Practices, the Productivity and the Projections.</p>
<p>Joe Renzulli and Sally Reis describe the Renzulli Learning System (RLS), an Internet-based enrichment program based on a high-end learning theory that focuses on the development of creative productivity through the <italic>application </italic>of knowledge rather than the mere acquisition and storage of knowledge. Steps include: <italic>Strength Assessment Using the Electronic Learning Profile</italic>,<italic> Enrichment Differentiation Databases</italic>,<italic> The Wizard Project Maker </italic>and <italic>The Total Talent Portfolio. </italic>The goal in this approach to learning is to promote high levels of engagement by providing a vehicle that enables students’ engagement in <italic>thinking, feeling</italic> <italic>and doing like practicing professionals</italic>, even if they are operating at a more junior level than adult scientists, artists, writers, engineers or other adults who pursue knowledge in professional ways.<bold> </bold>Research on the role of student engagement is clear and unequivocal – high engagement results in higher achievement, improved self-concept and self-efficacy and more favorable attitudes toward school and learning. This approach is able to differentiate and include new literacies that are inquiry based<bold> </bold>through software that focuses on the <italic>application </italic>of knowledge to creative productivity and investigative research projects that promote high levels of student engagement.</p>
<p>Gillian Eriksson, Christine Weber and Lauri Kirsch explore a range of ever-unfolding technologies, such as text messaging, blogging, social networking, personal webpages, video pods, streamed television, online textbooks, online knowledge base, web searching, presentation tools, desktop publishing, graphics infused in word processing, simulations and complex gaming. The writers also comment that the technology literacy of most teachers is in ‘catch-up mode’ with constant retraining about how to provide curricula that include webquests, virtual field trips, virtual passports, interactive maps (Google Earth) and webliography (TrackStar), presented in diverse formats.</p>
<p>Belle Wallace clarifies how the technology tools of e-learning can engage, support and extend thinking and problem-solving through the TASC Problem-solving Framework. Software such as the TASC Image Bank, containing the bold visual design and the vibrant colors of the TASC Wheel, can be captured and modified for use by the teacher, and TASC Interactive allows for dynamic interaction between teacher, learners and parents. The principle of providing ‘inclusion with differentiation’ is put into practice as students work individually or in groups on investigations of problems and research projects, using online resources and documenting their thinking processes. Alessio Bernadelli contributes to this paper with recommendations for effective and pedagogically sound use of technology in education, and a case study of Ropley Primary School (UK) using Studywiz with sixth-year students demonstrates how TASC is embedded in meeting curriculum goals and engaging students in addressing a community problem. Belle Wallace reminds us that real-world experiences are of most value as students reflect on their own thinking, and that the online technology is but one of many tools for learning.</p>
<p>The article by Lisa Dieker, Kelly Grillo and Nirmala Ramlakhan provides a summary of the use of simulated and virtual learning in a summer camp experience provided to 108 gifted students from diverse low socioeconomic backgrounds. This camp aimed to expose talented youth to future careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields through virtual environments. Through collaboration of several departments and partners, and the use of the Media Convergence Lab (MCL) at the University of Central Florida (UCF), a series of experiential learning landscapes provided interactive and immersive simulated environments. Using TeachMe™, a teacher preparation simulation tool, students engaged with simulators and computers in a collaborative, problem-solving setting to focus on what is required to become competitive in the STEM job market. University partners hosted an assortment of hands-on activities that included student exploration in TeachMe™, behind-the-scenes simulation training at Institute for Simulation Training (IST) and interactions with simulators and engineers at Lockheed Martin Simulation and Training Systems (LMSTS) in Orlando.</p>
<p>Glenda Gunter and Robert Kenny show how the use of media technology can motivate students to read while increasing self-efficacy: the authors suggest that technologies/media that are properly integrated into the reading curriculum can offer assistance to twice-exceptional students in reaching greater academic achievement. In initial sessions, students use mediated building blocks to develop their own personal video-based stories (‘<italic>meStories</italic>’). Once students develop their personal sense for story, the formalisms of vocabulary and writing structures are introduced. Through interactions with students, the authors have found that the attraction of a book is significantly increased once these digital natives learn that there has been a movie made from it. A web portal involves participants becoming directors of their own movies about the books they have read.</p>
<p>Dallas Price, in his article on using documentaries to motivate the tech generation to research and write, describes the process, tools and benefits of engaging highly gifted, middle-school-aged students in producing historical documentaries. Price highlights the project components that help students develop 21st-century skills within a content- and inquiry-driven historical documentary project. Collaboration, communication, critical thinking and craftsmanship are project outcomes.</p>
<p>Brent Smith, Allison Dempsey, Susan Jackson, Richard Olenchak and John Gaa examine how peer victimization, or bullying, is a phenomenon that is receiving increasing global attention, and how the use of technology, or cyberbullying, to bring about acts of bullying has increased as the use of various technological tools has escalated. While it is unclear whether this attention is a function of actual increases in cyberbullying or is simply a function of the fact that the same boom in technological access also enables more rapid reporting of such incidents, the reality remains the same; a number of young people use cyberspace as a means for attacking peers. An examination of the literature pertaining to cyberbullying serves as a backdrop for considering cyberbullying and its particular affects on gifted and talented students, and a call for increasing research efforts in this arena is issued.</p>
<p>A pilot project conducted by Phil Peters, Alex Katsaros, Rosalyn Howard and Robb Lindgren seeks to answer the question: Does a real-time, two-way, mobile, remote webcasting system have special properties for learning compared with traditional distance learning platforms? Students enrolled in two online undergraduate UCF courses explored South Africa via a ‘Cultural Transect’, which is defined as a method for recording and observing occurrences of cultural phenomena through regions and across borders of contemporary cultural systems around the world. The researchers hypothesize that this interactive cultural transect model augmented the traditional classroom by providing experiential access and interaction with authentic data, content, people and real-world contexts.</p>
<p>Alfred Loo examines a study on the effectiveness of a web browser, VocalSurf, used to generate speech. This software package can read words (both English and Chinese) on web pages and produce human speech accordingly. A sample of 100 participating kindergarten children used the browser to access web pages featuring an extensive range of vocabulary that purported to be understood in written form only by children over 10 years old. After completing the experiments, the children were interviewed to test their understanding of the web pages and the knowledge they had acquired. Eighty-five percent of the children indicated that surfing the Internet with the aid of VocalSurf had encouraged them to access the Internet despite the somewhat slow human speech produced by this tool and the monotonous Chinese pronunciation. However, some children felt frustrated because the web pages lacked interactive games or exercises. As educators, we also need to question whether living language development needs lively group interactions, rather than individual speech activities.</p>
<p>‘Thinking Inside the Box: Constrained Creativity and New Technology’ is presented by Bradley Gill, who suggests that an awareness of the boxed nature of new media can empower young students to think creatively about design. This article is a reflection of one teacher who led a group of young students in a series of lessons based on basic design principles related to technology.</p>
