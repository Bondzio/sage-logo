<p>In 2003, the bookstore manager at the university came to me, book in hand, saying, “I just read this book I think would really resonate with you.” I borrowed that book and began reading the same night, not putting it down until I finished at 3 a.m. The book was <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1932202X11434641">Herbert Kohl’s (1991)</xref> <italic>I Won’t Learn From You: And Other Thoughts on Creative Maladjustment</italic>, a collection of thought-provoking essays on topics related to how students handle being subjected to compulsory public education.</p>
<p>The title essay is a powerful one, in which Kohl describes several children who make conscious decisions to <italic>not learn</italic> what the teacher is providing. Kohl calls not learning a healthy coping mechanism for dealing with threats to one’s personal integrity, identity, and loyalties that result in a deliberate rejection of educational offerings, no matter how well meant.</p>
<p>The authors of “Differentiating Low Performance of the Gifted Learner: Achieving, Underachieving, and Selective Consuming Students” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1932202X11434641">Figg, Low, McCormick, &amp; Rogers 2012</xref>) endeavored to empirically validate qualitative findings that a difference exists between gifted students with high academic self-perceptions who deliberately underachieve (i.e., gifted selective consumers) and gifted students with low academic self-perceptions who underachieve (i.e., “conventional” gifted underachievers). They further sought to distinguish these two groups of underachievers in terms of thinking styles. Quantitative findings of this study, however, indicated no statistically significant differences between gifted selective consumers and conventional gifted underachievers with regard to academic self-perception or thinking styles, “though the study has produced support for the current trend in the literature that these students do, indeed, differ qualitatively from the underachieving student.”</p>
<p>The authors were innovative in combining <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1932202X11434641">Sternberg’s (1997)</xref> theory of mental self-government with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1932202X11434641">Zhang’s (2002)</xref> type grouping to construct a theoretical framework for conceptualizing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1932202X11434641">Kanevsky and Keighley’s (2003)</xref> five Cs (challenge, control, complexity, choice, and caring). Kanevsky and Keighley’s five Cs contributed to our understanding of why gifted students underachieve and how to potentially reverse underachieving behaviors. Operationalizing the five Cs builds on the authors’ work and provides us with a valuable tool for identifying and helping gifted underachievers and selective consumers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, attempting a quantitative investigation of selective consumerism adds to our knowledge base on a topic that, to date, has only been examined through a qualitative lens. Although qualitative research is advantageous in that it helps us account for the complexities of different phenomena, quantitative research is desirable empirical verification of the existence of actual relationships. The researchers should be commended for being the first to attempt to examine the topic of selective consumerism quantitatively.</p>
<p>What remains unclear in our minds, however, is whether not learners, or <italic>selective consumers</italic>, as identified by the authors of “Differentiating Low Performance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1932202X11434641">Figg et al., 2012</xref>) are, indeed, a special breed of underachieving students or just students who underachieve for their own reasons, just like all other underachievers. Whatever we call them, the outcomes, and often the underlying reasons, are the same, so maybe this is all more a matter of semantics. If we view underachievement as failing, then selective consumerism or not learning is something else. If, however, we look at underachievement as a multifaceted personal, family, school, and/or social issue that results in a wide variety of outcomes, we no longer require the distinction of selective consumerism. Taking this track enables us to spend more time and energy focusing on extending the extensive work of earlier researchers and moving forward rather than creating new microconcepts that may or may not lead to novel solutions.</p>
<p>An ongoing criticism of research in gifted education is that it tends to lack cohesiveness, forcing investigators into synthesizing literature from multiple sources and across disciplines to answer the simplest questions, such as the very definition of gifted and/or underachievement, rather than building on the work of each other. In “Differentiating Low Performance” (Figg et al.), the authors do not paint a complete picture of what a gifted underachiever looks like, except to contend that this group of students has a low academic self-perception. Had the authors done a more extensive review of the underachievement literature, they would have realized that “synthesizing the hypothetical characteristics of gifted underachievers [is] a nearly impossible task” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1932202X11434641">Reis &amp; McCoach, 2000</xref>, p. 158). This makes it difficult to draw meaningful comparisons between students who exhibit characteristics of “conventional underachievement” and those who manifest characteristics of “selective consumerism.”</p>
<p>To then characterize conventional underachievers as students with low academic self-perception, therefore, is a gross oversimplification of the myriad of characteristics offered in the literature on gifted underachievement. In fact, in research on gifted underachievers who eventually became successful adults, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1932202X11434641">Flint (2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1932202X11434641">2009-2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1932202X11434641">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1932202X11434641">2011)</xref> found that these individuals actually possessed a high academic self- perception, which was contrary to all previous research except for that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1932202X11434641">McCoach and Siegle (2003)</xref>, who also found no difference in the academic self-perception of achievers and underachievers. The authors of “Differentiating Low Performance” (Figg et al.) should have addressed these more recent findings in light of their claim that underachievers are students with low academic self-perception; they further use academic self-perception to distinguish underachievers from selective consumers. It is, therefore, not surprising that they found no statistically significant difference between these two groups on the academic self-perception subscale of the the <italic>School Attitude Assessment Survey-Revised</italic> (SAAS-R).</p>
<p>The authors state that “Selective consumers demonstrated a General Achievement Test (GAT) result in the 85th percentile range or higher plus an academic ranking that consistently fluctuated between ranking in the top 15% for the grade and ranking below the top 15%.” Although we appreciate the authors’ attempts to develop a method for classifying selective consumers, we do wonder if this approach really captured that population. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1932202X11434641">Peterson and Colangelo (1996)</xref> found that pulling and examining cumulative files for 153 gifted students was an effective way to classify students as gifted achievers and underachievers. Could the same method be used to capture students who are selectively achieving? This would certainly have provided the authors with additional information beyond a fluctuating class rank, to be sure the students were, in fact, selectively achieving and other factors were not contributing to this pattern. Using the cumulative file approach also helps us identify episodic achievers, which, according to Peterson and Colangelo would help us unmask more female underachievers.</p>
<p>One question that bears asking is the relevance of studying students at an all-boys school, when gifted underachieving boys have already been the subject of so much attention over the years. Gifted girls who underachieve are too often neglected in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1932202X11434641">Schober, Reimann, &amp; Wagner, 2004</xref>). Replicating this study with a more diverse population of gifted students might add valuable literature on the subject. In addition, although the body of literature on gifted underachievers basically states that boys underachieve at a rate 3 or 4 times as much as girls, some research shows that girls and boys underachieve at approximately equal rates, although in different ways (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1932202X11434641">Dowdall &amp; Colangelo, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1932202X11434641">Fox, 1981</xref>). Research findings also suggest that high-ability females tend to deliberately underachieve in response to what they perceive as gender-specific expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1932202X11434641">Dowdall &amp; Colangelo, 1982</xref>), which could ostensibly make them even more prone to selective consumerism than male students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1932202X11434641">Hollingworth (1927)</xref> noted that for females to be successful at anything beyond typical female roles of childbearing, child rearing, and housekeeping “requires a courage and a genius deserving of something better than blame or jeers; deserving at least open-minded toleration and assistance” (p. 20). Surely, females also deserve study? Males tend to be more overt and obvious about their underachievement and reasons for doing so, whereas females tend to try to maintain some outward standard of achievement, while covertly knowing they are not doing their best according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1932202X11434641">Flint (2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1932202X11434641">2009)</xref> who chose to study gifted males and females in equal proportions.</p>
<p>Adopting a more inclusive approach when replicating this study could help educators decide whether we <italic>need</italic> to distinguish between selective consumers and underachievers, and what interventions should be developed to appropriately address each <italic>group’s</italic> strengths and weaknesses. In the meantime, we must confront underachievement as a highly individual, multifaceted issue that demands creative solutions.</p>
<p>If we consider honoring students’ thinking styles in the classroom as a legitimate means for addressing selective consumerism and/or underachievement, we need to adopt a similarly inclusive approach to researching the possibility of differences among and between groups. The authors do note that their study should mark “the beginning of a series of studies that might identify how to differentiate between selective consumers and conventional underachievers.” Future research should, therefore, continue to create and add to a body of knowledge on this topic.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that while the authors wrote in the conclusion, “Although this study did not yield statistically significant results to suggest that selective consumers differ from underachieving students, the study has produced support for the current trend in the literature that these students do, indeed, differ qualitatively from the underachieving student,” when earlier in the article, they also stated, “The constructed framework of selective consumers does not satisfy the converging evidence principle because it is derived from <italic>qualitative research only</italic>.” Because there is no statistical significance evident from this study, does that not suggest that this is yet another qualitative report that, according to the cited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1932202X11434641">Stanovich and Stanovich (2003)</xref>, does not satisfy the principle of converging evidence?</p>
<p>We would like to close with some slightly different notions of converging evidence—a foundation laid back in Socrate’s time (469 <sc>bc</sc>-399 <sc>bc</sc>) and that continues to be augmented even today by researchers such as the authors of “Differentiating Low Performance” (Figg et al.). Whether qualitative or quantitative, philosophical or practical, there are some educational matters about which we already know a great deal, yet researchers persist in their attempts at distinguishing one “type” of underachiever from another, presumably to then “fix” whatever is keeping these groups of students from succeeding in school, and often, elsewhere. The authors conclude with, “The merit of separating selective consumers from underachievers lies in the impact it might have in the management of underachievement among gifted learners.” Perhaps we should instead focus our efforts at examining the underlying faults with our educational systems and then applying Kanevsky and Keighley’s five Cs with <italic>all</italic> students so they can enjoy the best possible outcomes from their schooling.</p>
<p>In the article, the authors discussed <italic>how</italic> we teach students, theorizing that selective consumers are primarily Type I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1932202X11434641">Zhang &amp; Sternberg, 2006</xref>) students whose learning preferences include need for control, challenge, complexity, and choice. In other words, these students resist teacher-centered learning environments and prefer autonomy in their learning. Does that not beg the question? Are we to infer, then, that students <italic>prefer</italic> a teacher-driven, inflexible learning environment? Do all students not desire and need creative challenge and opportunities to engage in meaningful, self-directed learning tasks of their own choosing?</p>
<p>Examining the literature on pedagogy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1932202X11434641">Conner (1997)</xref> said, “Pedagogy literally means the art and science of educating children and often is used as a synonym for teaching. More accurately, pedagogy embodies teacher-focused education,” and teacher-focused education is apparently passé, at least in the eyes of those gifted students who have chosen to disengage from some of the educational opportunities being offered them. Judging by test scores and levels of underachievement being reported around this country, it appears that not only selective consumers are finding teacher-centered instruction passé.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on thinking styles and how the classroom does not match them, maybe we should change the classroom. We could emulate Socrates, who is known to be a facilitator of thinking and learning, not a teacher in the current pedagogical sense, and teach using a more andragogical model.</p>
<p>Andragogy was formerly known as a model for adult learning but, thanks to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1932202X11434641">Knowles (1998)</xref>, has now come to denote learner-centered education. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1932202X11434641">Conner (1997)</xref> wrote,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>The andragogical model asserts that five issues be considered and addressed in formal learning. They include (a) letting learners know why something is important to learn, (b) showing learners how to direct themselves through information, and (c) relating the topic to the learners’ experiences. In addition, (d) people will not learn until they are ready and motivated to learn. Often this (e) requires helping them overcome inhibitions, behaviors, and beliefs about learning. (n.p.)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1932202X11434641">Dewey (1902)</xref>, in many of his books, including <italic>The Child and the Curriculum</italic>, argued that learning, choice, and social interaction are pivotal to students’ success in school and that when students are permitted and encouraged to create, interact with, and experience curriculum they will not only gain personal success but also gain the power and knowledge to change the world in which they live. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1932202X11434641">Freire (1970)</xref> compared modern education with the banking industry, where students were the empty accounts that could be then filled up by teachers, and “it transforms students into receiving objects. It attempts to control thinking and action, leads men and women to adjust to the world, and inhibits their creative power” (p. 77). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1932202X11434641">Montessori (1967)</xref> said,</p>
<p>As a rule . . . we do not respect children. We try to force them to follow us without regard to their special needs. We are overbearing with them, and above all, rude . . . let us treat them, therefore, with all the kindness which we would wish to help to develop in them . . . Kindness consists of interpreting the wishes of others, in conforming one’s self to them, and sacrificing, if need be, one’s own desires (p. 79).</p>
<p>All of these noted philosophers, teachers, and researchers believed that based on both study and experience, a teacher’s role is not to rule the classroom but to instead assist learners in becoming autonomous beings capable of thinking at the high levels demanded in today’s global economy. In fact, the deliberate teaching to Type II preferences flies in the face of the current research-based U.S. educational standards: The 21st Century Skills. Moreover, while some students may innately prefer thinking that way, is it not our responsibility to teach teachers a more effective means so that students leave school transformed?</p>
<p>The 21st Century Skills Framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1932202X11434641">Framework, 2011</xref>) includes teaching students the core subjects; learning and innovation skills; information, media, and technology skills; and life and career skills. These are not novel, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1932202X11434641">Dewey (1918)</xref> similarly described four essential types of thinking as reflective, critical, conceptual, and creative, and argued that all four are necessary for a student’s success in life. Also necessary, however, are self-regulatory processes, goal-directed behaviors, self-motivation, and the like. “Examining interventions, specifically ways in which to increase self-regulation, acquisition of appropriate tacit knowledge, and goal-directed behaviors, are additional potential areas for further study” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1932202X11434641">Flint, 2011</xref>, p. 4) and should be provided for all students. Whether students are achievers, underachievers, not learners or learners, male or female, “Policymakers and administrators should take the time to critically examine the campus climate(s); a school climate that is inviting to parents, teachers, students, and visitors encourages mutual respect” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1932202X11434641">Flint, 2011</xref>, p. 3), and one that honors and incorporates individual preferences for curriculum and thinking styles.</p>
<p>In her 2002 article, “Invitations to Learn,” Tomlinson asked, “Do students care about learning? The answer is, of course, that ‘it depends’” (p. 6). Her premise is that “environment and instruction work in tandem to invite, inspire, and sustain student learning. Together, they make the content important” (p. 7). She states that affirmation, contribution, purpose, power, and challenge are powerful motivators and that</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>what teachers actually say to students is less important to invitational learning than are students’ collective experiences in the classroom. Excellent teachers may speak the invitations to learn, but students respond because the actions of those excellent teachers consistently convey invitation. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1932202X11434641">Tomlinson, 2002</xref>, p. 10)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Based on our own decades of clinical and research experience, and a few millennia of others’ intellectual knowledge and wisdom, we believe that both Kohl’s and Kanevsky and Keighley’s writings speak truth. Kohl contends that when students are confronted with “forced choices and no apparent middle ground” and they are told “to learn from a stranger who does not respect [their] integrity . . . the only alternative is to not-learn and reject their world” (p. 6). Kanevsky and Keighly further describe a growing tension between students’ need for autonomy in their learning and “political pressures as curricula become increasingly test-bound” (p. 26). They argue that although “many educators feel opportunities to respond to students’ needs and preferences have diminished . . . this need not be true” (p. 26). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1932202X11434641">Dewey (1918)</xref> said,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>To the open mind, nature and social experience are full of varied and subtle challenges to look further. If germinating powers are not used and cultivated at the right moment, they tend to be transitory, to die out, or to wane in intensity. (p. 33)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Because giftedness is only a fragile <italic>potential</italic> (or dynamis) for future achievement, there is an enduring risk that it will not grow to fruition. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1932202X11434641">Dabrowski (1972)</xref>, in his work on personality development and the Theory of Positive Disintegration, referred to <italic>dynamisms</italic>, or clusters of “instincts, drives, and intellectual processes combined with emotions” (p. 294) that drive one’s behaviors and motivation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1932202X11434641">Aristotle (350 <sc>bc</sc>)</xref> argued that moving beyond dynamis to actual attainment of that of which one is capable, or <italic>entelechy, is</italic> what reveals us in our truest form. To <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1932202X11434641">Lovecky (1986)</xref>, “entelechy bespeaks a particular type of motivation, inner strength, and vital force directing life and growth to become all the self is capable of being” (p. 590). William <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1932202X11434641">James (1920)</xref> put it even more eloquently</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>I have often thought that the best way to define a man’s character would be to seek out the particular mental or moral attitude in which, when it came upon him, he felt himself most deeply and intensely active and alive. At such moments there is a voice inside which speaks and says, “This is the real me!” (p. 199)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Given this body of evidence, maybe it is time for researchers in the field of gifted education to take a lesson from Sternberg’s work on common sense and practical intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1932202X11434641">Sternberg, Wagner, Williams, &amp; Horvath, 1995</xref>) and stop arguing about definitions of giftedness and underachievement, or whether she or he is an underachiever, a selective consumer, or a twice-exceptional child and focus our collective energy on what matters: teaching students the practical knowledge and tacit skills they need to survive and excel in this world. Maybe we just need to accept that there are some common sense aspects of education-done-right that we qualitatively <italic>know</italic> and place our priorities on improving those, and providing opportunities for students to become their truest selves, rather than on obtaining quantitative evidence of amorphous concepts.</p>
