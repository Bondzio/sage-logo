<p>What does the wilderness look like?</p>
<p>I remember visiting the desert of Central Australia after rain. Against the background of bright orange sand, flowers bloomed – Sturt desert peas dressed in striking red and black, purple heath, yellow and orange lines of flowers. There were animal tracks zigzagging through the sand. At night we camped in swags under the stars and watched satellites circle the earth.</p>
<p>At Christmas in the Snowy Mountains wilderness I walked with thousands of others in pilgrimage to the top of Mount Kosciuszko. I walked on a raised platform to protect the environment. There were lots of flowers here too, and the beginnings of mountain streams. Eagles soared overhead.</p>
<p>What does the wilderness look like to you?</p>
<p>I visited someone recovering from a stroke, who then had a bad fall. This person was fearful, dependent, determined. Each step to recovery was tiny and painful.</p>
<p>My boyfriend was killed in a car accident when I was 19. The world was bleak shades of grey. I sat by the lake weeping my private tears while trying to study at Uni. I visited a friend in Sydney seeking support – but she hadn’t heard of his death so I ended up comforting her. The blackness and the tears dragged on. Grief was unresolved for 20 years though life continued and grief was only revisited occasionally.</p>
<p>A relationship ends after a bitter wrangle. There is guilt and recrimination, anger and sadness all mixed together, and ongoing custody battles. There is ageing, loss of fertility, loss of memory, aching joints, stiffness, becoming invisible as younger, beautiful people take the stand. Major surgery – a hysterectomy for me. For some there is mental illness, depression, dropping out, voices, mania… and isolation.</p>
<p>What does your wilderness look like?</p>
<p>I take a day out and drive to Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve, alone. I walk the lyrebird track. The air is crisp. I eat my packed lunch at a table. I write in my journal, then I walk the sanctuary path, watching water birds play. I sit in the botanic gardens, water dragons looked at me hopefully from my feet. Rosellas squawk… I rest.</p>
<p>The wilderness journey : exotic adventures, time out- or just plain hard work?</p>
<p>We hear in Mark 1 of Jesus’ baptism, where Jesus is named ‘God’s beloved son’. Then he is immediately thrust into the wilderness and tested. After the highlight of baptism down he goes. What does this wilderness look like for Jesus? Spirit, wild beasts, the Tempter, and angels it seems!</p>
<p>We tend to think our deserts are bad places, but could it be the Spirit leads us there to know ourselves better?</p>
<p>Could it be that our deserts are the very places from where we draw our spiritual power like water from a well, where our faith is strengthened and assurance given-that we can, as Jesus did, deliberately choose the good in the face of temptation and conflict? (Joyce Rupp, <italic>God’s Enduring Presence</italic>, John Garrett Publishing, Melbourne, 2008)</p>
<p>The reference to 40 days takes us back to Deuteronomy, one of the primary narratives of Israel’s wilderness traditions. Deuteronomy recalls the time when the Israelites were poised to enter the Land of Promise, and speaks of what it means to be God’s covenant people. Underpinning these traditions is that the 40 years in the wilderness resulted from people’s lack of trust in God. Jesus’ wilderness time, by contrast, is a journey of trust.</p>
<p>When Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness he did not travel alone. He took his relationship to this divine Spirit, the go-between. Not that this made it easy, mind you, but it was to that relationship he clung. In that desert, that wilderness, he also encountered other strange companions: ‘Satan’, real or imagined?; internal or external?; ‘Satan’, real enough to him – a presence, a force, a desire to be reckoned with; wild beasts, real or imagined? internal or external? Powerful yet. And he meets angels who minister to him. Were they real or imagined? Internal or external? Whatever the case, he was not alone.</p>
<p>Joyce Rupp reflects:</p>
<p><italic>This is a spiritual truth. Good and necessary are wise companions to guide us toward prayer: good, too, are the many strange companions that mature our faith through testing. These strange companions prove and improve us. Struggle hardens spiritual muscles. This was true for Jesus in the wilderness beyond the Jordan. And, this is true for us today.</italic></p>
<p><italic>We are conditioned for the work of God through struggle</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Good and wise companions assist us in our journey. Their words comfort and heal and bind up our wounds when life inflicts real hurt. But the “Devils” of the desert – the situations and people who challenge – these strange companions can test whether or not we know the ultimate truth about our life. Only in the shadows of the wilderness, with the wind howling and wolves nipping near, will it become clear:</italic></p>

<p>Esther De Waal (<italic>Lost in Wonder, Rediscovering the Spiritual Art of Attentiveness</italic>, John Garrett Publishing, Melbourne, 2003) tells of Fr Christian, a French Trappist Monk, who features in the movie ‘Of Gods and Men’. She writes:</p>
<p><italic>On the day before Christmas Eve 1979, Fr Christian, the French Trappist abbot, was 1,000 miles south of his monastery Tibhirine, in what is known as the Sinai of Algiers. It was an isolated plateau of windswept cliffs and rocks where once Charles de Foucauld had built a small stone hut in which to spend time in solitude. In this barren mountain of granite rocks he wrote these words:</italic></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Nuits de la foie en agonie…</italic></p>
<p><italic>Le doute est la, et la folie</italic></p>
<p><italic>d’aimer tout seul un Dieu absent et captivant</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>… Ce que j’espere, je ne le vois…</italic></p>
<p><italic>C’est mon tourment, tourne vers lui</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Toute souffrance y prend son sens</italic>,</p>
<p><italic>cache en Dieu comme une naissance</italic>,</p>
<p><italic>ma JOIE deja, mais c’est la NUIT</italic>.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This is paraphrased in her notes as:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>There are nights when I experience faith as anguish;</p>
<p>There is doubt, madness too,</p>
<p>in this solitary love of a God</p>
<p>who is at the same time</p>
<p>absent and absorbing.</p>
<p>… I hope; but what I hope for is out of sight…</p>
<p>That tortures me as I face him.</p>
<p>All the torment has direction and meaning there</p>
<p>where it is hidden in God, as though coming to birth;</p>
<p>JOY yes, but wrapped in NIGHT.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Esther De Waal continues: <italic>The monastery’s journal recorded that he returned smiling, unshaven, emaciated. Fr Christian was now sure of his monastic vocation, counting on the transforming power of prayer to have ‘the courage and the patience to place hope in the accomplishment of small things, each and every day’.</italic></p>
<p>Where does Jesus’ wilderness lead him?</p>
<p>In Mark’s telling, from the wilderness Jesus moves straight into public ministry proclaiming, ‘The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.’ He proclaims, and he calls people to follow Him! He ministers as ‘the Beloved One’ called by God, and One who has lived through wilderness, faced his Demons, and survived. He is clear and focussed on his calling.</p>
<p>Where do you place yourself?</p>
<p>Are you in the wilderness or beyond?</p>
<p>Wherever you are, Lent is an opportunity for reassessment.</p>

<title>Misunderstood Participants in the Jewish Revolt</title>
<p>Mark Andrew Brighton, The Sicarii in Josephus’s Judean War: Rhetorical Analysis and Historical Observations (Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature, 2009. £18.99. pp. 184. ISBN: 978-1-58983-406-4). This volume, a revision of Mark Brighton’s Ph.D. dissertation (University of California-Irvine), seeks to ‘provide a holistic study of the Sicarii in The Judean War’ by examining the passages where Josephus either explicitly mentions them or infers their presence and activity in the narrative (p. xiii). Specifically, Brighton’s goals for this study are to determine what rhetorical role the Sicarii play in Josephus’s narrative and to uncover historical details about the Sicarii that may lie behind Josephus’ rhetoric. Brighton accomplishes his objectives in five well-organised and carefully written chapters. Chapter one reviews the limited scholarship on the Sicarii and it is here that the justification for Brighton’s work emerges. As the author notes, no comprehensive study of the Sicarii in War has been attempted previously. Further, Brighton states that his study establishes Josephus’s depiction of the Sicarii in War which, in turn, allows him to shed light on the historical Sicarii by getting behind Josephus’s rhetoric. Chapter two addresses debated issues concerning the various contexts for the writing of War. Brighton concludes that War stands in the Greco-Roman historical tradition focused on stasis and tychē (similar to the work of Thucydides). Brighton adds that War was completed in its entirety by 81 ce and written for both Roman and Jewish readers. Chapters three and four are Brighton’s exegesis of the relevant passages in War with chapter three focusing on War 1-6 and chapter four focusing on War 7. Brighton’s approach to each passage is to explain why it is included in the study (since not every passage explicitly mentions the Sicarii), provide the literary context of the passage, highlight the activity/activities of the Sicarii in the passage, study important words associated with the Sicarii (e.g. stasis, lēstēs, etc.) and situate each passage in the structure of the book as a whole. Chapter five offers both the literary and historical conclusions of the study. At a literary level, Brighton deduces that Josephus utilises the Sicarii as both a positive and negative rhetorical tool that elaborates upon the themes stated in the proem of War and throughout the work (e.g. the crimes of the Sicarii were directed against their own people, the power of the Romans is limited, the Sicarii died in a way that both Jews and Romans would have viewed as noble, etc.). From a historical perspective Brighton’s one firm conclusion is that the Sicarii were not a subgroup of Zealots. Beyond this Brighton claims that there is little historical data to gather from War since Josephus used the epithet ‘Sicarii’ primarily as a broad term describing banditry in general. This book is an important step forward for deepening our understanding of Josephus’s War and the role the Sicarii play in that work. Brighton’s chief contribution is his attention to how the Sicarii serve Josephus’s literary aims in War. Additionally, this work provides a model for studying the roles characters or groups play in Josephus’s works. One lament, through no fault of Brighton, is that if the author’s conclusions are correct then War adds little to our historical understanding of the Sicarii.</p>
