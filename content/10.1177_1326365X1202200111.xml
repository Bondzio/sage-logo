<abstract>
<p>While the research culture is slowly but surely being strengthened, undergraduate teaching continues to be troubling. Employers said that they would not hire first-degree graduates because of the poor quality of their training. Many Indians therefore go on to obtain a master’s degree.Grinding poverty, corruption, the political culture and the caste system are four critical reasons for the current state of affairs. School fees are kept low as low as US$200 a year so as to be affordable; attempts to raise the fees are met with protests, with support from politicians.</p>
<p> Quoting the BBC broadcaster Mark Tulley, the author concludes that because of the Indian form of bad governance, where ideas sound excellent on paper but fail on implementation, the peculiarly Indian problems faced by the tertiary media education will require a peculiarly Indian solution.</p>
