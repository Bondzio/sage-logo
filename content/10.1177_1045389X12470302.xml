<abstract>
<p>We have fabricated the thermoelectric generator devices from 100 alternating layers of SiO<sub>2</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub>+CoSb superlattice thin films using the ion beam–assisted deposition. Rutherford backscattering spectrometry was used for quantitative elemental analysis of Si, Co, and Sb in the multilayer films. The thin films were then modified by 5-MeV Si ion bombardments using the Alabama A&amp;M University Pelletron ion beam accelerator. Quantum dots and/or clusters were produced in the nanolayered superlattice films to decrease the cross-plane thermal conductivity, increase the cross-plane Seebeck coefficient, and the cross-plane electrical conductivity. We have characterized the thermoelectric generator devices before and after Si ion bombardments using the thermoelectric, optical, and surface characterization techniques. The optical absorption amplitude decreased when the first fluence of 1 × 10<sup>12</sup> ions/cm<sup>2</sup> was introduced from the value of 2.8 to about 1.9 at 200 nm. The figure of merit reached the maximum value of about 0.005 at the fluence of 1 × 10<sup>13</sup> ions/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The demand for electrical energy is growing rapidly with increasing world population and diminution of conventional energy sources. However, the burning of fossil fuels leads to significant increase of greenhouse gases such as CO<sub>2</sub>, in our environments. The thermoelectric (TE) device is one of the candidates of energy production since exhausted heat can be effectively used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1045389X12470302">Hayakawa et al., 2011</xref>). Thermoelectric materials (TEM) can directly change heat to electric power by the Seebeck effect. The power-generating module of these materials has no moving components. The power generation using TEM also has high reliability and produces no noise, requires no frequency maintenance, and exhausts no waste. Therefore, TEM are attracting worldwide attention now, for reuse of the exhaust waste heat from power plant or automobile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1045389X12470302">Kawaharada et al., 2001</xref>).</p>

<p>Filled skutterudite compounds based on CoSb<sub>3</sub> have been paid much attention as candidate TEM because of their high power factor and low thermal conductivity due to rattling of filling atoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1045389X12470302">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>) and due to their “phonon glass and electron crystal character.” The CoSb<sub>3</sub> possesses only an “electron crystal” feature but does not have a “phonon glass” merit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1045389X12470302">Lu et al., 2010</xref>). However, CoSb<sub>3</sub> material is vulnerable to be oxidized or sublimed in different working conditions, and oxidation products can increase the resistance and result in degradation of TE properties. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the reliability of CoSb<sub>3</sub>-based materials under different serving circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1045389X12470302">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>CoSb<sub>3</sub>-based skutterudites are regarded as one of the most promising materials working in an intermediate temperature region. However, as the key technology for fabricating TE device, the joining of metal electrode and CoSb<sub>3</sub> materials is still a large obstacle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1045389X12470302">Zhao et al., 2009</xref>). Since the CoSb<sub>3</sub>-based skutterudites are promising materials in the efficient TE device fabrication, we have been working on the TE properties of some materials like skutterudite CeFe<sub>2</sub>Co<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>12</sub> thin films (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1045389X12470302">Guner et al., 2009b</xref>), skutterudite Co<sub>0.1</sub>Sb<sub>x</sub>Ge<sub>y</sub> thin films (at different x and y values) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1045389X12470302">Guner et al., 2009a</xref>), and skutterudite Er<sub>0.1</sub>Fe<sub>1.9</sub>SbGe<sub>0.4</sub> thin film (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1045389X12470302">Budak et al., 2009b</xref>).</p>
<p>Since we have reached efficient TEM when we prepare our thin film systems like superlattice multilayer thin films of SiO<sub>2</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub>+M (M = Ag, Au) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1045389X12470302">Budak et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1045389X12470302">2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1045389X12470302">Guner et al., 2009c</xref>), we decided to combine these good results from skutterudite and superlattice sides. In this study, we report on the growth of SiO<sub>2</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub>+CoSb multilayer superlattice thin film systems using the ion beam–assisted deposition (IBAD) and high-energy Si ion bombardment of the films. This technique reduced the cross-plane thermal conductivity and increased the cross-plane electrical conductivity and cross-plane Seebeck coefficients, due to the nanoclusters effect during the MeV Si ion bombardments. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), optical absorption spectra, photoluminescence (PL) spectra, I-V, and conductance were used for characterization.</p>

<title>Experimental</title>
<p>We have grown 100 periodic multi-nanolayers of SiO<sub>2</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub>+CoSb superlattices on the silicon and silica (suprasil) substrates at the total thickness of 486 nm using an IBAD. The multilayer films were sequentially deposited to have a periodic structure consisting of alternating SiO<sub>2</sub> and SiO<sub>2</sub>+CoSb layers. The deposited multilayer films have an alternating layer of about 4.9 nm thick. The two electron gun evaporators for evaporating SiO<sub>2</sub> and SiO<sub>2</sub>+CoSb were turned on and off alternately. The thickness of the layers was controlled by an INFICON deposition monitor. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1045389X12470302">Figure 1</xref> shows the geometries of the samples from (a) the top view and (b) the cross section for the cross-plane Seebeck and the cross-plane electrical conductivity and (c) the cross section for the cross-plane thermal conductivity and in-plane electrical conductivity measurement.</p>

<p>The cross-plane electrical conductivity was measured by the Agilent 4-probe micro-ohmic contact system, the in-plane electrical conductivity was measured by MMR Technologies Van der Pauw resistivity measurement system, and the cross-plane thermal conductivity was measured by the homemade 3ω technique. The thermal conductivity measurement was performed at a room temperature of 25 °C. One could find detailed information about the 3ω technique elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1045389X12470302">Dames and Chen, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>I-V and conductance characterization measurements have been performed by using Keithley I-V &amp; C-V measurement systems. The 5-MeV Si ion bombardments were performed with the Pelletron ion beam accelerator at the Alabama A&amp;M University’s Center for Irradiation of Materials (AAMU-CIM). The energy of the bombarding Si ions was chosen using the stopping and range of ions in matter (SRIM) simulation software calculations. Si ions with 5 MeV energy will go through the 100 alternating multilayer thin films, and the energy melts the Co and Sb elements and carries them through SiO<sub>2</sub> layer. One could calculate the amount of the energy and fluences that are necessary to make high-energy ion bombardment through thin films in SRIM software. The fluences used for the bombardment were between 1 × 10<sup>12</sup> ions/cm<sup>2</sup> and 3 × 10<sup>14</sup> ions/cm<sup>2</sup>. Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) was performed using 2.1-MeV He<sup>+</sup> ions with the particle detector placed at 170° from the incident beam direction to measure the elemental analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1045389X12470302">Chacha et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1045389X12470302">Chu et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1045389X12470302">Ziegler et al., 1985</xref>). The PL and XPS were measured on a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrophotometer and Mantis Instruments, respectively. Optical absorption spectra were taken by using Varian Cary UV Visible spectrometer.</p>

<p>The film thickness was measured using Fabry–Perot optical interferometer. The total thickness of 100 alternating layers of SiO<sub>2</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub>+CoSb thin films was found to be 486 (±10) nm. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1045389X12470302">Figure 2</xref> shows the RBS spectrum of 100 alternating multi-nanolayered SiO<sub>2</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub>+CoSb thin films. As seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1045389X12470302">Figure 2</xref>, the elements used during the deposition of the multilayer thin film systems appeared in the RBS spectrum of SiO<sub>2</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub>+CoSb thin film. The thin films of SiO<sub>2</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub>+CoSb were deposited on the fused silica, silicon, and glassy polymeric carbon (GPC) substrates. The fused silica and silicon deposited thin films have been used for the thermal, electrical, and optical measurements. The GPC sample was used for RBS measurements since carbon is a low-mass substrate material to show all possible elements used in the alternating layers as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1045389X12470302">Figure 2</xref> as C, O, Si, Co, and Sb. Depending on the energy and the place of the elements in the deposition, the elements show up at the different number of the energy channels. RBS spectrum gives quantitative information about the used elements. For the detailed information, Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy analysis package (RUMP) simulation and other useful techniques could be used.</p>

As seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1045389X12470302">Figure 3</xref>, each element has its own XPS peak at the different binding energy level in the whole XPS spectrum for each film. Sb has showed up two times at two different binding energies. Oxygen has the highest binding energy on the XPS spectra. The intensity shapes for the intensities for all unbombarded and high-energy bombarded samples at the different fluences look the same. Except for the intensity at the fluence of 3 × 10<sup>14</sup> ions/cm<sup>2</sup>, the other XPS spectra are very close to each other.

At 200 nm, the optical absorption amplitude decreased from the value of 2.8 to about 1.9 when the first fluence of 1 × 10<sup>12</sup> ions/cm<sup>2</sup> was introduced. When the fluence was being increased to 1 × 10<sup>13</sup> ions/cm<sup>2</sup>, the amplitude increased to about 2.0 at 200 nm. As the ion bombardment fluences increased, the optical absorption magnitudes approached the initial values of the unbombarded case at 200 nm. The varying wavelengths were supposed to show some absorption peaks to indicate the nanodots and/or nanocluster formation. We were not able to see these structures in the range of 200–1600 nm. Some other complimentary techniques need to be found to support the nanoformation in the multi-nanolayered thin film systems.</p>

We have observed the luminescence bands at about 390, 475, 550, and 710 nm. However, we could not see any significant effect in the structures as a function of the ion fluence. This could be explained by the role of nuclear and electronic stopping powers. The effects of the radiation damage are minimized in the surface and near-surface regions. It seems that the applied energy and beam fluence should be chosen more carefully for the future studies to see the ion beam energy effects in the PL spectra.</p>

At the first and the last applied fluences, we have observed the similar effects since the first fluence was not enough to induce some change in I-V curve and the last fluence has more energy causing the thin film system to be destroyed.

As seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1045389X12470302">Figure 8(b)</xref>, the cross-plane electrical conductivity generally increases until the fluence of 1 × 10<sup>14</sup> ions/cm<sup>2</sup>. Above the fluence of 1 × 10<sup>14</sup> ions/cm<sup>2</sup>, the cross-plane electrical conductivity decreased. As considered from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1045389X12470302">Figure 8(b)</xref>, the high-energy ion bombardments showed more positive effects in the increments of the cross-plane electrical conductivity. The increase in the electrical conductivity is a desired property for the TE device and TEM. The increase of electronic density of states in the miniband of the quantum dot structure formed by ion bombardment increases the electrical conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1045389X12470302">Zheng et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1045389X12470302">Figure 8(c)</xref> shows the cross-plane thermal conductivity change depending on the fluence of applied 5-MeV Si ion bombardment. As seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1045389X12470302">Figure 8(c)</xref>, the thermal conductivity generally increases except for the fluences of 1 × 10<sup>13</sup> ions/cm<sup>2</sup> and 1 × 10<sup>14</sup> ions/cm<sup>2</sup>. The decrease in the thermal conductivity is another desired quantity for the TEM and TE devices. While the samples are being bombarded with 5-MeV Si ions, the heat energy of 100 periodic nanolayers of SiO<sub>2</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub>+CoSb superlattice films increases. This might cause some interface scattering and absorption of phonons. Scattering and absorption of phonons cause decrease in thermal conductivity. If you continue to bombard the samples, the amount of the thermal conductivity may increase due to the increase of the discrete energy levels in between the conduction and valence bands.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1045389X12470302">Figure 8(d)</xref> shows the calculated figure of merit change depending on the applied fluence. As seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1045389X12470302">Figure 8(d)</xref>, the figure of merit generally increased except for the fluences of 1 × 10<sup>12</sup> ions/cm<sup>2</sup> and 5 × 10<sup>13</sup> ions/cm<sup>2</sup>. It reached the maximum value of about 0.0050 at the fluence of 1 × 10<sup>13</sup> ions/cm<sup>2</sup>. Kawaharada et al. used polycrystalline CoSb<sub>3</sub> samples. They found that CoSb<sub>3</sub> has negative Seebeck values at low temperatures, while the sign of the Seebeck coefficient turned positive with increasing temperature. Their results indicated that the major carrier changed in nature with the increasing temperature. They thought that the reason of this phenomenon might have been caused by the Sb/Co ratio. Their Seebeck results were between −230 and 180 µV/K at the temperatures between 300 and 700 K. They reached the figure of merit values between 0.01 and 0.05 at the temperatures between 300 and 700 K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1045389X12470302">Kawaharada et al., 2001</xref>). Their results showed support for our Seebeck results since we had negative values of the Seebeck coefficients at the room temperature they reached. Our Seebeck results become greater than what they have found in CoSb<sub>3</sub> samples. The reason might come from the superlattice multi-nanolayered thin films of SiO<sub>2</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub>+CoSb and ion beam bombardments for increasing the charge carrier concentration and decreasing the thermal conductivity.</p>
<p>Zhang et al. synthesized CoSb<sub>3</sub> compounds. They found that the higher sintering temperature and higher milling time changed the conductivity types of the samples. Samples with short milling time showed p-type, while samples milled for a longer time or sintered at higher temperature show n-type behavior. They measured the Seebeck coefficients between −450 and 200 µV/K at the temperatures between 300 and 770 K. They found the figure of merit for different samples between 0.05 and 0.09 in the temperature range of 300–750 K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1045389X12470302">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>). Their results also could give information about the type of the charge carrier concentration. Their TE results caused a remarkable figure of merit. Due to the usage of the superlattice multilayered system and ion beam bombardments, we might reach higher Seebeck coefficients.</p>
<p>Lu et al. studied the TE properties of the undoped CoSb<sub>3</sub> and rare earth–filled CoSb<sub>3</sub>-based nanostructure skutterudite. Their Seebeck results changed between 25 and 125 µV/K for undoped and doped samples at the temperature between 350 and 775 K. Higher Seebeck coefficients reached by the doped samples with the rare earth elements of LaFe, CeFe, and LaCeFe. They have seen the similar effects in the electrical and thermal conductivities. Rare earth–filled CoSb<sub>3</sub> samples give higher electrical and lower thermal conductivity with respect to the undoped cases. They reached the maximum figure of merit of 0.85 at the temperature of 775 K when the sample was LaCeFe<sub>3</sub>CoSb<sub>12</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1045389X12470302">Lu et al., 2010</xref>). We had similar studies done before with CeFeCoSb structure. The La element might have brought more contribution to the TE properties of their samples. We could consider this type of work for our future plans.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We have grown 100 periodic nanolayers of SiO<sub>2</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub>+CoSb superlattice films on the silicon and fused silica substrates (suprasil) at the total thickness of 486 nm using IBAD. The multilayer films were sequentially deposited to have a periodic structure consisting of alternating SiO<sub>2</sub> and SiO<sub>2</sub>+CoSb layers. The deposited multilayer films have an alternating layer of about 4.9 nm thick. The maximum figure of merit value of about 0.0050 has been reached at the fluence of 1 × 10<sup>13</sup> ions/cm<sup>2</sup>. The maximum cross-plane electrical conductivity value of about 0.65/(Ωm) has been reached at the fluence of 1 × 10<sup>14</sup> ions/cm<sup>2</sup>, and the minimum cross-plane thermal conductivity value of about 0.0105 W/mK has also been reached at the fluence of 1 × 10<sup>14</sup> ions/cm<sup>2</sup>. The high-energy ion bombardment can produce nanostructures and modify the property of thin films (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1045389X12470302">Budak et al., 2007</xref>), resulting in lower thermal conductivity and higher electrical conductivity. The future studies will continue on these materials system to reach the higher figure of merit at different conditions.</p>
