<p>In this collection, Malcolm Williams and W. Paul Vogt seek to examine the current state of affairs in social research methodology: ‘where social research “is at” at the present time’ (p. 1). The cutting edge of the methods and techniques utilised in social research are depicted across a wide range of sub-sections. What counts as innovative is clearly debatable and something the editors recognise; however, the broad scope of this collection is to provide a platform for further examination, not an exhaustive list of developments. In this the collection certainly succeeds and the inclusion of some predictions by the contributors indicates where future innovation may lie.</p>
<p>Split into four logical sections which summarise the current thinking in the social context of research, research design and data collection, the analysis of new data types, and sampling, inference and measurement issues, this weighty tome collates innovation from researchers at the forefront of methodological thinking. Such innovation is certainly not limited to developing software or new analytical techniques. The first section comprises essays on new directions in the philosophy of social research and aims to locate social science as distinct from alternative disciplines. Martyn Hammersly neatly and clearly outlines the nature of ‘objectivism’ (a theme later developed by Gayle Letherby); whereas Geoff Payne poses wider challenges to researchers and calls for innovation to be framed by individuals across the whole process of knowledge gathering.</p>
<p>If the first was epistemological then the second is pragmatic, dealing with innovation as it appears in the design and collection of social data. Of particular interest for me was Mike Thelwall’s chapter dealing with the emergence of new data collection techniques, made possible by web-based activities (for example MySpace, Wikipedia). He summarises more than just these new techniques by stating:
<disp-quote>
<p>[sifting through vast amounts of data] … is like looking for a needle in a haystack … yet with modern computer technology it may take less than a second to find the needle. (p. 168)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The third section examines the incorporation of new <italic>types</italic> of data, and, unsurprisingly, it is here that an emphasis on data combination emerges: not only the incorporation of data from both traditions of the social sciences (Onwuegbuzie, Leech and Collins’ chapter stands out), but also those which are time and location specific (and here Ivano Bison and Elizabeth Griffiths are highly informative). Lastly, the collection addresses issues of sampling, inference and measurement. This section naturally contains some of the heavier essays (at least in terms of statistical arguments). However, for me, this makes them some of the more rewarding; in particular, the convergence of SEM and MLM techniques described by Rex Kline. Less intense but no less innovative are the advances in automatic item generation for use in psychological test development outlined by Susan Embretson and Heather McIntyre.</p>
<p>Emergent themes throughout the collection will come as little surprise to those familiar to the field; the social world emerges as a complex object situated in both time and space, something which has far-reaching implications for the methods with which it is examined. A volume such as this also reflects more than just the new techniques described: ‘… Social science research methods reflect the social conditions of a society at a point in time, shaped by its structural and cultural context’ (p. 270).</p>
<p>Whilst this collection is almost certainly not for newcomers to the field, it was never intended as such. This collection provides a suitable starting point for research students, professional researchers and established academics seeking a summary (though not necessarily an introduction) of the current state of a particular method or methodology, as well as incorporating a broad range of more detailed sources. There are certainly stand-out chapters (particularly W. Paul Vogt and colleagues’ analysis of the ‘gold standard’ RCT); however, a review of this size cannot do justice to every contribution. It is of course the issue of scope which is the one thing some readers will find fault with – an intractable problem for editors of collected essays.</p>
<p>If there was an overarching message to take away from this volume it would be that methodological innovation lies not in the analytical tools utilised but, rather, in a ‘post-paradigm war’ <italic>attitude</italic> to all elements of the research process (p. 4), involving social data of any kind. This position is neatly summarised in Vogt’s own chapter:
<disp-quote>
<p>… to challenge the very idea that there is or should be a single standard of excellence … the belief in one preferred method to accomplish complex human activities does not conform to most reasonable assumptions about the social world and human actions in it. (p. 296)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Researchers with an interest in methodological innovation would be wise to order a copy, though quickly, as the other key message from the volume is that social science methodology develops at an increasingly astounding pace.</p>
