<p>With this collection of essays, Ivan Ureta aims to overcome a deficiency in research on media and migration—its lack of attention to North African countries. The book claims to examine commonalities and differences between media portrayals of migration in sending and transit countries like Algeria, Morocco, and Libya, on one hand, and receiving European countries on the other, here represented by the case studies of Spain, Malta, and Switzerland. The picture is not limited to the media, as migratory patterns, government policies, political parties’ agendas, state control of the media, and public opinion are also taken into account.</p>
<p>The essays in the book were written just before the so-called “Arab Spring” revolts that would change political and communicative spaces, especially in Libya, but this is not a major drawback. Instead, it is the challenge of comparing European and North African countries that is not met. Interesting and important similarities are overlooked, such as a common vocabulary that characterizes illegal immigrants as “desperate” not only in Algerian media, but in European countries as well. Similarly, the observation that like their neighbors north of the Mediterranean, Algeria and Morocco have their own “others”—namely sub-Saharan migrants—is not taken further. In short, cross-Mediterranean influences are not examined. One is left to wonder instead if mainstream European media vocabulary and points of view have simply infiltrated North African scholars’ own prose. In one chapter, Algerians trying to go to Europe are surprisingly and insistently called by author Assia Kaced, but not the media, “would-be <italic>immigrants</italic>,” as opposed to <italic>emigrants</italic> from the Algerian perspective.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, only some essays are empirical research studies. Others rely mainly on existing literature, NGO and official reports and statistics, and some secondary analysis. In the chapters based on original research, the empirical basis is often narrow, not clearly defined, and the samples of respondents or of newspaper articles are drawn with no explicit or precise criteria (“I have chosen the main articles covering the year…” [p. 94]; “The questionnaire was administered to 121 participants” [p. 140]). To be sure, the conditions of feasibility and funding of empirical research are not as generous in North Africa as in other regions. Even so, this does not explain the use of invalid indicators and the elaboration of hazardous interpretations. In Moha Ennaji’s chapter on “The Effects of the Media on Moroccan Migration” for example, the opinions of a hundred survey respondents (chosen with unknown criteria) about the influence of the media on their images of Europe and on their migratory project are used as a measure of media effects. The author claims that “media’s impact on migratory projects is relatively small, affecting less than 10 percent of Moroccan immigrants in Europe.” It is unclear how he arrived at this curious conclusion, but it is evident that he draws on the answers to questions like “Why did you migrate to Europe?” (Family, Friends, Television, Radio…) in which not unexpectedly only 3.1 percent of the 121 interviewees chose TV or radio (pp. 149–151).</p>
<p>It is striking that by far the greatest deviation from academic research and writing standards is found in the chapters written by the editor himself. Here heterogeneous and sometimes off-topic data and quotations, meandering discussions, simplistic hypotheses, melodramatic tones and truisms, and apodictic arguments look like the scattershot products of Google Translator—except that at least the latter do not need, as Ureta’s chapters do, Microsoft Word’s spell-check. An excerpt from the chapter on the Swiss case will help the reader make their own assessment of the text’s coherence: “Obviously, in epochs of turmoil and economic and financial uncertainty, security is a prime argument to be used. The linkage between migration and security is almost automatic, whereas the measures and policies used to reactivate the economy and to overcome this status of danger are widely accepted and applauded. As such, economics and politics are not a classical example of modernist disciplines, including predictability, observation, reproducibility, and objectivity. This is not even a question of rhetoric, as far as rhetoric could be the ‘art of probing what men believe they ought to believe, rather than proving what is true according to abstract methods’ [quotation]. It is rather a question of misinformation, and as a consequence, ‘a number of recent studies suggest that natives respond to immigration by voting with their feet’ [quotation]” (p. 243).</p>
<p>Despite all these important shortcomings, some chapters of the book provide informative snapshots about the state of the public debate and the topics covered by the media. This is the case in the essay written by Davide Vignati, which additionally provides a wide-spectrum overview of migratory patterns, media discourse and freedom, and government migratory policies in the Maghreb. Although more similar to a literature review, this chapter written by a journalist gives a richer account of the relationship between these factors than do the scholarly works in the volume, even though it draws on them. A similarly multifaceted understanding, this time using interviews conducted among journalists in Malta, is provided by Carmen Sammut, who focuses on the tension between ethical principles, “public sentiment,” and party alliances faced by newsmakers dealing with migration. The two essays on Algeria are interesting too, in that they show the contradictions of the media’s fragmented portrayal of migrants, who are presented alternatively as brave heroes, pitiful victims, and dangerous traitors to the nation.</p>
<p><italic>Media, Migration and Public Opinion</italic> might be used as an introduction to the media and political discourse on migration in under-studied areas like Malta and the Maghreb countries, keeping in mind that in this volume, only Algeria is actually covered by empirical research, while Morocco is sketched with quotations from existing literature that highlight its government’s active endorsement of emigration. Libya receives only a short contextualizing portrayal, one of a country that does the “dirty work” of migration control and whose strictly controlled media do not like to talk about it. For such an introductory purpose, the reading of a few selected chapters will suffice.</p>
