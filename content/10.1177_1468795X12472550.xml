<abstract>
<p>This article explores Alasdair MacIntyre’s social philosophy, which is regarded as both a sweeping criticism of the moral incoherence of modern society and a wide-ranging challenge to value-neutral and descriptive sociology. MacIntyre argues that any moral philosophy presupposes sociology, and hence the following discussion outlines his sociology as the underpinning of his criticisms of emotivism – the proposition that what is pleasurable to me and aesthetically satisfying is the good – in modern philosophy. MacIntyre is criticized on two grounds: firstly his work creates a nostalgic picture of the coherence of past communities; and secondly it neglects the growth of human rights and international law as instances of a shared moral system that is not based on emotivism. Indeed his <italic>Dependent Rational Animals</italic> can offer a notion of the ontology of human rights based on human vulnerability. The article concludes with a comparison of MacIntyre and Jacques Maritain, who, from the work of Aristotle and Aquinas, contributed to the construction of human rights as the modern version of natural rights. The growth of international law and human rights suggests that MacIntyre’s pessimistic view of the collapse of a common moral vocabulary is unfounded.</p>

<p>It is widely recognized that relativism is a problem confronting modern societies because it rules out the possibility of reaching any specific agreement about moral principles. Indeed, in its postmodern form, it regards as groundless any notion that society can be constituted by a system of shared values. There is also a liberal version of this argument that modern societies are characterized by incommensurable beliefs, but for the purpose of this discussion, we can take Max Weber’s sociology as the quintessential summary of the idea that modernity involves an endless confrontation of worldviews. Relativism is, however, only the peak of the iceberg, reflecting much deeper issues about the loss of community, the secularization of society and the fragmentation of values. In the social sciences, the relativism issue is associated with a cluster of problems that include the notion of a value-free sociology, methodological nationalism, the difficulties that pertain to comparative research and hence the connections between explanation, description and interpretation. Many of these current problems in sociology can be traced back inevitably to Max Weber’s philosophy of social science publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468795X12472550">Weber, 1949</xref>) and to the debate with Heinrich Rickert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468795X12472550">Oakes, 1988</xref>). The classic criticism of Weber’s view of value judgement with respect to natural law came from Leo Strauss in <italic>Natural Right and History</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468795X12472550">1950</xref>). Sociologists have generally fought shy of significant engagement with moral issues in terms of normative ethical analysis, opting for description over evaluation. In short, so-called ‘cultural relativism’ sits at the core of a bundle of epistemological issues in contemporary sociology.</p>
<p>Various attempts have been made to address relativism. In this paper I examine the social philosophy of Alasdair MacIntyre, who has been a central figure in the revival of virtue ethics, the defence of Aristotle and the critique of emotivism in twentieth-century philosophy. His attack on the emotivism of G.E. Moore’s <italic>Principia Ethica</italic> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468795X12472550">1903</xref> is central to his view of the problems not only of moral philosophy but of modern society as such, and before proceeding we should briefly consider Moore’s position. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468795X12472550">MacIntyre (1984</xref>: 15), Moore’s emotivism had its origins in nineteenth-century ‘intuitionism’ and in the belief that the reasons for ethical choices can find no ultimately satisfactory rational defence because they are grounded in intuitions. They are incapable of proof or disproof. The core notion of Moore’s philosophy was goodness, but it could not be defined, only illustrated, for example, in experiences of friendship and aesthetic enjoyment. Therefore the greatest good is in fact the personal satisfactions and aesthetic pleasures we derive from life. MacIntyre claims that Moore’s emotivism is at best shallow, since anything that feels good is good. To understand Moore, we need to understand the society that produces emotivism. Now MacIntyre claims that a moral philosophy ‘characteristically presupposes a sociology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468795X12472550">1984</xref>: 23); it requires some account of the nature of the society in which moral utterances occur. We can say therefore that the purpose of MacIntyre’s philosophy was to consider the moral dilemmas of the modern world by developing a sociological analysis of the social structure that underpinned those dilemmas. The two sources of that sociology were sought in Christianity and Marxism, but both ultimately failed to provide MacIntyre with adequate answers to his questions about the contemporary impasse of moral debate.</p>
<p>While MacIntyre started his academic career by developing a Marxist analysis of modern society and the Christian religion, as his work unfolded the influence of Aristotle and then Aquinas became increasingly more prominent. Having started with a commitment to Presbyterianism, MacIntyre eventually converted to Roman Catholicism. While there has been considerable interest in the theological and philosophical roots of his work, professional philosophy has often ignored the obvious fact that MacIntyre was both a sociologist and a philosopher. In the narrow sense, he was a professor of sociology at a British university. In a broader sense, he constantly engages with sociologists, especially with Max Weber and Erving Goffman, in his attempt to capture and describe the dilemmas of modernity.</p>
<p>We can therefore regard much of his historical account of philosophy in, for example, <italic>A Short History of Ethics</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468795X12472550">1998</xref>) as an exercise in the sociology of knowledge. MacIntyre’s basic thesis is that we can no longer conduct an adequate discussion of the virtues, because the communal nature of life has been shattered with modernization, leaving us with no vocabulary by which we can ask meaningful questions, let alone find satisfactory answers. This position was developed primarily in <italic>After Virtue</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468795X12472550">1984</xref>), but similar arguments were also presented in <italic>Secularization and Moral Change</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468795X12472550">1967</xref>), in which he claimed that the communal framework in which Christianity was intelligible has collapsed under the impact of urbanization, secularization and capitalist modernization.</p>
<p>There are many problems with MacIntyre’s position, but in this discussion I shall concentrate on two issues. I consider the accusation that his view of the past is nostalgic. He constructs a picture of past societies as if they were unified or organic communities with little conflict over values. To take one example, the long historical struggle between Protestants and Catholics in Europe indicates a rather different view of communal integration. I suggest, however, that nostalgia is only a serious problem when it precludes or obscures a constructive approach to the present and the future. MacIntyre argues that we can face our present moral confusion by seeking to defend communal life against the corrosive impact of individualism and capitalism. His resistance to emotivism on the basis of preserving communal life requires, however, a more sophisticated understanding of the sociological contrast between community and association or between <italic>Gemeinschaft</italic> and <italic>Gesellschaft.</italic></p>
<p>The second issue, and the one I devote more attention to, is that MacIntyre has very little to say about the role of law in human societies and appears to ignore the modern evolution of human rights as an indication of shared values across different cultures. In principle the law, and especially the common law, could be regarded as an important repository of shared values, customs and beliefs. The law could function as a shield against the erosion of the community that MacIntyre regards as essential to the virtues. Law is important because, while it is simply an institution like other institutions (the family, the community and so forth), it is also the vehicle of social values. Consider the role of the Supreme Court in the United States. Whereas Max Weber and legal positivists like John Austin regarded law as command (by a sovereign authority), modern jurisprudence, following Ronald Dworkin’s <italic>Empire’s Law</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468795X12472550">1986</xref>), rejected the separation of law and morality. I further explore this issue through a consideration of the emergence of human rights, and discuss a recent article by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468795X12472550">Nicos Mouzelis (2011)</xref> on MacIntyre’s neglect of human rights as a possible solution or corrective to this argument about three rhetorics of morality. I conclude that MacIntyre’s social philosophy needs to consider the law – both positive and natural – as the principal underpinning of community. The absence of a defence of legal reasoning in his work is curious given his obvious dependence on Thomist principles. This discussion of natural law and human rights provides an opportunity to consider, in comparison to MacIntyre, the work of one of the leading Thomist scholars of human rights, namely Jacques Maritain.</p>
<sec id="section1-1468795X12472550">
<title>MacIntyre and sociology</title>
<p>British sociology has been conditioned by an uncertain and weak professional development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468795X12472550">Turner, 2007</xref>). Despite a proliferation of sociology departments in the 1960s and 1970s, its presence in the university system has often been overshadowed by history and politics. Given a weak domestic tradition, it has been heavily dependent on continental social philosophy, and its intellectual consolidation after the Second World War was closely associated with the substantial influx of European, typically Jewish, refugees who found shelter in British universities during and after the ascendancy of German fascism. The peculiarity of British sociology is that, while its development has been slow and hesitant, the absence of professionalism allowed a diverse and rich, if heterogeneous, body of scholarship. Sociology was never concentrated around elite universities, and by contrast it has had a distinguished history at provincial universities such as Leicester, Lancaster, Liverpool, Essex and Warwick.</p>
<p>Alasdair MacIntyre was probably the most important product of this post-war situation in which, as sociology grew rapidly in the new universities, borders between disciplines were not closely guarded by professional bodies. As a professional philosopher, MacIntyre was also a professor of sociology at the University of Essex. The paradox of British, unlike American, sociology is that it has often been carried out by people who have not been overtly connected to mainstream sociology as an academic discipline. Arguably the most influential British social philosopher of the post-war period, Alasdair Chalmers MacIntyre was born in 1929 in Glasgow. Having taken masters degrees at Manchester and Oxford, he lectured at the University of Leeds before becoming a professor of sociology at the University of Essex. He moved to the United States in 1970 and has held professorial positions at various institutions, including Wellesley College and Notre Dame University.</p>
<p>Macintyre’s style of social philosophy represented British sociology at its most stylish, philosophical and provocative. His criticism of modern society is heavily influenced by Marx, Aristotle and Aquinas; he deploys these sources to argue that individualism and the unfettered quest for material wealth in capitalism have undermined any coherent moral framework. The erosion of this moral framework is in turn an outcome of the fragmentation of communal life. The result is the dominance of emotivism in philosophy and everyday life in which whatever feels emotionally to our taste is good. In the course of presenting this argument, MacIntyre has been committed to a defence of the secularization thesis, which has become in recent years the target of much criticism in the sociology of religion. Nevertheless, his interpretation of British religious culture was convincingly defended in such works as <italic>Secularization and Moral Change</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468795X12472550">1967</xref>), <italic>Marxism and Christianity</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468795X12472550">1995 [1968]</xref>) and (with Paul Ricoeur) <italic>The Religious Significance of Atheism</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468795X12472550">1969</xref>). In his analysis of the loss of moral authority with the growth of secular modernity, MacIntyre’s unique blend of philosophical inspection, meticulous analysis and critical social reflection has remained a positive characteristic of British sociology.</p>
<p>Why do I want to insist that we take MacIntyre’s sociology as seriously as we take his philosophy? The reason is that this combination of empirical sociology and moral analysis offers a clue to his attempt to overcome the fact–value distinction that is closely associated with the legacy of Max Weber. Firstly, he persistently evokes Weber and Goffman as sociologists who offered a decisive understanding of the break-down of community and the collapse of moral coherence. While MacIntyre is critical of both, he nevertheless takes their respective sociologies very seriously. Referring to Weber in <italic>After Virtue</italic>, he wrote that
<disp-quote>
<p>[t]he contemporary vision of the world, so I have suggested, is predominantly, although perhaps not always in detail, Weberian. … belief in an irreducible plurality of values is in itself an insistent and central Weberian theme … for in our culture we know of no organized movement towards power that is not bureaucratic and managerial in mode and we know of no justification for authority which is not Weberian in form.</p>
<attrib>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468795X12472550">MacIntyre, 1984</xref>:109)</attrib>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Towards the end of <italic>After Virtue</italic>, MacIntyre argues that ‘as Marxists move towards power they always tend to become Weberians’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468795X12472550">1984</xref>: 160), and that is because, I would argue, in attending to the problems of authority, organization, the state, the function of parties, the role of law and the bureaucracy, the sociology of Marx offers little guidance. Weber’s account of the neutrality, hierarchy and authority of modern rational bureaucracy provides MacIntyre with the perfect account of efficiency as the primary <italic>raison d’être</italic> of modern institutions and at the same time Weber’s bleak vision of a godless and amoral world – the iron cage – resonates with MacIntyre’s own criticisms of heartless and soulless modernity.</p>
<p>The other key figure in MacIntyre’s critique is the American sociologist Erving Goffman. In <italic>The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468795X12472550">1959</xref>), Goffman studied the micro-rituals by which we routinely construct the self in modern social encounters. These social selves of the corporate world are, however, fabricated, because successful interactions require strategies in which we may try to avoid embarrassment and loss of face. Social roles are not fixed, and in the public arena individuals have to work at the presentation of a self that is vulnerable and uncertain. The self only exists within the gaze of observers. This method of examining society was defined as the ‘dramaturgical approach’ insofar as Goffman recognized that we often play social roles in which we can distance ourselves from the immediate situation. Like the script in a stage play, the interactions of everyday encounters have to be performed and enacted. We have to build up a repertoire of skills and tactics to be socially successful, and hence handbooks on body language have become essential guides to social success. The point of this dramaturgical approach was to avoid the impression created by the sociology of Talcott Parsons that roles are fixed and secure. The social environment which Goffman described in the 1950s in America represented the historical realization of MacIntyre’s fears about the collapse of the moral order. With the ‘theatricalization’ of everyday life, conformity to social norms of behaviour is no longer linked to virtue. In the post-war suburban society described by Goffman in his interaction rituals or in the conformist world of the ‘organization man’ of corporate American (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468795X12472550">Whyte, 1956</xref>), surface behaviour rather than moral intention came to be the significant issue, and as a result all moral concerns were dissolved under the weight of this artificial corporate culture.</p>
<p>The organizational society as described by William F. Whyte was a world of managed emotions and standardized lifestyles. In this emerging corporate culture, domestic spaces had to be refashioned in the norms of commercial success. Public and domestic life were fashioned around the goals of salesmanship, a world that MacIntyre captured perfectly in his commentary on Goffmanesque role-playing:
<disp-quote>
<p>The unit of analysis in Goffman’s accounts is always the individual role-player striving to effect his will within a role-structured situation. The goal of the Goffmanesque role player is effectiveness and success in Goffman’s social universe is nothing but what passes for success. There is nothing else for it to be. For Goffman’s world is empty of objective standards of achievement; it is so defined that there is no cultural or social space from which appeal to such standards could be made. … Because success is whatever passes for success, it is in the regard of others that I prosper or fail to prosper; hence the importance of presentation as a –perhaps <italic>the</italic> central – theme.</p>
<attrib>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468795X12472550">1984</xref>: 115)</attrib>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>MacIntyre goes on to observe that this Goffmanesque world of suburban and corporate America is the opposite of the world described in Aristotle’s <italic>Nicomachean Ethics</italic>, because ‘in Goffman’s social world imputations of merit are themselves part of the contrived social reality whose function is to aid or to contain some striving, role-playing will’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468795X12472550">1984</xref>: 116). Successful role-playing requires only interactional skills in managing the front stage, carefully avoiding any embarrassment and strategically protecting oneself from any loss of face. The social world is a game in which winning and losing take on an arbitrary character, and hence the lottery of success in the modern world is unlike the heroic ethic of a warrior society that MacIntyre associates with the ancient Athens of Agamemnon or the warrior communities of the Icelandic saga. He argues, however, that we cannot criticize Goffman’s sociology as a cynical portrayal of the corporate world of modern America, because ‘there can be no such thing as a cynical disregard for objective merit for the cynic to disregard’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468795X12472550">1984</xref>: 116). Because the shared moral framework is shattered, there are no objective, shared criteria by which the virtue of an actor or the merit of an action-situation could be judged. These interpretations of two prominent sociologists rest on a particular view of secularization that informs the whole of MacIntyre’s sociology.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1468795X12472550">
<title>MacIntyre, secularization and the problem of religion</title>
<p>Religion, specifically Christianity, clearly played an important and continuous role in MacIntyre’s understanding of the moral and political problems of the modern world. As a young man he had trained to be a Presbyterian minister, and in his intellectual development he had sought to combine Christianity with his political radicalism – at the time largely driven by Marxism. He came to abandon faith mainly because he could find no rational grounds to support his belief (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468795X12472550">MacIntyre, 1994</xref>). Hence Karl Marx’s view of Christianity played an important role in the development of MacIntyre’s early work, especially in <italic>Marxism: An Interpretation</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468795X12472550">1953</xref>) and <italic>Marxism and Christianity</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468795X12472550">1995 [1968]</xref>). Marx’s own commentaries on religion were limited but striking. In Volume 1 of <italic>Capital</italic> he elaborated his original response to Hegel and Feuerbach to construct a theory of reification to describe the upside-down world of capitalism and to promote the notion that capitalism gave rise to a fetishism of commodities. He claimed that the ‘religious world is but the reflex of the real world. For a society based upon the production of commodities … Christianity with its <italic>cultus</italic> of abstract man, more especially in its bourgeois developments, Protestantism, Deism, etc., is the most fitting form of religion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468795X12472550">Marx, 1974 [1867]</xref>: 83). Out of Marx’s ‘critical criticism’ there emerged an influential heritage of sociological analysis in which religion was interpreted as the alienation of human capacities which are re-ascribed to divine powers, creating a society in which religion serves to obscure the real relations of economic exploitation. In Marxist politics, overcoming the hold of religion over society is thus the first step towards human emancipation.</p>
<p>Marxist ideas, including Lucien Goldmann’s analysis of the pessimism of Pascal’s view of the world in his <italic>The Hidden God</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468795X12472550">1964</xref>), played an important part in MacIntyre’s subsequent studies of politics and religion in <italic>Marxism and Christianity</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468795X12472550">1995 [1968]</xref>), <italic>Secularization and Moral Change</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468795X12472550">1967</xref>), and <italic>Against the Self-Images of the Age</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468795X12472550">1971</xref>). In his early analysis of religious change, he showed how the urbanization of the United Kingdom and the industrial revolution had brought about the destruction of the forms of communal life ‘to which religion had given symbolic expression’, and that the general function of religion ‘is always at least an expression of a society’s moral unity, and it lends to that unity a cosmic and universal significance and justification’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468795X12472550">MacIntyre, 1967</xref>: 12). As members of the working class were drawn into city life through urbanization, ‘they were finally torn from a form of community in which it could be intelligibly and credibly claimed that the norms which govern social life had universal and cosmic significance, and were God-given’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468795X12472550">MacIntyre, 1967</xref>: 15). As industrial society developed, each social class acquired its own communal dimension and its own religious expression. In England, Methodism came to provide both the discipline and piety of the lower middle class, which through hard work and abstinence enjoyed social mobility, often over time returning to the Anglican communion. High church Anglicanism remained the religion of the elite. There was no longer a religious canopy for the whole society and, as a consequence of class compromise, the English came to share a set of ‘secondary virtues’ – fair-play, tolerance and pragmatism. These virtues do not specify the ends to which we should adhere; they describe the appropriate means to values that remain vague and incomensurate.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468795X12472550">MacIntyre (1953</xref>: 1), through his engagement with both Catholicism and Marxism, developed a distinctive theory of secularization as the separation of the sacred and the secular, arguing that ‘if our religion is fundamentally irrelevant to our politics, then we are recognizing the political as a realm outside the reign of God. … A religion which recognizes such a division, as does our own, is one on the point of dying’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468795X12472550">1953</xref>: 1). MacIntyre went on to demonstrate in <italic>After Virtue</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468795X12472550">1984</xref>) that a secular society was one in which there was no authoritative language within which to settle moral disputes, and that in contemporary society the dominance of emotivism in philosophy – all moral judgements are nothing other than expressions of preference or feeling – is the consequence of secularization.</p>
<p>In many respects, therefore, MacIntyre’s substantive claims about modernity depend heavily on Weber’s sociology of industrial capitalism. The development of a sociology of secularization emerged in Weber’s theory of the rationalization and demystification of the world. According to Weber, more and more aspects of everyday life came under the influence of science, and, subsequently, meaningful interpretations of the world depended less and less on religious or metaphysical presuppositions. In more complex terms, where there is a differentiation of the spheres of life into separate spheres of aesthetics, religion, the economy, politics and so forth, then religion loses its overall authority. With the emergence of these ‘value spheres’, official religions had relatively little authority or control. The result of the differentiation of society is the emergence of the disenchantment of the world, in which in their everyday lives people are increasingly confronted by the meaninglessness of life. Modern science, while offering means to achieve our ends, has nothing to offer in terms of a moral or religious understanding of reality. With the transition from community (<italic>Gemeinschaft</italic>) to association (<italic>Gesellschaft</italic>), we have lost our roots in the communal world of the past. Secularization in this Weberian framework involves the erosion of those strong communal bonds that once wrapped individuals into closely organized social groups. For Weber, early warrior societies gave rise to closely knit social groups in which there were enduring and meaningful relationships between agrarian cultivation, family life and communal living. The modern problem is that the rational world is continuously eroding these close relationships between humans and nature, and hence the disenchantment of the world has become a profoundly corrosive aspect of modernity. This fateful view of the world has attracted more general interest than Weber’s descriptive account of the secularization of British society.</p>
<p>But MacIntyre is also influenced, albeit indirectly, by the legacy of Émile Durkheim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468795X12472550">2001 [1912]</xref>). It is relevant here to recall that the work of the Scottish theologian William Robertson Smith influenced Durkheim’s views on collective rituals. In his <italic>Lectures on the Religion of the Semites</italic> in 1889, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468795X12472550">Smith (1956)</xref> had shifted the focus of scholarly attention away from religious beliefs towards common rituals, arguing that these festivals bound religious communities together, but Smith’s lingering commitment to mainstream Protestantism led him to believe that the Protestant churches had in fact evolved beyond these ‘elementary forms’. One lingering problem for Victorian intellectuals was how to explain the differences between primitive ideas about sacrifice and the place of the Eucharist in Christian practice. One obvious solution was to appeal to an evolutionary theory of religion in order to argue that Protestantism was the most highly evolved religion, and that its beliefs were essentially abstract propositions that could be justified by rational argument. For example, in his second lecture, Smith claimed that in Christianity the idea of divine fatherhood had been completely dissociated from the physical notion of natural or biological fatherhood.</p>
<p>In his contribution to <italic>The Religious Significance of Atheism</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468795X12472550">MacIntyre and Ricoeur, 1969</xref>), MacIntyre took up these issues, interpreting Humphrey Ward’s novel <italic>Robert Elsemere</italic> as an account of the intellectual climate of this late Victorian world in which there was a drift of nineteenth-century Protestantism from an evangelical faith to a secular justification of religious practice and eventually to humanism and socialism. In light of MacIntyre’s interpretation of late Victorian Britain, we might understand Durkheim’s thesis in the following manner: the political authority and social legitimacy of beliefs receive their force from classificatory systems that are collective, and which are sustained by a shared emotional life. In modern societies, collective ritual and shared emotional effervescence have been eroded, with the result that our classificatory systems lack collective authority. This understanding of the relationship between social cohesion and moral force is obviously the pivotal issue in MacIntyre’s sociology, and his commentary on <italic>Robert Elsemere</italic> paves the way to his argument that in modern society words like ‘duty’ and ‘love’ have largely lost their meaning. He argues that, when Jesus placed love at the centre of his teaching, the ‘concept of love has meaning only in the context of a legal morality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468795X12472550">MacIntyre: 1967</xref>: 73). The death-of-God theology of liberal Christians such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468795X12472550">John Robinson (2003 [1963])</xref> rests on a morality of intention, but such a moral teaching can have no force outside the Law that is presupposed in the New Testament.</p>

<title>Dependent rational animals</title>
<p>MacIntyre’s critical perspective on modern morality ironically also has nothing to say about the law. In fact the issue of law in relation to morals is strangely absent from his philosophy as a whole. This raises the question: can the modern development of human rights fill this yawning gap in secular societies? Of course the immediate response to this proposal is that such a claim fails to attend to the contextual specificity that MacIntyre believes is lacking in so much philosophy. The drift of modern anthropology has been to reject the idea that such rights could have universal significance. Rights are simply claims or the effect of ‘rights talk’ that can only have specific and particular significance in a given cultural context.</p>
<p>My <italic>Vulnerability and Human Rights</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468795X12472550">Turner, 2006</xref>) attempted to get round this traditional criticism by appealing to the idea that, while we may be divided by culture, we are united by ontology. I argued that human beings are ontologically frail and their natural environment is uncertain and threatening. In order to protect themselves from the vagaries and afflictions of life, they must build social institutions (especially political, familial and religious institutions) that come to constitute the arrangements that we call ‘society’. This argument clearly adopts a view of the body that is compatible with MacIntyre’s <italic>Dependent Rational Animals</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468795X12472550">1999</xref>), in which he criticizes Western philosophy for its neglect of two central facts about human beings: their vulnerability and their afflictions. He goes on to argue that vulnerability explains our dependence on others for protection and sustenance.</p>
<p>The concept of vulnerability is derived from the Latin for ‘wound’. Although <italic>vulnus</italic> refers to real wounds in the human body, it is in many respects itself a metaphor for frailty. Wounds are open and they open us to the dangers of life; the wound is a metaphor of the human condition. It is instructive that ‘vulnerability’ should have such an obviously corporeal origin. In the seventeenth century, vulnerability had both a passive and an active significance, namely to be wounded and to wound. To vulnerate is thus to wound another, but in its modern usage it has come to signify the human capacity to be open to wounds. Vulnerability has become, in one sense, more abstract: it refers to the human capacity to be exposed to psychological or moral damage. It refers increasingly to our ability to suffer (morally and spiritually) rather than to a physical capacity for pain from our exposure or openness to the world. To be vulnerable as a human being is to possess a structure of sentiments, feelings and emotions by which we can steer a passage through the social world.</p>
<p>The point of this formulation of ontology is to provide a foundation for a sociological and normative defence of human rights as protective institutions. Firstly there is the argument that the biological nature of human frailty requires human rights as a protective canopy, and secondly there is the argument that social institutions are necessary but precarious. Given frailty and precariousness, human beings need a legal framework in which to seek respite from risk and the contingencies of everyday life. Both of these arguments (frailty and precariousness) are an attempt to develop a contemporary version of Hobbes’s theory of the state, but outside the limitations of any utilitarian notion of social contract. Hobbes argued in <italic>Leviathan</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468795X12472550">1962 [1651]</xref>) that rational human beings with conflicting interests in a state of nature would be in a condition of perpetual war. In order to protect themselves from mutual, endless slaughter, they create a state through a social contract, which organizes social space in the collective interests of rational but antagonistic human beings. Furthermore, the institutions which humans create as protective or defensive mechanisms have to be sufficiently powerful to regulate human agents in social space and as a consequence come unintentionally to present a threat to those same human agents. For example, the state, which holds a monopoly over legalized violence, is not only a guarantor of social security but also an instrument necessarily of violence.</p>
<p>Dependency and vulnerability both point to the need for a system of rights to protect individuals from external dangers. They also underline the importance of community in which to lead meaningful lives and to enjoy the support that comes from shared communal ties. In other words, we need the law not simply as a coercive instrument of the state, but also as an expression of common interests and shared concerns.</p>
<p>MacIntyre has made an important and original contribution to the modern discussion of ontology. <italic>Dependent Rational Animals</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468795X12472550">1999</xref>) is a significant addition to his general philosophical criticisms of both modern philosophy and modern society. However, his position on ontology has a one-dimensional emphasis on human disability and afflictions; it is ultimately limited because it presents a somewhat passive view of vulnerability. While it is important to recognize that the world that human beings fashion collectively is inherently and alarmingly precarious, we need to avoid the construction of a melancholic social science. Vulnerability is an aspect of human weakness, but is also a fundamental aspect not only of our frail humanity but also of our resilience. MacIntyre’s focus on human disability and morbidity fails to acknowledge the resilience of our human condition. His melancholic focus on the limitations of the human body finds its parallel in his nostalgic vision of history. Can international law and human rights offer a possible answer to MacIntyre’s complaint that in the modern world we have no method of taking moral questions seriously because we have no shared vocabulary? Does this criticism also apply to the globalization of human rights?</p>

<title>Human rights: MacIntyre and Maritain</title>
<p>Academic study of human rights has been unsurprisingly dominated by philosophy, jurisprudence and history. In many respects, the basic legal and philosophical framework for the theory of rights was laid out by the American jurist Wesley Hohfeld at the beginning of the twentieth century in his <italic>Fundamental Legal Conceptions</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468795X12472550">1919</xref>). Sociologists have, generally speaking, been absent from this field of study, in part because professional sociology has not been inclined to address normative issues and because the commitment to ‘methodological nationalism’ has limited interest in international as opposed to national institutions. Sociologists feel more comfortable when conducting research on social rights and citizenship, which are bounded by the nation state, and there is not yet anything approaching a sustained sociology of human rights. A recent spate of handbooks and companions of human rights from sociologists may, however, suggest an emerging interest (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468795X12472550">Cushman, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The issue of law and rights has emerged in a recent article on MacIntyres’s <italic>Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468795X12472550">1990</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468795X12472550">Nicos Mouzelis (2011)</xref> suggests that the cultural contexts of moral debate are not as radically incommensurable as MacIntyre fears, because the process of globalization has provided a counter-balance to such national diversity. Mouzelis praises MacIntyre for trying to develop moral arguments that are responsive to anthropological and sociological research. However, as we have seen, MacIntyre has remained pessimistic about the prospects of establishing a moral framework that has some universal relevance while remaining sensitive to national or local cultures. For MacIntyre, traditional Christian morality has been undermined by secularization, and Marxism, which could offer a modern morality, has in fact in times of crisis always fallen back on Kantianism or utilitarianism. Indeed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468795X12472550">MacIntyre (1984</xref>: 261) claims that Marx in the first chapter of <italic>Capital</italic> Volume 1 offered a ‘socialized Robinson Crusoe’ without explaining how such an individual would engage freely with others. Mouzelis offers a possible solution to MacIntyre’s impasse by claiming that the now almost universal acceptance of human rights suggests that the globalization of the principles of the Declaration of 1948 can overcome the erstwhile fragmentation and diversity of human cultures. This is not, of course, to deny the many well-known problems with human rights, such as the difference between the acceptance and enforcement of rights.</p>
<p>In this discussion of Mouzelis’s proposal I turn to a recent publication by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468795X12472550">Samuel Moyn (2010)</xref>, who in his historical account of the emergence of human rights presents two interconnected arguments. The first is to reject the standard view that human rights were the product of the immediate post-war period, specifically in response to the discovery of the victims of the Jewish Holocaust, and the second is to explore the problem of how human rights can be enforced outside or beyond the sovereignty of states. The first argument attempts to challenge the conventional view that, at least in formal terms, human rights were created in 1948 by the Universal Declaration. Moyn shows that in the late 1940s the idea that states could be constrained by human rights was not taken seriously. The legacy of the Treaty of Westphalia and the Western emphasis on individual rights discourse guaranteed the irrelevance of human rights to practical politics at the time, and ‘the prospect of moving to legally enforce human rights across borders that a few observers still considered a live possibility as late as 1949 was dead by 1950’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468795X12472550">Moyn, 2010</xref>: 69). In addition, there was no socialist renaissance to offer an alternative vision of rights, and hence human rights remained compatible with the commitment to the political autonomy of the sovereign state. Tragically the anti-colonial movements from the Bandung Conference of 1955 onwards were also based on the idea of <italic>national</italic> independence and self-determination, and hence these nationalist movements were not in any meaningful sense human rights movements. In fact the principle of self-determination, which was widely embraced by post-colonial governments, was the primary obstacle to the spread of human rights beyond the West.</p>
<p>Human rights began to emerge on the global political agenda in the 1970s when growing dissatisfaction with the historic role of states in the international order and widespread recognition of the failures of communism opened up opportunities for rethinking the role of rights in international affairs. Human rights emerged as a serviceable ideology for a variety of social movements such as women’s internationalism and political dissidents in Poland and Hungary, and as the basis of global NGO activity. The presidency of Jimmy Carter, who in his inauguration in 1977 declared an absolute commitment to human rights as the basis of American foreign policy, was also an important development. However, the critical turning-point occurred when academic lawyers came to embrace human rights as the normative framework of international law. These lawyers, who began to question the prevailing realist doctrines of international relations theory, embraced human rights as part of their core business. Without international law and international legal institutions, especially international courts, human rights could not play a significant role in modern politics. While the problem of the enforcement of human rights in the absence of global governance remains an important practical concern, law is a crucial ingredient of the effectivity of human rights aspirations, and hence it is strange that in modern sociology, including the sociology of globalization, the role of the law has been almost entirely absent from discussion.</p>
<p>Was this possibility – international law and human rights as the common basis of morality – not considered at all by MacIntyre? One figure who was central to the growth of human rights and the reassessment of natural law was Jacques Maritain (1882–1973). He was a major philosopher in the Thomist tradition and played a significant role in the drafting of the Declaration of Human Rights. Critical of the underlying positivist empiricism of science and influenced by the philosophy of Henri Bergson, he developed a critique of these dominant assumptions of science in the United States, converting eventually to Roman Catholicism in 1906. In particular Maritain was deeply influenced by Aristotle and St Thomas Aquinas. The key issue in Thomism, as opposed to Augustianian Christianity, is that Aquinas did not see human nature as essentially evil and therefore Maritain believed in the capacity of human reason to direct action. On these somewhat eclectic foundations (Bergsonian vitalism, Aristotle’s virtue ethics and Thomist rationalism), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468795X12472550">Maritain (1968a)</xref> came to develop ‘integral humanism’, which, while rejecting Western secularism as barren, sought to build a bridge between Christianity and secular politics. The result was two works of political philosophy – <italic>Christianity and Democracy</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468795X12472550">1986b</xref>) and <italic>The Rights of Man and Natural Law</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468795X12472550">1986c</xref>) – in the 1940s in which he insisted that without a strong moral foundation democracy and freedom could never flourish. The West required a vital Christianity grounded in a proper appreciation of natural law and expressed in human rights as the modern vehicle of natural rights.</p>
<p>Maritain stood out from most critical social theorists in taking a largely positive view of the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468795X12472550">Howard, 2011</xref>). While both the French Left and European conservatives often dismissed America as a mass society and the conduit of crass consumerism, Maritain thought that individual freedom and the separation of church and state in America had produced a pluralistic and dynamic society that came close to realizing his goal of integral humanism. His <italic>Reflections on America</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468795X12472550">1958</xref>) warned against the dangers of a democracy based merely on the opinions of the majority and argued the case for an organic democracy based ultimately on natural law. He was also enthusiastic about Franklin D. Roosevelt’s ambition that freedom of religion – so central to the American spirit – should be a basic right of all nations, but for Maritain such freedom was very different from the notion that every religious opinion was valid. Rather, freedom of religion meant freedom for rational debate and dialogue, and hence it meant that the state should never coerce belief.</p>
<p>MacIntyre’s intellectual foundations in Aristotle and Aquinas are more or else shared therefore with Maritain. In <italic>After Virtue</italic> MacIntyre refers once to Maritain, saying that he regards him ‘with great respect’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468795X12472550">1984</xref>: 260). Clearly MacIntyre was influenced by Maritain, but there is an obvious difference between the two men. While Maritain worked hard to revise Thomism to have an impact on real politics and ensured that both Christianity and natural law remained relevant to the emergence of human rights, it is not clear how MacIntyre’s worldview could have concrete consequences for political reform. MacIntyre’s nostalgic view of the world we have lost does not point towards any restoration of moral coherence or any repair of the social fabric. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468795X12472550">MacIntyre (1999</xref>: 142) defended the importance of local communities in the struggle to achieved common goods, but there was no grand picture of international co-operation under the umbrella of shared human rights. Consequently his view of our historical/contemporary condition remains bleak. What confronts our children is ‘a vestigial Christian vocabulary’ and the ‘absence of any alternative vocabulary’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468795X12472550">MacIntyre, 1967</xref>: 36). Here, however, MacIntyre failed to consider the ‘alternative vocabulary’ that rights offer, despite the many problems – both practical and theoretical – that face them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1468795X12472550">
<title>Conclusion: Nostalgia and community</title>
<p>MacIntyre’s work is typically criticized on philosophical or theological grounds. Much of this critical work has been usefully assembled in a comprehensive literature review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468795X12472550">Kevin Knight (1998)</xref>. Strangely enough, given MacIntyre’s insistence that every moral doctrine presupposes a sociology, there is relatively little critique of his own underlying sociological assumptions. My argument has been that his notion of historical communities before the rise of capitalism is open to question. Indeed his work is characterized by sociological nostalgia, because he constructs an imaginary community of the past in order to criticize the society of the present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468795X12472550">Turner, 1987</xref>). This notion that the values that had once underpinned community have been replaced by an artificial society of the present was common to much twentieth-century thought. In a short note on ‘society’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468795X12472550">Robert Nisbet (1993)</xref> observed that through much of the twentieth century there had been both a negative and a positive definition of society. The negative view of society emerged in comparison to the idea of ‘community’. Whereas society was bureaucratic and impersonal, community was seen to enjoy a permanence and authority. This contrast had its intellectual origins in the famous work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468795X12472550">Ferdinand Toennies (1957 [1887])</xref> on the distinction between community and association. The alternative positive meaning, however, was situated in a contrast between society and the sovereign nation state. Whereas society was the site of individual freedoms and liberties, these were all too easily expunged by the growth of the modern state. While conservatives looked back to the security of community, pluralists like J.N. Figgis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468795X12472550">Hirst, 1994</xref>) thought that freedom, depending heavily on the survival of voluntary associations, autonomous institutions and civil society, was severely compromised by the growth of the state. Nisbet concluded his note by observing that the majority of twentieth-century writers believed that modern society was in a state of crisis from which it might not emerge. MacIntyre’s views on communities of the past and societies of today share this nostalgic view of history.</p>
<p>But MacIntyre is nostalgic in a second sense. He failed to see the possibilities for a shared moral discourse that has been opened up by the evolution of a global human rights culture. It is no longer possible to argue that this discourse of rights is merely a Western invention; it is the language of NGOS worldwide and the vocabulary of protest in Tibet, China, Egypt and Syria. It is the means of opposing authoritarian rule and tyrannical overlords. Although as I have noted there is a real problem relating to their enforcement, we cannot ignore the growth of human rights under the umbrella of international law and international courts. Furthermore, as we have seen, one source of human rights values, but not the only source, arose from Christian values in general and from Thomist ‘personalism’ in particular. Human rights cannot be dismissed as simply a modern version of liberalism on a global scale. MacIntyre might therefore have found one antidote to nostalgia in the ‘integral humanism’ of Jacques Maritain.</p>
