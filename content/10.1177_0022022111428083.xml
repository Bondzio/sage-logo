<abstract>
<p>Academic self-concept and achievement are positively related among students from the same school and country. Yet negative associations between these variables may be found at the level of schools and countries. In the present article, we propose how this apparent paradox can be explained in terms of reference group effects, in which high standards, norms, or benchmarks act to decrease academic self-concept, whereas low ones have the contrary effect. Multilevel regression analyses of the PISA 2006 data consisting of 353,403 students, 13,886 schools from 53 countries revealed an interesting pattern of relationships. Within schools, students’ science achievement and science self-concept were positively related although the size of this relationship varied considerably between countries, whereas between schools and between countries, this association was negative. Consistent with our hypothesis, the size of the between-school relationship was larger in countries with a higher percentage of selective schools. At the country level, the negative relationship between country mean achievement and self-concept was explained by country differences in educational benchmarks, standards, and norms next to country differences in response styles. In this article, we also discuss the implications for the validity of cross-cultural comparisons of self-concept.</p>

<p>International comparative studies such as the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) reveal large differences between countries in 15-year-old students’ achievement in reading, science, and mathematics. For example, in PISA 2006 the lowest performing country has a mean science score of 2.4 standard deviations lower than the highest performing country. At the same time, however, when considering student motivation and attitudes such as academic self-concept, countries that are situated among the top performers in science achievement in PISA 2006 scored among the lowest on these attitudinal measures. This phenomenon has also been observed in other international comparative studies, such as Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and Progress in International Reading and Literacy Study (PIRLS). Moreover, this negative between-country correlation has been found consistently across different subjects, grades, and cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022022111428083">Kennedy &amp; Trong, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022022111428083">Lie &amp; Turmo, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022022111428083">Shen &amp; Tam, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022022111428083">Wilkins, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Clearly, this observation sharply contradicts the general expectation that students’ self-concept would be positively associated with achievement. Motivational theories such as the expectancy-value theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022111428083">Atkinson, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022022111428083">Eccles et al., 1983</xref>) have indeed stressed the importance of self-concept in explaining achievement and achievement-related behavior. Ample evidence has been found to support the hypothesis that higher achieving students have a more positive self-concept or perceive their abilities higher than lower achieving students. However, there is evidence that this relationship is reversed when it is reviewed at the aggregate instead of the individual level.</p>
<p>The lack of correspondence between individual- and group-level correlations has been of interest to researchers for many decades. More than 50 years ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022022111428083">Robinson (1950)</xref> tackled this problem in his seminal paper. He was concerned with the number of studies that used group-level data (such as the correlation between state percentages of illiterates and immigrants) to discover something about the individual (correlation between illiteracy and immigrant status) simply because individual-level data were not (always) available. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022022111428083">Robinson (1950)</xref> demonstrated that although it is theoretically possible that individual- and group-level correlations are equal, in most cases they are not (and may differ in sign). Furthermore, he stated that individual- and group-level correlations describe different phenomena and cannot be used as valid substitutes for each other. The incorrect inference of results from group-level to individual-level data or vice versa has been termed “ecological fallacy.”</p>
<p>The aim of this article is to explain why we observe negative associations between achievement and self-concept at the country level but positive relationship at the student level when using data from PISA 2006. In addition, we will also investigate the relationship between self-concept and achievement at the school level. We hypothesize that reference group effects are responsible for the observation of inverse associations between self-concept and achievement at the aggregate level when compared with the individual level.</p>

<title>Country Differences in Reference Groups and Curriculum Standards</title>
<p>Most large-scale international comparative studies use Likert-type scales to measure self-concept for economical and practical reasons. Respondents need to indicate, for instance, on a 4-point scale ranging from <italic>strongly disagree, disagree, agree</italic>, to <italic>strongly agree</italic> to what extent they agree with a statement concerning their self-concept. However, some scholars have voiced concerns regarding the use of Likert-type scales to measure self-report measures such as self-concept. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022022111428083">Heine, Lehman, Peng, and Greenholtz (2002)</xref>, using Likert-type scales to measure constructs that require introspection and evaluation such as self-concept may yield misleading results in cross-national research when members of different countries use different standards, norms, or reference groups to evaluate statements. They further claim that Likert-type scale scores are influenced by social comparison processes and do reflect not only absolute but also relative values. In other words, they capture the respondent’s belief relative to a (culture-specific) reference group or a (culture-specific) shared norm.</p>
<p>However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022022111428083">Heine et al. (2002)</xref> further stated that valid cross-cultural comparisons may only be affected when the different cultures also hold different standards or norms with respect to the construct being measured. In other words, although members of different cultures have different reference groups by definition, this may not necessarily mean that these different reference groups are also subject to different standards. The authors cited an example where respondents in Cultures A and B are asked to judge their height measured by the statement “I am very tall” using a 4-point Likert-type scale.</p>
<p>Respondents who “strongly agree” receive a score of 4 and those who “strongly disagree” receive a score of 1. Furthermore, the average height in Culture A is 1m60 and in Culture B 1m90. In Culture A, a respondent who measures 1m70 would tick “agree” (Likert-type score: 3) because he is taller than a respondent of average height in that culture. But in Culture B, a respondent with the same height would tick “disagree” or “strongly disagree” (Likert-type score: 2 or 1). A respondent in Culture A with a height of 1m80 would tick “strongly agree” (Likert-type score: 4), but in Culture B a respondent with the same height would tick “disagree” (Likert-type score: 2). This example shows that although a respondent measuring 1m70 is clearly less tall than a respondent measuring 1m80, the Likert-type scale scores show the opposite pattern between cultures. A respondent measuring 1m70 gets a higher Likert-type scale score (i.e., 3) in Culture A compared to a respondent of 1m80 in Culture B (i.e., Likert-type scale score: 2). Because both countries have different standards or norms, the statement “I am very tall” is evaluated against this norm resulting in responses that are opposite to the real differences.</p>
<p>The present study investigates whether a similar mechanism can explain the negative relationship between self-concept and achievement across countries. If countries differ in the educational standards (with regard to science curriculum), then this may distort a comparison of the judgment, such as “I am good in science,” in the direction precisely opposite to the “real” differences in science achievement. Countries with higher science achievement may also have more demanding curricula, relatively higher expectations of teachers and parents, higher pressure to achieve, and higher academic standards, which in turn may lead to relatively lower levels of self-concept or perceived competence. Conversely, students in countries with relatively low academic standards and expectations may actually develop more positive perceptions of their own abilities in science because they are able to meet with the teachers’ tasks and demands even though their average achievement is rather low according to international (“real” or “absolute”) standards. For these reasons, we expect that countries with higher educational standards and/or a more demanding curriculum for science subjects will tend to have higher science achievement but also have relatively lower levels of self-concept than countries with lower educational standards and/or a less demanding curriculum for science education of 15-year-old students.</p>
<p>We expect that the reference group effect plays an important role in the explanation of the negative between-country relationship regardless of cross-cultural differences in response styles. Cross-cultural differences in response styles on Likert-type scales such as acquiescence, social desirability, and extreme responses have been proposed to also play a role in the explanation of the negative association at the country level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022022111428083">Cheung &amp; Rensvold, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022022111428083">Lie &amp; Turmo, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022022111428083">Peng, Nisbett, &amp; Wong, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022022111428083">Walker, 2007</xref>). Previous research has demonstrated that compared to North Americans, East Asians tend to avoid the extreme points on the Likert-type scale when responding to statements reflecting positive emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022022111428083">Heine et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022022111428083">Heine et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022022111428083">Lie &amp; Turmo, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022022111428083">Peng et al., 1997</xref>). This observation is often referred to as <italic>modesty bias</italic>, which is attributed to the fact that in East Asian cultures people value being modest more than in Western cultures. This is explained with the prevalence of Confucian traditions in East Asia that shape attitudes, values, and behavior in these countries. Therefore, we expect that the mean self-concept scale scores of students in East Asian countries will tend to be lower than that of students from other countries. We expect that differences in reference groups and the associated differences in educational standards, norms, or benchmarks will additionally explain country differences in self-concept.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0022022111428083">
<title>School Differences in Reference Groups and Curriculum Standards</title>
<p>If our hypothesis about reference groups holds, we should be able to observe a negative relationship not only between self-concept and achievement at the level of countries but also between other group levels that provide a frame of reference for perceptions of self-concept. Most notably, it is likely that different standards and frames of reference may be present across different schools within the same country (and perhaps even across different classes within the same school). In particular, it is plausible to expect that students compare their ability in relation to their fellow schoolmates and that their self-concept is influenced by this comparison. This means that they perceive themselves as “good” students in a particular subject area when they have achievement levels that are higher than among their fellow students irrespective of the corresponding general achievement level of their school. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022022111428083">Marsh (1984)</xref> named this the <italic>Big Fish Little Pond Effect</italic> (BFLPE) and provided empirical evidence for this effect at the school level. He demonstrated that students with similar achievement tend to have a higher self-concept in lower than in higher performing schools.</p>
<p>The BFLPE is strongly related to the reference group effect because schools act as reference groups and different schools may hold different standards, norms, or benchmarks. Especially in countries with non-comprehensive educational systems where students are taught in different study programs that are organized in different schools or where the school intake is very selective, differences in standards, norms, and curriculum demands across schools would be expected to be larger. Based on the reference group hypothesis, we expect that in countries with large differences across reference groups (here: schools) there would also be larger negative associations between self-concept and achievement at the school level.</p>
<p>In summary, we do expect a reference group effect not only at the country level but also at the school level that explains the (negative) association between self-concept and achievement. However, we also hypothesize that differences in norms and standards will be larger between countries than between schools within countries. Therefore, we expect that the size of the negative relationship between self-concept and achievement is smaller at the school than at the country level.</p>

<title>Research Hypotheses</title>
<p>The present study uses data from PISA 2006 and has its primary focus on the exploration of how differences in standards and norms between reference groups affect the relationship between self-concept and achievement between countries, and a secondary focus between schools and students. First, consistent with previous findings, we expect to find a positive association of academic self-concept with achievement among students (within schools). Second, we expect that this association will be negative when considered at the level of schools and countries. We hypothesize that differences between countries in reference groups and (curriculum) standards as well as differences in countries’ response styles are responsible for the negative association between national aggregates of self-concept and achievement.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022022111428083">Figure 1</xref> shows the theoretical model for our analysis. Among students (nested within schools nested within countries), the effect of self-concept on achievement is predicted to be positive in all countries. We assume that student achievement in itself is influenced by student background characteristics such as gender, immigrant status, socioeconomic status, and curriculum, which is indirectly measured by variables such as grade attended, learning time in science, and study program. Although we expect that the effect of achievement on self-concept is generally positive for all countries, we predict that there will be considerable differences between countries regarding the size of this effect. PISA tests 15-year-old-students in schools (based on age-based samples), and this means that they may belong to different grades or classes depending on the organization of the countries’ educational system. Furthermore, we hypothesize that in countries where 15-year-old students are taught across different grades, the size of the association between self-concept and achievement will be smaller than in countries where most or all 15-year-old students are in the same grade. The reason for this hypothesis lies in the assumption that a country’s population of 15-year-old students taught in the same grade (and schools) would have similar reference groups within that grade or school that impact the perceptions of their own competence. Conversely, a country’s population of 15-year-old students taught across different grades would have different reference groups, which are expected to result in an attenuation of the effect whenever these different reference groups hold different standards, norms or benchmarks.</p>

<p>Theoretical Model</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0022022111428083-fig1.tif"/></fig>
<p>At the school level, we expect a BFLPE. This means that there would be a negative effect of school mean achievement on self-concept after taking student achievement into account. We assume that school average achievement itself is influenced by school intake and teacher and/or school curriculum standards. We expect that the size of the BFLPE varies across countries and that it will be larger in countries where schools are more selective.</p>
<p>Finally, at the country level we hypothesize that the negative relationship between achievement and self-concept can be explained by differences in educational standards across countries. We expect a positive relationship between countries’ educational standards and their students’ average achievement as well as a negative relationship of both countries’ educational standards and average student achievement with students’ average self-concept. More specifically, we hypothesize that the negative cross-national association between aggregates of student achievement and student self-concept can be accounted for by the negative cross-national relationship between educational standards and students’ average self-concept. In addition, we expect that the negative effect of the country mean achievement on self-concept is larger (indicated by the double negative sign) than that of the school mean achievement because we assume that there are larger differences in educational standards and curriculum between countries than across schools within the same country. As in the example of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022022111428083">Heine et al. (2002)</xref> cited above, where individuals in different countries were asked to judge their own height, we predict that a similar mechanism is at work with regard to students’ self-reports on their competence. A student (A) from a high-performing country (with a high educational standard or norm) may judge his or her own competence as lower than another student (B) in a low-performing country even when Student A has higher achievement scores than Student B on an internationally cognitive test.</p>
<p>An alternative explanation that has been offered to explain the negative between-country relationship is related to national or cultural differences in response styles. We expect that East Asian students would generally have lower levels of self-concept. However, we assume that also for countries from this region there would be a reference group effect on the association between self-concept and achievement in addition to the response style effect.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section5-0022022111428083">
<title>Data</title>
<p>We investigated the relationship between science achievement and science self-concept using PISA 2006 data. The PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) study is conducted by the OECD every 3 years. In 2006, tests and questionnaires were administered to approximately 400,000 students in 57 countries. PISA uses an age-based sample and the 15-year-old students are selected using a two-stage stratified sample design. At the first stage, schools are stratified by relevant variables and sampled proportionally by size. At the second stage, a subsample from all enrolled 15-year-old students is selected within these schools. We refer to The PISA 2006 Technical Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022022111428083">OECD, 2009</xref>), as it contains more detailed information about the sample design for this study.</p>

<title>Student-Level Measures</title>
<sec id="section7-0022022111428083">
<title>Self-concept</title>
<p>Students were asked to indicate to what extent they agreed or disagreed with six statements reflecting science self-concept using a 4-point Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>, 2 = <italic>agree</italic>, 3 = <italic>disagree</italic>, 4 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>). Response scores for these items were reverse coded so that higher scores on the self-concept index represented higher levels of self-concept (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022022111428083">Appendix A</xref> for the items measuring self-concept). For these analyses, we rescaled the international variable self-concept variable by multiplying it by 100.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0022022111428083">
<title>Science achievement</title>
<p>We used the science scores (plausible values) that were measured by a cognitive test reflecting science literacy in PISA 2006. They are standardized to having a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100 for equally weighted OECD countries.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0022022111428083">
<title>Gender</title>
<p>We recoded student gender as 1 for females and 0 for males.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0022022111428083">
<title>Immigrant status</title>
<p>We recoded student immigrant status as 1 for native students and 0 for non-native, including first- and second-immigrant-generation students (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022022111428083">OECD, 2009</xref>, for further details on this index).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0022022111428083">
<title>Socioeconomic status (SES)</title>
<p>We used the international PISA index of economic, social, and cultural status (ESCS). More detailed information on the construction of the PISA index is provided in the PISA 2006 Technical Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022022111428083">OECD, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The following three variables were used as indirect measures of the curriculum demands.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0022022111428083">
<title>Modal grade</title>
<p>In a first step, we calculated the modal grade in each country. Because PISA uses age-based sampling, 15-year-old students can be enrolled in different grades depending on the organization of the educational system (retention policies, differences in starting age at the beginning of primary school) and the time of testing. We first identified in each country the modal grade, meaning the grade attended by the majority of the students. In a second step, we created a dichotomous indicator variable where 1 was assigned to students enrolled above or at the modal grade and 0 to those in any lower grade. This scoring has the advantage that it helps with the interpretation of the aggregated variables at the school and at the country level (i.e., it represents the proportion of students who had a “normal” school career opposed to those who were lagging behind).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0022022111428083">
<title>Study program</title>
<p>Information is available in the PISA database on the ISCED orientation of the study programs attended by students. This variable describes the degree to which the study program is general, pre-vocational, or vocational oriented (for a full definition, we refer to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/7/2/1962350.pdf">http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/7/2/1962350.pdf</ext-link>). General study programs are not explicitly designed to prepare students for a specific class of occupations or trades or for entry into further vocational or technical education programs and less than 25% of their program content is vocational or technical. Pre-vocational programs are primarily designed to prepare students for entry into further vocational or technical education programs. At least 25% of their content has to be either vocational or technical. Successful completion of such programs does not immediately lead to a labor-market-relevant vocational or technical qualification. Vocational programs are primarily designed to prepare students for direct entry into specific occupations without any further training. Successful completion of these programs leads to a labor-market-relevant vocational qualification.</p>
<p>On the basis of the international variable “ISCED orientation,” we created a dummy variable where 1 is assigned to students in general study programs and 0 to those enrolled in pre-vocationally or vocationally oriented study programs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0022022111428083">
<title>Learning time in science</title>
<p>We asked students to indicate how much time they spend per week studying science in regular lessons at school using a scale ranging from 1 for no time, 2 for less than 2 hours a week, 3 for 2 or more but less than 4 hours a week, 4 for 4 or more hours but less than 6 hours a week, to 5 for 6 or more hours a week.</p>

<title>School-Level Measures</title>
<sec id="section16-0022022111428083">
<title>School mean science achievement</title>
<p>We calculated the school mean science achievement by using a school-level aggregate of science literacy. We calculated these aggregate scores using final student weights. The reliability of this aggregated variable was .86.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0022022111428083">
<title>School mean SES</title>
<p>Similarly, we calculated the school mean SES by aggregating the ESCS student scores at the school level using final student weights (aggregated reliability = .86).</p>
<p>The following three school variables are indicators of the school curriculum.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0022022111428083">
<title>School proportion of students in the modal grade</title>
<p>We aggregated the student-level variable “modal grade” at the school level using final student weights (aggregated reliability = .76). Values of 1 indicate that all 15-year-old students at school were enrolled in the modal grade or above and values of 0 that all of these students were in grades below the modal grade.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0022022111428083">
<title>School proportion of students in general-oriented study programs</title>
<p>We aggregated the student-level variable “study program” at the school level using final student weights. Values of 1 indicate that all students at a school were enrolled in general study programs and values of 0 that all of them were in pre-vocational or vocational study programs. The reliability of this aggregated variable was quite low (.42), which indicates that there is considerable variation in the study program orientation within schools compared to between schools.</p>

<title>East Asian countries</title>
<p>We created an indicator variable where 1 was assigned to Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Macao (China), and Taipei (Taiwan) and 0 to all other countries participating in PISA 2006. Because previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022022111428083">Heine et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022022111428083">Heine et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022022111428083">Lie &amp; Turmo, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022022111428083">Peng et al., 1997</xref>) indicated the influence of modesty bias for East Asian countries, we used this dummy variable as a proxy for modesty bias. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0022022111428083">Appendix B</xref>, the table presents the mean, median, and skewness of the self-concept by country. The mean and median of self-concept of the East Asian countries were among the lowest. The skew in the distributions for students from East Asian countries were among the largest and positive, indicating a higher proportion of answers towards the left (lower score) of the scale. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022022111428083">Figure 2</xref> also reveals that within the group of East Asian countries, Japan and Korea were those with very low self-concept scores. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0022022111428083">Appendix B</xref> also shows the proportion of “self-enhancers” and “self-depreciators” by country. Self-enhancers were defined as students that scored at least .15 standard deviations higher on the self-concept scale than on the self-efficacy scale. This means that these students reported that they were very good in science, but when they were asked to indicate to what extent they could solve specific science problems, they rated themselves as less competent (self-concept and self-efficacy were reported on the same standardized metric). On the other hand, self-depreciators were students that reported having low self-concept even though they also indicated they were able to solve specific science problems easily. As expected, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0022022111428083">Appendix B</xref> shows that all East Asian countries (except Macao) have the highest proportions of self-depreciators. This finding generally supports the assumption of a modesty bias as prevalent in these countries.</p>

<title>Analytical Approach</title>
<p>In order to investigate the relationship between self-concept and achievement, we used multilevel regression modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022022111428083">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022022111428083">Snijders &amp; Bosker, 1999</xref>). This technique allowed us to study individual- and group-level effects (across countries and schools) simultaneously. For our multilevel analysis, we assumed a three-level model with students nested within schools and schools nested within countries. All variables were centered on the grand mean and we used the MLwiN Version 2.18 software to estimate the models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022022111428083">Rasbash, Charlton, Browne, Healy, &amp; Cameron, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Although group mean centering also presents a valid way to analyze the data, we preferred grand mean centering for two reasons. First and most important, analyzing the data using grand mean centering answers our research questions in a more direct and appropriate way than group mean centering. Grand mean centering allows us to disentangle the unique effects of science achievement on self-concept at different levels (student, school, country), whereas group mean centering does not. The contribution of each of the effects at the different levels is something that is crucial to this article. Second, analyzing the data using grand mean and group mean centering yields equivalent models when aggregated variables are included in the grand mean centered analyses. The advantage of group mean centering is that it allows you to directly estimate the “pure” group-level effect, but this “pure” group-level effect can be deducted from grand mean centered analyses by adding the relevant beta coefficients of the variable at different levels.</p>
<p>We aggregated student-level (and one school-level) variables at the school and country level by calculating the mean per school and per country, respectively. For binary variables, this results in proportions per school and per country. For these aggregated variables, we included the aggregated reliabilities that were estimated using HLM 6.0.</p>
<p>Fifty-seven countries in total participated in PISA 2006. However, for our analysis, we excluded France, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, and Qatar due to either larger numbers of missing values or insufficient numbers of units at the school level. We also excluded individual students with missing values for the dependent variable self-concept (7.7% missing) and for a number of independent variables that had very few missing values such as gender (<italic>N</italic> missing = 4), study program (<italic>N</italic> missing = 2), and school mean learning time in science (<italic>N</italic> missing = 1). For the other variables with missing values such as immigrant status (1.9 % missing), SES (0.3 % missing), modal grade (0.2% missing), learning time in science (2.5% missing), and proportion of students in modal grade at school (0.2% missing), we applied a dummy variable adjustment method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022022111428083">Cohen &amp; Cohen, 1985</xref>). This method consisted of assigning mean or median values to students or schools with missing data and adding dummy indicator variables (with 1 indicating a missing value and 0 non-missing values) to the analysis. Although it has been shown that this approach may introduce bias due to the underestimation of standard errors of those variables that contain missing values, we assume that this bias is negligible for variables that show low percentages of missing data (less than 5%). We did not, however, impute missing data for the dependent variable science self- concept because the missing rate was higher than 5% and any imputation of means could have underestimated the variances at the different levels to a non-negligible extent. The resulting dataset used in our analysis consisted of 353,403 students from 13,886 schools in 53 countries.</p>

<title>Descriptive Statistics</title>
<p>Before presenting the results of the multilevel analyses, we first describe the zero-order correlations between science self-concept and science achievement at the student, school, and country level using PISA 2006 data. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022022111428083">Table 1</xref> shows the correlations at the student and school level, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022022111428083">Figure 2</xref> displays the correlations at the country level. Although we found large differences between countries, as expected the results show a positive correlation at the student level in all countries except Kyrgyzstan, Indonesia, and Thailand (the median correlation is 0.19). At the school level, we found rather inconsistent results. The median correlation across all countries (0.12) was positive but smaller in size compared to the one found at the level of students. In the majority of the OECD countries, the school-level correlations were positive or close to zero. However, in a small number of non-OECD countries including Kyrgyzstan, Indonesia, and Thailand, we observed a negative correlation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022022111428083">1</xref></sup> At the country level, as expected, we found a large and negative correlation (<italic>r</italic> = −0.74).</p>

<title>Relationship Between Self-Concept and Achievement at the Student Level</title>
<p>In a first step, we estimated a null model or a fully unconditional model that describes the partitioning of the variance in science self-concept between students, schools, and countries. The results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022022111428083">Table 2</xref> show that the largest variation was found between students within schools (84%), that there was only little variation between schools within countries (4%), and that there was more variation between countries (12%) than between schools within countries. In a next step (see student model in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022022111428083">Table 2</xref>), we included the student science achievement, student background variables, and variables that are indirect measures of the curriculum. As expected, science achievement was positively related to self-concept, which suggests that (within schools) higher achieving students tend to have higher levels of self-concept. Within schools, male students, non-native students, students from higher socioeconomic backgrounds, and students with a more demanding curriculum as measured by “learning time in science” showed higher levels of self-concept than others. There was no significant effect of the study program after controlling for the other student variables. Students in higher grades, however, showed a lower self-concept than students in lower grades when controlling for other student variables. This suggests that 15-year-old students with similar achievement and background characteristics judge their own competence as lower when they are already studying in higher grades (which we assume to have a more demanding curriculum for science) compared to those in lower grades. This finding supports the assumption of a BFLPE across different classes and/or grades.</p>

<p>To answer the question of whether the size of the effect of science achievement on self-concept varied across countries, we estimated a random slopes model that allowed the effect of student science achievement to be random at the country level. The results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022022111428083">Table 2</xref> (see final or country model) show that the mean effect across all countries was 0.22 with a variance of 0.02. As expected, the effect of science achievement is positive in most countries, but the size varied significantly. Consistent with our hypothesis, the significant positive interaction between science achievement and country proportion of students in the modal grade (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022022111428083">Table 2</xref>) indicates that the size of the effect is larger in countries where more students are in the same (modal) grade. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022022111428083">Table 3</xref> includes more detailed information on the size of the relationship between student self-concept and the proportion of students in the modal grade achievement within each country. Although most countries showed positive associations between achievement and self-concept within schools, there were a few exceptions. The effect was negative in only two countries (Kyrgyzstan and Indonesia) and very small or close to zero in a number of other countries (Montenegro, Romania, Thailand, and Bulgaria). We believe that these unexpected negative relationships may be due to the age-based (and not grade-based) sampling design for PISA. A closer investigation of the educational systems in these countries and in particular of the distribution of 15-year-old students across grades in these countries was beyond the scope of this study but would be required to better understand these findings.</p>

<title>Relationship Between Self-Concept and Achievement at the School Level</title>
<p>In a next step, we included the school variables in the model (see school model in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022022111428083">Table 2</xref>). As expected, we found significant negative effects for school average science achievement as well as for the school average SES that provide support for the BFLPE hypothesis. The average size of the negative effect of school mean achievement on self-concept across all countries was −0.23 but varied considerably across countries with a variance of 0.01 (see final model or country model in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022022111428083">Table 2</xref>). As expected, effect sizes were larger in countries that had a higher proportion of selective schools as indicated by the significant interaction between school mean achievement and national proportion of selective schools. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022022111428083">Table 3</xref> presents the estimated school mean science achievement effect and the country proportion of selective schools for each country separately.</p>

<title>Relationship Between Self-Concept and Achievement at the Country Level</title>
<p>The finding of a large positive cross-country correlation between the educational index and country mean science achievement (<italic>r</italic> = 0.59) supports our hypothesis that countries with higher educational standards are countries that also scored higher on the PISA test (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022022111428083">Table 3</xref> for more information on the educational index and science achievement per country). Furthermore, the results in the final or country model in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022022111428083">Table 2</xref> confirm our hypothesis that low-achieving countries, countries with a low educational index, and countries outside of the East Asian region show significantly higher mean levels of students’ science self-concept. In addition, the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022022111428083">Table 2</xref> (see final model) show that, in line with our hypothesis, the size of the negative effect of country mean science achievement was larger than that of the school average achievement.</p>
<p>In order to get a better understanding of how much variance between countries is explained either uniquely or in combination by country-level factors, we estimated the joint, common, and unique contribution of each of these variables to the explained variance (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022022111428083">Figure 3</xref>). The results show that adding the six country-level variables to the school model reduced the country-level variance in self-concept by 72% (i.e., joint variance). Around half of the variance (37%) was shared or common explained variation, meaning that it was explained by more than one of the country factors in combination. The largest proportion of variance uniquely attributable to one factor was found for the indicator variable for East Asian countries, which explained 23% of the variation in self-concept between countries. Seven percent of the country variance was uniquely explained by “education index” and 3% by “country mean science achievement.” The proportions of variance explained uniquely by “country mean SES” and “country proportion of students in the modal grade” were negligible. The very small unique contribution of “country mean science achievement” to the explained country-level variance in self-concept indicates that most of the variance explained by this variable was included in the proportion of “common variance” with other country-level predictors like the “education index” and “East Asia.” The fact that the educational index as well as the indicator of East Asian countries explain between-country variance in self-concept that were uniquely attributable to these factors indicates that both country differences in response styles (in East Asia) as well as country differences in standards, norms, and benchmarks played an important role in the explanation of the negative country-level relationship between achievement and self-concept.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of the present study provide insight into why one tends to observe a negative cross-country but a positive within-school/country relationship between self-concept and achievement. We hypothesized that the overarching explanation behind this apparent paradox is the reference group effect. In support of this hypothesis, our findings showed that when comparing self-concept between reference groups such as schools and countries that hold different standards, norms, or benchmarks, having the reference groups with higher standards or expectations leads to a reduction in students’ self-concept and vice versa. When comparing students’ self-concept across reference groups that hold similar standards, norms, or benchmarks (as, for example, students within the same grade/school), having higher standards is associated with higher levels of reported self-concept.</p>
<p>Reference groups are used as a frame of reference to which individuals refer when evaluating their own achievement. They provide the benchmarks, standards, or norms for comparison and evaluation of personal characteristics such as self-concept. In an educational context, reference groups can consist of classes or grades, schools, and countries. Students tend to evaluate their own achievement as high when they achieve higher than most of the other students in the reference group. In other words, within the same reference group in which we assume that students use the same benchmark, standard, or norm, students’ self-concept will be positively related to their achievement. However, direct comparisons of students’ self-concept become “problematic” when the students involved use different reference groups with different benchmarks, norms, and standards. This latter situation (i.e., use of different reference groups) occurs at the school level (more so in countries with tracked school systems and/or selective school intake) as well as the country level where, by definition, students have reference groups that differ not only in terms of curriculum standards, benchmarks, and norms but also in terms of culture and social values. Students in Country A who have a lower average performance than students in Country B on the PISA test may judge their own performance higher (hence have a higher self-concept) when they compare their own individual performance to a lower educational benchmark, norm, or standard in Country A than in Country B. In general, higher performing countries would tend to also have higher educational benchmarks, standards, and norms. This statement seems empirically supported in our study by the large positive correlation between educational index and science achievement. In addition, the relatively large explained variance jointly by the country mean achievement and the educational index compared to the small variance explained uniquely by the country mean achievement also supports this hypothesis. Therefore, we find a negative cross-country correlation between achievement and self-concept.</p>
<p>The Big Fish Little Pond effect is a phenomenon that occurs at the school level and is related to the reference group effect. Our findings of a negative school mean achievement effect on self-concept after controlling for student achievement provide evidence for this effect. Negative effects were found consistently at the school level across all countries. The explanation of this phenomenon includes social comparison processes where students use different reference groups (i.e., classes or schools) to evaluate their own competence. Students with similar achievement on the PISA test will judge their competence as higher in lower achieving than in higher achieving schools because of their more favorable relative position in the lower achieving school. Moreover, we found evidence for the hypothesis that larger differences between schools or reference groups lead to larger effect sizes of the BFLPE. Although the current research as well as previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022022111428083">Marsh &amp; Hau, 2003</xref>) demonstrated that the negative school mean effect is larger in selective educational systems, other factors such as the competitiveness of the educational system may also play a role. Analyzing the competiveness of education systems, which has the potential of enhancing the use of social comparison processes (and thus increasing the BFLPE), could provide an interesting future line of research. It is reasonable to expect that in more competitive educational systems higher proportions of students would be aware of their relative standing in their class or school, and that in these systems there would be larger negative school mean effect (or BFLPE).</p>
<p>The BFLPE is related to the negative cross-national relationship between achievement and self-concept because both effects result from comparing different reference groups that may hold different standards and norms. However, both effects can be explained by somewhat different processes.</p>
<p>At the school level, the results suggest that next to social comparison processes, other cognitive processes play a role in the judgment of one’s own competence. Indeed, if students judged their competence only based on relative standards using social comparison processes, then we would expect that the mean value of the self-concept variable would be zero across all the schools within a country (as well as all the country means would be zero), leading to a zero correlation between self-concept and achievement at the school and country level. Our results show clearly that this is not the case.</p>
<p>At the school level, the BFLPE is the result of three distinct—although interrelated—cognitive processes. First, students would tend to have a high self-concept if they received good marks from their science teacher and would have a rather low self-concept if they received poor teacher marks (comparison against teacher’s “absolute” requirements or standards). Second, students would tend to have a higher self-concept if they received better marks than their classmates and would have a lower self-concept if they received lower marks than their peers (social comparison against reference group). As a consequence, if the mark students received from their teacher was relatively low but still better than the average mark of their classmates, they would probably have a relatively positive view of their own abilities, something that would not be the case if they were the only students in the whole class who received poor marks. Third, students’ judgment would be partially moderated if they had some information about the fact that their teacher’s expectations regarding their achievement are not “absolute” but rather “relative.” Teacher expectations and curriculum demands may differ between schools within a country, in particular in educational systems with different study programs. Therefore, the value of the marks students received from their teachers could be relative (for example, to the particular study program), and students might be fully or partially aware of this. In other words, if students know, for example, that the requirements for science courses are higher (or lower) in their respective study program than in other programs, or that their particular school has higher requirements than other schools, then their self-concept will also tend to be higher.</p>
<p>The results of our analyses provide evidence for this moderation effect. The fact that in most OECD countries a positive zero-order between-schools correlation was found (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022022111428083">Table 1</xref>) suggests that to some extent students within the same country are aware of the differences between schools or programs and take this information into account when judging their own competence.</p>
<p>At the country level, the negative relationship between achievement and self-concept does not result from social comparison processes. Indeed, it is hard to imagine that students from different countries compare themselves with each other. The fact that people evaluate themselves with those around them means that, for instance, Japanese students compare themselves with other Japanese students when evaluating their own competence, whereas Belgians tend to evaluate themselves with other Belgians. Thus, the negative correlation at the country level is not a result of social comparison processes but of a comparison of judgments that are made against different (national) standards. Students with the same PISA achievement score will judge their competence higher in countries with lower teacher standards and curriculum requirements than students in countries with higher standards. In addition, the East Asian countries that were among the highest performing countries in PISA showed lower levels of self-concepts even after controlling for proxies of educational standards. This means that the negative cross-country correlation was not only the result of different standards used in different countries but also a result of cultural differences in response style, the well-known East Asian modesty bias.</p>
<p>The findings of our study have serious implications for the validity of cross-cultural comparison of self-evaluation constructs such as self-concept. In fact, we should be cautious comparing self-concept across countries or cultures when countries or cultures differ in educational standards, benchmarks, and norms. This does not necessarily mean that we cannot compare self-evaluation constructs between cultures at all, but we might need to look for other ways of measuring such constructs. Based on the findings of the current study, it seems crucial to use a measurement of self-concept that is not influenced by social comparison processes and/or a measurement where we make explicit the norm or standard, thus assuring that the norm is the same across countries. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022022111428083">King, Murray, Salomon, and Tandon (2004)</xref> suggested using so-called vignettes. Respondents are asked for self-assessment and assessment of several hypothetical persons described by written vignettes. These vignettes function as a common standard or anchor and are used to recode the self-assessment relative to the set of vignettes. Another possible solution is to include the norm or standard within the question. In PISA, the items belonging to the self-efficacy construct are an example of items that reflect self-evaluations, but they include a very clear reference to a particular task for which students evaluate their ability (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022022111428083">Appendix A</xref>). Interestingly, the cross-country correlation between self-efficacy and achievement in PISA 2006 was positive. This finding supports our initial hypothesis that using the same norm or standard to which students need to evaluate themselves presents a possible solution to the paradox. What seems crucial is whether the wording of the items elicits social comparison with regard to a reference group or standard that has not been made explicit. Previous research done by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022022111428083">Marsh, Trautwein, Lüdtke, and Köller (2008)</xref>, indeed, showed that the BFLPE is very specific to academic self-concept and has not been found for self-esteem, self-efficacy, and other non-academic aspects of self-concept measures because the wording of the items of the latter constructs does not elicit social comparisons. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022022111428083">Dai and Rinn (2008)</xref> distinguish between “enactive” aspects of the self (“I want to <italic>do</italic> it” or “I can <italic>do</italic> it”) and “reflective” aspects of the self (“What does this say about me?”). Measures of enactive aspects of the self are situation or task specific and are often measured before achievement such as self-efficacy and self-expectancy, whereas measures of reflective aspects of the “self” reflect more enduring evaluations of the self when measured after achievement. We expect that the BFLPE and the reference group effect will mainly be evident in measures of reflective aspects of the self. However, more research is needed to test this hypothesis.</p>
<p>On a more general note, the findings of the present study have implications for any type of research using self-reports that is looking to compare different groups (with different standards), especially if those self-reports entail self-evaluations. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022022111428083">Credé, Bashshur, and Niehorster (2010)</xref> demonstrated the impact of reference groups on self-reports on personality scales and on job attitudes. This implies that organizations that ask job applicants to describe themselves along a variety of dimensions such as personality should be aware of the effects of reference groups and may have to question the validity of such scores (e.g., predictive validity for job performance). Furthermore, our findings imply that we need to rethink the way we assess a variety of constructs based on self-reports in a cross-cultural context.</p>
<p>Another important finding of the current study is that the reference group effect plays an important role in understanding the cross-country negative relationship between achievement and self-concept, additional to the role of country differences in response styles. East Asian countries that are among the countries with the highest educational standards and the highest achieving countries in PISA still show lower levels of self-concept after taking into account educational standards, and achievement indicates that the effect of response bias cannot be ignored. The tendency to score around the midpoint of the Likert-type scale on items tapping positive emotions among East Asians has been well documented in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022022111428083">Heine, Lehman, Markus, &amp; Kitayama, 1999</xref>). This implies that not only the self-concept construct but any construct that reflects positive emotions may be susceptible to response bias and may give rise to cross-country negative relationships. The present study only investigated to what extent modesty bias contributed to country differences in self-concept. More research is needed to assess the effects of different types of response bias, such as modesty bias, extreme response style, and acquiescence, on the validity of cross-cultural comparisons of non-cognitive constructs.</p>
