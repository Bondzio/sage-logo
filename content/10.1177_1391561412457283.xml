<p>This book firstly discusses the role of SEZs in the global context and then their evolution in India. It finally discusses the economic and social impact of SEZs on India. It is divided into 11 chapters. The first chapter introduces the topic and in subsequent chapters it deals firstly with the historical perspectives of SEZs and then the global perspective. The fourth chapter deals with the evolution of SEZ policy in India and then sets the theoretical perspective of their impact in Chapter 5 followed by the experiences of China, Taiwan and South Korea. In Chapters 7 and 8, it carries out quantitative and qualitative assessment of the economic impact of SEZs, respectively. It discusses the human development impacts on the basis of empirical evidence and then analyzes the emerging social issues in Chapters 9 and 10. Finally, on the basis of these findings it discusses opportunities and challenges associated with it and makes policy suggestions.</p>
<p>SEZs have been considered to be engines of growth by most of the economies in the world and therefore attracted the policy-makers’ attention as they account not only for the increasing share of the international trade but also creation of employment opportunities. In India, the SEZ Act was introduced in 2005 with the objectives of making them engines of growth which would enhance India’s share in world trade. It was also believed that it will create lots of employment opportunities. In recent past it has created lots of attention, debate and criticism, especially against the government. In this backdrop, this book examines a pragmatic framework for assessing the contribution of SEZs, evaluates the actual and potential economic and social costs and then evaluates the losses/benefits to India. It has used the primary as well as secondary data for making assessment. The assessment, however, is based on the survey dating to 2009. There has been a decline in setting up of SEZs since 2008 and therefore, some of the recommendations may only reflect the situation prevalent at that time. The effect of global economic recession and whether SEZs in India were useful in the process of recovery in exports, thus cannot be gauzed.</p>
<p>The book (Chapter 3) examines how SEZs have evolved in 23 developing countries, and it finds that the general belief that the role of SEZs diminishes after a country liberalizes its economy does not hold true in these case studies. Rather it finds that the numbers and varieties have proliferated. In Chapter 4, the origin and evolution of SEZs in India have been discussed. It observes that there are three distinct phases in evolution of SEZs in India—EPZ (1965–2000), transition phase (2000–2005) and the SEZ regime (post-2005, after enactment of SEZ Act). It also finds that at the initial stage the response of private sector on SEZ was lukewarm and that the changes were not as revolutionary as were perceived. It points that the packages offered were not sufficiently attractive to divert international investments to SEZs. It points out that restrictions on size, and infrastructure of SEZs, absence of single-window clearance, exit policy, land acquisition policy and grievance redressal mechanism were serious handicaps. In the view of the author—accountability, effective partnership and community responsiveness—the three basic principles of administration were missing.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 analyzes the theoretical foundations of SEZs, namely, the Neoclassical; Neo Marxist; Heterodox; Life cycle; and newer international division of labour perspective and their notion that SEZ policy is alternative strategy for development and is a second best solution to either total liberalization or overall improvement in investment climate. It finds that the SEZs are not an alternative strategy nor the ‘second best’ but need to be viewed as a component to broader strategy for cluster development. These theories are tested in Chapter 6, where case studies of China, Korea and Taiwan have been done. It infers that the SEZs made significant contribution to upgrading and diversifying the economies of all the three economies studied. It also observes that the most successful effect was seen in case of China which is due to the cluster-based industrial promotion.</p>
<p>Chapters 7 to 11 are based on studies on India. In these chapters, issues relating to assessment of EPZs and SEZs and their economic benefits have been dealt. Quantification of benefits in terms of employment, exports and investments have been calculated. Performance of SEZs by taking into account the international, national or macro, regional or meso and zonal or micro factors have been evaluated. It finds that and that they have affected industrial activity outside the zones as well and that the SEZ policy has been successful in giving a major push to FDI inflows and employment at aggregate level. The study reveals that they have acted as a catalyst in the process of industrial diversification in India and that the India model is based on the Chinese model. The study also highlights from the Indian experience that the role of state governments is equally important in determining the success of SEZs, while finding that the diverse and conflicting group interests are detrimental to the SEZs’ success.</p>
<p>The book has studied the impact of SEZs on human development, a topic which has though attracted lots of attention but not much academic work has been done. Highlighting the 47 central labour laws and 200 state labour laws and pointing their rigidity as major impediment to the SEZs success, it recommends for labour market reforms and flexibility. Citing the withdrawal of some flexibility in labour laws which were initially proposed in the SEZ Act, it also points that states like Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, even though the front runners in SEZs, have not given the powers of labour commissioners to the Development Commissioners of SEZs. It therefore argues for bringing in voluntary codes with public regulation. It also highlights the need for training of industrial workers as most of them are ill equipped and come from agriculture background. It has also found that the pressure of giving employment to at least one member of a displaced family has been instrumental in offering employment to those unskilled workers who were earlier engaged in agriculture. It points that some of the SEZs have made arrangements in this regard. Looking at the social obligation, it also suggests that the government must encourage the concept of dormitories for labour and their families and also that substantial targeted investment in vocational training in the short term, as a part of longer-term strategy for developing human capital.</p>
<p>The most contentious issue of SEZs in India, that is, land acquisition has been dealt in Chapter 10. The chapter covers issues relating to real estate development, environment and urbanization. Dealing with the issues like the right to acquire land—state government or SEZ developer, roles played by them, civil society, it also compares with the systems of Australia, Canada, UK and United States. In case of India, it has also discussed some voluntary initiatives taken by certain private companies to draw certain lessons. It has observed that most of the state governments, with the exception of Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh, have adopted a lukewarm approach towards SEZs for fear of unpopularity and its electoral implications. The study suggests for a comprehensive strategy to be designed to reap the overall benefit. Noting the negative impacts of social pressures, it suggests for turning them to channel in the positive direction for inclusive growth.</p>
<p>The issue of SEZ in India in recent past has become a major issue of debate, mostly on account of social impact, especially the land acquisition, labour rights and the environment, even though there is a recognition that it has also led to economic benefits. In this regard, this book is timely, as it not only touches these issues but also identifies policy challenges associated with them and lastly suggests possible interventions for a liberal and supportive environment. The importance of the study findings comes from the theoretical assumptions which are then passed through the test of case studies and interviews. It truly observes that initial success of SEZs in India does not ensure sustained performance and lots of things need to be changed. In this regard, it points out rightly that the first change needs to come from the government, especially the state governments which hold the key to success of SEZs, especially in resolving the conflicting situation.</p>
<p>The book is important for the policy-makers, academia and also the civil society organizations, as this is a first attempt where most of the issues reading to SEZs have been addressed. The book tries to bring some balance between opposing views/forces and thus, recommends them to be channelled positively by the government, although a herculean task. It is also useful for private sector, as it compiles the policy and procedure of other countries and also shares success and failure stories of SEZs in India. It is important for them to understand what went wrong in order to be right.</p>
<p>The language is simple and easy to understand.</p>
