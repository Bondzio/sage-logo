<abstract>
<p>Both environmental social movements and academic thinkers appear to move away from fundamental critique of dominant values in the direction of a more pragmatic approach to environmental politics. This article highlights some of the disadvantages of this development, using environmental concerns to illustrate the broader argument that decent societies aiming for social and environmental justice are best served by the existence of an informed, fundamental type of opposition next to cooperative, loyal modes of dissent. For academics in their inescapable role as fundamental critics, this would imply a relatively distant role as guardians of the critical potential of civil society.</p>

<title>1 Critique and guardianship</title>
<p>Social and political critique may originate in experience or experiment, but they always relate and refer to a practice in a theoretical context. Sometimes the context is, by and large, taken for granted and critique merely serves to improve a practice; here, critique is, to use a Weberian term, goal-rational. This does not imply that the goals of or convictions behind a practice are shared; they simply are not on the agenda. In other cases, the context of a practice is itself questioned – what can be called value-rational critique or reflective rationality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0191453713491233">Beck, 1997</xref>). Here, in turn, the efficiency and effectiveness of a particular practice are neither implied nor denied; they are simply not topical.</p>
<p>At the risk of implying a value judgment, one could call the former type of critique <italic>practical</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0191453713491233">1</xref></sup> and the latter <italic>fundamental</italic>. The distinction is less clear-cut in practice than it may appear to be on paper, since it is not always obvious which practice is criticized, <italic>really</italic>. For instance, in its critique of the globalization of capitalism and western materialist consumer culture, the alter- or anti-globalist movement frequently uses environmentalist arguments (cf. e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0191453713491233">Wall, 2005</xref>). It points, for instance, to the destruction of the rainforest as the destruction of valuable alternative ways of life and ways of ‘being in the world’, ways of relating to individuality, humanity and nature; it also points to the short–sightedness of use of those natural resources to satisfy immediate desires rather than long-term needs, including effects on the global climate; and it points to the exploitation of the rainforest as an illustration of the limitations of the market model – in a classic ‘Tragedy of the Commons’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0191453713491233">Hardin, 1968</xref>), individually rational behavior leads to collectively irrational results. If alter-globalism is construed as a critique of capitalism, then it offers <italic>fundamental</italic> critique: it questions whether the goods that capitalism delivers are worth buying. If, however, alter-globalism is seen from the perspective of ecologism, the green critique of modernity, then it offers relatively <italic>practical </italic>critique, i.e. little more than a list of suggestions for a more efficient and effective use of natural resources in the pursuit of human desires, and not, as ecologists would want, a critique of humanity’s cannibalistic appreciation of Mother Nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0191453713491233">Wissenburg, 2004b</xref>).</p>
<p>Adding a further and admittedly exaggerated dichotomy, critique may originate in the world of practice or in that of fundamentals, i.e. in society, the ‘real’ world of practitioners and activists, or in academia, the ‘ivory tower’ of cogitation and reflection (cf. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0191453713491233">Table 1</xref>). Obviously, the relationship between society and academy is characterized by structural stress. On the one hand, the academy flourishes only in an atmosphere of freedom of thought and maximum liberty from outside interference. It is by its very nature a den of fundamental critique. On the other hand, society funds the academy and as an institution begotten out of private interests and founded on distrust, it (i.e. society) expects something back for its money. Both the providers of so-called private funding (mostly companies) and those of public funding (changing political majorities) expect accountability, including a comprehensible explanation of the goals of research and of its relevance, either social or commercial. On this other hand then, on the side of the hand that feeds, the academy’s <italic>raison d’être</italic> is in constant jeopardy. It is not my intention here to question this constellation or its increasingly destructive effects on ‘the Arts and Sciences’. What I want to offer in this article is, instead, a practical critique of the agenda of academic research, as illustrated by ‘green’, a.k.a. environmental, political thought. As I will explain in a moment, the choice for environmental thought is almost perfectly random – it is not the case that matters but the general processes at work there.</p>

<p>A mere critique of the fashions and vogues in <italic>forms</italic> of academic critique would hardly be new or surprising. The relative importance of applied versus fundamental research for the advancement of knowledge is an everyday topic of internal academic debate, and the pros and cons of academia as a social critic and political activist have been discussed ad nauseam since the 1960s. Rather than flogging any of these dead horses, I want to draw attention to a role that has mostly been overlooked: academia not as an active critic but as the impartial guardian and promoter of social critique, providing all sides and parties with the material that fundamental political critique is made of.</p>
<p>Over the past three decades, political thought has become appeased: less radical and revolutionary, and more and more reformist, even in some respects rabidly defensive, e.g. when confronting (Islamic) terrorism. Talk of progress and the good society, of times after the revolution and the overthrow of the evil imperialist powers, has been replaced by talk of justice, local and global – the remedial virtue par excellence. As Cass Sunstein observed: ‘In recent decades and more, the emphasis has been on the need for consensus. To take the most prominent example, John Rawls stressed the value of an “overlapping consensus” among citizens who disagree on the most fundamental issues’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0191453713491233">Sunstein, 2003</xref>: 8).</p>
<p>Green political thought, which set out as a full frontal attack on mainstream political thought, is apparently no exception in this process of appeasement. Green thought, it has been said, is turning ‘practical’ (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0191453713491233">Barry and Wissenburg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0191453713491233">Dobson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0191453713491233">Shellenberger and Nordhaus, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0191453713491233">Wissenburg and Levy, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0191453713491233">Baxter, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0191453713491233">Blühdorn and Welsh, 2007</xref>; and perhaps also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0191453713491233">Schlosberg and Bomberg, 2008</xref>). It set out as a full frontal attack on mainstream political thought, supporting a perception of nature not as the (human) environment made up of resources but as a symbiotic ecosystem with value independent of human whims, supporting a self-understanding of humanity not as materialistic maximizers but as cultured, even spiritual beings aiming for sufficiency, and supporting a matching political (world) order of independent, self-supporting groups practising direct democracy and solidarity. The green academic’s attention has now shifted from conceptual and theoretical elaboration to the application of ideas and normative concepts to practical issues, and away from the use of radical concepts like nature’s intrinsic value to far more moderate (anthropocentric) concepts like environment and sustainability.</p>
<p>This may be a question of demand rather than supply: a decreasing proportion of ‘purely’ theoretical and philosophical books and articles on environmental issues (if such a decrease can be observed) can also be explained by a demise of interest on the side of the public or publishers, just as much as by loss of interest among the publishing theorists. The numbers and percentages of ‘clearly’ abstract, conceptual articles in the most influential journals <italic>Environmental Ethics</italic> and <italic>Environmental Values</italic> show no decrease over the years of their existence, but the ‘practical’ articles are ever more clearly applied or case studies. There seems to be trace evidence, then, of green political thought trying to connect more to ‘real world’ and ‘mainstream’ interests and preoccupations – say, from Leibniz (a topic in <italic>Environmental Ethics</italic> in 1980) to flood control (<italic>Environmental Values</italic>, 2005), and from developing ‘genetically pure’ green theory to shopping for mix-and-match products in mainstream political and ethical thought. In that sense, critical reflection on the legitimization of practices does seem to have been replaced by a more practical attitude. Like most empirical claims, though, this one requires further investigation.</p>
<p>Green thought may be becoming more practical, or interest in fundamental critique may be waning – either way, what <italic>remains</italic> and what is <italic>read</italic> is more ‘practical’ than ‘fundamental’. This development may be seen as a response to developments in practice, in particular to green <italic>activists</italic> also becoming more practical or appeased: by participation in politics and policy-making in and through NGOs and INGOs, by having themselves recognized as legitimate stakeholders by economic actors who in turn profess belief in corporate social responsibility, and so on.</p>
<p>The present article tries, first and foremost, to highlight some of the social disadvantages of academia’s ‘turning to the practical’, as illustrated by the case of green political thought, against the background of a concurrent (though not necessarily identical) ‘turn to the practical’ among social movements, here illustrated by environmental campaigners. Similar cases can be made, for example, in feminism and gender studies (e.g. moving from radical alternatives to gendered society towards ‘gender mainstreaming’), North–South relations (from anti-imperialist revolution to fair trade and PPP: People, Planet, Profit), race or multicultural studies (from rethinking explanatory and prescriptive Marxist categories to mainstream toleration and cultural cross-fertilization), and so on. Even academic research agendas associated with the political right (whereas most ‘critical’ academic studies seem to inspire and be inspired by ‘the left’), such as neo-liberal political economy, seem to have become ‘softer’ and more accommodating. The choice to discuss environmental politics is, in that perspective, a purely random decision. Thus, although I use an illustration to present my argument, its scope is wider: it is an argument about the inimitable functions of fundamental social and academic critique per se. The argument’s scope is also wider in that it addresses social critique in a broader context than western liberal democracies only. In the next section, I shall define its context as that of decent societies – a term that will be elucidated there as well.</p>
<p>Subsequently, I look at the many roles critique can play in such societies. I distinguish a minimum of 10 such roles, some more suited to fundamental critique, others more suited to practical critique. I try to show here that fundamental critique and practical critique also tend to be reflected in two concepts of politics and society, one appeasing, seeking consensus and harmony, the other highlighting irreducible fundamental conflict. Briefly, I argue that the production of fundamental critique is a necessary condition for the viability of decent societies, regardless of whether there is a perceptible demand for that product.</p>
<p>After discussing how the agendas and approach of environmental groups highlight a move from fundamental to practical critique, indicating that environmental activism contributes less and less to the required fundamental critique of society, I add a positive argument for academia as an alternative source of fundamental critique. Yet, and this is part two of my argument for the inimitable nature of fundamental critique, because academic critique, where it can and must be fundamental, must at the same time remain fundamentally impartial, it is necessarily incapable of fulfilling <italic>all</italic> the necessary roles required of fundamental critique. In other words: by producing fundamental critique, academia can serve as the guardian of the critical potential of civil society, but it cannot fully replace fundamental social critique. Experts cannot replace experience.</p>

<title>2 The decent society and critique</title>
<p>This text investigates the role of ‘critical’ academic thought and social movements (as it happens, green versions of either one) in a slightly broader context than that of democracies alone. The argument presented here applies to all (what I shall call) ‘decent societies’ rather than western-type liberal democratic regimes only, and although its focus is on the role of academics and movements and their contribution to making decent societies environmentally sustainable, much of it will apply, <italic>mutatis mutandis</italic>, to other critical movements and other politically desirable goals as well.</p>
<p>Let me begin by explaining two crucial terms here, ‘decent society’ and ‘critique’. The term ‘decent society’ already has two established meanings: Margalit’s, which is rather vague, and Rawls’, which is rather idiosyncratic. Avishai Margalit, in his popular <italic>The Decent Society</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0191453713491233">1998</xref>), understands a decent society as one respecting basic human rights, not accidentally or merely formally but as part of the society’s culture – leaving crucial concepts like human rights, social culture and, indeed, decency itself ill-defined. John Rawls, in particular in his <italic>The Law of Peoples</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0191453713491233">1999</xref>), made a distinction between just and ‘merely’ decent hierarchical peoples – for practical purposes, let us equate peoples with societies. Just societies conform to the view of justice as fairness, in particular by having society’s basic institutions conform to Rawls’ renowned two principles of justice. A decent society is one that respects the greater part of the two principles, except that it does not offer equal access of all members to the centers of political power and political decision-making. Decent societies are, then, ruled by a special type of enlightened despot or an enlightened elite. An example would be a caste society where all positions of power are reserved for one caste or a few castes, and membership of a caste is determined by birth and descent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0191453713491233">2</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In the context of this article, I shall use the term ‘decent society’ to refer to any stable and institutionalized form of potentially self-sustaining social cooperation that aims to create social justice within its borders and abroad by just means. Although it addresses (I believe) the shared basic intuitions behind both, my definition deviates in at least three evident respects from Margalit’s and Rawls’. First, it aims for justice, not Rawlsian justice specifically. Second, it <italic>aims</italic> to ensure social justice rather than that it already <italic>respects</italic> the possibly only partially overlapping category of <italic>human rights</italic>. Finally, other than the classic ‘society’, it does not evoke instinctive associations with communitarian notions of culture, people, or tribe, nor with the classic concept of the sovereign nation-state of yore. It is a concept of today – also happily appropriate to the environment in which environmental movements operate.</p>
<p>Although the precise criteria for or measures of justice are left open by this definition, I shall assume that justice requires at least two things. First and foremost, it <italic>does</italic> require (as that which is aimed at rather than that which is already realized) equal access of all members to the centers of political power and political decision-making. Whether equal access means an exact same power of decision-making for each individual, or influence proportional to the interests and intensity of preferences of those affected in any particular instance of decision-making or rule-application, or anything in between, will be left undecided – the point is that, overall, no justice of any kind is possible in any field if subjects of justice are completely excluded from the formulation of the rules applied to them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0191453713491233">3</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In addition, a decent society, a society aiming for social justice, by definition also aims for environmental justice. Environmental justice must be clearly distinguished from ecological justice. The former relates to the fair distribution of environmental resources among humans, the latter relates to what humans owe non-humans (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0191453713491233">Baxter, 2005</xref>: 7). Whether or not other animals, let alone other entities, have what it takes to qualify as subjects not objects of justice is wide open to debate and will have to remain so, as it involves the kind of fundamental critique that is the object of this text.</p>
<p>Such considerations aside, social justice does, necessarily, imply environmental justice – it is certainly not the whole of social justice (because the latter also includes artifacts as well as social structures and institutions and psychological goods like honor and self-esteem) but it is part of it. Without <italic>continued</italic> fair access to and fair distribution and exchange of resources for all those deserving, social justice would be a one-shot game, a race to consume nature as efficiently as possible within the course of our lifetimes but without adding new lives. With the exception of a world peopled by the last humans ever to exist, the phrase ‘sustainable decent society’ is as pleonastic as ‘featherless bipedal humans’.</p>
<p>The decent society, briefly summarized, aims for equal access to the places of power and for environmental justice. It cannot do this without critique, and this brings us to another relevant concept: democracy. Some but not all decent societies give some but not complete room to democracy – culture and custom limit the realm of democracy to issues that are considered neither too unimportant to vote on, nor too important to be decided by whim, nor finally too arcane to be sufficiently well understood by and trusted to all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0191453713491233">Shapiro, 2002</xref>). Critique, on the other hand, is by definition present in any decent society, both within and, more importantly, outside the public forums of democracy.</p>
<p>A distinction was already made briefly above between two types of critique, one relatively innocent and therefore dangerous (practical), the other relatively dangerous and therefore innocent (fundamental). The two types reflect Max Weber’s distinction between goal-rationality (innocent therefore dangerous) and value-rationality (dangerous therefore innocent). Goal-rational critique surfaces when authorities (for instance – or pressure groups, or opinion pollsters, or grassroots organizations) gather information on existing preferences, aiming to formulate either a consensus on a policy goal, or a consensus on the legitimacy of the policy itself even if its goal is not unanimously appreciated. Value-rational critique on the other hand focuses on arguments rather than supporting numbers and weights of votes, questioning reasons rather than respecting opinions as sacred.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0191453713491233">4</xref></sup> It is value-rational critique that results in issues being <italic>put</italic> on political agendas and policy options being formulated, rather than that they are simply dealt with, respectively chosen, <italic>once</italic> they are on, and it is value-rational critique alone that can ensure that issues that are too important to be solved by only counting heads are identified.</p>
<p>Critique is always aimed at and relative to a human practice or idea, not a fact; we cannot reasonably dispute facts – they simply <italic>are</italic> – but we can criticize their creation, what we think of them and what we do with them. In a broader sense, critique implies testing an idea or practice rather than subjecting to it; in a more limited sense it can be a practice in its own right – one can make disagreeing a matter of principle or a mode of life. Note that on a Popperian view of scientific knowledge, the two necessarily coincide: one cannot test X without assuming, if necessary against one’s own intuition, that something is awry with X. The critic’s aims may differ, from hard-headed pubescent obstinacy via dispassionate intellectual interest to paranoid self-protection. The effect of critique on that-which-is-critiqued is, however, always the same: critique is what <italic>voluntarily</italic> changes it, sustains and maintains it, or freezes it, before external conditions <italic>involuntarily</italic> do. Without critique, humans cannot act, only react.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0191453713491233">
<title>3 Two concepts of politics</title>
<p>The effects of critique can be identified slightly more specifically when we consider a particular practice or set of practices like society. It further helps to distinguish – the reference to Berlin will be evident – two concepts of politics, and relate these to the notions of fundamental and practical critique.</p>
<p>In political science, the most popular definitions of politics are Laswell’s, who described it as ‘who gets what, when, how’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0191453713491233">Laswell, 1936</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0191453713491233">Laswell, 1948</xref>: 7), and his student Easton’s, who spoke of ‘the authoritative allocation of values’. Definitions are, like models, simplified representations of the real world – which makes them quite useful but also necessarily flawed. Laswell and Easton’s definitions, for instance, presume too much, in particular the prior existence of a ‘society’ and of authority; the phase of reflection on the need for and form of social cooperation as in, for example, classic contract theories, which precedes the formation of state or society, is thereby excluded from ‘politics’, as is any form of decision-making for a ‘bunch of folks’ (to use George W. Bush’ definition of groups of individuals) in circumstances where words like ‘tribe’, ‘community’, or ‘planet’ would be more appropriate than ‘society’. There is also, at least in Easton’s case, a risk of circularity: if authority depends for just the least bit on performance, i.e. on results, it cannot really precede decision-making; so that no decision on who gets what can be called truly authoritative or political except in hindsight.</p>
<p>More important is the fact that Laswell and Easton conflate two more or less distinct human practices. One of these is perhaps better described as ‘government’, ‘governance’, or ‘policy-making’, and relates to decision-making on <italic>how</italic>, rather than whether, a ‘bunch of folks’ is to get whatever it gets. If we reflect for a moment on the nature of arguments for human cooperation, we may come to realize that they seem to presume exactly this conception of politics as government. All are geared towards finding common ground somehow and somewhere, whether in absolute ethical principles, or in an overlapping consensus, a policy <italic>telos</italic>, a popular conviction, or enlightened self-interest. For political philosophers in these traditions, the fundamental question of politics seems to be how to justify cooperation, and once this question is answered all that remains are technically rather than normatively controversial issues of procedures and structures.</p>
<p>In terms of Albert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0191453713491233">Hirschman’s (1970)</xref> three possible replies to any kind of problem in any type of cooperative venture, the principal role of critique in politics interpreted as governance is to express <italic>loyalty</italic> – hence practical critique is functional while fundamental critique ‘does not compute’. Critique contains information that contributes to the creation of consensus and the smooth operation of institutions. Critique carries <italic>discrete</italic> information on possibly ignored or (qua intensity) underrated preferences, and <italic>structural</italic> information on the adequacy of the political structure as mediating preferences and interests to produce consensus and legitimacy. In this respect, critique protects us against group-think and against consensus based on insufficient evidence: ‘[M]ost human beings, including many apparent rebels, are strongly influenced by the views and actions of others. Unchecked by dissent, conformity can produce disturbing, harmful, and sometimes astonishing outcomes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0191453713491233">Sunstein, 2003</xref>: 1).</p>
<p>There is, however, a second ‘political practice’, a second tradition in political philosophy addressing a radically different conception of politics. Although Heraklitos of Ephesus (for want of an earlier source) should be credited for its first formulations,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0191453713491233">5</xref></sup> politics understood as a continuation of war by other means has been described most explicitly by authors like Niccolò <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0191453713491233">Machiavelli (1998</xref>), Karl Marx and Carl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0191453713491233">Schmitt (1996</xref>) – three of the most ill-famed political thinkers of all times – though one should add that more honorable men and women like Bernard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0191453713491233">Crick (2000</xref>), Ian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0191453713491233">Shapiro (2002</xref>), Chantal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0191453713491233">Mouffe (1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0191453713491233">2005</xref>) and Pierre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0191453713491233">Rosanvallon (2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0191453713491233">2008</xref>) are part of the same tradition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0191453713491233">6</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>There are circumstances under which no agreement is possible, perhaps for philosophical but certainly for practical reasons. Here, no basis for cooperation, for an agreement on who gets what, when and where (let alone why), exists that is generally or ideally (as in an original position) recognized as legitimate. Yet a decision often needs to be made or implemented, or else it will be done for one (and then usually to the disadvantage of the deciding party). Making a decision under such circumstances necessarily means forcing one’s way upon others, exercising <italic>power</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0191453713491233">7</xref></sup> Even where cooperation is possible, not all those ideally involved in a cooperative venture will agree; from their subjective points of view, making them cooperate is perhaps tolerable but never anything less than coercion. Either way, politics involves a choice between deadlocked incompatibles, a choice by force not argument: it requires cutting a Gordian knot (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0191453713491233">Wissenburg, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>On this view of politics as power-struggle, critique equals Hirschman’s category of <italic>voice</italic>. It expresses protest against rather than support for practices, rules, or institutions, and calls for reform rather than a continuation of things-as-they-are. Here, it is fundamental critique that is appropriate while practical critique ‘does not compute’. Critique now highlights the exclusion of complete issues from the political agenda, the failure of institutions adequately to reflect preferences or adequately to respond to them, or even more fundamental (i.e. since it is directed against co-citizens rather than institutions), the genesis and formulation rather than post-facto expression of preferences. It is this kind of critique that Cass Sunstein finds most productive: ‘[I]n many domains, we do not know whether we have converged on the right answer, and group influences might reduce potentially productive disagreement. The phenomenon of “political correctness” on college campuses – squelching those who reject left-wing orthodoxy – is an important and highly publicized illustration’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0191453713491233">Sunstein, 2003</xref>: 7).</p>
<p>Note that the equivalent of Hirschman’s third category, <italic>exit</italic>, would equal activities like sabotage, terrorism, revolutionary resistance and escapism. Exit-type critique denotes the failure of politics both as governance and as power-struggle. It indicates that the critic does not believe in the desirability or viability of any form of social cooperation or (e.g. if cooperation on some but not all highly valued issues is possible) has no faith in the ability of any other form of critique to create circumstances under which continued cooperation is acceptable (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0191453713491233">Friedman, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>To summarize, the functions of critique seem to include at least the following (with 1–4 referring to loyalty, 5–9 to voice and 10 to exit):</p>

<p>In addition, and on a less instrumental view of social cooperation, one can point to long-term structural advantages (or disadvantages) of critique, like its possible contribution to individual growth, to emancipation and to the health and viability of the public sphere in general. All of these are, as expressions of the equal access criterion, arguably aims of a decent society – but it will be clear that not every type of critique nor any form in which it is expressed will contribute equally (if at all) to those goals.</p>

Let me stress once more that the presence of practical critique does not imply the absence of fundamental critique (or vice versa) – the latter may simply not be on the agenda. Hence, in a society that generally sees itself as sharing a fundamental consensus, fundamental critique will not easily be considered germane, while practical critique will be considered unhelpful and beside the point in a society perceiving itself as characterized by power-struggle.</p>

<p>Both ideal-types of politics, politics as power-struggle and politics as governance, exist in real life, and, as a consequence, so do critique of the exit, the voice and the loyalty types. Since a decent society aims for equal access and social justice, it aims to discourage the kinds of feelings and convictions that give rise to exit critique, which is impossible if it promotes only loyalty critique. Without adequate instruments to determine whether the topics on the political agenda reflect all citizens’ interests and aspirations and whether institutions guarantee not just their expression but also their being investigated, reflected on and responded to – in other words, without room for voice critique – exclusion of all but the most sheepish citizens results. In still other words, fundamental critique, the constant actual testing of the moral foundations of society, is a necessary condition for the viability of the decent society, <italic>regardless</italic> of whether there is a perceptible topical interest in that kind of critique.</p>
<p>Protest movements then, as expressing ‘voice’ and as distinct from mere interest groups expressing ‘loyalty’, are essential to the viability of a decent society. They add to the overall viability of cooperative social structures by raising public awareness (for instance, of environmental problems before they actually become crises) and by protecting society against unsound, illegitimate, unwise, or immoral decisions. More importantly, they contribute – or rather, <italic>can</italic> contribute – to equal access in the interests and preferences of the excluded or ignored, and thereby to the emancipation and flourishing of all.</p>

<title>4 The normalization of environmental movements</title>
<p>If environmental justice is a necessary condition for a decent society, as we may conclude from the previous section, and if not only loyalty but also voice is part of the decent society, it follows that <italic>green</italic> critique has an audience and function in any decent society – regardless of whether it is a ‘republican’ republic, a constitutional monarchy, or a direct democracy.</p>
<p>Green critique can come from many sources – some relatively active, like protest and interest movements, NGOs and political parties, some more passive like think-tanks, individual thinkers and opinion-makers, and of course academic researchers. It seems, however, that both passive and active green critics have been compromised lately. Green protest movements, some academics claim, are increasingly turning away from the classic issues with which they gained their reputation and, after a while, public standing (cf., for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0191453713491233">Dowie, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0191453713491233">Blühdorn and Welsh, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0191453713491233">Schlosberg and Bomberg, 2008</xref>). The protection of (they say) cuddly and rare species, vulnerable ecosystems and beautiful landscapes has lost priority. While on the one hand participating more in, and protesting less against, institutions of the industrial and consumer society, on the other they now focus increasingly on (to the general public) esoteric issues attracting far less popular interest and support – issues like genetic modification. Activists themselves are now recognized as legitimate stakeholders by economic actors who in turn profess belief in corporate social responsibility, and who sometimes actually do ‘turn green’. The thematic shift, moreover, goes hand in hand with an organizational shift (cf., for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0191453713491233">Schlosberg, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0191453713491233">Chaloupka, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0191453713491233">Vanderheiden, 2008</xref>): environmental movements are becoming more and more professional. Volunteers work with an increasing number of paid staff (including professional managers), public accountability is formalized through formal meetings and glossy annual reports, and so on.</p>
<p>A classic illustration was (not is, as will be argued below) Greenpeace’s decision in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453713491233">2005</xref>, for the second year in a row, not to <italic>physically</italic> campaign against ‘the needless and cruel slaughter of hundreds of thousands of seals’ in the Canadian North. It would not even monitor a hunt operating under the rather difficult-to-maintain constraint forbidding the killing of seals aged two weeks or younger. Apart from a letter campaign and scattered protests near Canadian embassies by which Greenpeace said it attacked the problem at its roots, i.e. the Canadian government, no action was undertaken. In Greenpeace’s own words (note the professionalism implied by mentioning subspecies of seals):
<disp-quote>
<p>Greenpeace was part of a movement that first actively campaigned against commercial Canadian sealing between 1976 and 1983. Since that time, groups such as the International Fund for Animal Welfare, and other organizations, have taken the lead in campaigning against the slaughter of seals. We support the efforts of the International Fund for Animal Welfare and other organizations taking action against the commercial hunt for harp and hooded seals. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453713491233">Greenpeace UK, 2005</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As a Dutch representative for Greenpeace explained on the radio, the organization abstained from active protests against the seal hunt and threats to other rare species, on the grounds that it wanted to use its ‘scarce resources’ more ‘efficiently’.</p>
<p>What the history of Greenpeace and the seals seemed to illustrate – among other things – is a more general development among environmental movements from unique opposition through the mobilization of masses on exemplary rather than essential, high-profile issues (the famous cuddly species), to a combination of strategic protest with participation in forums on serious but unpopular and unappealing issues. More may be happening here than meets the eye: there may be an invisible change of ideology behind the visible change in tactics, which cannot be adequately explained by the alleged increased level of professionalism,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0191453713491233">9</xref></sup> the bureaucratization and political integration of the green (once New) Social Movement. Second, actual success may explain part of the normalization of the environmental movement – rather than being encapsulated and compromised, the movement may have succeeded in getting environmental issues taken seriously, with the inevitable consequence that a broad or general consensus on goals is assumed, making technical or policy-oriented input relevant – which, given finite resources, means that green groups can indeed not afford to spend their time and resources inefficiently. Third, the rational and universal quest for perpetuation of an organization’s existence seems to expose itself in conscious marketing strategies (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0191453713491233">Berny, 2009</xref> – note that such strategies are not necessarily successful, cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0191453713491233">Strømsnes, Selle and Grendstad, 2009</xref>). Finally, a general empirical claim like this needs more support than the one example of an apparent policy change within one organization in 2004–5. The volatility of that small bit of proof is illustrated by the fact that Greenpeace has not <italic>abandoned </italic>radical action and still engages in obstruction of, for example, whalers.</p>
<p>Whatever the cause, the green movement’s critique seems to be evolving from voice only into loyalty first, voice only when prudent. If we may assume that modern decent societies are trying to develop into environmentally sustainable societies, they need, by implication, critical green movements around. If they want practicable measures in the pursuit of sustainability, they need green critics to test both the factual and the normative assumptions of policies. If we understand politics solely as governance and consensus-building, this is exactly the kind of critique any society needs: loyal and constructive.</p>
<p>Yet can accommodation and appeasement strategies do the trick, that is, can they solve environmental problems and ensure sustainability? There are two reasons to doubt this. First, there is no apparent indication of fundamental changes to the economic and political system that up to now guided the exploitation of the environment. In particular, all empirical data point to a still increasing demand for resources. Second, where environmental interest or protest movements become less visible to the public, they contribute less to the public’s awareness of the state of the planet’s ecology, let alone to its awareness of the normative choices that may need to be made. In a post-Westphalian world of political secession, reconfiguration and internationalization, of marginalization of democratic decision-making and increasing power of professional, expert and socio-economic elites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0191453713491233">Wissenburg, 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0191453713491233">2008</xref>), being successful in addressing elites on environmental issues will only increase the cleavage between the general public and its rulers.</p>
<p>On the other hand then, ensuring sustainability may be more than a bookkeeping exercise; for instance, if the only way an ecological crisis can be averted or fought is by changing the parameters of the problem, specifically the demand for environmental goods (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0191453713491233">Wissenburg, 1998</xref>). The kind of critique this requires, voice, is the kind that sets and changes political agendas and influences decision-making. By becoming stakeholders – almost ‘ecological citizens’ (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0191453713491233">Dobson, 2003</xref>) – rather than grassroots organizations, environmental movements are in an increasingly better position to influence the post-agenda and pre-decision-making stages of politics and policy formulation. At the same time, though, <italic>given</italic> that their resources are indeed finite, they lose important assets as well: control over the agenda-setting process, and contact with their constituencies.</p>
<p>What looks like a victory for the decent society – the absence of or reduction of violent or radical protest – is then in fact a defeat. It is vital to the survival of decent societies and to their evolution that they are criticized, at all levels but specifically on fundamental points; the fewer resources are spent on voice, the less active and pro-active can a society be.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0191453713491233">10</xref></sup>

<title>5 The ivory tower and the decent society</title>
<p>If we are to take the limited resources argument seriously, we must conclude that any increase in ‘loyal opposition’ by green movements implies a decrease in voice. A decent society, however, needs both voice <italic>and</italic> loyalty.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0191453713491233">11</xref></sup> The normalization of green movements may contribute to more efficiency in, and a more effective implementation of, <italic>policies</italic> aimed at sustainability – yet effectiveness and efficiency in themselves are no guarantee that such policies will result in a genuinely sustainable society, or in a desirable form of sustainability. There is a difference between effective symbolism and rhetoric on the one hand, and effective policy on the other. Adding voice, i.e. promoting a critical debate not just on means but on ends, assumptions and ideals, is no guarantee either – but it is a necessary condition nonetheless.</p>
<p>But is fundamental critique still necessary – has the environmental problem by now not been charted and analysed more than enough? Merely <italic>posing</italic> this question is already sufficient to enter that very realm of fundamental critique, and to answer it we have to answer further questions of an equally fundamental nature. Why, for what <italic>ethical</italic> reasons, should we worry about known environmental problems like global warming, rising sea levels and a thinning ozone layer – who will miss Vanuatu when it sinks? How do we know that we can identify future environmental problems – in time or at all? Should we handle relatively new issues like genetic modification as conservationists and thereby commit ourselves to a view of sustainability in which, in principle, no further growth whatsoever is possible, or as ecologists, and embrace the idea that genetic modification results, by definition, in more biodiversity – and if not all biodiversity is good, which is and which is not, and why?</p>
<p>These are almost exactly the kinds of questions that green political thinkers used to pose in days before they turned ‘practical’ and became stakeholders in the shaping of workable environmental policies. Yet there can be no avoiding the more fundamental or even arcane questions relating to the value-rationality of policies and the politically disputable nature of those values. The simple reason is that, unless we know why we would or should support the <italic>goals</italic> of policy X, we cannot support or criticize policy X itself. Moreover, in a decent society, fundamental critique should not be voiced only in the circles where ‘practical’ policy is made. All that would result in is deliberation behind closed doors by specialists (even if the process is officially open to the public), and a reinvigoration of elite rule – something that may be inevitable and even beneficial provided the elites are not <italic>mentally</italic> closed (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0191453713491233">Wissenburg, 2004a</xref>), but it remains incompatible with the equal access criterion for a decent society.</p>
<p>A decent society, as argued above, is best served by the existence of an informed opposition, rather than by merely loyal critics partaking in the feast of piecemeal engineering that politics as governance is, and rather than by a marginalized, exit-fixated fundamentalist foe. In the creation and preservation of such an opposition, academia has at least as much of a role to play as it has in providing more ‘practical’, goal-rational critique.</p>
<p>It is worth noting, though, that fundamental <italic>academic</italic> critique is not immediately digestible food for citizens. As Brian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0191453713491233">Barry (1997</xref>: 63) said in response to UK Green Party founder Jonathan Porritt’s critique of academics’ constant dwelling on ‘practically irrelevant’ questions: ‘What the activist wants is ammunition that can be used in the fight for greater ecological awareness and responsibility. Fine-drawn analyses of sustainability such as those offered here are hardly the stuff to give the troops.’</p>
<p>There are two more or less opposing sets of criteria for the relevancy of green academic thought. On an academic view, relevant ideas are those that identify important unresolved issues of a fundamental nature and address these. As already indicated in the introduction, this is rarely a viable strategy. Alternatively, we may believe that academic thought has a ‘social function’ or a kind of social relevance <italic>too</italic>, or we may have to learn to accept that this role is simply bestowed on academic research. Either way, ‘practical relevance’ (as much as personal commitment and political pressure) then plays a role in the choice of topics and in directing debates within academia. Yet that does not imply that academia must or even can adapt itself to a market – whatever market: companies, activists, politicians, or bureaucrats.</p>
<p>Academic critique is theory-guided or theory-focused, and therefore serves no <italic>direct</italic> social purposes, neither in the service of an opposition nor in that of the powers that be. Good scientific critique is not what is demanded by activists, by political agents, or even by the environment itself; instead, it <italic>criticizes</italic> those demands, <italic>any</italic> demands, because it is by its very nature skeptical, and that skepticism is aimed both at accepted wisdom <italic>and</italic> at the reasons for questioning accepted wisdom. (Good) fundamental scientific critique will therefore be ill-suited to or an unreliable partner for <italic>one</italic> specific party, interest, or movement. Instead, academic social and political thought can play only a relatively distant role as guardian of the critical potential of civil society, offering all sides ammunition, and no role as a participant. Or, formulated from the perspective of society, expertise cannot replace experience: it takes the exercise of engaging in <italic>real</italic> opposition to keep society fit.</p>
<p>Against the background of a decent society, I have argued that the case of environmental critique does not just illustrate how critique and deliberation appear to be increasingly practised behind closed doors, which contravenes the decent society’s ideal of equal access, but also that it tends to take on the shape of goal-rational rather than value-rational critique, loyalty rather than voice. It thereby promotes an understanding of politics as governance and consensus-building but neglects politics as power-struggle, i.e. it neglects the necessarily controversial nature of any normative premise on which policies are based. Wayward and defiant thought, as much as protest movements, is crucial to the flourishing of a decent society. It raises awareness of and warns against unsound, imprudent, or immoral decisions. Academic duty and the needs of the decent society coincide in suggesting that academic thought should remain fundamentally critical of <italic>all</italic> practices, those of activists, those of rulers, and any others.</p>

<p>Some authors use the term ‘pragmatic’ as a synonym for what I shall exclusively characterize as ‘practical’ (practical critique, a practical attitude, etc.). Pragmatism in the colloquial sense of the word is not the same as philosophical pragmatism, an approach to knowledge that requires engaging with and immersing in practices, rejecting an a priori subject–object divide, and so on. Pragmatism in environmental philosophy (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0191453713491233">Light, 1996</xref>), for example, criticizes the relevance of both the terms intrinsic <italic>and</italic> instrumental value as applied to nature – terms usually dividing the most important schools in green thought.

<p>Rawls is never too clear on where the line between decent and just societies is to be drawn, but if we interpret him strictly, societies like the UK, Spain and the Netherlands are not just but merely decent: they are monarchies, and their hereditary monarchs are not mere figureheads but do have perceptibly more influence on political decision-making than the average citizen.
