<title>Background:</title>
<p>The situation for people feeling severely affected by Multiple Sclerosis (MS) remains largely unexamined and the term ‘severe MS’ is not clearly defined.</p>

<sec id="section3-0269216311425420">
<title>Design:</title>
<p>A questionnaire with open- and closed-ended items addressing only patients feeling severely affected was sent out nationwide.

</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269216311425420">
<title>Setting/participants:</title>
<p>1,110 questionnaires were analysed regarding the closed-ended questions while a subsample of 40% (<italic>n</italic> = 445) was analysed regarding the open-ended questions. Average age of participants was 51.87 years. Average time since diagnosis was 16.6 years. Main course of the disease was secondary progressive (35.5%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0269216311425420">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The most frequently mentioned reasons for feeling severely affected were lack of mobility (56.4%) and fatigue (27.4%). Significant percentages for unmet needs were seen in the categories of funding services (31.0%), better social integration (24.7%) and medical support (25.2%). A significant correlation was observed between EDSS and subjectively felt affectedness (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.01). Motor disorders explained differences in patient needs behind a higher EDSS score; higher severe affectedness referred to other issues like dependency and immobility.</p>

<sec id="section6-0269216311425420">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>EDSS is insufficient for usage as the sole instrument for measuring severe affectedness as it does not take into account other potential reasons. Complex patient needs necessitate multi-professional care as offered by palliative medicine.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that mainly affects people between the ages of 20 and 40 years. An estimated 2.5 million people have MS worldwide, and in Germany approximately 122,000 people are affected by the disease (data provided by the German Society of Multiple Sclerosis [DMSG], available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dmsg.de">http://www.dmsg.de</ext-link>). MS is a difficult disease for people to adjust to due to its severity, the unpredictability of its course, and the modest effectiveness of available medical treatment. As the disease progresses MS can result in physical, cognitive and psychological limitations. Clinical experience suggests that advanced MS patients commonly experience pain, spasticity, fatigue, depression, bedsores and incontinence, with approximately 50% displaying some cognitive impairment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311425420">1</xref></sup> These problems impact the patients directly as well as their families and caregivers since many patients are cared for at home. So far, little research has been done to ascertain the perceptions of people with MS (PwMS) and their caregivers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311425420">2</xref></sup> or the experiences of people with more advanced MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311425420">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311425420"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311425420">5</xref></sup> The definition of the group of patients severely affected by MS is subjective and the term ‘severe MS’ is not clearly defined. Problems for research so far are that being affected by MS is a complex concept where many external factors may interact. Forbes et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311425420">2</xref></sup> suggest that the health status of the patient contributes to the health status of the caregiver and vice versa, and that the affectedness of the patient might even be mitigated by the actions of the caregiver. In addition to the physical burden, other factors that might contribute to a severe affectedness include difficult psychosocial circumstances, social isolation as well as losses and changes in independence, relationships and social roles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311425420">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311425420">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are several studies (especially from English language speaking areas) which have examined the unmet needs of MS patients but only a few have addressed the issue of feeling severely affected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311425420">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311425420">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311425420">7</xref></sup> These studies indicate a broad variety of medical help related needs as well as assistance with affected patients’ activities of daily living (ADL), psychosocial help and other factors such as rehabilitation and non-professional care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311425420">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216311425420"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311425420"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311425420"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216311425420">12</xref></sup> Initial studies on this subgroup of severely affected MS-patients were carried out by Higginson et al.;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311425420">7</xref></sup> however, the patients in that study were identified by staff members using the EDSS score as a definition for a severe affectedness, and not via patient self-reporting. Edmonds et al. recruited participants for their study on severely affected MS-patients utilizing only EDSS (EDSS score &gt; 8). Most studies emphasize the medical assessment or objective criteria like the EDSS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311425420">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311425420">7</xref></sup> where the scoring primarily refers to the level of restricted movement. This does not encompass symptoms such as visual problems, sexual dysfunction, fatigue, or depression,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216311425420">13</xref></sup> and may be insufficient for assessing the severity of the disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216311425420">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>MS-patients develop progressive disability after a decade or more from disease onset, thus it is extremely important to gain a good understanding of the natural history of MS to date, necessitating the databasing of a large inception cohort. There are currently a number of regional and national registries (for instance MSBase, Lyon MS database system, EDMUS) dedicated to the acquisition of prospective and objective data on MS patients (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216311425420">Table 1</xref> in Butzkueven et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216311425420">15</xref></sup>). The aforementioned databases seek to provide minimal descriptive records for research purposes as well as classify the course, severity and diagnostic confidence of the disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216311425420">16</xref></sup> EDMUS gives priority to symptoms over signs; MSBase collects data on the relapse rate, relapse treatment, MS specific therapies, diagnostic tests performed and EDSS score; however, none of those databases collects data on the subjectively felt (severe) affectedness. Our study was therefore directed towards identifying, for the first time, this specific subgroup of MS patients through the exclusive use of a completely subjective inclusion criterion. Additional goals of the study were to describe the reasons for feeling severely affected and identify the perceived most important unmet needs.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section9-0269216311425420">
<title>Development of the questionnaire</title>
<p>For this study we opted for a two-part questionnaire design with both closed-ended questions and open-ended questions to assure the subjective view of the patients concerning their disease and needs. An initial draft of the questionnaire was developed by an internal, multi-professional team from the Department of Palliative Medicine at the University of Cologne. Ten experts recommended by the DMSG were then asked to evaluate this first draft. All involved in the evaluation had cared for MS patients in their capacity either as doctors or as nurses and were uniquely qualified through having years of specific expertise in the treatment of MS. Most of the comments on the nine (out of a total of 10) questionnaires returned were related to additions to the closed-ended questions. The questionnaire was revised accordingly following careful evaluation of all suggestions received.</p>
<p>To test relevance and comprehensibility of the questionnaire we decided to arrange ‘think-aloud’ interviews, a standard method for pre-testing of questionnaires to ensure comprehensibility, not content.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216311425420">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216311425420">18</xref></sup> Three MS patients volunteered to participate in these interviews.</p>
<p>No problems were detected with either comprehensibility or language, nor were there any answers that did not fit the question. Some answers were shown to be redundant so two open-ended questions were then omitted, and closed-ended questions were condensed. The results were summarized and re-evaluated. For distribution the questionnaire was edited down to four pages for inclusion into a patient magazine format. In its final form, the questionnaire consisted of closed-ended questions concerning socio-demographic (i.e. age, gender, living situation, family etc.) and disease-related aspects (i.e. EDSS, years passed since diagnosis, subjective health condition, subjective severe affectedness etc.) as well as the following four open-ended questions: 1) Why do you feel severely affected by MS? 2) Which aspects of your situation are satisfying? 3) Which aspects of your situation are dissatisfying? 4) In which aspects of your situation do you need more support?</p>
<p>Patients were asked to name the three most important reasons or aspects to each question.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0269216311425420">
<title>Ethics</title>
<p>The study was approved by the University Hospital of Cologne Ethics Committee (Number 06-220). All data were rendered anonymous and the voluntary nature of the study clearly stated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0269216311425420">
<title>Recruitment of the sample</title>
<p>The questionnaire was published nationwide on 1 April 2007 in the DMGS magazine <italic>aktiv</italic> (issue 1/07, no. 214), a magazine for MS-patients and others dealing with MS. A notation was included detailing our request that everyone who felt severely affected by MS take part in the study and also inform other patients about it. Thus, the only inclusion criterion was self-reported feeling of being severely affected by MS.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0269216311425420">
<title>Content analysis</title>
<p>A set of categories to be used for categorizing the answers was first developed according to the required guidelines of content analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269216311425420">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216311425420"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269216311425420">21</xref></sup> before data from the open-ended questions was entered into a matrix. The research team (RV, MG, HG, AH) developed an analysis strategy to process the large amount of data inductively as well as deductively. Although one individual researcher (AH) handled the coding, the entire research team (RV, MG, HG, AH) met regularly to finalize the content analysis by studying coding examples together, refining the coding system, shaping the categories and discussing any possible flaws. To find potential categories, existing literature was reviewed to see what needs or reasons related to feeling severely affected had already been identified. The data was then examined for emerging categories. The categories from this inductive process and those encountered during our review of the literature were compared and integrated into one system.</p>
<p>We observed potential reasons for feeling severely affected in 19 categories, which included, for example, medical problems, such as pain or bladder and bowel problems, as well as psychosocial problems including fear, lack of independence and social stigmatization and immobility. Five categories for possible needs also indicated potential reasons for feeling severely affected, including, but not limited to, medical, psychological, financial and informative reasons.</p>
<p>A subsample of <italic>n</italic> = 50 was tested to assess whether these categories were sufficient for categorizing the answers. Thirteen answers could not be classified under the ‘needs’ category system, while 24 answers could not be classified under the ‘reasons’ category system. The existing categories were judged to be insufficient and thus supplemented, resulting in 37 categories for reasons and eight categories for needs, which were then applied to the subsample. By using this set of categories we iteratively extended the categories even further for more explicit coverage, eventually arriving at 48 categories for reasons and 11 categories for needs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269216311425420">Figure 1</xref> shows the development process for the set of categories in our study.</p>

<sec id="section13-0269216311425420">
<title>Evaluation and statistics</title>
<p>The extracted 48 categories for reasons and 11 categories for needs were summed to obtain higher numbers per category for statistical reasons. Categories were then analysed descriptively to find general characteristics of the sample. We tested for correlations between subjective felt affectedness and (i) subjective felt health, (ii) EDSS score, (iii) health condition, (iv) years passed since diagnosis, and (v) the open ended questions.</p>
<p>In addition, we sought to discover any differences in the given reasons and needs found among patients with a rather high and rather low EDSS, as well as amongst patients with a rather high and low felt subjective affectedness. All participants felt severely affected but there were differences in the rating of the severity felt. Patients could indicate the intensity of their subjectively felt severity on a scale from 1 to 10. Two groups were then formed by dichotomizing the scores via a median-split: people feeling more and people feeling less severely affected. The EDSS score (scale 0–10) was also split on the basis of the respective median to compare the groups of patients with lower and higher scores.</p>
<p>A higher EDSS was defined as ≥ 6, a lower EDSS as &lt; 6, a higher severity of affectedness as ≥ 7, a lower severity as &lt; 7. Chi square (χ<sup>2</sup>) was then used to ascertain any statistically significant differences among these groups, i.e. if some reasons were given more frequently by people with a high EDSS (≥ 6)/subjective affectedness (≥ 7) than were given by people with a low EDSS (&lt; 6)/subjective affectedness (&lt; 7).</p>
<p>A total of 1110 questionnaires were analysed regarding the closed-ended questions while a subsample of 40% (<italic>n</italic> = 445) was additionally analysed regarding the open-ended questions using the developed set of categories. All the results were coded in an SPSS 15 (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) data mask and then analysed.</p>

<title>Characteristics of the study sample</title>
<p>Of the 1110 patients from all over Germany who returned the questionnaire there were 745 (67.1%) females and 364 (32.8%) males, with one respondent lacking specification (0.1%). Average age was 51.87 years and respondents’ ages ranged from 12 to 85 years. Most patients (69.9%) indicated having a partner. Average time since diagnosis was 16.6 years (SD = 10.37), while the main course of the disease was secondary progressive (35.9%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216311425420">Table 1</xref>). In our sample 64.1% (<italic>n</italic> = 711) indicated that they felt more severely affected, with scores of ≥ 7 (median-split).</p>
<p>When asked about their health condition during the preceding week, patients could rate their health on a scale ranging from 1 (very bad) to 7 (excellent). Most patients (<italic>n</italic> = 318; 28.6%) answered with 3; however, the median was 4 (mean = 3.63, SD = 1.34, min. = 1 (<italic>n</italic> = 66), max. = 7 (<italic>n</italic> = 14)).</p>
<p>A total of 241 patients (21.7%) were aware of their current EDSS score (scale 0–10, the median was 6, min. = 1, max. = 9.5) while most of the people with MS in our sample (75.8%) did not know their scores (2.5% missing data). The median of the item measuring how severely people felt affected by MS was 7 (range from 1 [not at all] to 10 [totally]), indicating a highly felt severe affectedness. The percentage of the sample suffering from depression was 25.2%.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269216311425420">Table 2</xref> demonstrates that in comparison with data from the German MS-registry (data provided by the DMSG Bundesverband e.V.), the patients identified in our study were on average older, had a higher EDSS score and were more affected by the chronic course of MS.</p>

<p>The subjective estimation of being severely affected correlates moderately with the EDSS score at 0.517 (Spearman-Rho, <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.01, two-sided) meaning that the higher the EDSS score, the higher the subjectively felt affectedness.

<title>Reasons for feeling severely affected</title>
<p>As mentioned above, we analysed the open-ended questions for feeling severely affected by MS on a subsample of 40% (<italic>n</italic> = 445). Given reasons for feeling subjectively severely affected were (multiple answers possible – see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269216311425420">Figure 2</xref>): impairment in mobility (56.4%); fatigue (27.4%); problems in autonomous functions such as bladder problems and sexual dysfunction (19.1%); dependency (17.8%); psychosocial problems such as isolation, social stigmatization or limited future life perspectives (11.0%); coordination problems (10.6%); and having to give up habits (7.2%). Pain was mentioned by only 6.1% of the patients as a reason for their perceived severe affectedness.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section18-0269216311425420">
<title>Needs when feeling severely affected</title>
<p>Unmet needs were mentioned in the areas of better financing of services (31.0%); better social integration (24.7%); better medical treatments (25.2%); and more help with everyday life (21.1%). The need for better access to healthcare services was specified by 10.3% of the sample.</p>
<p>The needs indicated by the two groups were then compared according to higher/lower EDSS score and higher/lower affectedness (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0269216311425420">Figure 3(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0269216311425420">(b)</xref>). One hundred and one patients (22.7%) in the subsample knew their EDSS score, a result that corresponds approximately to the whole sample where 21.7% knew their scores. Of the 101 patients of the subsample that knew their EDSS score, 52 people with MS (51.49%) had a rather low EDSS score (&lt; 6), although 70 people of those 101 (69.3%) felt subjectively more severely affected (<italic>≥</italic> 7). A comparison of unmet needs of patients in the groups higher versus lower subjectively felt severe affectedness and high versus low EDSS scores shows that patients express needs in all categories more frequently if they feel subjectively severely affected than if the severity was rated with the EDSS and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0269216311425420">Figure 3(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0269216311425420">(b)</xref>).

<p>Furthermore, when Chi-square testing the categories for differences in reasons regarding higher and lower EDSS scores and higher and lower subjectively felt affectedness, we identified four significant differences between the groups: the group that rated their affectedness rather high (&gt; 7) had significantly more problems with dependency (χ<sup>2</sup> = 12.708, 3 df, <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and immobility (χ<sup>2</sup> = 15.656, 3 df, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001) and mentioned these as their reasons for feeling severely affected. Additionally, the group feeling more severely affected felt more disturbed in their autonomous functions (χ<sup>2</sup> = 2.704, 2 df, <italic>p</italic> = 0.011) and more often had to give up habits (χ<sup>2</sup> = 11.197, 3 df, <italic>p</italic> = 0.011), for instance, participation in sports and meeting friends. There were no other significant differences between higher and lower felt affectedness in reasons (i.e. fatigue, spasticity, pain, cognition, depression, motor function problems, secondary diseases, psychosocial problems, coordination and other physical problems).</p>
<p>As for significant differences in reasons between higher and lower EDSS, the groups differed only in terms of motor function problems (χ<sup>2</sup> = 4.821, 1 df, <italic>p</italic> = 0.028). There were no significant differences in the areas of spasticity, pain, cognition, depression, giving up habits, dependence, mobility, motor function disorders, coordination, secondary diseases, psychosocial problems and other physical problems.</p>
<p>When Chi-square testing the categories for differences in needs regarding higher and lower EDSS scores and higher and lower subjectively felt affectedness, no significant differences between the groups could be identified in any of the categories.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study used self-reporting via questionnaire to identify a subset of MS patients feeling severely affected by the disease. Our study marked the first time a completely subjective inclusion criterion has been utilized to describe and analyse the reasons persons diagnosed with MS offer for feeling affected as well as to document their perceived unmet needs.</p>
<p>There is a large German MS Registry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269216311425420">22</xref></sup> for analysing patient data from specialized MS centres treating patients in early stages of the disease, whereby these individuals are documented, but without reference to the severity of the disease. As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269216311425420">Table 2</xref>, persons documented by the MS Registry are more often suffering from the relapsing–remitting course of MS; only 1.9% of the sample by Higginson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311425420">7</xref></sup> have this form of the disease. The patients identified in our study were on average older, had a higher EDSS score and were more affected by the chronic course of MS. This indeed points towards a more advanced disease in the patients in our study, but less advanced than in the paper by Higginson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311425420">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The approach and recruitment of participants for our study differs from that used in the study by Higginson et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311425420">7</xref></sup> where patients were included via staff assessment and EDSS scores. Our method also differs from the recruitment of patients by the German MS-Registry, where data is obtained by MS centres, which may partially explain why the data from the three compared samples differ in outcome, i.e. in age, disease-course, and EDSS score.</p>
<p>The presented data strongly support the need for alternative ways to assess severe affectedness as many symptoms that were mentioned as reasons for feeling a severe affectedness in our study (such as fatigue, having to give up habits, dependence) are not included in quantifying the disability by the EDSS, though they can also be found in other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269216311425420">23</xref></sup> In the study by Higginson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311425420">7</xref></sup> dealing with people severely affected by MS (mean EDSS score of 7.8), patients reported a mean of nine symptoms, including fatigue, lack of energy, spasms, pain, and feeling drowsy. Fatigue, especially in correlation with depression, is also a common symptom as Bakshi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269216311425420">24</xref></sup> and Flachenecker et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269216311425420">25</xref></sup> have shown. Both seem to have a significant influence on the quality of life for MS patients as demonstrated by Amato et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269216311425420">26</xref></sup> This is also true for pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269216311425420">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269216311425420"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269216311425420">29</xref></sup> In cases of advanced MS, the most common psychological disorder reported is a reactive depression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269216311425420">30</xref></sup> Chwastiak et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269216311425420">31</xref></sup> also found that particularly those in the advanced stages of MS suffer more from depressive symptoms. Depression is thought to occur because of physical impairment, dependency on others as well as an uncertainty about their finances, job, and future.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269216311425420">32</xref></sup> Being in a dependent role can lead to feelings of emptiness, hopelessness, or uselessness, and lead to feeling depressed, while depression itself can increase in severity with progressive disease activity and to feeling more severely affected. In our sample of people with MS, 25.2% felt depressed. This number might also indicate that more advanced disease as well as feeling severely affected and dependent can increase depressive symptoms.</p>
<p>Although the moderate correlation between EDSS and subjectively felt affectedness is significant, it is still too low to draw conclusions about the subjectively felt severe affectedness from the EDSS score. There might be aspects other than the EDSS score that account for the subjectively felt affectedness. From the results of our study we might thus assume that the EDSS score alone might not be sufficient to quantify disability in multiple sclerosis, a critique that is also supported by other authors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269216311425420">33</xref></sup> who consider the EDSS to have important flaws seriously limiting its usefulness, such as placing too much emphasis on use of the legs and being insensitive to clinical change. Obviously, there are further aspects making patients feel severely affected by MS that are not covered by the EDSS.</p>
<p>With regard to unmet needs, patients in our sample mentioned the areas of better financing of services, better social integration, better medical treatments and more help with everyday life. This corresponds to other studies which have shown that MS not only influences the physical aspects of quality of life, like immobility or bladder dysfunction, but also influences social activities and personal control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269216311425420">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269216311425420">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>Unfortunately, most of the people in our sample have to struggle with funding services. Considerable bureaucratic and structural problems apparently exist for severely affected MS patients. These results correspond to findings in a study of a sample of 32 patients by Edmonds et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311425420">3</xref></sup> The need for help with the activities of daily living indicates that there is still a lack of adequate services and general assistance including devices for people with disabilities. The expressed need for better social integration may point towards acceptance of disabled people still being very low in Germany, and it may also be a reason for needing better access to adapted accommodation and services.</p>
<p>Unmet needs did not significantly correlate with any tested group (higher/lower EDSS and higher/lower affectedness). Such needs might be general in nature and patients might need help regardless of the severity of their affectedness. Although the result that the unmet needs were higher if the person felt subjectively more severely affected than if the severity was rated with the EDSS and vice versa shows no significance, it gives first insights into the relationship between feeling severely affected and having more unmet needs. This result should be examined in future studies.</p>
<p>Many rehabilitation practitioners and researchers often work in a way guided by the model of disability to which they subscribe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269216311425420">36</xref></sup> As a result, the daily lives of people with disabilities, their social and familial life – in large parts – are determined by models of disability. Moreover, and most importantly, models of disability have a powerful influence on the public perception of disability and how the public responds to people with disabilities. The medical model of disability, for instance, focuses on problems and deficits, usually concentrating on the impairment, rather than the needs of the person. The power to help disabled people seems to lie within the medical and associated professions and disabled people’s lives are often handed over to these professionals. Disabled people are thus viewed as being at risk and consequently looked after and become passive receivers of care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269216311425420">37</xref></sup> They are excluded from many of the learning opportunities in society and thus become more vulnerable, which, in turn, then justifies their being looked after. In recent years, the disability movement has advocated a different way of looking at disability, known as the ‘social model of disability’. This model takes into account the strengths of the person with the impairment and the physical and social barriers obstructing them. The social model of disability defines ‘impairment’ and ‘disability’ as two very different things. Supporters of the disability movement believe that the discrimination against disabled people is socially created and has little to do with their impairments. Yet, since all models of disability – with their strengths and weaknesses – are based on the intention to assist people with disabilities, it will be important to provide cross-model service provision that allows for interdisciplinary, consistent collaboration, and interdependent services.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269216311425420">38</xref></sup> No single model reflects all of the needs of persons with disabilities, nor can a single professional respond to all these needs. Diversity in models should be viewed as strengthening and enriching.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269216311425420">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269216311425420">40</xref></sup> This diversity is also important when looking at the needs of people with MS and the implications for palliative care. Palliative care can offer an interdisciplinary approach and thereby cover a broad range of diverse MS patient needs representing a <italic>heterogeneous</italic> group with respect to disease severity and outcome. The comprehensive care of MS patients involves open communication with patients as well as the entire healthcare team. This is only one of many points where palliative care can contribute to meeting the needs of severely affected MS patients.</p>
<sec id="section20-0269216311425420">
<title>Implications: palliative care for MS?</title>
<p>The scope of unmet needs mentioned in our study highlights the importance of having multi-professional care for MS patients that includes not only medical but social and psychological help as well. Employing interdisciplinary teams of physicians, nurses, social workers, and additional personnel as needed (chaplains, physical therapists, psychologists), palliative care teams identify and rapidly treat distressing symptoms. Research has demonstrated that palliative care programs improve physical and psychological symptoms, caregiver well-being, and also consulting physician satisfaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269216311425420">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>Clinical experience and the results of recent studies lead us to conclude that patients severely affected by MS should have access to palliative care assessments and services. A clinical pathway has to be developed that helps to identify MS patients who can benefit from referral to a specialized palliative care service. However, palliative care will have to adapt to MS patients and MS patients must have access to palliative care assessment and, if necessary, to a specialized palliative care service.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269216311425420">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269216311425420">43</xref></sup> Since the role of rehabilitation in palliative care has been established and its benefits demonstrated,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269216311425420">44</xref></sup> neurological rehabilitation services are needed for people with MS and these should be tailored to each individual situation in order to maximize independence, encourage autonomy and social participation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0269216311425420">
<title>Strengths and limitations</title>
<p>Although we had a large dataset (<italic>N</italic> = 1110), we cannot calculate any response rate or refer to how representative the data are. Also we cannot guarantee any non-response bias. Yet, most studies in the field of analysing needs of MS patients deal with considerably fewer participants and in comparison with the German MS Registry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269216311425420">22</xref></sup> we succeeded in meeting the criteria of reaching those people with MS feeling severely affected by the disease. The DMSG Bundesverband e.V. currently has about 45,000 members and publishes the quarterly magazine <italic>aktiv</italic>, which is distributed to all members and thus circulation numbers for each edition correspond with membership. We lack data on the number of non-patients belonging to the DMSG who also receive this publication and thus cannot calculate the response rate in relation to the intended sample. The response (<italic>N</italic> = 1110) is considered to be very high given that not all of the members are patients – some are relatives, physicians, neurologists, therapists – and not all of the patients who are members feel subjectively severely affected by MS. Still, since only people reading the magazine <italic>aktiv</italic> and members of the DMSG could be reached to answer our questionnaire, this might have led to a selective sample and the views portrayed here cannot be transposed to all MS patients.</p>
<p>Coding was performed by a single researcher, however, and regular meetings with the whole research team were conducted where the coding system was presented and discussed. Reliability would likely have been increased by having two researchers independently coding the qualitative response data.</p>
<p>Completing the questionnaire required abilities that may be impaired among very severely affected people whose physical function is likely to be limited by MS. We attempted to circumvent this problem by inviting the patient to get help from family, caregivers or friends in filling out the form. Not everyone may have sought this assistance. For further studies, an online questionnaire could be helpful in order to reach those patients more limited in their physical functioning but who may have technical assistance, i.e. adjusted computers for low vision, adjusted text and icon size, and/or screen magnification. Also, other instruments or data collection methods for severely affected people should be offered in order to reach people with different levels of handicap.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>So what does it mean to feel severely affected by MS? The experience, symptoms and feelings about having MS may be different for each of those affected, yet MS is very central to all of their lives. The results show that feeling subjectively severely affected cannot be rated by quantitative measures of MS severity alone. It involves many more, broader aspects like psychosocial support, better financing and mobility as well as support by relatives. Feelings of dependency and having to give up habits appear to play a large role in feeling severely affected, factors which clearly hinder people with MS in their leading a self-determined life. As the EDSS score turned out to be insufficiently reliable for measuring the severity of the disease and the quality of life, more research is required to find an adequate instrument.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269216311425420">45</xref></sup></p>
