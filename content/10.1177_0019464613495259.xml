<p>South Asian seafarers employed on British ships engaged in international merchant shipping numbered roughly 25,000 men in the later nineteenth century rising to an annual average of some 50,000 in the inter-war decades. Ships of other nations employed thousands more generating inter-war employment totals in the 50,000 to 65,000 ranges although official statistics probably undercounted their presence. By the World War II, approximately one-third of all seamen on British ships were South Asian, of whom the majority came from region that became Pakistan, although other localities could be represented within any specific crew (for example, cabin crews from Goa). Many of these seafarers retained a foothold in peasant agriculture.</p>
<p>These South Asian seafarers had a small presence within the total Indian workforce in the period c. 1870–1945. However, as Professor G. Balachandran ably demonstrates, they had a historical significance considerably greater than their raw numbers would suggest. They were, he argues, ‘among the world’s and India’s first global workers’. Their substantial presence on British ships made them a pivotal group of cheap, reliable labour (the ‘muscles of Empire’) in the interconnected activities of the British Empire and profit-seeking shipowners. Much official and non-official attention, therefore, was devoted to keeping them available as sea-going labour, albeit labour deliberately excluded from some shipping routes and from long-term residence in Britain. As a group they were subordinated to the needs of Empire and capitalist imperialism and, discursively, to stereotypes widely held among those who had authority over them. However, the few South Asian seamen who became domiciled in Britain before 1950—they numbered a few thousand at most—had a disproportionate effect on metropolitan attitudes and actions. For some South Asian communities moreover, notably Sylhetis in East London, deserted or England-discharged seamen from India opened pathways that facilitated the migration of substantial numbers of South Asians to Britain in the post World War II era.</p>
<p>South Asian seafarers seemed to lead highly mobile lives. Their places of work—ships—traversed the oceans and docked at ports located along the littorals of continents far distant from India. However, as this fascinating book demonstrates, immobilisation better describes many aspects of their lives. Their ships moved but they remained embedded for many months within the limited physical space of the vessel and within a social space built around small work units (deckhands on a steam-driven merchant vessel, depending on its size, numbered roughly between 12 and 60 and the engine crew between 15 and 80; passenger ships had more South Asians because of the additional cabin staff) contained and constrained within extended labour processes (hiring to discharge) characterised by extensive, interlocked legal and extra-legal forms of control informed by the racially-tinged attitudes and security concerns of colonial authorities, shipping authorities, European masters (captains) and their officers and the profit-seeking of shipping companies.</p>
<p>Balachandran develops his arguments via eight chapters: an introduction and an epilogue between which one finds chapters on (<italic>a</italic>) the origins and expansion of the seafaring group he describes, (<italic>b</italic>) their recruitment and how they were controlled, (<italic>c</italic>) their itineraries, onboard work, job classifications, pay, rations, health and destinations, (<italic>d</italic>) conditions at ports of arrival and departure, (<italic>e</italic>) something about the existence of those seamen who through desertion or other means ended up living in the UK and also those who became prisoners of Germany during the World Wars, (<italic>f</italic>) the characteristics and expressions of collective resistance of the Indian seamen to their deplorable working and living conditions and to the low rates of pay that were, as an additional grievance, much less than those received by British seamen. This material enables Balachandran to segue into a discussion of the beginnings of a transformation in the extended labour processes within which the Indian seamen were enmeshed.</p>
<p>The book’s broad-based coverage gives us a good, cohesive overview of what had been a neglected part of South Asia’s labour history. Others (for example, Ahuja, Broeze, Dixon, Hyslop and Balachandran himself) have given us focused articles but the connected, bigger picture was absent until now. The book addresses socio-cultural issues, globalisation, political economy and the more focused topics that sometimes interest historians of labour (for example, de-skilling or collective action). Another strength of the book is the author’s use of the telling anecdote, the fascinating vignette and details about individuals when available. Indian sailors rarely left any records themselves, but Balachandran does well to tease out what information he can.</p>
<p>Despite their far-flung voyages, aspects of the working lives of the Indian seamen fit comfortably within what is known generally about the history of labour in colonial India. The persistent presence of intermediaries in the form of <italic>ghat serangs</italic>, <italic>serangs</italic> and rooming house-owners in the recruitment and workplace control of the Indian seamen (<italic>lascars</italic>) is striking. Fascinating, too, is the extent to which the <italic>lascars</italic>, like their brethren in the jute and cotton industries or in construction work, were systematically located within a discursive framework that reduced them to the stereotypical coolie labourer of the colonial imaginary and to legal controls derived from master and servant statutes. Additionally, as we find elsewhere in India’s labour history, the <italic>lascars</italic> found ways collectively and individually to resist the controls and degraded conditions to which they were subjected. They had agency: they deserted; they dragged their feet; they struck when conditions were favourable—most sensibly and self-aware, almost always in port when their legal situation was somewhat stronger because strikes at sea risked the draconian sanctions imposed on mutineers.</p>
<p>The patterns of recruitment, control and exclusion described by Balachandran endured with evolutionary changes through 1945 although the British need for seamen during the two World Wars resulted in some loosening of the coolie-lascar strait jacket, a loosening re-tightened after both Wars in shameful repudiation of the wartime sacrifices of the <italic>lascars</italic>. Some small movement via the emergence of Indian seamen’s unions, official attempts to regulate hiring practices and other inter-war developments nibbled at the existing structures and attitudes but major reform came well after World War II. Balachandran briefly touches on some of those changes in his brief epilogue that also discusses the consequences of Partition for those crewmembers recruited from areas that became Pakistan. However, this is the least satisfactory of the chapters. The final pages of chapter six are the conclusion. The epilogue could be expanded into another book.</p>
<p>Criticisms of this important, interesting and (as a bonus) readable book are more in the nature of what a reviewer would like, as opposed to what is on offer. Balachandran opens up a field; he did not set out to write a huge, detailed study. Therefore, I would like to know more about the differences between Bombay and Calcutta markets for maritime labour, more about Indian seamen on the vessels of other European nations (those of the German Hansa line, for example) and more about how and why some regions of South Asia became major suppliers of maritime labour—and other regions did not. Tables consolidating quantitative data presented in the text would have been helpful. And perhaps one does not need quite so many exclamation marks to express (rhetorical?) surprise.</p>
