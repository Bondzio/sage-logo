<p>Reading Renée Fox’s expansive autobiography, <italic>In the Field: A Sociologist’s Journey</italic>, leaves one suitably torn. On the one hand, the nostalgia seeping from the text can leave you reminiscing for the carefree days of early graduate seminars in theory (or at least preparing to teach your first introduction to the history of American sociology). From Talcott Parsons to Seymour Lipset to Margaret Mead, the recollection of interactions with pantheonic figures is somewhat relentless. On the other hand, however, one is left pondering the relevance of the “traditional” autobiography in an era of quasi-legitimated autoethnography. Is it enough to simply offer recollections on an incredibly accomplished career? Or are we now conditioned to expect a critical analysis of one’s place in a larger systemic context?</p>
<p>Well-written and detailed, Fox’s memoir is a rapid progression through the (sometimes) life and career of a preeminent American medical sociologist and ethnographer. That being said, the purpose of the book is neither an introduction nor a critical investigation of either. Rather, the approach is an interesting combination of subjective perspective and embedded narrative; indeed, the focus is much more autobiographical than explicitly sociological. The substantial and often detailed recollections are largely chronological and remain steadfastly focused on the experiential professional life of Renée Fox.</p>
<p>The memoir begins as these things often do with recollections of childhood—in this case growing up in Manhattan. The “journey” quickly progresses through formative undergraduate experiences at Smith and later at Harvard. The latter inaugurates a style that minimizes personal contributions from Fox and heavily emphasizes the importance of relationships and key individuals. This pattern begins early as the influence of Talcott Parsons, who served as Fox’s graduate advisor at Harvard, is cited in a way that could leave readers with the impression that Fox’s very career is due to the close professional relationship she developed with Parsons. She credits her first job (working with Merton at Columbia), her first book, and her return to Harvard after a stint at Barnard to some level of interest on the part of Parsons.</p>
<p>Her identification of important individuals and description of their respective contributions continues as she describes her development as one of the founders of what would become medical sociology. In keeping with her subjective emphasis, Fox uses her work in formative medical sociology as the descriptive vehicle that facilitated a larger professional “journey.” Indeed, her work on the socio-cultural context of medical care and professional development led her to explore cross-cultural work in Belgium, which again led to similar work in the Congo. Her work in the Congo is particularly reflective of her emphasis on relationships and cooperative assistance. Her friendship with Willy de Craemer, a Belgian priest/sociologist, is given a prominent place in explaining her entry into and work in the Congo. Again, Fox seems to imply that her success is the result of cooperative associations—a point that would be reiterated a few years later as her friendship with Margaret Mead resulted in a long-term post at the University of Pennsylvania. In this instance, Fox is much more explicit: “There is a real sense in which she [Mead] commandingly created such a position for me at the University of Pennsylvania. This is how she made it happen” (p. 232).</p>
<p>The memoir continues through her time as Chair of the Department of Sociology at Penn, groundbreaking work in China with Judith Swazey, broadly cited work in organ donation and medical ethics, as well as several other “anecdotes” such as being knighted by the King of Belgium in 1991. Fox offers a fluid and highly readable account of an incredibly accomplished sociological career; however, the “journey” seems much less about prolific sociological accomplishments and more about the personal relationships that both enable professional success and make an academic career worth living. On these counts, the book is a resounding success.</p>
<p>From a more detached critical perspective however, one is left somewhat wanting. For instance, Fox clearly identifies the colonial context of the Congo as an essential motivation for her work in the region; however, there is a strange lack of discussion of colonial structures themselves. There are allusions to “rebellions” and “exploitative” treatment, but very little on the Belgian and Catholic role in fomenting systemic adversities. To be fair, the subjective emphasis throughout privileges the role of individuals over broader social or structural motivations, so the focus on individual Belgians and Congolese should come as no surprise. The approach does leave one with a snapshot view through the lens of a detached colonial interlocutor with only intermittent critical evaluation of the images.</p>
<p>Even more intriguing is Fox’s treatment of gender throughout the memoir. She regularly notes that her gender was often more of an obstacle during an era of (arguably) more blatant paternal chauvinism. She also notes, with obvious pride, her many instances of being the “first woman” to fill various professional roles. I understand the subjective emphasis of the text—and even admire the tenacity to which she adheres to this approach—but I am dying to know what she really thought. There is a note of recognition and pride in her accomplishments both in terms of quality and relative to her gender; however, we are left without a broader (and more explicit) look at how she understood the restrictive structures of paternal academic cultures. The memoir is marked by references to the “paucity of women” in academic positions and a tantalizing reference to her salary being “lower than the salaries of my male colleagues whose professional status was comparable to mine” (p. 336), but I find myself begging for just a brief respite from the subjective to gain a bit of critical structural analysis of these personal experiences and observations.</p>
<p>On the whole, Fox’s memoir is exactly that. At heart, a collection of subjective memories (copiously supported with relevant evidence, of course) detailing experiences and accomplishments that define a staggering career in sociology. More implicitly, the autobiography chronicles the power and necessity of personal relationships. On a professional level, one cannot help but be fascinated (and not a little envious) at the role networks can play in building and nurturing opportunities. Indeed, it is easy to focus on these relationships and perhaps miss the fact that Fox’s individual skill and capabilities must make these relationships secondary in the grand scheme of things. This is not a text for those hoping for foundational insights into medical sociology or those hoping for a more critical examination of personal experiences, but it would also be disingenuous to imply that that is the overall point.</p>
