<abstract>
<p>In this study, a low carbon cast steel (0.1% C) alloy designed for offshore structures, and the mechanical properties of the alloy under different heat treatment cycles have been evaluated. The effect of austenitizing time on the austenite grain size was studied. Subsequently, the quenched samples with minimum austenite grain size subjected to tempering experiments at different tempering temperatures (450 °C, 550 °C, and 650 °C) and cooling rates (0.23, 36, and 50 °C/s) from the temperature. The results showed that by increasing the austenitizing time, the austenite grain size initially decreased and reached the minimum value with ASTM number of 6.35 and then followed by an increase. When the tempering temperature increased, yield and tensile strengths decreased, whereas the ductility properties improved. In addition, yield and tensile strengths were not affected by cooling rate from tempering temperature, whereas the ductility properties were slightly affected. The increase in tempering temperature significantly led to improvement in the toughness to fracture of the alloy. The effect of cooling rate on impact energy for the samples tempered at 450 °C and 550 °C was negligible. By the contrast, impact energy for the samples tempered at 650 °C was markedly affected by cooling rate, in which the highest value was achieved for a cooling rate of 50 °C/s.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1464420712438502" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>There is a strong drive for exploring oil resources in the deep oceans because of the dramatic rises in oil consumption. Hence, there is a growing demand for offshore structure such as semi-submersible drilling rigs (semi-rigs), tension leg platforms (TLPs), and floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) units.</p>
<p>Offshore structures include enormous numbers of major and minor welded structures. For example, in these structures, brackets are additional structures, which endure stress concentration. These brackets are mostly manufactured from worked steel plates in the shape of a triangle with one free side and two sides welded to columns and girders. On the other hand, when the bracket needs to be reinforced, a face plate, flange, and stiffener are welded to it. Thus, designing and manufacturing of brackets could be very complicated. Furthermore, different types of plate-to-plate connecting parts are used in semi-rigs, TLP and FPSO units. These connecting parts consist of a number of components, which are welded to each other and to the main body of the connector with the aim of reinforcing. Clearly, the structural integrity of an offshore structure is predominantly based upon the performance of its welded joints. The fatigue behaviour of the welded structure is complicated by many factors related to the nature of the welded joints.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464420712438502">1</xref></sup> For instance, the presence of the residual tensile stress and high stress concentrations in welded joints might particularly result in the low fatigue life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464420712438502">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1464420712438502">3</xref></sup> One solution in order to diminish the deleterious effect of a welding process on the structures could be the substitution of a casting steel part for an assembly consists of many welded pieces. This study is an investigation into the design of a low carbon cast steel and the optimal heat treatment process to be used in the offshore structures. The required mechanical properties of offshore structural material are classified according to the different international standards.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464420712438502">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464420712438502">8</xref></sup> However, the chemical composition and/or the heat treatment cycles for steel castings applicable to the offshore structures are not regulated in a special classification.</p>
<p>In this study, initially a low carbon (0.1% C) steel cast alloy is designed. Then, the effects of different heat treatments on the microstructure, the room temperature tensile properties, and the low temperature (−40 °C) impact toughness of the alloy are investigated and the corresponding mechanisms are discussed as well. Finally, the optimum condition resulting in the required properties for the offshore structures is thoroughly discussed.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1464420712438502"><title>Design of the steel</title>
<p>A low carbon steel with the following composition: C (0.10–0.12%), Si (0.45–0.50%), Mn (1.00–1.10%), Cr (0.19–0.20%), Cu (0.20–0.22 %), Mo (0.15–0.018%), Ni (0.5–0.6%), P (&lt;0.03%), and S (&lt;0.02%) was designed. The low content of carbon results in a high weldability of steel. The hardenability of cast steel is greatly affected by the presence of manganese. Manganese also improves ductility and eliminates formation of harmful iron sulphides, which will increase the strength. Chromium forms a variety of carbides and the presence of chromium carbides gives structural steel better corrosion resistance and the ability of softening at elevated temperature. This leads to greater stress rupture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1464420712438502">9</xref></sup> An increase in silicon content to 0.8% leads to an improvement in castability of cast steel. This facilitates the initial fabrication processes of the steel in order to become a feasible commercial product for offshore structures.</p>
<p>In order to achieve a high strength, the initial microstructure of the steel must be martensite with the finest grain size of prior austenite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464420712438502">10</xref></sup> Since the martensite phase is brittle, tempering will result in improvement in toughness to fracture of steel. The tempered lath martensite structure, consists of fine ferrite and carbide particles, provides the desired combination of strength and fracture toughness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464420712438502">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464420712438502">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The weldability of the desired alloy was estimated by applying the calculated carbon equivalent values to the Graville diagram.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464420712438502">13</xref></sup> The carbon equivalents calculated from equations (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1464420712438502">1</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-1464420712438502">2</xref>) varied between 0.415 and 0.455 and 0.490 and 0.539 for the designed alloy, respectively. The corresponding values were well placed in the zone (I) of the Graville diagram representing the safe to weld area; thereby, avoiding the crack formation in the heat affected zone after welding

<sec id="sec5-1464420712438502"><title>Heat treatments</title>
<p>For heat treatment experiments, the specimens with the dimensions of 320 × 30 × 25 mm<sup>3</sup> were machined from the initial W-block. Specimens were subjected to the different heat treatment cycles and cooling methods to modify the microstructure and mechanical properties.</p>
<p>In order to achieve the optimum austenite grain size and structure, the samples were initially austenitized at 920 °C temperature for different holding times (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 and 3 h) and followed by quenching in water at room temperature (will be referred to as-quenched material). Subsequently, the samples were subjected to tempering heat treatment process to improve their toughness to fracture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464420712438502">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464420712438502">15</xref></sup> Tempering was carried out for 2 h and at the tempering temperatures of 450 °C, 550 °C, and 650 °C, which was followed by the various cooling methods from the temperature. The average cooling rates were 0.23, 36 and 50 °C/s for the air cooling, water cooling, and stirred water cooling methods, respectively.</p>
<p>The microstructures of the specimens were examined by means of optical microscopy. The specimens were etched with a 5% Nital enchant (ethyl alcohol + nitric acid (5%)) which was according to the ASTM E 407-07.</p>

<p>The as-cast microstructure of the W-block is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1464420712438502">Figure 2</xref>. The microstructure of the specimen consisted of ferrite (faded white or grey) and the colony of pearlite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464420712438502">16</xref></sup> The decomposition of austenite phase (γ) to ferrite occurs over a wide range of temperatures below the austenite-to-austenite and ferrite-phase boundaries. Ferrite usually nucleates along the austenite–austenite grain boundary. It first grows laterally along the boundary and then can proceed perpendicularly into the austenite grain. However, when the material anneals (reheat) into the γ-region, austenite grains are nucleated at the carbide/ferrite interfaces, which transform to martensite after quenching.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464420712438502">17</xref></sup>

</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1464420712438502"><title>As-quenched microstructure</title>
<p>Quenching carbon steel from γ-region could result in lath martensite and/or plate martensite. However, in steels containing less than about 0.6% C lath martensite would be mainly formed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464420712438502">18</xref></sup> The resulting microstructural features from the austenitizing of the starting material are crucial in achieving the better adaptation of the mechanical properties to the requirements of the treated parts. For example, in order to obtain the maximum toughness after tempering of the as-quenched samples, a grain size of ASTM &gt;6 is required for the prior-austenite resulted from austenitizing.</p>
<p>The microstructures of the as-quenched samples and the variation in the prior-austenite ASTM grain size number (G) after austenitizing for different holding times at 920 °C are shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1464420712438502">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1464420712438502">4</xref>. The image analyses were conducted by means of Lecia Materials Workstation V3.1. The grain size number was determined according to ASTM E 112-96 (Heyn linear intercept procedure). By increasing the holding time, initially, the grain size decreased and reached the finest grain size after holding for 2 h with ASTM number of 6.35. This followed by increase in austenite grain size (decrease in ASTM number) for the longer holding times (2.5 and 3 h). Note that it was very difficult to reveal the prior-austenite grain boundaries at 920 °C as a low austenitization temperature. At this temperature, the prior-austenite grain size is very fine and if allotriomorphic ferrite is formed at austenite grain boundaries, during etching, the fine grains are instantly covered (due to the simultaneous etching of ferrite) and the accurate measurement of fine grains would be very difficult.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464420712438502">19</xref></sup> Therefore, an immense consideration was required in the preparation of metallographic sample and conducting image analyses.

<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1464420712438502">Figure 4</xref>, the initial decreasing trend in grain size might be the unexpected feature since, due to the diffusion nature of austenite formation, a monotonical increase in grain size was expected. In order to thoroughly investigate the reason for this trend, a new concept in the design of experiments for austenite formation should be proposed. However, austenite formation from ferrite–pearlite structure has been widely studied by other investigators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1464420712438502">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464420712438502">21</xref></sup> The reports clearly indicate that there are two major transformation sequences: (a) a rapid pearlite to austenite transformation and (b) a transformation from ferrite phase. Therefore, it could be proposed that the larger austenite grains at early stage (0.5 h holding time) of reheating process resulted from the transformation in pearlite colonies. Subsequently, when the transformation progressed, the nucleation of new austenite grains from ferrite phase gradually led to the decrease in the grain size. Clearly, the nucleation and growth of grains were occurring simultaneously and independently. The finest austenite grain size achieved after 2 h holding time. Further holding (2.5 and 3 h) at 920 °C significantly resulted in the growth of the grains. Note that although holding times of 1 and 1.5 h resulted in a grain size of ASTM above 6, in this study, austenitizing for 2 h selected for further experiments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1464420712438502"><title>Tempering microstructure</title>
<p>The parameters that influence the microstructural features and the mechanical properties of the steel during tempering process are the tempering temperature, the tempering time, the cooling rate from the tempering temperature, and the composition of the alloy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464420712438502">22</xref></sup> In this study, for the designed low carbon steel, the effects of tempering temperature and cooling rate were thoroughly studied. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1464420712438502">Figure 5</xref> illustrates the microstructural evolution during tempering at different temperatures and cooling rates. The martensite structure resulted from the rapid quenching of austenite in iron–carbon alloys is very unstable. Upon tempering, the martensite with the body-centred tetragonal structure decomposed into a mixture of the fine distributed carbide particles and the body centre cubic ferrite phase. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1464420712438502">Figure 5</xref>, by increasing the tempering temperature, the decomposition of the lath martensite structure increased, regardless of the cooling rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464420712438502">17</xref></sup> as inferred from the change in the brightness of the matrix phase; the ferrite grains appeared grey in the micrographs increased by increasing the tempering temperature. This was very evident for the sample tempered at 650 °C. However, it seemed that tempering at 450 °C and 550 °C did not significantly influence the as-quenched structure. Additionally, it was expected that the carbide particles formed at the grain boundaries of the ferrite grains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464420712438502">23</xref></sup> Note that the morphology of the tempered microstructure resembled to the morphology of the as-quenched martensite microstructure. On the other hand, it appeared that the microstructure of tempered martensite was finer with faster cooling rate.

</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1464420712438502"><title>Effect of tempering temperature on the tensile properties</title>
<p>The variation in the tensile properties of the designed low carbon steel at different tempering temperatures and cooling rates are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1464420712438502">Figures 6</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1464420712438502">9</xref> in which the data for the as-quenched and starting material are included for comparison. It is evident that, as the general tendency, there was a decrease in the yield and tensile strengths with an increase in tempering temperature. However, by contrast, the elongation values and reduction in area, presenting the ductility of the designed alloy, significantly increased by increasing the tempering temperature from 450 °C to 650 °C. It is worth mentioning that the highest level of strength obtained for the as-quenched state of the alloy. This is due to the nature of the martensite lath structure (forms upon rapid quenching of austenite) owning a high density of dislocations. During tempering, beside decrease in the number of dislocations and the elimination of the strain energy from the dislocations, there are several structural changes eventually form carbide particles in a ferrite matrix and finally lead to the softening of the martensitic steel. In other words, the pivotal changes in microstructure usually results in the reduction in hardness and tensile and yield strengths, but increase in ductility and toughness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464420712438502">24</xref></sup> The mechanical properties of tempered alloys are principally associated with the size, morphology, and distribution of carbide particles that form, with a fairly slight contribution from the features of ferrite phase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464420712438502">22</xref></sup> The formation of carbides and ferrite phase is a diffusion-controlled process, which enhanced by increasing tempering temperature and consequently led to the variation in tensile properties as mentioned earlier. Tempering at higher temperatures might give rise to the coarsening of the carbide particles and decreasing their total number, thereby significantly reducing the dislocation interaction with carbide particles led to reduction in the yield and tensile strengths.

<p>Yield and tensile strengths of the designed alloy were not influenced by cooling rate. However, the ductility properties of the alloy were slightly affected by cooling rate. The highest elongation and reduction in area values were obtained for stirred water cooling with 50 °C/s cooling rate. By increasing the tempering temperature, for three different cooling rates, the differential between the maximum and minimum ductility properties increased.</p>

<sec id="sec15-1464420712438502"><title>Effect of tempering temperature on impact energy</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1464420712438502">Figure 10</xref>, by increasing tempering temperature from 450 °C to 650 °C, the impact energy values distinctly increased.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1464420712438502">25</xref></sup> Tempering at 450 °C was not effective to improve the fracture toughness as it resulted in the same level of impact energy for the as-quenched samples. This might inferred that the martensite was still heavily dislocated. In addition, the impact energy was not influenced by applying different cooling rates from tempering temperature of 450 °C. A slight increase in impact energy was obtained when tempering temperature increased to 550 °C, where also the highest impact energy resulted from stirred water cooling. Nevertheless, it seemed that the desired effect on the improvement in impact energy was not achieved by tempering at 450 °C and 550 °C. As discussed earlier in “Tempering microstructure” section, after tempering the as-quenched samples at 450 °C and 550 °C, any remarkable change was not observed in the structure of the samples; that is, the reason for the insufficient improvement in impact energy after tempering at theses temperatures. There was a marked sharp increase in the impact energy, when the samples tempered at 650 °C. Furthermore, it was evident that the toughness was greatly affected by cooling rate. In other words, when the alloy was slowly cooled from the tempering temperature at 650 °C, an obvious loss in toughness occurred. This phenomenon is called temper embrittlement and is due to the precipitation of compounds containing trace elements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1464420712438502">20</xref></sup> Note that the desired property for application in the offshore structures, according to the requirement presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1464420712438502">Table 1</xref>, would be achieved only for tempering at 650 °C (over the 27 HV at −40 °C).

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1464420712438502">Figure 11</xref> shows a series of photographs of the fractured impact samples after tempering at different temperatures (stirred water cooling). The fracture surface for the sample tempered at 650 °C featured a macroscopic plastic deformation, which was rough and noticeably ductile in comparison with samples tempered at the lower temperatures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1464420712438502">26</xref></sup> The fractographs of the alloy are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1464420712438502">Figure 12</xref>. All the fractographs featured the similar quasi-cleavage type of fracture. The rare evidence of micro voids (dimples) was also detected. This was much evident for the samples tempered at 650 °C. For samples tempered at 450 °C, despite the very low impact energy indicating a brittle fracture, the presence of micro voids could be attributed to the high dislocation density in the microstructure or/and the carbide particles precipitated during tempering. The dislocations in a similar way to precipitates act as the crack initiation sites and result in the micro void morphology in the fracture surface. In addition, the presence of tear ridge was the distinct feature for samples tempered at 650 °C. The cleavage facets blend into areas of dimple rupture, and cleavage steps become tear ridges.

<list-item><p>A low carbon steel with the combination of high strength and toughness to fracture applicable to offshore structures has been developed.

<list-item><p>For the alloy, on austenitizing, by increasing the holding time, the average grain size of austenite grains initially decreased and reached the minimum value for 2 h holding time. For further holding time 2.5 and 3 h, the average grain size increased.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The yield and tensile strength decreased by increasing the tempering temperatures, which were not affected by cooling rate from the tempering temperature.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The ductility properties and toughness to fracture improved by increasing the tempering temperature. The ductility properties were slightly affected by cooling rate from tempering temperature. On the other hand, toughness to fracture of the alloy was greatly influenced by cooling rate for tempering at 650 °C.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>After tempering, a quasi-cleavage fracture surface was observed for the samples fractured by impact test.</p></list-item>
