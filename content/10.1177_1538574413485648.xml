<title>Objective:</title>
<p>Aneurysm repair is centralized in higher volume centers resulting in reduced mortality, with longer travel distances. The purpose of this study is to explore patients’ preference between local care versus longer distances and lower mortality rates.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) measuring 4 to 5 cm and living at least a 1-hour drive from our hospital were asked to assume it had grown to 5.5 cm, and repair was recommended with a mortality risk of 2%. The level of additional risk they would accept to undergo surgery locally was determined.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results:</title>
<p>A total of 67 patients were surveyed. If mortality risk was equivalent at the local and regional hospitals, 44% preferred care at our tertiary center, while 56% preferred surgery locally. If perioperative mortality was increased at the local hospital, 9% preferred local surgery.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>The vast majority of patients with AAA will accept longer travel distances for care as long as it results in a reduction in perioperative mortality.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The relationship between greater case volumes and lower patient mortality is well documented in elective abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) surgery at individual surgeon<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574413485648">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574413485648"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574413485648">3</xref>
</sup> and hospital<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574413485648">4</xref>
</sup> levels. Higher volume surgeons and hospitals can offer their patients a perioperative survival advantage, or lower mortality rate, following AAA repair compared to lower volume surgeons and hospitals. Coinciding with this in our area, we have observed the progressive centralization of vascular surgery services to higher volume and, most commonly, university-affiliated medical centers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574413485648">5</xref>
</sup> These hospitals and surgeons have been able to achieve very low perioperative mortality rates following AAA repair.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574413485648">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574413485648">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>However, from the patient perspective, centralization has some disadvantages, and there are benefits to local care including proximity to personal support systems, familiar physicians, and continuity of care. In some instances, these benefits may outweigh the promise of a lower perioperative mortality with its required travel and inconveniences.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574413485648">8</xref>
</sup> There are few instances where patient preferences have been explored. In one of the few relevant studies of patient’s preference and proximity of care, close to half of the patients in the United States Veterans Affairs system with a scenario of pancreatic cancer would accept a doubling of mortality risk to have their surgery at a local hospital rather than traveling to a regional hospital.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574413485648">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Although the potential advantages of high AAA volume surgeons and hospitals have been extensively reported, it is not widely known whether patients actually prefer to travel to these regional centers in return for lower perioperative mortality. It appears intuitive to many health care providers that they would, but in some instances the benefits of more local care could outweigh this promise of lower mortality risk with greater travel distances. The purpose of this study was to determine whether patients with AAA would accept a higher risk of mortality to have their elective repairs at a local hospital rather than travel a greater distance to a higher volume, academic center.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1538574413485648" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This study was performed at our university-affiliated medical center in southwestern Ontario, where vascular surgery services are provided for a surrounding population of 1.9 million people. Patients who lived at least a 1-hour drive from our hospital and had infrarenal, asymptomatic AAA’s, measuring 4 to 5 cm in largest diameter were recruited and administered a questionnaire (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1538574413485648">Appendix A</xref>). The inclusion criteria permitted recruitment of patients who were not scheduled to undergo repair in the immediate future so as to minimize the bias of perioperative anxiety but maintained relevance to the intended audience by including patients with the disease process (AAA).</p>
<p>A modification of the standard gamble utility assessment technique<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574413485648">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538574413485648">10</xref>
</sup> was used to determine the level of the additional operative mortality risk patients who would accept to undergo surgery at a local center rather than at our hospital where perioperative mortality is 2% to 3.5%.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574413485648">6</xref>
</sup> This method of utility measurement is subject to good validity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538574413485648">10</xref>
</sup> For the purpose of this study, risk of postoperative mortality at our center was set at 2%. An interviewer-administered survey was used to collect general demographic data and information regarding family and social support as well as the amount of additional risk they would accept to be treated locally.</p>
<p>During the survey, patients were asked to assume that they had a 5.5-cm aneurysm that required repair. In a standardized script, patients were told that AAA repair carries a mortality risk that may differ depending on the treatment hospitals. Patients were asked to choose between having their operation locally, at their closest hospital, or at our center. Preference for method of repair, endovascular or open, was not explored. In the first standard gamble iteration, the patients were asked to choose between their local hospital and ours assuming an operative mortality risk of 2% at both the locations. Using an iterative process, the operative risk at their local hospital was then titrated upward. The upward titration doubled the local operative risk whenever the patient chose their local hospital, and lowered the local operative risk by one-half of the difference between the current and the previous iterations whenever our center was chosen. This continued for each patient until the patient stated, they were indifferent to the choice between their local hospital and our center.</p>
<p>Potential associations between patient characteristics and willingness to travel to our center were explored using both the chi-square and the Fisher exact tests where appropriate. Statistical significance was set at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05. This study received approval from the Western University Ethics Review Board for Research involving Human Subjects.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 67 patients that participated in this study, 87% lived within a 2-hour drive of our tertiary academic center, and 96% lived within a 30-minute drive of their local community hospital. Over half (57%) were from an urban community, and 91% had traveled outside of their home community previously to receive medical care. Patients were more like to be male (78%), and the majority (76%) had been prior patients at our hospital. The great majority (91%) of patients were unwilling to accept any degree of increased risk of perioperative mortality in order to have surgery performed at their local hospital. Of the group willing to accept additional risk to receive local care (9%), 1 patient would accept a 1% increase, 3 patients would accept a 2% increase, 1 patient would accept a 7% increase, and 1 patient would accept a 30% increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574413485648">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Volume outcome relationships have been extensively described in all aspects of vascular surgery, particularly with aneurysm repair.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574413485648">2</xref>
</sup> Although it seems intuitive that patients would value lower perioperative mortality as much as surgeons, the patient preference has not been widely explored. This study suggests that our patients value a lower mortality risk over the inconveniences of travel and, for the most part, would not tolerate any increased mortality risk to have surgery locally. Home support and living with family members and previous care at our center were factors in favor of patients accepting longer travel distances to have aneurysm surgery at our regional center. Having others who live in the home may enable patients to travel further for care by providing transportation or contributing to the financial means by which a patient can arrange travel for care. Patients who have been to our center before are less likely to be intimidated by a new hospital and are then more likely to prefer care at our center.</p>
<p>Patient preference for location of care will likely differ between clinical conditions and among, and between, countries. The demographics of this cohort were representative of our patient population and consistent with a recent report describing a decade of aneurysm repairs at our center.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574413485648">6</xref>
</sup> The reality of our geographic location is that there are more no-volume than low-volume hospitals providing aneurysm care in our surrounding catchment population area of 1.9 million.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574413485648">5</xref>
</sup> Patient acceptance, and preference, for care in regional centers may be unique to such geographic setups and not generalizable to more urban areas even in our own country.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538574413485648">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The difference between urban and rural patients’ preferences for location of care is certainly seen in other countries.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538574413485648">12</xref>
</sup> In the United Kingdom, the great majority (92%) of urban patients living in London would be willing to travel to centers with lower mortality rates and providing endovascular alternatives.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538574413485648">13</xref>
</sup> However, many of these urban citizens already accept long commutes for work and other nonhealth care-related pursuits. In northern England, fewer patients were found to tolerate longer travel distances with more accepting an increased perioperative mortality risk to receive care at their local hospital.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538574413485648">14</xref>
</sup> Although this geographic location is most similar to our own, patient preferences were likely influenced by the availability of local units in England providing quality vascular care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538574413485648">15</xref>
</sup> Deliberate and planned centralization of services has occurred across the United Kingdom, but the issue of “distance decay” remains a challenge, namely that utilization of health care is inversely related to distance from a hospital, thereby differentially affecting rural and urban patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1538574413485648">16</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In some respects, travel distances may not be as much of an issue for patients with aneurysm in the United States. Although geographic distances are large, a generalized dissemination of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) services in the United States offers many patients the opportunity to undergo modern aneurysm care in low-to-mid-volume local centers with favorable outcomes. This trend is reflected in the state of New York, whereby 2002 over half of the hospitals performing EVAR were nonacademic centers, and 50% were performing 5 or fewer procedures annually.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538574413485648">17</xref>
</sup> However, excellent outcomes can be achieved at lower volume US centers and, as with other procedures, such as esophagectomy and pancreatic resection, hospital volume standards can be set without imposing long travel times on patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538574413485648">18</xref>
</sup> This dissemination has resulted in rural Americans having equivalent, and sometimes better, access to EVAR compared to their urban counterparts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538574413485648">19</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The present study enrolled patients with AAAs that were smaller than the widely recognized repair threshold of 5.5 cm prompting questions of bias in patients’ survey responses. Specifically, patients might feel an obligation to state a preference for treatment at our center, where they would eventually receive care if it became necessary. We believe that this set of inclusion criteria introduced the lowest level of bias possible because patients with larger aneurysms who were awaiting repair would be even more apt to choose our hospital. The inclusion of postoperative patients would introduce another level of bias as such discussions are less relevant to those who have avoided perioperative mortality. A similarly designed survey regarding pancreatic cancer surgery displays the disadvantages of including patients without the disease in question. Some patients were willing to accept perioperative mortality rates as high as 100% to have care at their local hospital, suggesting a level of disconnect between the patient population and the scenario they were asked to consider.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574413485648">9</xref>
</sup> Selecting patients with smaller aneurysms ensured that the survey was relevant to this patient population, without the bias inherent in the perioperative period.</p>
<p>Regionalization of AAA care is a reality in the current era of vascular surgery in North America.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538574413485648">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538574413485648">19</xref>
</sup> Although this trend can provide mortality benefits, patient perspective is an important consideration when analyzing the impact of health care regionalization plans. Given the acuity of disease in many patients with vascular surgery, strict regionalization may leave rural community hospitals ill equipped to deal with urgent cases, such as AAA ruptures. In addition, elective wait times will lengthen if large number of patients are transferred to a smaller number of centers without the necessary resources allocated to treat them in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>Ideally, health care provision strategies, including those involving aneurysm care, should involve the coordination of large tertiary institutions, smaller centers, physicians, other health care providers, and policy makers in their respective geographic location. As this study demonstrates, the patients can also offer valuable input into these strategies and should be involved in such discussions.</p>

<p>You are now going to be asked a couple of questions about where you would want your aneurysm repaired if it had grown to the size range for repair to be recommended.</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>You are going to have an operation to repair your aneurysm. Risk of death at London Health Sciences Centre and your local hospital is 2%. Where would you prefer to have your aneurysm repaired? (circle one)<list list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item>
<p>LHSC</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Local hospital</p>

<p>If the risk of death at LHSC was 2% and it was 4% at your local hospital, where would you prefer to have your aneurysm repaired? (circle one)<list list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item>
<p>LHSC</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Local hospital</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The survey administrator will continue with the upward titration that involves doubling the local operative risk whenever the patient chooses their local hospital and lowering the local operative risk by one-half of the difference between the current and previous iterations whenever LHSC is chosen. This continues for each patient until the patient states that they are indifferent to the choice between their local hospital and LHSC.</p>
