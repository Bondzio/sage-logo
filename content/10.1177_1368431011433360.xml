<p>This is an extremely ambitious book. Its point of departure is that the study of the origins, status and functions of constitutions was a central element of early sociology. It is argued that classical sociological scholars such as Tönnies, Durkheim and Weber initiated a break with the normative ideals of the Enlightenment and established the defining features of a positive-descriptive political sociology through the study of constitutions. The strong centrality of the study of constitutions in political sociology, however, drastically declined in the post-war period. Instead, constitutional theory and practice became dominated by formalist-normative approaches developed within the realm of legal and political philosophy. The book is aimed at turning this development around by introducing a fully-fledged empirically founded, essentially positivist, sociological theory of constitutions capable of re-establishing constitutional sociology as a specific sub-discipline within law, politics and sociology. Or, as expressed by the author, “the book … contains the implicit argument that the original sociological attack on the normative analyses of the Enlightenment needs to be re-initiated” (p. 8) because “the constitutional structure of society and the legitimacy of political institutions can be illuminated only weakly by normative analysis. In fact, normative analysis is incapable of illuminating that object which it has made its most common analytical focus: rights-based constitutional legitimacy” (p.8).</p>
<p>This attack on formalist-normative analysis, today typically associated with different strands of Rawlsianism, is carried out with the help of an approach which the author characterises as historical functionalism, where constitutions are seen as the result of historical processes at the same time as they serve as devices that regulate the functional set-up of societies through the condensation of legal norms. This makes the normative dimension of society the primary object of study in the sense that the author develops a <italic>sociological-descriptive</italic> theory of (legal) norms and the structural reliance on norms within social formations such as states. In contrast to formalist-normative approaches the author, however, advances an understanding of norms as <italic>objective institutions</italic> which are generated by inner-societal dynamics and functionally delineated evolutionary processes.</p>
<p>But the author also opens up a second front through a dismissal of Marxist- and Foucauldian-inspired perspectives on political power. The author advances a specific, Luhmann-inspired, theory of political power, that relies on a sharp distinction between social power or coercion and political power. Political power is seen as a functional process which is merely connected to a distinct set of institutions, just as the production of political power is seen as related to a rather limited number of social objectives. The multiplication and densification of political power in modern societies is furthermore conditioned by its increased abstraction and differentiation from, for example, aesthetic, religious or economic exchanges. This approach allows for an understanding of political power as an autonomous facility, thereby making it an independent object of study.</p>
<p>Although the Luhmannian inspiration is clear, the book is not providing an outright application of Luhmann’s theory. Rather, the Luhmannian insights serve as a more general source of inspiration. Furthermore, in contrast to the late Luhmann, associated with the theory of autopoiesis and post-structuralism, the author has a clear preference for the works of the early Luhmann, which are more directly embedded in the classical sociological canon. Thus, as a result of a lack of translations, he is very much relying on Luhmannian insights which have, so far, not gained widespread attention in the English reading world. Further, a central difference to Luhmann is that the author clearly operates within a historical-sociological tradition that is, methodologically, markedly different than the conceptual history approach which Luhmann relied on. The specific theory concerning the emergence of totalitarian regimes which the author develops (see beneath) furthermore fills a gap in so far as Luhmann never undertook a systematic analysis of the origins of totalitarianism.</p>
<p>The book advances a dual approach in the sense that it seeks to establish a conceptual, as well as empirical, link between, on the one hand, the development of (legal) norms and, on the other hand, political power through an invoking of an elaborated concept of constitutions, as well as a reconstruction of the factual evolution of constitutions. According to the author, constitutions are characterised by the following four propositions: firstly, they express a framework for public rule in accordance with legal principles which cannot be easily suspended; secondly, they restrict the use of public power, as well as private coercion; thirdly, they distribute power within the state through recourse to some sort of representation of the wider society within the state; and, fourthly, they introduce a legal distinction between office and persons holding office. More generally, constitutions thereby become the central instrument through which a double stabilisation is achieved: constitutions simultaneously provide a basis for the internal stabilisation of states, understood as entities which are distinct from the rest of society and an alleviation of relations between states and the societal terrains in which they are located. Moreover, these two functions, it is argued, are mutually constitutive in the sense that the internal stabilisation of the state, established mainly through a maintenance of the distinction between the state and the wider society, is seen as a condition for increased inclusion of societal actors in the state and vice versa. Thus, the condition for the opening of the state vis-à-vis the wider society is its factual separation from society. It is here that the linking of power and law through constitutions becomes pivotal: the reliance on law allows states to introduce internal limitations to the exercise of power which counters tendencies to succumb society in its entirety to political power. Moreover, legal rights are deployed as filters which frame the transfer of social exchanges between the state and the rest of society thereby reducing such transfers to specific functionally defined social issues.</p>
<p>The vast majority of the book is, however, not devoted to a purely conceptual exercise. Instead, the author undertakes a meticulous historical reconstruction of the evolution of constitutional structures which he combines with a multitude of analyses of specific constitutional texts. This reconstructive analysis has a breathtaking scope compromising constitutional developments in almost the entire European context from the Middle Ages, over the emergences of early modern European states, the late 18th and early 19th century revolutionary époque, to the era of heightened imperialism in the Belle Époque and the subsequent emergence of totalitarianism, culminating in the post-totalitarian transitional constitutions that emerged in western Europe (e.g. Italy, The German Federal Republic, Portugal and Spain) in the post-war period, and in Central and Eastern Europe following the fall of the Berlin Wall. In addition, the book is garnished with an excursus to the constitutional development of the USA in its founding period.</p>
<p>At first glance, the scope of the historical reconstruction triggered certain scepticism by this reviewer. With 376 pages of core text, the many concrete historical analyses are necessarily unfolded over a rather limited number of pages, thereby making sketchiness and superficiality an obvious risk. Intermittently that is, indeed, the case. For example, the analysis of Swedish constitutional developments is unfolded over a handful of pages (pp. 134–7 and 168–71), just as Greece is granted half a page (pp. 243–4). Generally, however, it is clear that the author is extremely well-read and knows the material in detail despite the immense complexity of the subject matter. The concrete analyses undertaken are furthermore linked to specific points dominating the debates on constitutional development within the variety of historical contexts which the book examines. It is impossible, in the form of this review, to address all the analyses provided. But four illustrative examples can be brought to the fore.</p>
<p>Firstly, the author argues against the idea that deep ruptures took place fundamentally transforming the constitutional structures characterising early modernity when compared with the late Middle Ages. Similarly, it is argued that the classical modern period from the early 19th century onwards did not emerge through a singular revolutionary break with early modern constitutional setups. Instead, a process-oriented perspective is invoked. The argument is, however, not that no changes can be observed. Rather, the point advanced is that generalised political power has always been confronted with privatistic and localistic forms of social ordering of an essentially feudal nature and that the switch towards an increased dominance of a specifically modern form of political power was far more protracted than typically assumed, just as the historical evolution of European societies over and over again has shown itself vulnerable to the re-emergence of (neo-)feudalistic structures, thereby indicating that the integrity of the modern state is fundamentally precarious.</p>
<p>Secondly, and closely linked to the first point that the successful emergence of modern states characterised by high level of abstraction and differentiation, has been far more limited than typically assumed. For example, the author launches the thesis that neither France nor Prussia, as assumed in many strands of the historical-sociological literature, gained fortified features of modern statehood in early modernity. In both cases, the emerging state did not succeed in eradicating private forms of countervailing power throughout society. The absolutist states in continental Europe remained characterised by limited constitutional maturity and lateral semi-patrimonial counterweights remained of great importance. In the case of France, outright state supremacy was first gradually established in the post-revolutionary period and, in the Prussian-German area, such supremacy did not emerge before the successful stabilisation of the German Federal Republic in the mid-20th century. The well-established thesis that France and Prussia were prime examples of ‘strong statehood’ is thus decisively refuted. Instead, the author’s native England (and, to a certain extent, also the Dutch Republic) is being presented as the ultimate case of strong statehood in early modernity because it was the only state at the time which successfully internalised social forces which had previously operated outside the state. This was made possible because it was the only early-modern European state which, through constitutional arrangements, was capable of developing a coherent normative self-understanding and acquiring a unitary set of legal procedures regulating the access to, and use of, political power.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the book advances a particular theory of legal rights and grants rights a far more constitutive role for the stabilisation of society when compared with competing approaches. It is argued that the semantics of nation and nationhood are secondary appearances, which first gained force after the emergence of elaborated rights regimes. It was through rights, especially through a clear distinction between public and private rights, that states separated themselves from the wider society and transformed constitutions into purely internal state constitutions. Thus, the semantics of nationhood only gained substantial force in the mid-19th century, at a time where elaborated, although still fragile, rights regimes had emerged. This historically-founded argument in favour of liberal rights rather than republican politics as the main driver of successful state building is furthermore taken up in the final chapter, where the transitional post-totalitarian constitutions are analysed on the basis of the argument that constitutional courts, and not parliaments, were the central institutional sites where the successful transformation of totalitarian states into democratic states of law unfolded.</p>
<p>Fourthly, the book advances a specific theory concerning the emergence of totalitarianism in the first half of the 20th century. The author argues that it was only during the course of the First World War that most European societies achieved the defining characteristics of modern statehood in the sense that European societies first then became fundamentally centred on state power. The dramatic expansion of state power during the war, however, had fundamentally fatal consequences because the result, in many European settings, was a suspension of the juridical patterns of self-restriction characterising modern statehood. Thus, the tragedy of modern European statehood was that it imploded in the moment of its realisation. The breakdown of the rights-based filters which ensured that societal conflicts were merely incorporated into the state in a limited and measured manner, ultimately led to a destabilisation of the state in many European settings and to the emergence of neo-feudal forms of power through reliance on collective rights. Consequently, the distinction between state and the wider society broke down and was replaced with highly arbitrary and essentially semi-feudal forms of social relations. The emergence of totalitarianism did not, therefore, imply a move towards a strong state but rather dissolution of the state altogether.</p>
<p>A number of critical points can be made, however. This reviewer would have, for example, liked to see a more detailed unfolding of the theory of constitutions introduced in the introductory chapter. The perspective advanced by the author challenges the majority of existing scholarly positions on the subject matter and a more direct and detailed refusal and criticism of competing position would have been an interesting read. It was also surprising to see that conceptual history and genealogical approaches and methodology of the kind which one, in substantially different variants, can find by Foucault, Koselleck and Skinner are not taken into consideration. The author may have specific reasons for that, but revealing those reasons to the readers would have been helpful. Another interesting question is whether the perspective proposed is generelisable to the extent that the author seems to suggest. In the Introduction, the author, however, promises two follow up books dealing with constitutions in inter- and transnational settings and with post-colonial constitutionalism, respectively. This reviewer will look forward to see how well the intended extrapolation will be able to carry itself. That said, Thornhill’s work can only be considered truly impressive. It is very rare that one comes across a book which opens up an entirely new field while challenging essentially all existing approaches in such a convincing, elegant and scrupulous manner. Most proponents of alternative positions are likely to find the foundations of their own work seriously challenged, just as the book is likely to dominate the field for many years to come. This makes the book an absolute must for any serious scholar interested in constitutional sociology and theory. Thornhill has casted a gauntlet which deserves to be picked up.</p>
