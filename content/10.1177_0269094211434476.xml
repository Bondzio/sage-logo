<abstract>
<p>Comparing VAT registration data with Scottish Clearing Bank Statistics on new start-up activity we assess the extent to which VAT registration data reflect the general level of start-up activity in the Scottish economy for the period 2002–2009. Findings reveal that VAT registration data underestimate the general level of start-up activity by 39%. The data also reveal there is considerable spatial variation in start-up activity across Scottish regions and the recent recession has affected start-up activity irrespective of which measure is used. It is also clear, however, that the recession has affected the general level of start-up activity to a far greater extent.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0269094211434476" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Future prosperity is driven by economic growth and the extent of this growth is largely determined by the level of entrepreneurship that exists within a society. It is not, therefore, surprising that a number of studies have identified links between economic growth and corresponding levels of entrepreneurship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269094211434476">Audretsch and Keilbach, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269094211434476">Lee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0269094211434476">Valliere and Peterson, 2009</xref>). <?twb?>Indeed as a result of the perceived importance of entrepreneurship and its role in driving growth, entrepreneurship policy has been placed high on the agenda of both national and regional authorities throughout the world in both developed and developing countries. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0269094211434476">Scottish Enterprise (2008)</xref> highlight there are positive links between high levels of entrepreneurship and more rapid levels of growth, stressing that between 1999 and 2002 of the 559,000 jobs created, one quarter were created through new firm formation. Furthermore, according to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0269094211434476">Scottish Government (2010)</xref> the total number of private sector enterprises in Scotland was 296,780 in 2010, with small enterprises accounting for 99% of all enterprises and 53% of employment. However, the Fraser of Allander Institute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0269094211434476">University of Strathclyde, 2009</xref>: 9) report ‘domestic business birth rate remains stubbornly low and business R&amp;D is amongst the lowest in the world’. The aforementioned relationship between entrepreneurship and economic growth may explain why the Scottish economy has underperformed relative to both the UK and smaller benchmark countries including Ireland and Norway. Over a 30-year period Scotland’s annual average growth rate in GDP was 1.8%, significantly below the UK average of 2.3%, while growth in Ireland has been three times as high and twice as high in Norway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269094211434476">Scottish Government, 2007</xref>: 10). Moreover, recent data show rates of entrepreneurial activity in Scotland have only been 55% and 60% of those experienced in Ireland and Norway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269094211434476">Levie, 2009</xref>). The Scottish First Minister states ‘a low growth economy is a concern… [i]t affects our job opportunities, our incomes and the aspirations of our young people’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269094211434476">Scottish Government, 2007</xref>: 5).</p>
<p>While economic growth and productivity are linked to regional levels of entrepreneurship, the rate at which regions are able to generate new firms will determine the extent of this growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269094211434476">Bruce et al., 2009</xref>). Consequently this may adversely affect levels of economic growth, employment and regional competitiveness in Scotland and its ability to achieve long term prosperity and sustainable development.</p>
<p>As a consequence of the role entrepreneurship plays in economic growth, job creation and investment entrepreneurship can have a much wider impact on the social fabric that underpins a society and therefore polices to promote and encourage dynamic innovation-driven regions are crucial for future prosperity and sustainable development. However, before any policies can realistically be implemented it is crucial that entrepreneurship is measured accurately in order to determine appropriate policy for promoting a strong entrepreneurial environment.</p>
<p>Building on the earlier work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269094211434476">Ball (2007)</xref> using VAT registration statistics (the official government measure of entrepreneurship in Scotland) and comparing these for the first time with Scottish Clearing Bank Statistics (SCBS) we assess the extent to which VAT registration statistics accurately represent new entrepreneurial activity in Scotland. In the interests of policy making we also outline the relative strengths and weaknesses of each data set. The article also provides a timely spatial analysis of entrepreneurial activity in Scotland taking account of the recent global recession and its impact on Scottish entrepreneurial activity. In addition, to the best of the authors’ knowledge this is the first article to compare VAT registration and SCBS data over the given time period. Finally, given the small size and geographical position of Scotland, the article also adds to the limited amount of literature addressing entrepreneurial activity in both Scotland and other small and peripheral countries. The article is structured as follows: the second and third sections present a review of the literature explaining what entrepreneurship is and the impact of new firms, the fourth ‘Methodology’ considers the data and method, the ‘Findings’ section identifies regional variations in entrepreneurship and how representative VAT registration data are as a measure of entrepreneurship, while the concluding section offers recommendations for further research.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0269094211434476"><title>What is entrepreneurship?</title>
<p>Ever since the seminal work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269094211434476">Birch (1981</xref>: 8) who stated: ‘Whatever else they are doing, large firms are no longer the major provider of new jobs for Americans’, entrepreneurship has been recognised as a key driver of economic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269094211434476">Audretsch and Keilbach, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269094211434476">Lee et al., 2004</xref>). The creation of an entrepreneurial spirit can stimulate competitiveness, creating dynamic national, regional and provincial economies. Furthermore, it is those countries with an entrepreneurial spirit that have tended to flourish in the late 20th century. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0269094211434476">US Department of Commerce (2007</xref>: 3) states: ‘Entrepreneurs are the engine for America’s economic growth, and innovation [is] the fuel for that engine’. It further substantiates (p. 7) the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269094211434476">Birch (1981)</xref> reporting that:<disp-quote>
<p>small businesses provide approximately 75% of the net jobs added to the American economy, and represent over 99% of all our employers. The growth in our economy is in very large part due to entrepreneurs – that’s where the job growth is coming from… it’s not from big companies.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0269094211434476">Scottish Enterprise (2008)</xref> highlights the fact that there are positive links between high levels of entrepreneurship and more rapid levels of growth, while the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0269094211434476">OECD (2009</xref>: 5) reports: ‘entrepreneurs play a significant role in all economies and are key agents of employment, innovation and growth’. Through new firm formation entrepreneurship fosters a spirit of innovation and competition when firms enter a market with a new product or service. If these new firms are more efficient than existing firms, then productivity will increase and existing firms will be compelled to innovate or imitate new firms’ practices or face becoming uncompetitive and ultimately replaced. Therefore, although widely accepted that entrepreneurship is a vital driver of economic growth in developed economies as a consequence of its contribution to job creation, innovation and productivity growth, there is, however, little or no consensus as to what constitutes entrepreneurship. As a result defining and explaining entrepreneurship is one of the most complex elements of its study, yet not being able to define entrepreneurship is not to understand or learn what its contribution is to society.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0269094211434476">Peneder (2009)</xref> suggests the difficulty in precisely defining entrepreneurship is a result of the weight of the functions for which it is held responsible. Indeed traditional neoclassical economic theory portrays the firm as a black box that transforms inputs into outputs with the aim of maximising profits whereby there is little, if any scope for the entrepreneurial agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269094211434476">Crossan, 2010</xref>). However, Peneder emphasises that the definition of entrepreneurship will be dependent upon the particular scholarly perspective or emphasis on which it is being examined at any given time, although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0269094211434476">Shane and Venkataraman (2000)</xref> argue that in the end entrepreneurship is broadly concerned about the creation and discovery of commercial opportunities.</p>
<p>The lack of a precise definition means entrepreneurship literature is wide and varied, ranging from entrepreneurship as the setting up of a new business, becoming the owner-manager of a business, taking advantage of an opportunity, commercially exploiting an innovation and transforming an existing company or organisation – sometimes known as intrapreneurship. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269094211434476">European Commission (2003)</xref> portrays entrepreneurship as a mindset, concerning an individual’s motivation and the capacity, through either the creation of a new business or endogenously from within an existing business to first identify and second pursue a new idea, which adds new value or economic success. Entrepreneurship is about the ability to create and innovate, first as a means to enter a market and second as a means to adapt and remain competitive throughout a firm’s life cycle. Entrepreneurship concerns the process and choices individuals make in deciding when and how to enter a market. Entrepreneurs are a non-conformist group spanning all sections of society. Transcending all sections of society from the lowest social class with little or no formal qualifications, to those of the privileged class possessing qualifications from the most distinguished of institutions, all entrepreneurs possess certain common characteristics and traits. The entrepreneur is a risk taker and creative venturer, who possesses independence and imaginative qualities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269094211434476">European Commission, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269094211434476">Hebert and Link, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269094211434476">OECD, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0269094211434476">Shane and Venkataraman, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269094211434476">Ahmed and McQuaid (2005)</xref> suggest entrepreneurship is an elusive concept, reflecting the diverse number of disciplines that it crosses, indicating that entrepreneurship means different things to different people. At a policy level entrepreneurship is more often seen as the creation of a new firm, while from an academic perspective the entrepreneur can be viewed as fulfilling a specific function within the economy, through the introduction of a new innovation (Shumpeter, 1934), as a resource allocator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269094211434476">Kirzner, 1979</xref>) or as the bearer of uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269094211434476">Knight, 1921</xref>), rewarded by the residual income that their endeavours generate. From this brief summary alone we can see entrepreneurship means different things to different people, but ultimately entrepreneurs are game changers who make an impact and this is often achieved through the creation of a new firm.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0269094211434476"><title>Impact of new entrepreneurial firms</title>
<p>The impacts of new firm formation have been widely explored<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0269094211434476">1</xref></sup>and few dispute the positive impacts that entrepreneurship can have on both national and regional economies in developed and developing countries. Since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269094211434476">Birch (1981)</xref> reported that the majority of jobs are created by small businesses and not large ones, the interest shown in entrepreneurship by governments and supranational institutions has grown rapidly, as a result of the actual and perceived economic impacts. It is true that these impacts go beyond economics, affecting the social environment in which individuals and firms are located, creating both positive and negative externalities, yet ‘almost without exception, academic studies on entrepreneurship are motivated by the economic benefits’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0269094211434476">van Praag and Versloot, 2007</xref>: 351).</p>
<p>Studies assessing the economic impact of entrepreneurship are largely categorised into three subcategories, to include the effects on employment, innovation and productivity (growth). In relation to employment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269094211434476">Baldwin (1998)</xref> like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269094211434476">Birch (1981)</xref> confirms that small size manufacturing firms had a higher share of employment growth than larger size plants. Although larger plants showed a decreasing level of employment growth, they did maintain their levels of output, while labour productivity fell for smaller firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269094211434476">Baldwin, 1998</xref>). More recent studies at the regional level identified that higher start-up rates lead to higher employment creation both directly and indirectly in the long run (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094211434476">Acs and Mueller, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269094211434476">Baptista et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269094211434476">Fritsch and Mueller, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0269094211434476">van Stel and Suddle, 2008</xref>). The aforementioned studies identify that higher start-up rates are strongly associated with levels of employment in the short run, yet as a result of creative destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0269094211434476">Schumpeter, 1934</xref>) and competitive pressure from new firms, the relationship with employment growth declines, as inefficient firms reduce employee numbers to remain competitive or exit the market, yet in the long run the net gain is positive due to increased competition, ensuring firms increase levels of productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0269094211434476">van Stel and Suddle, 2008</xref>). In general empirical studies show that smaller entrepreneurial firms grow faster and generate higher levels of employment than older larger firms. However, while there is evidence to suggest smaller entrepreneurial firms do create more jobs than both high growth firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094211434476">Botham and Graves, 2011</xref>) and larger longer established firms, entrepreneurial jobs in new smaller firms can be lowered paid, less secure and more volatile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0269094211434476">van Stel and Suddle, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269094211434476">Malchow-Moller, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The contribution that entrepreneurs make to innovation is less evident than the effects associated with employment. When assessing quantity and quality of innovations, research expenditures are considered important inputs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269094211434476">Castany et al. (2005)</xref> find that large Spanish firms invest 2.5 times more resources on R&amp;D than smaller firms, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269094211434476">Arvanitis (1997)</xref> finds contradictory evidence, whereby research and development expenditures per employee are the same between small and large companies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0269094211434476">Yang and Huang (2005)</xref> suggest smaller firms generate higher growth the higher the R&amp;D spend, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0269094211434476">van Praag and Versloot (2007</xref>: 363) indicate that ‘each dollar spent on R&amp;D in a small firm is more valuable than a dollar spent in a large firm’.</p>
<p>Patents also act as a proxy for a firm’s level of innovation. Research suggests that larger firms are more likely to introduce more innovations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269094211434476">Huergo and Jaumandreu, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269094211434476">Love and Ashcroft, 1999</xref>). However, this is not surprising as larger firms especially in manufacturing are more likely to have a larger number of product lines to improve upon. However, to further emphasise the ambiguity concerning entrepreneurs and innovations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269094211434476">Love and Ashcroft (1999)</xref> considered the effect of innovation per employee and found that innovation per employee actually decreases with a firm’s size. Therefore, ‘smaller plants are indeed more “innovation intensive” than their larger counterparts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269094211434476">Love and Ashcroft, 1999</xref>: 107), suggesting that smaller plants may well produce less innovations overall compared with larger plants, but are actually more efficient than larger firms when producing innovations.</p>
<p>Finally, the entrepreneur’s contribution to productivity and growth is measured by the components of GDP, namely, total value added and labour and factor productivity. Distinctions between levels of GDP and growth of GDP are important, as studies have paid more attention to the growth of value added and productivity, opposed to their relative levels. In terms of labour productivity, studies suggest that entrepreneurs generally do not have higher productivity levels or are at least equal to their counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269094211434476">Brouwer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269094211434476">Foster et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269094211434476">Jensen et al., 2001</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269094211434476">Disney et al. (2003)</xref> find that younger firms show higher levels of labour productivity with respect to output per person per hour than older firms. In addition, total factor productivity, a combination of output per unit of labour and capital combined, highlights that entrepreneurs are no more productive than their counterparts (Brouwer et al., 2005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269094211434476">Castany et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0269094211434476">Nquyen and Lee, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Impacts related to growth of value added and productivity have been studied most extensively and a number of studies report that entrepreneurs make a positive contribution to growth of value added, whereby size relates negatively to value added growth (Brouwer et al., 2005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269094211434476">Carree, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269094211434476">Carreee and Thurik, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269094211434476">Robbins et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269094211434476">Rodriguez et al., 2003</xref>). This may explain why small firms have become increasingly dominant in economic activity and why a shift towards small firms has led to higher levels of growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269094211434476">Carree, 2002</xref>). Research (Brouwer et al., 2005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269094211434476">Carree and Thurik, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269094211434476">Disney et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269094211434476">Robbins et al., 2000</xref>) supports that labour productivity and total factor productivity growth are positively related to small firms compared with their larger counterparts. Therefore, we conclude that although entrepreneurs do not display higher levels of productivity than non-entrepreneurial firms, they do tend to display higher levels of efficiency and a greater degree of economic growth than their larger counterparts.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0269094211434476" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="sec5-0269094211434476"><title>Unit of analysis</title>
<p>The unit of analysis is the local authority council region, as this is the most spatially disaggregated level at which to investigate the local environment for entrepreneurship in Scotland. Alternative options include utilising NUTS 2 data. However, the major weakness of these data in the case of Scotland is the failure to account for the entrepreneur’s local environment because of the degree of aggregation and the limited number of NUTS 2 regions. Scotland is comprised of four NUTS 2 regions, making its space economy difficult to interpret – demonstrated by the NUTS 2 Eastern Scotland region having a northern border touching the North Eastern Scotland region best approximated by the location of Aberdeen, and a southern border tangentially resting on the Scotland/England border. NUTS 3 regions would be more appropriate, but in Scotland these do not correspond fully with either of the data sets used in this study. A potential limitation of the degree of disaggregation at the local authority level may mean that while one region appears to have low levels of entrepreneurship relative to its population, this may not actually be the case, as entrepreneurs may live in one region, but run their business in another.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0269094211434476"><title>Data</title>
<p>The VAT register is the most comprehensive measure of new firm formation statistics available in the UK and has been employed in a number of related studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269094211434476">Ashcroft et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269094211434476">Gleave and Mitra, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269094211434476">Keeble and Walker, 1994</xref>). The number of VAT registrations in a region indicates the general health of a business population and in addition to being used in academic studies is widely used in regional and local planning to examine the number of new entrants into the UK economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269094211434476">Ball, 2007</xref>). For the purposes of this study the VAT register provides annual data to map patterns and trends of entrepreneurial activity from 2002 to 2009 in Scotland. It should also be noted that from 2008 VAT data were subject to a methodological change, as a result of regulatory changes implemented by Eurostat, requiring the ONS to include PAYE firms. This means that the historical VAT register no longer exists, as it must now include firms that are not only VAT registered, but are also employers, even if they are below the VAT threshold. Therefore, while the new Business Demography database is more representative of the wider business population, it is less consistent in that while it includes PAYE firms, those firms need not pass the VAT threshold. As a result the Business Demography database must be treated with some caution when merging pre- and post-2008 VAT data.</p>
<p>With over 2 million listed businesses the VAT register represents nearly 99% of UK economic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0269094211434476">Office for National Statistics, 2011</xref>). However, the IDBR (Inter-Departmental Business Register) estimates there are 4.3 million enterprises in the UK. Therefore, while VAT registration and deregistration do provide trends for start-up and closures, they are likely to underestimate the total number of starts and closures and as a result should be treated with some caution. There are a number of issues with using VAT registrations as a measure of new firm start-up rates. First, and most significantly, a large number of new firms will not pass the VAT threshold of £73,000 and will therefore not register for VAT and will not be classified as new firms. This is an important observation given that some recent evidence suggests the majority of new jobs are created by small firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094211434476">Botham and Graves, 2011</xref>) and new small firms are the source of creative destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269094211434476">Derbyshire and Haywood, 2009</xref>), yet many of these new firms do not officially exist because they do not surpass the VAT threshold. It has been estimated that only one in every two new firms registers for VAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269094211434476">Mason, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0269094211434476">Storey, 2002</xref>). Firms have an incentive not to register for VAT thus avoiding the cost of administering the collection and payment of such a tax and the idea that small firms underestimate their turnover by using cash payment is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269094211434476">Keen and Smith, 2007</xref>). When a new firm registers for VAT there is also evidence to suggest that there is often a significant lag between it starting to trade and registering for VAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269094211434476">Johnson and Conway, 1997</xref>). There are also issues around firms that trade in non-rated goods (e.g. book companies, the producers of food and children’s clothing firms) and others whose business is focused primarily on the employment of labour, for example construction; these firms often do not register for VAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269094211434476">Keeble, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0269094211434476">Westhead and Moyes, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition the VAT register is quantity driven, failing to distinguish between type and motivation of the entrepreneur. As a result researchers employing the VAT register are operationally constrained to adopting Gartner’s definition of entrepreneurship as anybody who starts a business. Therefore, VAT registration is not synonymous with business births and deaths, as registration includes businesses which have been trading previously but have only just crossed the VAT threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269094211434476">Campbell, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269094211434476">Johnson and Conway (1997)</xref> also highlight that VAT registration may not be the result of a new business, but rather a reorganisation, change in ownership or business acquisition. However, they also state that the ‘relative comprehensiveness, their “official” status, and the regularity with which they are collected, give them a powerful advantage, despite their limitations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269094211434476">Johnson and Conway, 1997</xref>: 408). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269094211434476">Keeble and Walker (1994: 413)</xref> acknowledge the limitations of the data but, also state the data ‘represents the most up-to-date, comprehensive, reasonably long-term and spatially disaggregated data source currently available for such investigation’. The register also captures companies which exceed a certain annual turnover threshold, which acts as a proxy for both company size and growth potential. In general the main advantage of making use of this data set is that it is unobtrusive and can provide comparative and contextual data at a number of disaggregated levels including: the UK, country, by Government Office Region, Broad Industry, Parliamentary Constituency, SIC (3-digit), county and district.</p>
<p>However, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269094211434476">Ball (2007)</xref> claims to offer a comprehensive comparison of both actual new firm formations and VAT registrations on a sample of new firm start-ups in Glamorgan, Wales in the 1980s, this is unlikely to be the case for a number of reasons. First, new firms were identified largely through their interaction with government bodies (Welsh Development Agency etc.). Although there is some evidence to suggest that most new firms do contact these agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269094211434476">Griffiths, 1986</xref>), there is also a body of evidence that refutes this claim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0269094211434476">Storey, 2002</xref>). Second, by his own admission Ball uses his own ‘unique’ and ‘original’ definition of a new firm, resulting in many actual new firms being excluded from the sample on the basis of an arbitrary definition. Third, given that Ball only applies his analysis to one Welsh region, the results are not representative and nor can they be generalised. Furthermore, because of the one-region constraint, Ball is unable to offer an insight into whether there are any differences in the accuracy of VAT data between different types of regions including urban and rural. Fourth, Ball uses a combination of primary and secondary sources to create a data set that has no official status, that would be difficult to replicate and that does not allow for comparison over time. Fifth, the study employed a data set that was almost three decades out of date, raising some doubt about its appropriateness and validity for current policy making.</p>
<p>On the basis of the aforementioned limitations we would question both the method and type of data Ball has used to assess the validity of VAT registration statistics as an accurate indicator of new firm formation. The alternative measure of new entrepreneurial activity employed in this study is the start-up statistics provided by the Committee of Scottish Clearing Banks (SCBS),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0269094211434476">2</xref></sup> which estimate all new business activity based on business bank account openings in Scotland’s four major clearing banks. The main advantage of using SCBS data is that they may act as a better general indicator of total entrepreneurial activity in the Scottish economy when compared with VAT registration data. This is particularly the case with smaller businesses that are excluded from the VAT register because they do not pass the VAT threshold or trade in non-VAT rated goods. Furthermore, comparing both VAT and SCBS data allows us to provide a spatial analysis of entrepreneurial activity in all regions distinguishing between urban and rural, allowing policymakers to make like for like comparisons over time given the longitudinal nature of both data sets. However, the main disadvantage of SCBS data is the opportunity for overestimating actual levels of new start-ups, as some companies may have multiple bank account openings, whereas a VAT registered company will only register once. We must also recognise that the SCBS data set is not as comprehensive as the VAT register, with no data on deaths so we cannot analyse net births, which would provide information about the stock of businesses. In addition unlike many commercial databases including Dun and Bradsteet, Experian and FAME, VAT and SCBS are unable to provide any detailed financial, descriptive and ownership information. Yet, similar to VAT registration data, SCBS data are broken down at a number of levels in addition to the local authority region. Therefore, the results from this study are, on the one hand, more robust than the earlier study by Ball as we use regional data from the Scottish Clearing Banks across all Scottish regions, which includes anyone who opens a new business bank account, rather than the arbitrary definition adopted by Ball. However, the analysis is less valid in that we cannot control for firms that change banks, etc. Notwithstanding these weaknesses our results are in line with the earlier findings by Ball that VAT registration figures are not an accurate indicator of new firm activity. However, unlike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269094211434476">Ball (2007)</xref> our results suggest that VAT registration data underestimate rather than overestimate actual levels of entrepreneurial activity.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0269094211434476"><title>Standardisation of entry rates</title>
<p>As a result of differences in population and region size, it is necessary to standardise the number of new entrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269094211434476">Armington and Acs, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269094211434476">Ashcroft et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269094211434476">Gleave and Mitra, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269094211434476">Keeble and Walker, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0269094211434476">Storey and Johnson, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0269094211434476">Sutaria and Hicks, 2004</xref>). In line with the previous literature, standardisation methods are grouped into two categories: the ‘labour’ market approach and the ‘ecological’ approach. The labour market approach standardises the number of new entrants relative to the size of a region’s workforce or population. The benefit of this approach is that it can indicate a region’s entrepreneurial potential, based on the assumption that new entrepreneurial activity is most likely to arise from the actions of individuals within a given region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269094211434476">Cheng and Li, 2011</xref><bold>;</bold> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269094211434476">Gleave and Mitra, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0269094211434476">Sutaria and Hicks, 2004</xref>). The ecological approach, on the other hand, measures new entrants relative to the stock of existing businesses.</p>
<p>Both the labour market and ecological approaches have attracted criticism, as a result of contradictory findings and a weak conceptual basis, depending upon which standardisation method is used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269094211434476">Audretsch and Fritsch, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269094211434476">Love, 1995</xref>). While Audretsch and Fritsch report the conflicting signals as ‘disappointing’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269094211434476">Love (1995: 154)</xref> is less concerned, arguing ‘that the results need not be considered discouraging, because the labour market approach can be shown to be completely and practically superior to the ecological approach’.</p>
<p>The conceptual weakness of the ecological approach is the assumption that new businesses arise as a result of existing ones. While this may be true to an extent, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269094211434476">Ashcroft et al. (1991: 396)</xref> highlights a greater weakness in that if:<disp-quote>
<p>the stock of existing businesses reflects the firm formation rate of the past, and thus if a particular region suffered from a low firm formation in the past, the use of [this] method would result in the present rate being artificially inflated.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>While Ashcroft makes a valid point regarding artificial inflation, a number of studies investigating path dependency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269094211434476">Andersson and Koster, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269094211434476">Mueller et al., 2008</xref>) in entrepreneurship find the stock of existing businesses serve as role models, acting as an important source of information for potential entrepreneurs prior to and during start-up.</p>
<p>In addition to contradictory findings, the labour market approach has a number of limitations outlined in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269094211434476">Ashcroft et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269094211434476">Audretsch and Fritsch, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269094211434476">Garofoli, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269094211434476">Love, 1995</xref>). First, while conceptually the labour market approach is appealing, based on the assumption that each new entrant will be started by an individual (either employed or unemployed), its main weakness is the assumption that the entrepreneur starts a new business in the same labour market within which the new firm operates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269094211434476">Audretsch and Fritsch, 1994</xref>). However, this assumption is not entirely realistic given that it is not unlikely for an entrepreneur to start a business outside the region in which he/she lives, especially if specialised inputs are required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269094211434476">Audretsch and Fritsch, 1994</xref>). Furthermore, nor is it uncommon for entrepreneurs to spin-off businesses outside the industry in which they once worked.</p>
<p>While the labour market approach has some clear limitations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269094211434476">Ashcroft et al. (1991)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269094211434476">Love (1995)</xref> argue the ecological approach is not appropriate conceptually, as the denominator fails to satisfy two criteria. First, there is no conceptual relationship with what is being researched and, therefore, the denominator does not ‘represent the source from which firm formations are most likely to come’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269094211434476">Ashcroft et al., 1991</xref>: 396). Second, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269094211434476">Love (1995)</xref> highlights that to be an objective indicator of scale the denominator should be exogenous to the numerator. While ‘it can be shown that the labour market entry rate possesses both of these characteristics… the ecological approach possesses neither’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269094211434476">Love, 1995</xref>: 156).</p>
<p>On the basis of the above critique and given that this study is concerned with the role of the regional entrepreneurial environment in influencing individuals to undertake an entrepreneurial act, it would be most appropriate to measure new entrepreneurial activity standardised by the labour market approach, as conceptually new businesses are most likely to be created by the actions of an individual/individuals. Yet the critique demonstrates that both the labour market and ecological approaches are limited conceptually, which is further emphasised by the contradictory findings of previous studies.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec8-0269094211434476"><title>Findings</title>
<p>The purpose of this section is twofold: first, to map new firm formation rates identifying any regional variations in entrepreneurship and second to compare the extent to which VAT registration data reflect the general level of entrepreneurship in the Scottish economy by expressing the number of VAT registrations as a proportion of SCBS data which is more likely to be representative of the general level of entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>Located in the northern periphery of the UK and Europe, Scotland is a small country with a total population of 5.14 million and a working age population of 3.38 million.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0269094211434476">3</xref></sup> A constituent part of the UK since 1707, Scotland is currently governed under a system of joint sovereignty between the UK Government and the Scottish Parliament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269094211434476">Brown and Mason, forthcoming</xref>). Scotland is divided into 32 local authority council regions ranging in size, the number of inhabitants and in population density. Glasgow City (582,000) is the most populous region and the Orkney Islands (20,000) the least populous. The Highlands region is the largest in size (25,659 km<sup>2</sup>) and Dundee City the smallest (60 km<sup>2</sup>). Scotland is also one of the least densely populated countries in Europe, ranging from 8 people per km<sup>2</sup> in the Highlands region to 3316 individuals per km<sup>2</sup> in Glasgow City. Overall 70.1% of the population live in urban areas with 29% of the population living in the two largest cities, Glasgow and Edinburgh.</p>
<p>In order to compare firm birth rates in different regions the labour market approach is used to standardise entry rates as a result of differences in population and absolute size of regions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269094211434476">Figure 1</xref> compares the total number of new business registrations annually for the period 2002–2009 for both measures of entrepreneurship employed. It is clear that SCBS start-up activity is greater in all years when compared with VAT registration data and that this variation appears to be significantly greater in each year apart from 2009. In total 166,440 businesses were created according to SCBS data and 103,920 VAT registrations: a difference of 62,520. SCBS show a peak of 25,041 (2007) and a low of 15,726 (2009) with a yearly average of 36,531. This compares with a yearly average of 12,990 VAT registrations peaking at 16,225 (2008) with a low of 11,040 (2002). It is also worth noting the substantial year on year falls of 20% and 21% in 2008 and 2009 in SCBS registrations which is most likely a reflection of the recession that took place during that period. It also indicates that in general levels of entrepreneurship are positively correlated with the economic cycle. By comparison VAT registrations during the recession rose 11% (2008) when compared with 2007, although they did fall 9.2% in 2009 compared with the previous year. A possible explanation is that VAT registered firms are more growth orientated and better able to absorb the effects of an economic downturn compared with smaller lower growth companies represented more generally by SCBS data. However, our data show that VAT registration data, the official measure of entrepreneurship, are significantly underestimating levels of new business creation in the Scottish economy on average by 39% over the period.

<p>By comparison SCBS data show that firm formation rates are on average 60% higher across Scottish regions. SCBS rates range from 28.3 to 49.8 with a mean of 40.0 registrations per 10,000 of total population. There are 13 regions (40.6%) with above average entrepreneurial activity which is broadly comparable with the number of regions that have above average rates of entrepreneurial activity when compared with VAT registrations. Similarly, the majority of regions showing above average activity are rural.<sup>4</sup> The three highest SCBS entrepreneurial rates are: the Scottish Borders (49.8), Stirling (49.7) and Aberdeenshire (49.6) all of which can be considered rural regions. By comparison and similar to the VAT registration analysis, those regions with the lowest SCBS start-up rates are located in the west of Scotland: East Ayrshire (32.3), Inverclyde (32.0) and West Dunbartonshire (28.3). Again Scotland’s largest cities Aberdeen, Glasgow and Edinburgh have higher than average firm formation rates.</p>
<p>Therefore, while it is perhaps not unexpected that SCBS firm start-ups are in general higher than the number of VAT registrations, it is very clear that there is considerable spatial variation in new start-up activity across Scottish regions. It is also apparent that, irrespective of what measure of entrepreneurship is employed, there is a clear urban/rural divide with particularly high rates in more northern regions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269094211434476">Ashcroft et al. (1991)</xref> reported similar findings when undertaking analysis of VAT registration data during the 1980s, explaining that the apparent high levels of entrepreneurial activity in rural areas may be the result of a technicality whereby regions with low populations do not have firm formation rates that are reduced pro rata. Overall, when the labour market approach is used to standardise the number of new firm formations, it can be observed that entrepreneurial activity in Scotland is highly skewed, with the highest rates of new entrepreneurial activity found in rural rather than urban regions. This may be a reflection of limited employment opportunities in rural regions, first in terms of the total number of jobs available and second the variety of jobs available in rural regions. Therefore, entrepreneurship may be the result of necessity rather than opportunity in rural regions.</p>
<p>The following section addresses the extent to which VAT registrations are representative of total new business activity in Scotland by comparing the proportion of VAT registrations relative to the more general levels of entrepreneurship represented by SCBS registration. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269094211434476">Table 1</xref> identifies that on average VAT registration data underestimate start-up activity by over one-third (39%) when taken as a proportion of total SCBS start-ups. Spatial analysis of this data in Appendix 1 also highlights considerable regional differences in the extent to which VAT registrations underestimate general activity with a range of 51.4% in East Renfrewshire to 71.9% in the Orkney Islands. It is also possible to observe a number of other differences. First, the 10 regions in which the VAT start-up rate as a proportion of SCBS data is lowest, are all urban regions, while seven of the top 10 regions where VAT start-ups are most representative of SCBS data are rural regions, which suggests that VAT registration data are a better indicator of start-up activity in rural regions compared with urban regions.</p>
<p>Geographically, it is also discernible that regions with the largest difference in rates of entrepreneurship when comparing both measures are located in the west of Scotland: East Renfrewshire, West Dunbartonshire and North Ayrshire. Overall, other than the northern region of Moray, the largest differences between VAT registrations as a proportion of general start-up activity (SCBS) are in the urban central regions of Scotland and in the south west of Scotland. Furthermore, there is a pattern where those regions with the highest VAT registrations have the lowest differences between both measures, while those regions with the lowest VAT registration are also most significantly underestimating the actual levels of general start-up activity in the Scottish economy when measured by SCBS data.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-0269094211434476" sec-type="discussion|conclusion"><title>Discussion and conclusion</title>
<p>Using two different measures of entrepreneurship this article has provided an overview of new start-up activity in Scottish regions over the period 2002–2009. We identify that, irrespective of what measure of entrepreneurship is employed, there is considerable regional variation in new entrepreneurial activity in Scotland, with particularly high levels in rural areas. The primary aim was to assess the extent to which VAT registration data, the widely used and official measure of new entrepreneurial activity, are reflected by SCBS data, which estimate new entrepreneurial activity based on the number of new business bank accounts opened in the main Scottish clearing banks. We identify that when comparing both measures of entrepreneurial activity the official measure (VAT registration) underestimates the more general level (SCBS) of entrepreneurship in the Scottish economy by more than one-third (39%). In addition to identifying regional variations in entrepreneurial birth rates, there is also considerable regional variation in the extent to which VAT registration data underestimate the general level of entrepreneurial activity in Scotland. It was also noticeable that smaller businesses represented by SCBS data have been affected to a greater extent by the recent recession with substantial falls in start-up activity when compared with VAT registered firms. One plausible reason for this may have been the lack of finance available to small businesses, as banks reduced the amount of lending they made available as a result of the credit crunch. It is clear, therefore, that VAT registration data significantly underestimate the actual level of entrepreneurial activity in the Scottish economy. As a result current enterprise policy may be failing to reflect the needs of small firms, which are also the firms that appear to have been more adversely affected by the recent economic downturn than larger VAT registered firms.</p>
<p>However, this article is not suggesting that VAT registration data are inappropriate or should not be used, as they still remain the most comprehensive data set available, allowing for comparison of business births, deaths and change in business stock. Furthermore, it is most likely that VAT registered firms are the growth firms driving the Scottish economy and are therefore extremely important. That said, VAT registered firms only account for approximately 60% of firms created in the Scottish economy, raising concerns about how accurate current entrepreneurial policy is at a time when higher levels of entrepreneurship are required to foster economic growth and job creation. As a starting point we suggest researchers and policymakers attempt to gain a more accurate understanding of the actual level of entrepreneurship that exists in Scotland by combining the strengths of both VAT and SCBS data, given that some recent evidence suggests it is small firms that are most dynamic in terms of creative destruction and employment creation. Therefore, the key question arising from this article must be how at a policy level do we foster and harness a significant proportion of the remaining 40% of smaller general economic activity identified by SCBS data towards growth orientation, which can help foster dynamic innovation-driven regions to achieve sustained and high levels of economic growth, that are at least comparable with other parts of the UK and smaller benchmarks countries such as those in Scandinavia. Future research should also attempt to identify whether determinants of new start-up activity are the same for both measures of entrepreneurship, which will allow us to identify the causes and better explain spatial variation in new entrepreneurial activity in Scotland.</p></sec>

Where a unitary authority has a population density of less than one person per hectare it is considered rural. On this basis there are 14 rural unitary authorities. Unitary authority data is readily available and it is, therefore, very easy to apply this definition to a wide range of data sources. One disadvantage, however, is that since it is unitary authority based, some urban areas, including Stirling and Inverness, are classified as rural. Using the Randall definition of rurality, 89% of Scotland's landmass and 29% of its population are classified as rural.</p></fn></fn-group></notes>
