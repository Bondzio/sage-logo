<title>Background:</title>

<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Eighteen cadaver Achilles tendons were split longitudinally and detached, exposing the calcaneus; an ostectomy was performed and the tendon was reattached to the calcaneus in 1 of 2 ways: 2 suture anchors (single row) or a 4-anchor (double row) construct.

<title>Clinical Relevance:</title>
<p>In treatment for insertional Achilles tendinosis, the tendon often has to be detached and anatomically reattached to its insertion at the calcaneus. To our knowledge there is a lack of biomechanical studies supporting either a number or a pattern of suture anchor fixation. Because the stresses going across the insertion site of the Achilles tendon are significant during rehabilitation and weightbearing activities, it is imperative to have a strong construct that allows satisfactory healing during the early postoperative process.</p>

<body>
<p>Tendinopathy of the Achilles tendon is a common finding in both competitive and recreational athletes with chronic, often disabling posterior heel pain. Patients of all ages and activity levels can be affected, but this condition most commonly occurs beyond the fourth decade.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513487061">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513487061">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513487061">24</xref></sup> Various forms of tendinopathy are known, and little consensus exists on their pathogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513487061">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513487061">26</xref></sup> Of these, insertional Achilles tendinopathy is a specific entity often demonstrating intratendinous ossifications and bone spurs. It is most commonly accompanied by retrocalcaneal bursitis, Haglund exostosis, or intratendinous necrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513487061">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513487061">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513487061">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nonsurgical management is generally indicated as the first line of treatment. However, if this regimen fails for more than 6 months, surgical treatment may be a promising option. Although multiple approaches and techniques for surgical treatment of insertional Achilles tendinopathy are known, they have in common the need for debridement of degenerated tissue or calcific deposits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513487061">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513487061">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513487061">27</xref></sup> A wide exposure with disinsertion of the tendon is needed to allow complete access to possible calcific deposits. Some studies have shown that favorable results can be achieved with a central tendon-splitting approach with spur removal and release of up to 50% to 70% of the tendon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513487061">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513487061">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513487061">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513487061">28</xref></sup> These studies also used some combination of suture anchors to reinsert the tendon in those patients for whom greater than 50% of the substance was disinserted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513487061">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513487061">28</xref></sup> In these cases, reinsertion of the tendon with 2 to 5 suture anchors is suggested.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513487061">18</xref></sup> If detached, the tendon has to be anatomically reattached at the calcaneus, and this refixation has to biomechanically allow progressive and functional rehabilitation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513487061">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513487061">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513487061">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513487061"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513487061">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>In contrast to a simple single-row refixation, a double-row technique may generate an increased footprint and provide biomechanical advantages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513487061">28</xref></sup> Such biomechanical differences have been demonstrated for double-row repairs in rotator cuff surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513487061">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513487061">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546513487061">25</xref></sup> Initial clinical studies have shown good results for the use of such double-row constructs in surgical treatment of insertional Achilles tendinopathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513487061">28</xref></sup> A recent biomechanical study assessed the load to failures of a double-row construct and a double-row construct augmented with an additional transcalcaneal suture button.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513487061">5</xref></sup> Another biomechanical study published by Pilson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513487061">22</xref></sup> evaluated the simple load to failure of a single-row versus a double-row refixation of the Achilles tendon. This study did not demonstrate superiority of one repair over the other. However, the authors did not examine the behavior of the constructs under cyclic loading or evaluate differences in the footprint reconstruction.</p>
<p>Overall, there is a lack of biomechanical studies that support either a number of anchors or a pattern of suture fixation. In our experience, inadequate healing after this type of surgery does not lead to actual retears like rotator cuff repairs because it is extra-articular and adjacent to bone. Patients continue to have pain because the tendon attachment is inadequate to generate the forces required for function. This may be due to the poor tendon healing to bone, which leads to thickening and a chronic insufficient attempt at healing in the area. A more physiological refixation of the tendon may permit more progressive weightbearing and fewer range of motion restrictions in the postoperative period. We are not aware of previous studies that evaluated the effect of such constructs on the reattached tendon’s footprint and its behavior under cyclic loading conditions.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to determine the difference in contact pressure and area as well as the strength of repair between a single-row repair construct (2 anchors) and a double-row suture construct (4 anchors) after complete detachment of the Achilles tendon insertion. The hypothesis was that the double-row repair would generate an increased contact area and demonstrate higher biomechanical stability.</p>

<title>Specimens, Preparation, and Surgical Techniques</title>
<p>Eighteen fresh-frozen lower legs harvested from 9 cadavers (distal two-thirds of tibia and fibula as well as intact foot) were thawed overnight. Age, sex, race, height, weight, and cause of death were recorded. The mean age of the specimen donors was 48.8 ± 10.1 years (7 male, 2 female). The mean height of the specimen was 177 ± 7.6 cm and the mean weight was 73.1 ± 19.1 kg. The mean bone mineral density of the specimens was measured 0.60 ± 0.19 for group 1 and 0.63 ± 0.17 for group 2.</p>
<p>The entire calcaneus and intact Achilles tendon were dissected free from the specimens before testing. The distal aspect of the calcaneus was potted in plaster of Paris in a 2-inch section of PVC pipe, providing access to the tendon insertion while allowing secure fixation for the material testing machine (MTS). A digital ruler was used to measure the thickness and width of the entire tendon as well as the thickness of the split limbs (described below) for every specimen. Additionally, microscribe technology (MicroScribe, CNC Services Inc, Amherst, Virginia) was used to map the area of the each tendon’s footprint.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513487061">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513487061">23</xref></sup> Finally, a DXA bone densitometer (GE-Lunar Prodigy Advance, (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, Wisconsin)) was used to scan the calcaneal tuberosity of each specimen to determine bone mineral density (BMD).</p>
<p>For matching the pairs, each of one donor’s legs was randomly assigned to either group 1 (single row) or group 2 (double row). To achieve an optimal and a consistent surgical technique for reconstruction, surgeons familiar with each technique performed the reconstructions. Therefore, one surgeon (J.M.) treated all specimens in group 1, while another surgeon (A.A.) treated all specimens in group 2. To reproduce the in vivo surgery, the Achilles tendon was split in its midline approximately 5 to 7 cm proximal to its insertion, and subperiosteal elevation was then used to create free medial and lateral limbs, exposing the calcaneus. Ostectomy of the posterior, superior process of the calcaneal tuberosity was then performed with a microsagittal saw, as done in the excision of a Haglund deformity. Additionally, as part of the biomechanical testing described below, every tendon was reattached to its respective calcaneus with interposition of a custom Tekscan (Tekscan Inc, Boston, Massachusetts) pressure sensor strip.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513487061">2</xref></sup> Sutures were passed through the strips via prepunched holes, which were placed to avoid disruption of the pressure-sensing capability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513487061">19</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546513487061">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Group 2</title>
<p>The contralateral, matched specimens assigned to this group underwent identical detachment of the Achilles tendon. The reattachment in this group involved a double-row configuration. Two single-loaded 5.5-mm Bio-Corkscrew FT anchors (Arthrex) were placed more superiorly in the footprint of the bony resection. A standard mattress stitch was placed approximately 5 mm proximal from the distal tip of the tendon, and the free tails of the suture were then fixated distally (inferiorly) with two 3.5-mm Bio-PushLocks (Arthrex). One suture end from each knot was placed through the eyelet of the Bio-PushLocks, the tension was adjusted, and the Bio-PushLocks were inserted distally and in line with the Bio-Corkscrew anchors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546513487061">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section12-0363546513487061">
<title>Biomechanical Testing</title>
<p>Tekscan data were recorded for contact pressure and contact area for all of the specimens in the cadaver study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513487061">2</xref></sup> Both measurements were recorded at 3 time points: immediately after reattachment (time zero), 5 minutes after reattachment, and 24 hours after reattachment. These time points were chosen to evaluate the constructs’ behavior over time. The Tekscan sensors surpassed the average area of the tendon reconstruction, which allowed incorporation of the sensor into the repairs. No tension was applied on the constructs while the Tekscan testing was performed.</p>
<p>After the Tekscan measurements, the specimens were randomly mounted onto an MTS machine and loaded at 100 N for 2000 cycles at 1 Hz. The calcaneus was positioned at a 30° angle to simulate early heel rise, and the direction of force was vertical to the floor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513487061">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513487061">15</xref></sup> At early heel rise, the relationship of the calcaneus to the tibia and therefore the direction of pull is approximately 40° of dorsiflexion. Because the normal pitch of the calcaneus is 10° to 30°, this would give a range of 20° to 40° of dorsiflexion of the calcaneus relative to the tibia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513487061">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513487061">15</xref></sup> With this relationship, the direction of the force should be vertical.</p>
<p>The proximal end of the tendon was clamped 7 cm proximal to the insertion near the point where the soleus fibers began to arise. A custom clamp with sinusoidal grips was used. Dry ice was put on the spouts on the side of the clamp to ensure that the tendon was frozen and no slippage occurred.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513487061">20</xref></sup> Three sets of markers were placed into the Achilles tendon and 1 set into the calcaneus for measurement of displacement.</p>
<p>Cyclic loading was chosen to be 100 N at 1 Hz for 2000 cycles. Finni et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513487061">6</xref></sup> demonstrated that the Achilles tendon sees a load of 1430 N during gait with individual peaks of 2400 N. Both loads proved to be greater than the strength of the repairs, which led us to investigate the load for a passive plantar flexion motion. Other authors provided a close representation of plantar flexion by measuring loads on the Achilles tendon during pedaling at 480 N.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513487061">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513487061">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513487061">14</xref></sup> Cyclic loading at 480 N led to early failure, as this too was greater than the strength of the repair. Pilot work was performed to determine the load seen during passive plantar flexion, and we found that a total of 5 N would re-create this movement with no load applied to the foot, but this load would be too small to demonstrate any change in displacement. We then referenced Zandbergen et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513487061">29</xref></sup> who showed suture anchor repairs to have a strength range of 166 to 202 N, which led us to use a load of 100 N, 50% of the highest load seen on this type of repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513487061">3</xref></sup> This load provided displacement data but did not compromise the repair for load to failure testing. We performed 2000 cycles because pilot work showed no significant changes in displacement after 1500 cycles.</p>
<p>The total and average displacement of both the medial and lateral limbs of the tendon was recorded. After the displacement due to cyclic loading had been determined, the specimens were then loaded to failure at a rate of 1 mm/s on the same MTS machine, which was performed with the tendon pretensioned to 10 N and after cyclic loading. Yield elongation and peak elongation were recorded as well as yield load and peak load. Finally, mode of failure was documented.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of the present study partly proved our hypothesis and showed a statistically significant biomechanical advantage to the double-row construct for Achilles tendon reinsertion with both the repair footprint area and the peak load to failure. The double-row construct did not show statistically significant advantages for biomechanical behavior under cyclic loading. However, the increased strength of the construct (peak load and load at yield) may allow for more progressive weightbearing and a more functional rehabilitation program after surgical treatment of insertional Achilles tendinopathy.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that a central tendon-splitting approach with spur removal and release of up to 50% to 70% of the tendon are needed to achieve favorable results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513487061">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513487061">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513487061">28</xref></sup> These studies used some combination of suture anchors to reinsert the tendon in those patients in whom greater than 50% of the substance was disinserted. Since 1999, when Kolodziej et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513487061">12</xref></sup> mentioned the paucity of clinical outcomes studies involving complete disinsertion, debridement, and reinsertion of the Achilles tendon, multiple authors have shown excellent results in cases requiring complete release of the tendon, debridement, and reinsertion with suture anchors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513487061">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513487061">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513487061">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513487061">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>The concept of the double-row construct was developed from rotator cuff surgery, where biomechanical studies have shown promising results for the double-row repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513487061">17</xref></sup> Double-row repairs have been biomechanically shown to create higher contact areas than have single-row repairs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546513487061">25</xref></sup> Other biomechanical studies demonstrated increased contact area, contact pressure, and force for double-row constructs compared with single-row repairs of the supraspinatus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513487061">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>This concept has been transferred clinically to Achilles tendon reinsertion with good results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513487061">28</xref></sup> The advantage of such double-row techniques is seen in the sufficient coverage of the tendon’s footprint, which allows for equal pressure distribution and greater coverage of the entire enthesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513487061">17</xref></sup> The results of the present study showed significantly improved coverage of the footprint area initially (0 and 5 minutes) after the repair was performed. All other Tekscan measurements, including the 24-hour footprint evaluation, failed to show statistically significant improvements. The changes in the footprint area at the 24-hour measurement may be related to the in vitro behavior of the experimental setup and biomechanical changes in the soft tissue construct over time. This may fail to reflect the complex physiological processes that occur in the first 24 hours after the reconstruction if performed in human surgery.</p>
<p>Displacement under cyclic loading did not demonstrate superiority of one repair construct over the other. However, peak load and load at yield were significantly (<italic>P</italic> = .01; <italic>P</italic> = .042) higher for the double-row repair constructs. Sadoghi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513487061">24</xref></sup> recently published a meta-analysis of human cadaver studies evaluating different forms of midsubstance repairs of the Achilles tendon. The range of load to failure within these 11 studies was 81 to 453 N (mean, 222.7 N). Although another type of repair was used, our results are seen within the upper range of these results for the double-row repair (433 ± 84 N) and within the middle range for the single-row repair (212 ± 49 N).</p>
<p>Our results demonstrated an increased load to failure for the double-row construct, which is in contrast to the results presented by Pilson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513487061">22</xref></sup> They showed no significant differences in load to failure for a comparable single-row versus a double-row refixation. However, no cyclic loading and no analysis of the reconstructed footprint were performed in their study. Regarding modes of failure, more constructs failed by anchor failure in the study by Pilson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513487061">22</xref></sup> (6/18) compared with our study (1/18). Although their specimens have been matched according to donor, bone mineral density was not determined. Therefore, one reason for the increased rate of anchor failure may be low bone mineral density because of the unknown age of the tested specimens. When we compare our study with that performed by Fanter et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513487061">5</xref></sup> the double-row construct used in our study achieved higher loads to failure (433 ± 84 N) compared with the loads to failure shown by their study for a comparable double-row construct (239 N; range, 196-267 N). The combination of a double-row repair augmented with a transcalcaneal suture button demonstrated the highest load to failure in their study (391 N; range, 358-451 N). However, Fanter et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513487061">5</xref></sup> only evaluated biomechanical load to failure at a speed of 0.33 mm/s, whereas the load to failure was tested at 1 mm/s in our study after previous cyclic loading testing. This may explain the difference in loads tested when the studies are compared with each other.</p>
<p>Double-row repairs have a disadvantage in that more foreign body structures are implanted into the body, which increases the possibility of foreign body reactions. This is especially critical in the area of the Achilles tendon insertion and its limited soft tissue cover, which make it prone to wound healing problems. Our results showed that a double-row repair performed as a bridging technique increased the loads to failure. In a biomechanical study on ovine rotator cuff tendons, Jost et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513487061">11</xref></sup> demonstrated that the number of sutures determines the strength of the repair, in contrast to the number of applied anchor rows. We do not believe that our results are in contrast to the findings of Jost et al, because they did not evaluate double-row repairs constructed in a bridging technique and because both repairs in our study used identical numbers of sutures. But the use of additional suture anchors may also have an economic disadvantage, which has to be weighed against possible advantages.</p>
<p>Another factor is the improved contact between the tendon and the bone under flexion-extension motion of the foot, which is also known from studies performed at the rotator cuff tendon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513487061">9</xref></sup> Overall, it can be hypothesized that these advantages may result in an increased healing rate and fewer failures because of higher primary strength of the repair construct. If the load to failure is greater, then there is less risk in the postoperative period that the tendon will separate from the bone during an activity. At present, using this technique clinically has increased our confidence in our patients’ postoperative protocol and ambulation.</p>
<p>The in vitro nature of biomechanical evaluation can limit application of the findings to the in vivo conditions of the hindfoot. Accurate replication of these forces in a cadaveric study might be difficult. However, the intention of this study was to evaluate the pressure distribution and biomechanical stability of the refixation of the tendon at the anatomic insertion site. The mean age of the cadavers was 47 years. This has to be regarded in the interpretation of the results, although bone mineral density of each cadaver was measured to ensure that the cadaver’s bone density was within physiological ranges. Tendons were completely detached and reinserted to allow for standardized comparison of both tested groups. In comparison with in vivo reconstructions in which tendons are partially resected, the technique used here may result in different overall levels of strength of the constructs in terms of biomechanical forces. However, the aim of this study was to compare 2 different techniques of tendon reattachment, so a completely standardized setup was used. In addition, biomechanical testing with cadaveric specimens does not allow for the effects of biological healing to be measured, and therefore we are only able to draw conclusions for the primary stability of the joint at a time point immediately following surgical reconstruction. Finally, our results show statistical significance in only 2 measurements, whereas the remainder only showed a trend toward superiority. It may be that the number of specimens analyzed was not large enough to provide sufficient statistical power. Using a larger number of specimens may have provided statistical differentiation. Although our biomechanical data show statistical significance in vitro, further animal and long-term clinical outcomes studies will need to show that this construct provides an improved biochemical healing and improved patient satisfaction.</p>
