<abstract>
<p>The authors present the case of a 23-year-old paratrooper who was admitted to intensive therapy unit with florid meningococcal septicemia. Being young, fit, and well, he survived this acute episode with supportive therapy, antibiotics, and inotropes. He made a good recovery and was left with multiple wounds all over his body predominantly on the extensor aspects of his upper and lower limbs and torso.</p>

<body>
<p>His wounds were managed expectantly with simple dressings. After being in hospital for 3 months, his wounds healed, leaving marked hypertrophic scars. He did have sloughy wounds over both heels, thus limiting his mobility and therefore costing him his independence, an extended hospital stay, as well as the financial implications thereof.</p>
<p>He was taken to theatre for debridement of these bilateral heel wounds and application of the PICO single-use negative pressure wound therapy (SUNPWT) device (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534734612474305">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534734612474305">2</xref>).</p>

<p>The device is easy to use, quick to apply, and unlike other topical negative pressure (TNP) devices, everything needed comes with the pack, thereby avoiding delays locating components such as foam, gauze, and dressings. Furthermore, being portable, lightweight, and relatively inconspicuous, it offers patients mobile TNP readily and without restriction or inconvenience.</p>
<p>The patient’s wounds have now healed and he is engaged in rehabilitation with occupational therapists. Defects over the heel and tendo-Achilles area are challenging to reconstruct, especially with exposed tendon and bone as local options are limited. After thorough discussion with the patient and his family, given the patient’s institutionalization and his ongoing recovery from sepsis, the case for further surgery and flap surgery in particular was declined. Instead, the senior author felt a quicker wound healing time was in the patient’s best interest without inflicting further surgical wounds and donor sites, and hence the choice of PICO. Skin substitutes as part of the reconstructive armamentarium were also discussed; however, it was felt that this option would still require further surgical procedures in the future.</p>
<p>The authors also acknowledge a recent article by Kasai et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734612474305">1</xref></sup> wherein it was demonstrated that delivery of lower suction pressures is less likely to occlude most of the capillaries adjacent to the wound edge. They used it in 3 ischemic wound with good results and no evidence of peripheral wound edge necrosis. As the pressure of the PICO device is fixed, ~50 mm Hg according to Smith &amp; Nephew (London, UK), this perhaps may have contributed to better wound healing in a complex patient.</p>
<p>There is also some recent evidence that SUNPWT devices potentially reduce keloid scarring, which perhaps warrants further study, and if proven may pave the way for wider use of such devices in daily practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734612474305">2</xref></sup></p>
