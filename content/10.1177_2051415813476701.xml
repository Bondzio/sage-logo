<title>Objective:</title>
<p>The current economic and political climate demands a focus on efficiency and productivity, whilst delivering quality, across all aspects of the National Health Service (NHS). Operative theatres act as a critical, yet costly resource. The Audit Commission employs the use of percentage theatre utilisation as a principal measure of NHS operating theatre service and efficiency performance. We analysed theatre utilisation data in a five-consultant, high turnover, urology department within a NHS University Teaching Hospital. Our aim was to examine the relationship between theatre utilisation data, cost effectiveness and income generated.</p>

<p>Data on the usage of a dedicated urology theatre was collected over 251 hours for a full calendar month. A total of 176 consecutive procedures were performed.

<sec id="section3-2051415813476701">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>There was no correlation between percentage theatre utilisation and income (<italic>R</italic>2=0.0191, <italic>p</italic>=0.82). No relationship was identified between percentage theatre utilisation and total number of cases performed (<italic>R</italic>2=0.0001, <italic>p</italic>=0.99). Although there appeared to be a positive correlation between the number of cases performed and income generated, this was not statistically significant (<italic>R</italic>2=0.725, <italic>p</italic>=0.067).

<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Our data identifies no correlation between percentage theatre utilisation, income generated and number of cases performed. Utilisation percentages are not a reliable performance indicator when used in isolation, and therefore should be used as part of a more global picture when assessing cost effectiveness and efficiency performance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The current economic climate presents the NHS with perhaps its greatest challenge to date.</p>
<p>The Healthcare Commission in 2005<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2051415813476701">1</xref></sup> reported that in the year 2002/2003, seven million operations were performed on patients in England and Wales with the annual budget for main theatre departments exceeding £1 billion. It also stated that these operations were predominantly elective procedures performed not uncommonly in inefficient day case settings. Some day case facilities were being used an average of only 16 hours a week; whilst 45% of planned operating hours are taken up by cancellations, operating lists running short and gaps between cases .<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2051415813476701">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite their ability to generate revenue, operating theatres are a costly resource accounting for a significant proportion of the total hospital budget.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2051415813476701">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2051415813476701">4</xref></sup> It is therefore vital that operating theatres are used efficiently, maximising theatre utilisation by minimising over-running theatre sessions and patient cancellations. In achieving these measures departments would greatly reduce waiting lists, optimise productivity and cost benefit, not to mention improve patient experience and service quality.</p>
<p>Theatre utilisation has become the principal measure of theatre performance in the UK since the publication of the <italic>STEP Guide to improving Operating Performance</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2051415813476701">4</xref></sup> (2002), and the two national Audit Commission reports on operating theatres.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2051415813476701">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2051415813476701">5</xref></sup> The Audit Commission employs percentage theatre utilisation as a principal marker of NHS operating theatre service and efficiency performance. Efficient utilisation of theatres is defined by set measures including starting and finishing on time, minimising time between cases, handling emergency and elective case-loads separately, effective pre-operative assessment and measures in place to reduced cancellations.</p>
<p>We aimed to analyse more closely and holistically the locally published theatre utilisation data at an NHS University Teaching Hospital. Our interest lay more specifically in exploring the potential relationship between theatre utilisation figures, income generated and cost effectiveness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-2051415813476701" sec-type="methods">
<title>Patients and methods</title>
<p>Data regarding the usage of a dedicated urology theatre was collected over 251 hours for a full calendar month. A total of 176 consecutive procedures were performed under the care of 5 urology consultants in one month. Up to 49 different procedures were performed. These ranged from minor to major surgery. The operating surgeons consisted of specialist registrars in urology and consultant urologists.</p>
<p>The trust policy ensures that data is fed back to all surgical subspecialties on a monthly basis outlining subspecialty theatre utilisation percentages. This data was compiled from daily-computerised entries by theatre staff during timetabled lists and was then retrospectively analysed in an attempt to highlight areas for improvement. We further examined the percentage theatre utilisation data that was entered in Excel.</p>
<list id="list1-2051415813476701" list-type="bullet">

</list>
<p>HRG (Healthcare Resource Grouping) tariffs per procedure were obtained from the trust. This enabled us to assess income generated per procedure. Only the cost related to the procedure was included in calculating income generated. No additional cost related to hospital stay was accounted for. Using theatre records we were able to extrapolate gross procedure related income generated per consultant during the period of our study. Linear regression analysis was performed on collated data to assess the correlation between number of operating hours, cases per hour, percentage theatre utilisation and income generated.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The most widely used measure of theatre performance has been percentage theatre utilisation data: although it is not without limitations. The results from our data are significant in showing the importance of interpreting such data with a more holistic approach rather than in isolation.</p>
<p>Presumptions made purely from percentage theatre utilisation rates can be mis-leading. These figures fail to take into account significant variables such as:</p>
<list id="list2-2051415813476701" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The case-mix and extraneous factors surrounding surgery</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Case complexity</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Emergency vs elective cases</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Operating surgeon and theatre staff experience</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cancellations as sessions times are aggregated</p></list-item></list>
<p>Such variables have been acknowledged by the Audit Commission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2051415813476701">3</xref></sup> who state that approximately one-tenth of scheduled operating sessions are cancelled by NHS trusts. Utilisation rates do not reflect performance of operating sessions that overrun the allocated session time. Over-runs and under-runs are both sources of inefficiency resulting in high and low utilisation rates respectively. Aside from the financial penalty, over-running lists cause discontent among theatre staff, can lead to poor productivity and incur additional costs spent, such as employment of agency staff, the cost of absenteeism and recruitment difficulties.</p>
<p>Our experience revealed up to 20% of available operating time was lost to delays. This is consistent with national figures. Complex anaesthesia, complex patient preparation or extubation in theatres are some of the common reasons cited for unavoidable and unforeseeable delays. Delays have a negative effect on efficiency and the working environment .<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2051415813476701">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2051415813476701">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, there are more basic procedural causes that may account for the delay in getting patients to theatre, such as ward delays when patients are ‘sent’ for, patients not sent for in time, lack of porters, ineffective list planning and communication breakdown as to the order of the list and the specific requirements of particular cases. In our study, availability of ward beds accounted for a significant proportion of unavoidable delays: a problem that continues to plague the NHS.</p>
<p>It is thought that the principal driver for theatre utilisation is operating list size. This, in turn is determined by factors such as availability of ward beds and high dependency beds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2051415813476701">7</xref></sup> However Mayer et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2051415813476701">8</xref></sup> suggested, using a multivariate case-mix adjusted analysis, that the size of operating lists represents by far the strongest determinant of effective theatre utilisation. They felt the effect of delays and speed of surgeons were much smaller determinants. Overrunning lists inflate utilisation rates, however there is evidence that some studies have adjusted utilisation methodology and calculations to account for overtime.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2051415813476701">9</xref></sup> Conversely, in a large study Faiz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2051415813476701">7</xref></sup> found that size of the operating list and whether the list overran were the strongest independent predictors of list utilisation. The Modernisation Agency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2051415813476701">10</xref></sup> has published specific practical advice on administrative and clinical measures aimed at reducing delays and cancelled operations.</p>
<p>Other methods of operative workload assessments in the UK include:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2051415813476701">8</xref></sup></p>
<list id="list3-2051415813476701" list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>The Finished Consultant Episode (FCE) is a ‘case counting’ method, which does not accurately reflect operative workload, as it makes no distinction between procedure complexity (i.e. an endoscopy and a liver transplant both represent a single FCE).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Healthcare Resource Grouping (HRG) now offers a potential direct measure of case-mix adjusted operative output by grouping operations within specialties which use comparable levels of resource and act as a means of determining equitable financial reimbursement for care services delivered by healthcare providers. It acts a marker of theatre productivity.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Our study was informative but not without limitations. This was a single-centred study looking at utilisation over a short period of time. Hence, interpretation of the results is unique to one centre, and extrapolation of the results to other NHS Trusts may not be appropriate. Three of the five surgeons in our group perform laparoscopic, renal and pelvic surgery, often resulting in cases taking several hours. This inevitably has an impact on pre, peri and intra-operative times, as well as number of cases listed per session. We have chosen not to examine explicitly sub specialty case mix, or divided cases into minor, intermediate and major. However its reasonable to assume that a laparoscopic cystectomy for example will take several hours in comparison to a day case procedures such as a check rigid cystoscopy. A closer evaluation of anaesthetic times and variation between anaesthetists, in patient stay and impact of this on the gross income per list and loss of income as a consequence of cancellations would provide a deeper understanding of this complex issue.</p>
<p>NHS performance evaluation is increasingly under scrutiny and theatre utilisation percentages are employed nationally to assess performance across the majority of UK Trusts. Our study findings are therefore pertinent to other Trusts. There is a paucity of UK data on comparisons of theatre utilisation and relative income generated. Our data identifies no correlation between percentage theatre utilisation, gross income generated and number of cases performed suggesting that utilisation percentages are not a reliable performance indicator when used in isolation. An evaluation of true cost effectiveness can only be achieved if income and spend are accurately monitored and form the basis of any assessment of productivity and efficiency as indicated by Pandit et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2051415813476701">11</xref></sup> in their model for measurement of theatre utilisation.</p>
<p>Several studies in a range of surgical specialties such as orthopaedics, neurosurgery, outline the flaws in elective theatre planning and the implications it has on efficiency, time, and resources.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2051415813476701">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2051415813476701">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2051415813476701">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2051415813476701"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2051415813476701"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2051415813476701"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2051415813476701">15</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2051415813476701">6</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2051415813476701">7</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2051415813476701">11</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2051415813476701">12</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2051415813476701">13</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2051415813476701">14</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2051415813476701">15</xref></sup></p>
