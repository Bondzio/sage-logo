<abstract>
<p>Asexuality, quickly becoming a burgeoning sexual identity category and subject of academic inquiry, relies at this budding moment of identity demarcation on a series of scientific studies that seek to ‘discover’ the truth of asexuality in and on the body. This article considers the existing scientific research on asexuality, including both older and more obscure mentions of asexuality as well as contemporary studies, through two twin claims: (1) that asexuality, as a sexual identity, is entirely specific to our current cultural moment – that it is in this sense culturally contingent, and (2) that scientific research on asexuality, while providing asexuality with a sense of credibility, is also shaping the possibilities and impossibilities of what counts as asexuality and how it operates. In the first section, I consider how older scientific research on asexuality, spanning from the late 1970s to the early 1990s, is characterized by a disinterest in asexuality. Next, turning to recent work on asexuality, the beginning of which is marked by Anthony Bogaert’s 2004 study, I demonstrate how asexuality becomes ‘discovered’, mapped, and pursued by science, making it culturally intelligible even while often naturalizing, in the process, what I argue are harmful sexual differences.</p>

<p>Nowhere, perhaps, do the interests of fiction and those of science meet and mingle more intimately than in the body of knowledge we have come to call ‘sexuality’. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959353512443668">Potts, 2002</xref>: 15)</p></disp-quote>
<p>The goal of this article is to question the existing scientific knowledge on asexuality. Such work is especially necessary at this moment when predictions are being made about asexuality’s vibrant academic career – for instance, Karli June <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959353512443668">Cerankowski and Megan Milks (2010)</xref> recently predicted it will blossom into an ‘asexuality studies’ (pp. 654–655). Amidst the foretelling of this future for asexuality, I would like this article to serve as a critical reflection on the ways in which ‘scientific’ writings are edifying cultural understandings and definitions of an identity and sexual concept that is necessarily cultural. Two simple reminders are crucial for future considerations of asexuality to gain in adroitness and depth. First, asexuality, like all sexualities, is culturally and historically contingent. Asexuality has not existed at any other time in Western history, not as ‘asexuality’ per se. It has <italic>not</italic> always existed underneath all that sex. That it is here today is necessarily a crystallization of our specific here and now. Second, asexuality, like most sexualities, is in significant and intricate ways carved into existence by science. This is not to say that science alone is inventing asexuality but that science, in collusion with other social forces, is defining what asexuality is and how it functions. In other words, scientific writing on asexuality is an important contributor to the formation and popularization of asexuality. I will note here, though, that science is not alone; both asexually identified individuals (most pronouncedly those organizing around the AVEN – Asexual Visibility and Education Network – banner) and various media are equal contributors to the asexuality of today, though my focus in this article is on the <italic>scientific</italic> mapping of asexuality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0959353512443668">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>This article is divided into two sections, both of which provide an overview of the existing research on asexuality, tracing asexuality’s appearance (and disappearance) in scientific sex writing. The literature I am referring to as the scientific study of asexuality is comprised of a set of mostly articles, from the late 1970s to the present decade, published in academic journals that self-describe as scientific in focus, such as <italic>Archives of Sexual Behavior</italic> and <italic>The Journal of Sex Research</italic>. They are ‘scientific’ not only in their self designation, but also in the way they strive to mimic the methods, processes, taxonomies, and language of the more ‘hard’ sciences. They are invested in a particular type of knowledge-production which gains credibility, neutrality, and truth-value from its scientific label. Leonore <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959353512443668">Tiefer (2000)</xref> provides a list of 10 tenets that run through the ‘sexological model of sexuality’ <italic>including</italic> the notion that sex is a natural force, that desire is mostly a result of biology, the naturalization of differences between women and men, the normality of heterosexuality, and the belief that every person has a categorical sexual and gender identity (for the whole list see pp. 82–83). A critical feminist analysis of these texts is necessary because it interrupts readings of empirical research as absolute and neutral truth, encouraging us to remember the story-telling aspect of scientific fact-production and that science too is a series of representations allied to specific cultural discourses. Also, such an analysis is urgent at this budding moment of asexuality studies because far too often, these empirical accounts of asexuality are taken up as sheer facts documenting the unveiling of a long-neglected sexual orientation.</p>
<p>But there is also a certain irony to the scientific study of sex. As Gayle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959353512443668">Rubin (1984: 284)</xref> noted, ‘empirical sex research is the one field that does incorporate a positive concept of sexual variation’. Even as it is potentially damaging in its, say, naturalization of sexual difference or its binding of sex to the body, such research is also transformative in that it allows marginalized sexual identities to become articulated, to appear in the world in a recognizable way. So my analysis of these texts is not ultimately intended to erase them – they are meaningful documents that enable certain understandings of the (a)sexual self – but to disarm them of their neutrality.</p>
<p>The first section of my analysis explores the older and more outdated literature on asexuality, which spans the period between the late 1970s and early 1990s. This research, as I will demonstrate, is characterized by a lackadaisical inclusion of asexuality into sexual models. The authors of this early work, such as Michael <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959353512443668">Storms (1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959353512443668">1980</xref>) and Paula <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959353512443668">Nurius (1983)</xref>, included asexuality in their models and writing not in order to interrogate it, but in order to advance their other sexual projects; thus they discussed asexuality in very limited terms. Next, I turn to the more contemporary and oft-cited research, which both opens up the academic study of asexuality and enables asexuality to be popularized and thus rendered culturally visible, the advent of which is heralded by Anthony Bogaert in 2004. Significantly, this later work evinces a tangible claiming of asexual territory, and signals the modern ‘discovery’ of asexuality by science, fueled by the creation of the online asexual community, AVEN, by David Jay in 2001 (available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.asexuality.org">http://www.asexuality.org</ext-link>). In particular, I will here argue, in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959353512443668">Tiefer’s (2000)</xref> argument, that current scientific articulations of asexuality bind (a)sexuality indiscriminately to the biological body while reproducing and naturalizing harmful sexual differences.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0959353512443668"><title>Asexuality’s ‘prehistory’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0959353512443668">2</xref></sup></title>
<p>Asexuality’s prehistory, or its articulations before its more recent widespread dispersal, is rather humble. Indeed, before 2000 there were only very rare and random mentions of asexuality by scientific sources, and scarcely any interrogations of it in its own right. Prior to the 21st century, only a few scientific studies outright registered or named asexuality: those by Michael <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959353512443668">Storms (1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959353512443668">1980</xref>), Paula <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959353512443668">Nurius (1983)</xref>, William <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959353512443668">Masters et al. (1986)</xref>, and Braden <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959353512443668">Berkey et al. (1990)</xref>. This nearly absolute lack of interest in asexuality – this ‘prehistory’ – when understood as a counterpoint to contemporary asexual identity and community formation, evinces the contingency of cultural understandings of sexuality. That asexuality mattered so very little prior to this last decade, and then suddenly rapidly acquired an abundance of signification, demonstrates, first, that it has become culturally relevant and intelligible and, second, that this intelligibility is reliant on a particular cultural nexus.</p>
<p>Yet unlike contemporary studies on asexuality by researchers such as Anthony <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959353512443668">Bogaert (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959353512443668">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959353512443668">2008</xref>) and Lori Brotto and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959353512443668">Brotto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959353512443668">Brotto and Yule, 2011</xref>), which demonstrate a tangible claiming of new, unexplored sexual territory, these sparse early scientific mentions of asexuality seem to have accepted it as an obvious and integral, if often neglected, component of the sexuality spectrum. The holistic models of sexual orientations, described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959353512443668">Storms (1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959353512443668">1980)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959353512443668">Nurius (1983)</xref>, and others, from the late 1970s through to the 1990s, took for granted that a category such as ‘asexuality’ must exist, alongside other sexual orientations such as homosexuality, heterosexuality, bisexuality, and ambisexuality. In their scales, spectrums, models, diagrams, and typologies, asexuality was simply another hue of human sexuality. However, while asexuality had its place in some of these sexual models, early writing on asexuality was also characterized by a disinterest in exploring its definitions, parameters, and implications. This rather lackadaisical inclusion of asexuality into models of sexual orientation, in light of today’s more avid scientific interest in asexuality, provides a living trace of sexuality’s constructedness.</p>
<p>The first depictions of asexuality in a scientific source concerned with the study of human sex<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0959353512443668">3</xref></sup> occurred in psychologist Michael <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959353512443668">Storms’ 1979</xref> chapter ‘Sexual Orientation and Self-Perception’, and his 1980 article ‘Theories of Sexual Orientation’, where he engaged in a remodeling of Kinsey’s sexuality scale, producing as a byproduct the sexual orientation of asexuality. Alfred Kinsey’s breakthrough model of sexual orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959353512443668">Kinsey et al., 1948</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959353512443668">1953</xref>), while highly innovative in the 1950s, was, Storms argued, ‘unidimensional’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959353512443668">Storms, 1980</xref>) and insufficient for sexuality studies of the late 1970s. Kinsey’s seven-point scale, while fluid in its insistence that ‘the heterosexuality or homosexuality of many individuals is not an all-or-none proposition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959353512443668">Kinsey et al., 1948</xref>: 638) and that ‘reality is a continuum’, (p. 647) was nevertheless hinged on one sole axis of sexuality – the heterosexual–homosexual continuum on which each person must fall. Because of this, Kinsey’s continuum model did not provide asexuality with any real territory; indeed, individuals who <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959353512443668">Kinsey identified as having ‘no socio-sexual contacts or reactions’ (1948: 656)</xref>, and who ‘[did] not respond erotically to either heterosexual or homosexual stimuli, and [did] not have overt physical contacts with individuals of either sex in which there is evidence of any response’ (1953: 472), were labeled simply as ‘X’ and were in want of a home on the erotic graph.</p>
<p>While Kinsey did provide textual, if not graphic, space for a group ‘X’, indicating that after the age of 25 for men about two percent are characterized by a paucity of sexual response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959353512443668">Kinsey et al., 1948</xref>), and that ‘a goodly number of females belong in this category in every age group’ (1953: 472), he neither investigated this nor actually employed the term ‘asexuality’. Indeed, because his project was so implicitly focused on disrupting conservative views of human sexuality, he probably was not compelled to investigate the absence of sexual response. As Janice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959353512443668">Irvine (1990</xref>[2005]) argued, ‘Kinsey conveys his belief, cloaked in the rationale that what is “natural” is right, that sex is good and more is better’ (p. 20). For instance, Kinsey did not think to include priests or nuns, or otherwise celibate groups in his data sample, likely because this would affect his overall results (nor did he, for that matter, include many other groups for other reasons, including most problematically non-whites) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959353512443668">Irvine, 1990[2005]:</xref> 24). As Vern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959353512443668">Bullough (1998)</xref> indicated, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959353512443668">Kinsey’s 1953</xref> book on the ‘human female’ was intent on challenging the assumed ‘asexuality of women’ (p. 130). Thus, women’s high rate of ‘X-ness’ (or potentially, their asexuality) was explained by Kinsey as in need of further analysis, since ‘these individuals might show that they do sometimes respond to socio-sexual stimuli’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959353512443668">Kinsey et al., 1953</xref>: 472). To recapitulate then, Kinsey’s gathered data, which ushered in the scientific study of sex, suggested the presence of some category which might serve as a precedent for the contemporary designation of asexuality; however, this was neither accommodated in his seven-point scale, nor did Kinsey explore it in any great depth.</p>
<p>In Storms’ remodeling, we see a slight possibility of a space for asexuality. Although not investigating asexuality in any great depth, Storms did create space for it on the scientific page, recording it as the fourth quadrant of his ‘map of erotic orientation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959353512443668">Storms, 1980</xref>: 784–785) – of which the three other quadrants were homosexuality, bisexuality, and heterosexuality, or in his earlier chapter heteroerotic, homoerotic, ambierotic, and anerotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959353512443668">Storms, 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959353512443668">1980</xref>). Storms’ subtle cartographic move, a remodeling of Kinsey’s model into a two-dimensional map, did allow for asexuality to make its mark, but Storms was not concerned with the asexual category at all. While he did recognize that a two-dimensional model will have as one advantage the possibility of an asexual category, his writing focused primarily on the second advantage of such a model, namely a ‘different view of bisexual[ity]’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959353512443668">Storms, 1979</xref>: 172), one that was not a compromise between heteroerotic and homoerotic fantasies but instead allowed for ‘high degrees of both homosexuality and heterosexuality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959353512443668">Storms, 1980</xref>: 785). In other words, although asexuality was scientifically named by Storms, he hardly acknowledged this act of naming.</p>
<p>Psychologist Paula <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959353512443668">Nurius’ (1983)</xref> study also <italic>incidentally</italic> gave a name to the category of asexuality. Intent on disproving traditional assumptions that heterosexuals are more psychologically and sexually ‘healthy’ than homosexuals, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959353512443668">Nurius employed a ‘four-group typology of sexual orientation’ (1983: 119)</xref>, which included asexuality as one of its categories. While Nurius did not discuss asexuality in any great depth, we do learn that out of her 689 participants, 5 percent of men and 10 percent of women have a predominantly asexual orientation, based on their low scores on the Sexual Activity and Preference Scale (SAPS) test. She therefore classified asexuals as ‘those who largely prefer not to be involved in any sexual activities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959353512443668">Nurius, 1983</xref>: 122).</p>
<p>Like Storms, Nurius took up asexuality unselfconsciously, taking for granted its status as a sexual orientation. While her article exhibited a lack of interest towards asexuality, she did create a proximity to <italic>pathology</italic> for asexuality. While Nurius challenged notions of homosexual pathology, her research suggested a link between <italic>asexuality</italic> and pathology through associating it with a greater risk for ‘clinical dysfunctions’ such as depression, lower self-esteem, and lower sexual satisfaction (p. 128). While we should rightly be suspicious of this early alliance between asexuality and clinical dysfunctions, Nurius did ask rhetorically: ‘to what degree is the individual’s problem rooted in their sexual preference per se and to what degree is he or she paying the price of norm-breaking via social sanctions?’ (p. 133).</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959353512443668"><italic>Masters and Johnson on Sex and Human Loving</italic> (1986)</xref>, sexologists William Masters, Virginia Johnson, and Robert Kolodny also linked asexuality with negative and pathological traits. Like the other authors considered here, they employed asexuality as a component of a sexual typology, in their case a typology of homosexuals. Emphasizing that homosexuals, like heterosexuals, live their sexualities diversely, they identified ‘asexual homosexuals’ as those ‘low in sexual interest and activity and […] not “coupled”’ (p. 365). Reviewing a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959353512443668">Bell and Weinberg (1978)</xref>, they deduced that 16 percent of male homosexuals and 11 percent of lesbians were ‘asexual’ (p. 365). They linked this asexual homosexuality with negative traits such as being ‘more secretive about their homosexuality’, being the least happy of all homosexuals (along with ‘dysfunctional homosexuals’), as ‘worse off psychologically’, having ‘considerable difficulty coping with life’, and being ‘generally loners’ (p. 365). These descriptors are affectively charged and imbued with a fear of singlehood, equating asexuality with asociality – an inability to network in the gay community, to bond through friendships, romantic partnerships, and sex. But, much like with Kinsey, this is perhaps not all that surprising since their ongoing project was broadly focused on the ‘liberation’ of sex and the investigation of sexual arousal and orgasm, and any real, unbiased interrogation of asexuality might have been antithetical to such goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959353512443668">Irvine, 1990[2005]:</xref> 59).</p>
<p>Finally, another article which accommodated asexuality is ‘The Multidimensional Scale of Sexuality’ (MSS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959353512443668">Berkey et al., 1990</xref>). Concerned, like Storms, with the expansion and definition of bisexuality, Braden Berkey et al. introduced the MSS to test for the accuracy of participants’ self-descriptions of their orientations. Their scale accommodated asexuality, with five statements designed specifically for its investigation (pp. 73–77).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0959353512443668">4</xref></sup> Although inclusion of these statements was unprecedented, and demonstrated a multi-faceted conceptualization of asexuality, none of the 148 participants actually described themselves as ‘asexual’, and thus regrettably the article did not ultimately investigate asexuality, or the results of the MSS, in any further detail. The authors speculated that ‘no subject categorized himself/herself as “asexual” [and that this was] not surprising because of its reported low frequency’ (p. 83).</p>
<p>Thus asexuality, while suggested as a ‘sexual orientation’ already from the late 1970s and early 1980s, was mentioned only sporadically and not explored in any great depth. Early findings on the rates of asexuality varied from a high of 14 to 19 percent as suggested of unmarried women by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959353512443668">Kinsey et al. (1953: 474)</xref>, to the zero percent indicated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959353512443668">Berkey et al. (1990: 77)</xref>. If anything, these varying rates, coupled with a paucity of any engaged explorations of asexuality, evince a relative disinterest in the asexual category. It seems instead that asexuality was plugged into models of sexuality for other purposes than its own categorical existence. That it was not taken up in any engaged or sustained way suggests also that it was not, at the time of these writings, a site of meaning-making, intellectual inquiry, or identity formation.</p>
<p>This is of particular interest for contemporary considerations of asexuality because it serves to flag the very contingency and constructedness of sexuality as of sexual ideals and practices. In other words, these studies’ negligence towards asexuality reminds us that asexuality, like all sexualities, is not immutable and ever-present in a self-same form. Today’s flourishing of asexual interest and meaning-formation, as I will explore in the following section, puts into sharp relief the absence of such conversations in the past. While asexuality had made its appearance in these early scientific texts, it was with a certain apathy, disinterest, incidentalness, and lack of engagement.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0959353512443668"><title>Asexual cartography: The ‘discovery’ of asexuality</title>
<p>When, in the new millennium, asexuality is taken up as a subject of inquiry in its own right, by researchers such as Anthony <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959353512443668">Bogaert (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959353512443668">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959353512443668">2008</xref>), Nicole <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959353512443668">Prause and Cynthia Graham (2007)</xref>, and Lori Brotto and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959353512443668">Brotto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959353512443668">Brotto and Yule, 2011</xref>), there is a shuffle for territory, for accurate mapping, for the production of science-knowledge. Here I draw on Jeffrey Weeks’ deployment of cartography in his discussions of the history of sexuality: sexuality as ‘virgin field’ (1981: 1), a ‘continent of knowledge, with its own rules of exploration and its own expert geographers’ (p. 12), with sexologists as ‘would-be-colonizers’ (2010: 13).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0959353512443668">5</xref></sup> Weeks also describes the pluralization of today’s sexual identities by way of similar language: ‘in this new erotic economy […] we can now witness huge clusters of islands […] each with its own unique vegetation and geography’ (2010: 88). Memorably, for Freud, women’s sexuality was also a ‘dark continent’, an enigmatic unknown, a silence worth ‘penetrating’ (1926, quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959353512443668">Weeks, 2010</xref>: 29). For Bogaert too, his first ‘study was an attempt to open up the field and begin to explore factors associated with this relatively <italic>uncharted</italic> area of sexual variability’ (2004: 279, emphasis added).</p>
<p>Emphasizing that this writing on asexuality is a form of map-making, I am suggesting that it is not neutral, value-free, and apolitical. In other words, the territory claiming and boundary drawing just beginning to take shape around asexuality is a form of sexual colonization which purports to identify and label whole sexual realities for groups of certain people. Asexuality becomes discovered (more decisively than it was before); it is drawn out of obscurity and silence and transformed into a site worthy of scientific interrogation. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959353512443668">Tiefer (2000)</xref> asserted, ‘the scientific paradigm [leads] sexologists to assume that once general laws [are] established […] sexuality [will] be thoroughly <italic>mapped</italic>’ (p. 92, emphasis added).</p>
<p>Several themes reoccur within this new scientific work on asexuality. First, and most pronouncedly, there is a veritable binding of (a)sexuality to the body (as will be discussed, the ‘proof’ of asexuality is sought in and on the body). This is hazardous because, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959353512443668">Rubin (1984)</xref> pointed out, ‘sexuality is impervious to political analysis as long as it is primarily conceived as a biological phenomenon or an aspect of individual psychology’ (p. 277). Second, asexuality becomes a site of struggle over understandings of so-called orientation and pathology, legitimacy and disorder. Third, in many cases asexuality becomes an occasion for shoring up naturalizations of sexual difference.</p>
<p>While I focus my analysis around the work of psychologist Anthony Bogaert in particular, many of the themes that appear in his work are also evident in the work of the other contemporary researchers. I have chosen to build my analysis around Bogaert because his was the first outright study of asexuality, and what follows in many ways either expands on his work, clarifying details and uncovering new aspects of asexuality, or is a direct response. Bogaert’s research is often taken up as the very proof of asexuality, the effects of which, I will argue, are to both <italic>legitimize</italic> and <italic>depathologize</italic> asexuality. Obviously, both of these aspects are very meaningful and provide a good base for further explorations of asexuality, scientific and otherwise. But I wish to provide a more complicated reading of his short texts on asexuality. Bogaert’s publications themselves (2004, 2006, 2008), as well as most other writing concerned with the scientific examination of sexuality, presents itself as value-free and neutral in its science. And yet this scientific work is often limiting and limited in its reliance on <italic>biological</italic> explanations for asexuality and a psychosocial rehearsal of confining sexual <italic>gender</italic> roles. In other words, it seems that the price paid for the legitimization and depathologization of asexuality is high – the rehearsal of limiting and normative standards of gender, as well as a veritable binding of asexuality to the body.</p>
<p>Bogaert, followed by others, essentially asked, is asexuality <italic>real</italic>? i.e. does it exist, and if it does, what is its existence? Does it qualify as an ‘orientation’? Does it (should it) have its own unique territory, with distinct borders, peculiar features, a subsystem of typologies? Or does asexuality overlap with those aspects of our sexuality that we already know to exist (i.e. for which we have scientific proof) – with certain other orientations, with particular pathologies? This is all, of course, in line with the great tradition of scientific discovery.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0959353512443668"><title>Legitimization</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959353512443668">Bogaert’s (2004)</xref> influential article ‘Asexuality: Prevalence and Associated Factors in a National Probability Sample’ used the data from the UK National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles, a national study of residents in Britain which had been published in 1994 (Johnson et al.) to investigate changes in sexual behaviour in the wake of AIDS. Fortuitously, one of the answer choices to a question designed to determine sexual orientation was ‘I have never felt sexually attracted to anyone at all’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959353512443668">Johnson et al., 1994</xref>: 185); Bogaert used these responses to assess that 1.05% of the participants were indeed asexual. Bogaert’s article attracted media attention (e.g. ‘Asexuality on 20/20’. Available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeKGOMUVU7g">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeKGOMUVU7g</ext-link>) and was also discussed online by the asexual community, such as on forums on The Asexual Visibility and Education Network (AVEN). One of its major attractions, for asexually identified persons and the media alike, was that it gave credibility to this new sexual orientation.</p>
<p>However, this 1.05 percentage is not particularly accurate or reliable, as many (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959353512443668">DeLuzio Chasin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959353512443668">Hinderliter, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959353512443668">Prause and Graham, 2007</xref>) have suggested. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959353512443668">Prause and Graham (2007)</xref> pointed out that Bogaert only used one item to test for asexuality and that he drew on preexisting data not concerned specifically with the study of asexuality. Likewise, asexually-identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959353512443668">DeLuzio Chasin (2011)</xref> argued that since the data were collected <italic>previous</italic> to the existence of the asexual community and asexual self-identification, the validity of Bogaert’s one percent is uncertain. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959353512443668">Hinderliter (2009)</xref> pointed out that the statement ‘I have never felt sexually attracted to anyone at all’, which Bogaert adopted to be the sine qua non of asexuality, assumed a permanence, absoluteness, and lack of flexibility around the category of asexuality which is unrealistic and which may have deterred many people from choosing this response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959353512443668">Hinderliter, 2009</xref>: 620; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959353512443668">Przybylo, 2011</xref>); it was also ‘functionally problematic’ because ‘people who have never felt sexual attraction do not know what sexual attraction feels like, and knowing whether or not they have ever felt it can be difficult’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959353512443668">Hinderliter, 2009</xref>: 620). In other words, the percentage Bogaert identified is not likely very reliable, accurate, or representative and it certainly does not account for the diversity of lived styles of asexuality, ranging from a preference for hugging and kissing to aromanticism, as well as additional identification as gay, straight, and bi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959353512443668">Carrigan, 2011</xref>; DeLuzio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959353512443668">Chasin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959353512443668">Scherrer, 2008</xref>). Yet, despite this, the one percentage introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959353512443668">Bogaert (2004)</xref> continues to be used as a reliable indication of widespread asexuality (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959353512443668">Swash, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>But of most interest for my discussion is not the accuracy of the prevalence rates indicated by Bogaert so much as the suggestion of validation that they provided. Because it provided an analysis of empirical data, and because it was published in the highly regarded <italic>Journal of Sex Research</italic>, Bogaert’s article became mobilized by various media sources, and by asexuals themselves, as ‘proof’ of asexuality. It fueled the wider cultural imagination, suggesting that new uncharted sexual terrains lay in wake for sexuality researchers to uncover. Bogaert’s exploration of asexuality was very different from the casual deployment of asexuality that appeared in prior research. It seemed that, at last, asexuality had come out of the shadows of indifference and entered the limelight of scientific and sexual concern.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0959353512443668"><title>Depathologization</title>
<p>Another reason why Bogaert’s work is so often and so widely taken up in relation to asexuality is because it argued against the pathologization of asexuality. For instance, in ‘Toward a Conceptual Understanding of Asexuality’ (2006), the goal of which was ‘the clarification of some basic conceptual and definitional issues’ of asexuality, Bogaert distinguished asexuality from sexual desire disorders such as hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), by the very fact that asexuals are not necessarily characterized by ‘marked distress’ and ‘interpersonal difficulty’ (p. 241) – both of which are necessary for currently diagnosing HSDD, as based on the <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959353512443668">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>: 539–541)<italic>.</italic> Unlike in his earlier work, as will be discussed shortly, Bogaert argued not for the primacy of a biological proof of asexuality, but rather began to trust more in the validity of asexuals’ self-reporting, arguing against an approach where the ‘physiological attraction/arousal supersedes […] subjective sexual attraction in determining one’s sexual orientation’ (2006: 244).</p>
<p>In his assertion that asexuality is not a pathology he is not alone; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959353512443668">Prause and Graham (2007)</xref> likewise asserted the damaging potential of assigning pathology status to a newly forming sexual identity. They even exceeded Bogaert’s claims by complicating the very notion of distress through recognizing that it might result from social expectations rather than from an innate problem, and argued that if this was the case, ‘then a psychiatric diagnosis implying abnormality may exacerbate concerns in an asexual individual’ (p. 353). They suggested, then, that to consider asexuality a pathology would be inaccurate and harmful to those who identify as asexual.</p>
<p>More recently, psychologist Lori Brotto, who specializes in low desire problems among women, along with her colleagues, has buttressed asexuality’s depathologization through qualitative, quantitative, and physiological methods in two recent studies on asexuality: ‘Asexuality: A Mixed-Methods Approach’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959353512443668">Brotto et al., 2010</xref>) and ‘Physiological and Subjective Sexual Arousal in Self-Identified Asexual Women’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959353512443668">Brotto and Yule, 2011</xref>). The first of these concluded that while ‘the border between HSDD and asexuality is unclear’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959353512443668">Brotto et al., 2010</xref>: 614), nonetheless, ‘similar to the proposition by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959353512443668">Bogaert (2006)</xref>, […] asexuals are a mentally healthy group who continue to seek out and engage in rewarding, emotionally connected relationships’ (p. 615). Like Bogaert’s work, it ultimately undermined claims that asexuality is a pathology on the basis that asexuals are not distressed. Brotto’s second study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959353512443668">Brotto and Yule, 2011)</xref>, co-authored with Morag Yule, entrenched asexuality as a non-pathology by way of physiological testing which suggested that the sexual arousal response is intact in asexual women, advising sex therapy clinicians from a ‘premature temptation […] to seek pharmaceutical and/or hormonal treatments’ for asexuality (p. 700). This is significant since it urged against hasty pharmaceutically-augmented medicalization of asexuals, in a context where a pill seems to be the answer of choice for every sexual ailment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959353512443668">Conrad, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959353512443668">Tiefer, 2006</xref>). But despite this significant depathologizing work, Brotto and colleagues, especially in the first of these studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959353512443668">Brotto et al., 2010</xref>), formed links between asexuality and disorders such as Schizoid Personality Disorder/social withdrawal – links that might, problematically, become foundational to understandings of asexuality and perhaps even to asexuals’ self-concept. Similarly, Bogaert, despite his efforts to suggest that asexuality is not a pathology, in a short 2008 chapter pondered whether those asexuals who masturbate may not have ‘sexual attraction to themselves, a paraphilia known as “automonosexualism”’, or ‘directional/target disorders […] disruptions in mate recognition mechanisms’ (p. 12). Such suggestions function to pathologize masturbation and question, again, the extent to which asexuality is a ‘healthy’ and valid sexual orientation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0959353512443668"><title>Biology</title>
<p>Of 19th century sexology, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959353512443668">Foucault (1978[1990]</xref>: 44) wrote: ‘since sexuality was a medical and medicalizable object, one had to try and detect it—as a lesion, a dysfunction, or a symptom—<italic>in the depths of the organism</italic>, or <italic>on the surface of the skin</italic>, or among all the signs of behavior’ (emphasis added). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959353512443668">Rubin (1984)</xref> likewise criticized the search for sex in hormones or psyche, in the physiological or psychological, as a form of ‘sexual essentialism’. This search for the truth of sex, <italic>on</italic> and <italic>in</italic> the body, is evident throughout the scientific work on asexuality.</p>
<p>In discussing the results of his research, Bogaert described physical development factors, such as adverse health, later menarche for women, shorter stature, and lower weight as predicting asexuality, arguing that these associations suggested that sexual attraction ‘may be [not only] partly biologically based [but also] determined prior to birth’ (2004: 284). In his later article, he underlined again his findings that asexuality might be determined prenatally: ‘asexuality ha[s] certain biological correlates that suggest a prenatal origin (e.g. potential alteration of the hypothalamus)’ (2006: 245–246). He argued that asexuality is made visible <italic>on the surface of the body</italic> by such characteristics as shorter stature and lower weight, exemplifying the ‘detective’ work that goes into uncovering the <italic>truth</italic> of our sexualities. Fixing asexuality onto the body, Bogaert effectively limited the mobility of cultural understandings, encouraging us to make sense of asexuality not through interpersonal or social analyses, but rather in terms of the reading of the body in isolation.</p>
<p>The scientific study of sex thus decrees the body a map of a person’s sexuality, promoting at the same time the normalcy of certain body types and characteristics (such as, for Bogaert, those of normal height and average weight). Earlier in the 2004 article, Bogaert set the stage for his consideration of asexuality by hypothesizing biological factors that might predicate asexuality, such as ‘illness, disease, disability […] <italic>unusual</italic> physical development characteristics – for example, short stature, obesity or extremely low weight, or late puberty onset’ (p. 280, emphasis added). The body’s appearance is here at once <italic>diagnostic</italic> of asexuality, and its raison d’être<italic>,</italic> since ‘these characteristics may be markers of poor health and development, which may alter sexual functioning and thus lead to the perception by others and themselves that they have little or no attraction for a partner of a particular sex’ (p. 280).</p>
<p>Bogaert continued on in his discussion arguing for the necessity of psychophysical research that would ‘evaluate the physiological arousal and attraction patterns of asexual people’ (2004: 286) with the intention of discriminating between those asexuals who only perceive or report their asexuality, versus those who are <italic>true</italic> asexuals. Presumably, true asexuals would demonstrate ‘a true lack of physiological attraction to a partner of either sex’ and would ‘show no physiological response to stimuli’, whereas perceived asexuals would ‘show typical attraction and arousal patterns and yet report, label, or perceive themselves as being asexual for various reasons (e.g. not aware of own arousal, deny arousal)’ (p. 286). Again, ultimately and paradoxically, Bogaert seemed unable to consider asexuality as anything other than the truth of the body. Yet, in this instance, this truth is not readily perceived in the body’s exteriority, but is concealed, embedded within the hidden mechanisms of the body, and in want of psychophysical research to be uncovered. Interestingly, however, Bogaert did somewhat soften his views of perceived versus true asexuality with his second article, recognizing that ‘physiological attraction/arousal’ should not supersede ‘subjective sexual attraction in determining one’s sexual orientation’ (2006: 244).</p>
<p>Others have also studied the body for signs of asexuality. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959353512443668">Brotto et al. (2010)</xref> commented on the possibility of a faulty maturation of adrenals during adrenarche (the period of adrenal gland maturation that is understood to occur prior to adolescence), which would then affect the release or uptake of certain hormones and thus alter sexual development, leading perhaps to asexuality. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959353512443668">Prause and Graham (2007)</xref> recommended that future research on asexuality should undertake physiological and psychophysiological testing, listing off suggested items to test for, including responses to sexual stimuli, neurological testing, and hormone profiles. But interestingly they followed this up with admitting that ‘physiological mechanisms appear unlikely to completely explain asexuality’ (p. 353). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959353512443668">Brotto and Yule (2011)</xref> finally undertook physiological research to map women’s asexuality by way of measuring vaginal pulse amplitude (VPA). Participants viewed an erotic film while having their VPA tested through vaginal photoplethysmography which ‘involves [inserting] a tampon-shaped, usually acrylic, probe, which emits infrared light and provides an index of absorbed light corresponding to the degree of genital congestion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959353512443668">Brotto and Yule, 2011</xref>: 701) – a technology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959353512443668">Irvine (1990[2005])</xref> described as a ‘represent[ation] [of] the continuing evolution of medicine’s ability to explore and conquer the inner body in the quest for knowledge, scientific truth, and clinical intervention’ (p. 161). Rebecca <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959353512443668">Jordan-Young (2010)</xref>, discussing physiological measures of subjective attraction, is likewise skeptical, arguing that such measures do not effectively account for the ways ‘that <italic>context and subjectivity matter to sexuality</italic>’ (p. 155, emphasis in original).</p>
<p>This view that sexuality, and asexuality in particular, might be discovered somewhere within the body is not however endemic to scientific studies on asexuality but operates as part of broader scientific and popular discourses which identify sex and sexuality as a <italic>biological imperative</italic>. Within the biological imperative, sexuality is manifest in the body and sex is an expression of one’s most innermost self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959353512443668">Foucault, 1978[1990</xref>]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959353512443668">Potts, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959353512443668">Rubin, 1984</xref>). Indeed, one asexually-identified participant from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959353512443668">Prause and Graham’s (2007: 345)</xref> study recycled just this logic: ‘I think people are probably biologically programmed to be interested, to have interest in sex, and it just comes naturally’, while other asexually-identified participants similarly articulated asexuality as rooted in the body – as ‘something wrong genetically’ or a ‘hormone problem’ (p. 353). This locating of asexuality on and in the body allows for asexuality to be irrevocable, perhaps providing a certain legitimacy to the participants’ sexual identity status. But it also ambivalently solidifies asexuality as beyond one’s control, rendering asexuals victims to their own biology, and obviating cultural and relational understandings of asexuality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0959353512443668"><title>Gender</title>
<p>Bogaert’s analysis also engaged in a naturalization of gender difference based on female sexual submission and male sexual dominance. In order to explain why more women than men reported asexuality (he identified 138 women and 57 men, from a sample of 18,876 participants), he proffered several explanations, including that since current definitions of sexual arousal and response are ‘target-oriented’, they ‘may not adequately capture the nature of some women’s sexuality’ (2004: 285). Bogaert suggested the possibility that sexual desire may be categorized as <italic>proceptive</italic>, ‘the urge to seek out and initiate sexual activity’, or <italic>receptive</italic>, ‘the capacity to become aroused upon encountering certain sexual circumstances’ and that, perhaps unsurprisingly, women more often demonstrate receptive desire (p. 285). Not only does this recall the ‘sleeping beauty’ model of women’s sexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959353512443668">Gerhard, 2000</xref>: 455; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959353512443668">Tyler, 2009</xref>: 44), it also suggests that women are in a sense incapable of being asexual. Bogaert’s suggestion thus evoked the active nature of men’s sexuality and the passive, coy, receptive nature of women’s sexuality in order to argue that women are often not at all aware of their own sexual impulses, and thus might <italic>perceive</italic> themselves to be asexual. In other words, Bogaert suggested a correlation between higher rates of asexuality in women with both their unawareness of their own sexual bodies – ‘they [(women)] may not be aware of their own sexual arousal as men are, even under conditions when genital responses are occurring’ (p. 284) – and with their submissive, or receptive, sexual nature. This establishes men as simultaneously more knowledgeable observers of their own bodies – ‘(s)experts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959353512443668">Potts, 2002</xref>: 60) – and more trustworthy in their asexuality (and perhaps more likely to be ‘true’ asexuals).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0959353512443668">6</xref></sup> By not exploring what cultural causes may enhance women’s rates of asexuality, Bogaert explained differences in sexual expression with inherent differences in women and men’s sexual biopsychology.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the work of Brotto and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959353512443668">Brotto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959353512443668">Brotto and Yule, 2011</xref>), two twin themes surface which suggest sexual gender differences as inherent, and as scientifically proven and provable facts. First, one theme that arises is that women cannot correlate their physiological arousal with their subjective arousal (their minds do not know when their bodies are aroused). In line with the point Bogaert made when he asserted that ‘[(women)] may not be aware of their own sexual arousal’ (2004: 284), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959353512443668">Brotto et al. (2010)</xref> noted, ‘women [are] more likely to show desynchrony between mental and physiologic arousal than men’ (p. 615). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959353512443668">Brotto and Yule (2011)</xref> expanded on this, quoting studies which suggested that women might be more incapable than men of coordinating their subjective (self-reported) and physiological (genital) arousal because they lack ‘interoceptive awareness’ (p. 709). Brotto and Yule also speculated based on their physiological study that asexual women might be unlike other women and more like men in that <italic>they</italic> might be capable of ‘interoceptive awareness’ (defined by them as ‘awareness of sensations originating from within the body’) (2011: 709) and have more concordance between their subjective and their physiological arousal responses than other women.</p>
<p>Second, and related to women’s inability to synchronize their physiological arousal with their subjective arousal, is the notion that women are more sexually ‘plastic’, pliable, and their sexualities more easily shaped by ‘cultural influences’ and ‘life circumstances [that] are atypical’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959353512443668">Bogaert, 2004</xref>: 284) than are men. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959353512443668">Brotto et al. (2010)</xref> argued that ‘women have been described as having greater sexual plasticity in sexual response and sexual orientation’ (p. 615; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959353512443668">Brotto and Yule, 2011</xref>). Similarly, Bogaert also wrote ‘that women’s sexuality (or at least their sex drive) is more “plastic” than men’s sexuality […] Thus, cultural influences may have a more profound effect on women’s sexuality than on men’s; as a result more women than men may become asexual if life circumstances are atypical’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959353512443668">Bogaert, 2004</xref>: 284).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0959353512443668">7</xref></sup> These ideas of women’s sexualities as plastic, along with the perceived lack of synchronicity between women’s physiological and subjective arousal, combine to form a sense of women as uncertain, fickle, and uncoordinated in their sexual expression and identity.</p>
<p>Two series of questions thus arise: (1) Why is the contemporary scientific study of sex, including the work of Bogaert and Brotto and colleagues, now concerned with establishing the <italic>differences</italic> between men’s and women’s sexual response? Is this the general trend of today’s sexology (perhaps in opposition to Masters and Johnson who had as ‘one of their major ideological tenets: the similarity between women and men’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959353512443668">Irvine, 1990[2005]:</xref> 60)? What might a focus on biological differences between women and men’s sexual responses suggest about contemporary sexology and sexual politics more broadly? (2) <italic>Also</italic>, why is it that this difference is based on classifying women as less aware of their bodies, less capable of coordinating their bodies with their minds, and as being more sexually receptive and pliable? Proven and provable by science, as these claims of sexual difference appear to be, and embedded within an exploration of asexuality, these ‘discoveries’ about women’s sexualities are key to understanding current patterns within scientific sexological discourse, as well as what these patterns and trends reflect about our contemporary sexual politics.</p>
<p>Meagan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959353512443668">Tyler (2009)</xref> likewise identified this relatively recent move within scientific studies of sex towards emphasizing women’s receptivity. As she pointed out, although the recent <italic>receptivity model</italic> demonstrates an effort to more accurately represent women’s experiences of desire and to challenge a model of women’s desire that is based on <italic>men’s</italic> desire (following Masters and Johnson), it ultimately ‘inhibits the possibility of women’s sexual autonomy, […] reinforces the sexual demands of men in heterosexual relationships, undermines women’s ability to refuse unwanted sexual contact, and may even promote harmful rape myths’ (p. 43).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0959353512443668">8</xref></sup> It positions women’s ‘receptivity’ as binarically opposite to men’s ‘spontaneity’, and offers an ultimately disadvantageous and potentially harmful naturalization of sexual difference. Crucially, this new model rehearses the ‘sleeping beauty’ ideal of women’s sexuality (p. 44), making it difficult for women to viably refuse unwanted (hetero)sex since <italic>receptivity</italic> becomes ‘the new standard’ for women (p. 46). In other words, in efforts to rework one faulty model of desire (namely Masters and Johnson’s), another <italic>differently faulty</italic> model has appeared, marking a shift from sexual sameness to sexual difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959353512443668">Tyler, 2009</xref>). Evincing a renewed investment in discourses of sexual difference, polarization of the sexes, and gender complementarity, this new model detrimentally essentializes women as sexually passive and receptive.</p>
<p>In the context of this new ‘receptivity’ model for women, a worrying aspect that arose within <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959353512443668">Brotto and Yule’s (2011)</xref> research concerns the suggestion that asexual women, while not experiencing a desire for sex, are nonetheless expected under certain conditions to undertake sex with a partner. Brotto, who is a psychologist and sexual therapist, advised along with Yule that ‘the (sexual/asexual) couple might be the focus of relationship therapy aimed at how to negotiate her lack of sexual attraction and what agreements can be reached about sexual activity that sufficiently appease both partners (e.g. agreeing that sexual activity may take place consensually but without interest for it on her part)’ (2011: 710). Brotto and Yule are suggesting that unwanted sex is acceptable within a certain scenario; the unwanted sex discussed in this statement is between an asexual woman and a sexual man, it is within the specific couple context in which sex is taken for granted as integral to the health of the relationship, and it is arrived at with the aid or under the guidance of a sexual therapist. Agreed upon, but unwanted sex, while perhaps consensual, is potentially harmful for asexual women, especially when emphasized within such a narrow scenario, because it pressures women into feeling that they are obliged to present their partners with sex. Nicola <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959353512443668">Gavey (2005: 136)</xref>, discussing unwanted sex, differentiated between ‘sex that is unwanted only in the sense that it takes place in the absence of desire’ and sex in which ‘women [do not] feel like they [have] a choice; when the sense of obligation and pressure is too strong’, focusing in her discussion on the latter. While Gavey’s discussion makes effective use of this distinction, drawing attention to various limits women have on sexual choice in given contexts, I would argue that the unwanted sex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959353512443668">Brotto and Yule (2011)</xref> suggested as acceptable also creates for women situations when they may feel they have no choice. Thus, perhaps the distinction Gavey identified between undesired yet agreed to sex and sex where there is no choice is not necessarily simple and obvious but rather more ambiguous and less certain. One participant from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959353512443668">Brotto et al.’s (2010)</xref> study provided an example of how undesired but negotiated sex can be not only unwanted but also perhaps absent of choice:<disp-quote>
<p>You know, the only reason I do it (intercourse) is to make the other person happy. And so, we were in a relationship and you know, he wanted to do it and we had been dating for a while and you know, I was in love or whatever and I thought we’ll be together forever. So um … yeah, so we kind of planned it and that’s … yeah … I mean it wasn’t … I mean the way he was talking about it, oh it’s so great and you’re going to love it, blah, blah, blah, and then okay … you know, I believed him … (Participant 14). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959353512443668">Brotto et al., 2010</xref>: 612)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This participant, while involved in planning or negotiating sex with her<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0959353512443668">9</xref></sup> boyfriend, seemed to have been avidly and aggressively convinced of its value through a powerful sex-is-great rhetoric. Thus, the participant was in a certain sense pressured to have sex through the operations of the same androcentric discourses which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959353512443668">Gavey (2005: 136)</xref> suggested makes ‘women […] feel like they [do not have] a choice’. In other words, it is not altogether clear whether the unwanted sex that is negotiated within the context of sex therapy between a sexual man and an asexual woman is not in fact coercive, unpleasant, and perhaps harmful to asexual women’s sense of their (a)sexual selves. That <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959353512443668">Brotto and Yule (2011: 710)</xref> advised that this sort of sex might be ‘the focus of relationship therapy’ and ‘sufficiently appease both partners’ raises questions about sex therapy, consent, and the centrality of sex within romantic relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959353512443668">Gavey, 2005</xref>: 139).</p>

<p>As I have demonstrated, while the scientific research on asexuality is instrumental in legitimizing asexuality, it does so through the reproduction of normative, essentialist, and harmful notions about (a)sexuality and sexual difference. Women are rendered as more receptive, pliable, and less sexually coordinated than men and asexuality becomes mapped on and in the biological body. Not only are naturalized views of sexual difference rehearsed, but they are also framed in what may seem at first glance a progressive and generous analysis of asexuality. Significantly, Bogaert and Brotto and colleagues ultimately assigned the status of nonpathology to asexuality, enabling it to be understood as a viable sexual orientation. At the same time, however, they did so by simultaneously rehearsing harmful and myopic ideas of sexuality and sexual-gendered difference. While this work may certainly be deployed strategically to aid in further explorations of asexuality, these texts are certainly not – as they may seem at first instance – single-mindedly empowering tracts.</p>
<p>Although sexual science is playing a central role in the formation of contemporary asexuality, this is certainly not a simple role. Instead, the scientific study of sex provides opportunities for asexual formation, identification, and action, but also functions to limit and restrict the shape that contemporary asexuality will acquire. In this article I have ultimately argued that the discourses that are woven, in part by sexology, need to be carefully considered and relentlessly scrutinized.</p>

Feminists have critiqued the Masters and Johnson model on the grounds that it provides ‘[a] false notion of sexual equivalency between men and women’ and that it overstates the ‘genital and physiological similarities between men and women’ (‘New View Manifesto’.
