<sec id="sec1-1468017312441870"><title>Fiona Gardner, <italic>Critical Spirituality: A holistic approach to contemporary practice</italic>. Farnham: Ashgate Publishing, 2011, 199 pp., £40 (pbk), ISBN: 9781409427940.</title>
<p><bold>Reviewed by:</bold> David R Hodge, <italic>Arizona State University and (Program for Research on Religion and Urban Civil Society) University of Pennsylvania, USA</italic></p>
<p>During the past decade, a growing number of books on spirituality have appeared in social work discourse. This increasingly rich vein of scholarship has been augmented once again with the publication of <italic>Critical spirituality</italic>. This text represents an important addition to the profession’s discourse on spirituality. It consists of three relatively distinct sections or parts, each consisting of four chapters.</p>
<p>Part one provides the context and relevant theoretical background for the rest of the book. The aim in this section is to outline the suppositions that contribute to practicing in a critical spiritual manner. Or put simply, the aim is to establish the underlying theoretical framework for critical practice in the area of spirituality.</p>
<p>Part two articulates a model of critical practice. As part of this model, the principles that inform practice are delineated. For instance, the procedures that social workers might use to exemplify critical practice are identified, discussed, and applied in work with individuals, families, and communities.</p>
<p>Part three profiles the experiences of four practitioners who work with spirituality in a critical manner. Written in the form of interviews, this section differs markedly in style from the previous two sections. Nevertheless, these interviews serve to illustrate the themes discussed in prior sections of the text.</p>
<p>This book is characterized by numerous strengths. As the above summary suggests, the sections build upon one another in a logical manner. The text is clearly written. Helpful summaries are provided throughout the book. The principles of critical social work practice contain multiple insights that will help social workers engage client spirituality in a positive, respectful manner.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most substantial strength, however, is the introduction of a critical perspective in the area of spirituality. As the author suggests, optimal practice is predicated upon deconstructing the values of the dominant secular culture. Culturally dominant groups often fail to understand how their beliefs and values negatively impact service provision. From the perspective of those with cultural power, present secular norms seem appropriate, correct, and even self-apparent. A critical perspective is essential for uncovering the systematic power differentials that inhibit optimal service provision. By identifying and deconstructing the biases of the dominant culture, social workers are able to develop awareness of how spiritually informed populations view reality and move toward anti-oppressive practice. This text advances social work discourse by highlighting the salience of these issues for social workers and encouraging them to implement this process in their own work with clients.</p>
<p>In terms of possible improvements, it would helpful if subsequent editions of the text fleshed out in more detail the implications of a critical perspective in the area of spirituality. For instance, the dominance of the secular culture in the centers of social and cultural power might be discussed (e.g. news media, fictional television programming, movies, popular periodicals and educational settings). This might lead into a discussion of how privileging secular values detrimentally impacts social work practice with various spiritual groups.</p>
<p>Future editions of the text might also benefit from clarifying the importance of tolerance. As presently written, the text seems to suggest that tolerance is insufficient and that social workers should actively celebrate different expressions of spirituality. It is inappropriate, however, to ask social workers to actively celebrate expressions of spirituality with which they personally disagree. For example, feminist therapists committed to egalitarian marriage relationships cannot celebrate Islam, which generally affirms complementary marriage relationships that feminists view as inherently oppressive to women. Similarly, gay men who affirm the expression of sexuality in same-sex relationships cannot celebrate Hinduism, which typically affirms the expression of sexuality within heterosexual marriage. Such individuals can learn to tolerate spiritual diversity, affirm the human rights of Muslims and Hindus, and work to advocate for their place in society as legitimate actors. However, to ask them to actively celebrate expressions of spirituality with which they disagree would violate their own moral values.</p>
<p>In addition, it would also be helpful to ground the text more deeply in the spirituality literature in social work and allied helping professions. The bibliography is under 10 pages. Incorporating recent scholarship on spirituality and fully referencing quoted material would enhance the text’s contribution to professional discourse.</p>
<p>These suggestions, however, are relatively minor in nature and do not detract from the importance of the text. As noted above, this book makes a substantial, much needed contribution to social work discourse in the area of spirituality. It will be helpful to readers interested in critical practice as well as those interested in providing more equitable services to clients.</p>
