<abstract>
<p>This article is part of a larger study of inquests into the deaths of Aboriginal people in custody. I suggest that the Aboriginal body is considered to be one that is already dead, and thus a body on whom a full measure of care would be wasted. The inquest becomes a place where this ‘‘truth’’ is established. I explore how the deaths of Aboriginal people in police custody have been persistently “medicalized” – that is, attributed to the medical condition of alcoholism, with the inevitable consequence that they cannot be connected to the violence of an ongoing colonialism. Aboriginal death becomes a timely rather than untimely death, the only thing we can expect from a disappearing race.</p>

<title>I. Introduction</title>
<p>Aboriginal people in custody are, as Achille Mbembe described for the inhabitants of death worlds, people whose bodily integrity has been replaced by pieces, fragments, folds, immense wounds that are difficult to close.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1743872111407022">1</xref></sup> Seen as people whose hold on modern life is tenuous, Aboriginal people are often considered to be beyond help. They are, in this sense, already dead. It is remarkable how many deaths in custody occur because the police will not touch, look at, or closely monitor Aboriginal people in their care assuming that such people are simply irreversibly damaged. Stopping to think about spraying their gloves for protection against infectious diseases, while a man lies dying on the ground from a fall, not even a severely wounded body gives the police pause.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1743872111407022">2</xref></sup> Accustomed to dealing with Aboriginal people as the living dead, police betray themselves when they label the personal data they collect on prisoners (such as name and age) as “Tombstone data.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1743872111407022">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Inquests into the death of Aboriginal people in custody have typically framed the circumstances surrounding death as a timely rather than untimely death, parsing the story of its violent elements. The story of timely death gains coherence through representations of Aboriginal people as possessing a pathological frailty that is more often than not associated with alcohol abuse. If Aboriginal people are a dying race and a people unable to enter modern life, then they are people that no one can really harm or repair. Despite evidence of a persistent failure to care on the part of medical professionals and the police, inquests generally conclude that no one can be held accountable for the deaths of Aboriginal people in custody. Each inquest must establish anew how much beyond saving Aboriginal people actually are and how little can be done for them. At the same time (and paradoxically), for our collective redemption, inquests repeatedly offer suggestions for improvement. Custody and the inquest are in this way a dance, a dance of death. It begins with the state ostentatiously performing the arrest for being drunk in a public place, and it proceeds with the booking, the filling of forms and the routines of custodial care. At the inquest, the dance continues as protocols and policies are hammered out to describe the things we must do as a civilization when confronted with flesh that has decayed and minds that have lost their rationality. Throughout, an astonishing negligence and violence prevails. Left untreated, wounded bodies give out and their owners’ demise is seen as natural and inevitable. It goes without saying that a damaged and dying people cannot be entrusted with self governance and stewardship over the land. Custody and the inquest therefore both bear an intrinsic relationship to continuing colonial occupation.</p>
<p>Colonial subjects are drawn into “more intimate micro-tyrannies,” writes Rutherford of Australia, as the colony moves from its early instabilities, through to the “chauvinistic uncertainties of the 1950s” and the dislocations of the 20th century.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1743872111407022">4</xref></sup> Certainly the crudeness of early settler responses hardens into the cold bureaucracies and routines of hospital care and policing in the 21st century, an inhumanity that medical science can veil. What is remarkable, however, is the settler’s continuing investment in these tyrannies and the equal compulsion to stage goodness amidst the violence, as in inquests. Inquests stage settler goodness through assembling a tableau both of Aboriginal dysfunction and of the many challenges settlers face in dealing with it. Peeping through the tableaux, however, is the killing indifference (the indifference that kills) of settler societies towards Aboriginal people.</p>
<p>In part II, I offer a few preliminary remarks about inquests into the deaths of Aboriginal people. In part III I consider the case of Paul Alphonse who died in hospital while in police custody, showing how the Aboriginal body is considered by health care professionals as so deeply destroyed by alcoholism that nothing else can destroy it, a situation that renders the body one that is not worth caring for, and one that can be violated with impunity. In part IV, I discuss two Aboriginal men who died in custody while being held in jail, cases that further show how entrenched the conviction is among the police that an Aboriginal body is beyond care. In the conclusion, I discuss <italic>why</italic> settler societies display such a killing indifference towards Aboriginal people. I suggest that while other marginalized groups may experience a similar violence in custody, notably other racialized groups, poor people and people with disabilities (for some coroners, Aboriginal people are best considered as people with disabilities, rather than as Aboriginal), the violence that is meted out to Aboriginal people in settler societies is a paradigmatic and foundational violence.</p>

<title>II. The Inquest</title>
<p>For the British context (whose common law Canada has inherited), Clare Beckett writes that<disp-quote>
<p>Any person who dies in prison or police custody is, at the time of their death, removed from community, family or friends. Their death is not open to any usual considerations: no doctor can talk to the family, no friends can reconstruct the incident … Family and friends are dependent on the actions of the coroner, and the findings of any Inquest hearing, to reconstruct the circumstances of death.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1743872111407022">5</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Scholars have long commented on the particular features of the inquest and its role in reconstructing the circumstances of death. As Beckett notes, families who expect the inquest to provide them with information about who is responsible for the death of their loved one are often bitterly disappointed. In protecting the public’s interest, the coroner’s role is to establish the cause of death and to make recommendations concerning the prevention of similar deaths; it is not to establish liability and to prosecute accordingly. The inquest is thus oriented to the future and not to the past or the present where grief-stricken families await its conclusions. Beckett reminds us that in the 12th century when it first emerged, the role of the inquest in common law was centrally to protect the Crown in criminal proceedings. Certainly this impulse of protection remains. Scraton and Chadwick, writing in 1986 of the British context, underscore that the inquest is a place designed to exonerate the police and other state professionals through “the effective building of negative reputations of the deceased.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1743872111407022">6</xref></sup> Through “speaking ill of the dead,” the inquest establishes that the dead caused or contributed to their own demise. As Dr. Johnson of the British Association of Forensic Medicine opined, people who die in custody are for the most part people who are at risk of dying anyway because they are drug addicts, alcoholics or vagrants. Scraton and Chadwick comment:<disp-quote>
<p>This position on the ‘‘type’’ of people who die in custody has serious implications at two associated levels. First, it typifies an attitude that the deaths of such people in custody remain non-controversial. It assumes that people who choke on their own vomit, hang themselves in a distressed state or die unattended in a police cell are not controversial so long as they are checked every half-hour. The easy processing of such cases through the coroner’s court as though they represent a kind of ‘‘normal’’ or ‘‘acceptable’’ death in custody is a practice of real concern. The second implication of this position is that the authorities marginalise the people concerned. A negative reputation is established and developed which suggests that <italic>they</italic> – the people who have died – are the problem. It is as if their actions have contributed to their deaths.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1743872111407022">7</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>If coroners’ courts function as Scraton and Chadwick found in the late 1980s, how might we understand the work they do in sustaining a white settler society (that is, a society established by Europeans on non-European soil whose origins lie in the dispossession and near extermination of Indigenous populations by conquering Europeans)?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1743872111407022">8</xref></sup> Although not concerned with a white <italic>settler</italic> society but a former colonial power, Scraton and Chadwick maintain that the coroner’s court is best understood as a part of the political management of marginalised groups through class, race and patriarchal prejudices. The state relies on these ideologies, they suggest, to marginalise and they identify the class system as the most significant outcome of these processes of marginalization. When a coroner’s court declares that the state (in the form of its police officers and medical personnel) has had a hard time confronting a dysfunctional and often violent population, it keeps in place a class system (one that is racialized and gendered) where poor people’s deaths at the hands of state officials simply do not count. In a 2002 article, Scraton offers the argument that the “structural relations of production (class), reproduction (patriarchy), neo-colonialism (‘race’) and age (childhood) are powerful determining contexts in terms of material conditions and the administration of criminal justice and social policy.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1743872111407022">9</xref></sup> He emphasizes that it takes a “formidable alliance” of law and medicine to produce the outcome where “speaking ill of the dead” marks marginalized populations as authors of their own demise.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1743872111407022">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>In white settler societies such as Australia and Canada, where Aboriginal land claims are vigorously pursued and where the state and corporations are enmeshed in ongoing battles over land and resources, it is the structural relations of settler colonialism, rather than the class system <italic>per se</italic> that is the powerful determining context in inquests into the deaths of Aboriginal people in custody. It is instructive to recall that in the province of British Columbia, Canada, the location of the deaths discussed here, there is considerable anxiety on the part of the provincial and federal governments to resolve the many outstanding land claims made by Aboriginal people since corporations are unwilling to invest in the province’s resource industries where land is in dispute. As Carol Blackburn has written, treaty negotiations in British Columbia may well be a new form of governmentality intended to contain the threat posed by Aboriginal land claims.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1743872111407022">11</xref></sup> Amidst the conflicts of an ongoing colonialism, responses to Aboriginal people certainly have to do with racism as so many allege, but it is a racism inextricably linked to an ongoing and increasingly heightened conflict over land. In many ways, we might consider the violence that is directed at Aboriginal peoples as the epicenter of the violence of colonial societies; it secures the material basis of settler society and installs the paradigm for all other hierarchical social relations.</p>
<p>The neglect of Aboriginal people in police custody is a well-known phenomenon, although it is rarely linked to an ongoing colonialism. Australia’s Royal Commission on Aboriginal Deaths in Custody (RCADIC) studied 18 deaths and found that they were all preventable. The Commissioner concluded that “negligence, lack of care, and/or breach of instructions on the part of custodial authorities were found to have played an important role in the circumstances leading to 13 of the 18 deaths investigated.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1743872111407022">12</xref></sup> In Canada, inquiries and a Royal Commission have documented the over-incarceration of Aboriginal people and described the neglect they encounter in the criminal justice system. The <italic>Aboriginal Justice Inquiry</italic>, for example, declared that Aboriginal peoples had encountered the most entrenched racial discrimination of any group in Canada, and the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples concluded that the criminal justice system had crushingly failed Aboriginal peoples, a failure it saw as rooted in colonialism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1743872111407022">13</xref></sup> In British Columbia, Aboriginal people are twice as likely to die in police custody than are other groups.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1743872111407022">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although there is debate about the statistics (does over-incarceration account for the higher rate of deaths in custody, for example),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1743872111407022">15</xref></sup> there is confirmation about the continuing lack of care and the breach of recommendations offered in numerous inquiries and inquests in both the Australian and Canadian contexts. Vicki Dalton notes that Aboriginal deaths in prison custody have risen steadily over the period 1980–1999 in Australia and that the most frequent cause of death for the inmate population is suicide. Further, she documents a lack of initiative to respond to the recommendations proposed by RCADIC. For example, prison cells are still being built that have hanging points in them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1743872111407022">16</xref></sup> Chris Cunneen reports that RCADIC’s findings highlighted “the intersection between the structural conditions of ‘race,’ colonialism, and criminalization, as well as the more mundane failings of administrative systems and daily practice in the way the criminal justice system operates in its day-to-day contact with people placed in care.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1743872111407022">17</xref></sup> Notwithstanding the impact of the Australian Royal Commission into Deaths in Custody, he concludes that “there has been an inability to effectively generate a greater sense of obligation and responsibility among custodial authorities toward those who are incarcerated.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1743872111407022">18</xref></sup> This “inability” to generate a greater sense of responsibility is also what troubles Howard Saper, the Correctional Investigator for Canada. As he wrote in his annual report in 2009,<disp-quote>
<p>my Office continues to review and investigate deaths in custody where the initial staff response was neither appropriate nor timely. As our reports recommend, intervention should be immediate and decisive whenever life is at risk. The Service continues to have serious compliance issues with respect to responding to situations of medical distress.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1743872111407022">19</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>With an entrenched “inability” to generate a greater sense of obligation in mind, in this article, I want to illustrate what the inquest reveals about <italic>the relationship</italic> between settlers and Aboriginal people in a white settler society still very much engaged in stealing land and resources. I suggest that the failure of inquests to move beyond insisting that cells be checked for hanging points, and that rousability checks are done, all express a necropolitical, to use Mbembe’s phrase,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1743872111407022">20</xref></sup> rather than a discriminatory impulse. That is to say, Aboriginal bodies that are considered by police and medical professionals as bodies on whom a full measure of care would be wasted, bodies marked for death, more so than they are marked for exploitation. Far more than a simple mark of inferiority, the branding mark of dysfunction is emblazoned on the flesh but given full meaning in the inquest, the place where we learn what death means. If bodies that bear this fateful X, an X marked on the epidermis, to recall Fanon, are beyond care, the inquest confirms that the state, and settlers, have nevertheless done all that could be done with such a difficult population. There is something more profound in inquests than the ongoing management of marginalized populations, and something more sinister than the routine operation of racism, sexism or class exploitation. This something is lethal. The failure on the part of police and health care professionals to provide even the most basic care reveals that the killing indifference to Aboriginal suffering so often charted in inquests springs from and simultaneously sustains the idea that Aboriginal lives are “wasted lives,” the “human waste” Zygmunt Bauman describes that is produced by modernity and that is “the deepest meaning of colonization.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1743872111407022">21</xref></sup> Settlers are able to repress what they would rather not be reminded of – that the land is stolen – and simultaneously, if Aboriginal people are waste and if the inquest can confirm that their lives are indeed wasted lives, settlers confirm themselves as its rightful owners. Given the perniciousness of violence against Aboriginal people and their eviction from the domain of universal justice, their deaths in custody and law’s response are better considered as colonial violence.</p>

<title>III. The Hospital: Once an alcoholic, only an alcoholic?</title>
<p>Paul Alphonse, a 67 year old Aboriginal man (Shuswap) was arrested for public drunkenness. During the booking process at the local detachment of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), a scuffle ensued and he fell. He was taken to hospital, found to have no injuries, and returned to the cells. A short time later, Alphonse complained of chest pains and in a second trip to the hospital, it was then determined that he had several fractured ribs. He remained in hospital until his death eight days later.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1743872111407022">22</xref></sup> This sequence of events, related by the coroner at an inquest into his death, omits several important details, notably the large purple boot print on Alphonse’s chest. It does not include the fact that his family was never contacted while he was in hospital, nor does it hint that the level of care that Paul Alphonse received might have had something to do with his death. In the terse official description, he is simply a man arrested for public drunkenness who is discovered to have had undetermined injuries and who ultimately dies, whether from the undetermined injuries or alcoholism.</p>
<p>The inquest invites us to see Alphonse’s death as one that no one could prevent and that no one could have caused. Alcohol addiction plays a key role in leading us to this conclusion by enabling the state to make the case that Alphonse was an irreparably damaged individual. The issue of separating where a victim’s prior medical conditions end and police or medical abuse begins is always controversial but no more so than when the underlying condition is chronic alcoholism. For Aboriginal people, alcoholism is as racially inflected a disease as sickle cell is for people of African origin. For instance, it is widely believed that Aboriginal peoples possess an inherent inability to process alcohol and, in comparison, that whites are able to handle it better. This myth obscures the role that alcohol played in the management of Aboriginal peoples and it occludes the pain and violence of colonialism that have led so many Aboriginal peoples to abuse alcohol. The stereotypical drunken Indian achieves its power, as all stereotypes do, precisely because alcohol abuse is a problem among Aboriginal people, a problem that began in colonialism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1743872111407022">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Notwithstanding the direct role that colonization has had in producing Aboriginal ill-health, the marker of sickness has often functioned as a racial mark, an indicator of a pathological fragility.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1743872111407022">24</xref></sup> In their work on the experiences of Aboriginal women in health care settings, Jo-Anne Fiske and Annette Brown write persuasively of the “discredited Aboriginal subject,” showing how a single discrediting factor works to mark Aboriginal women seeking health care as responsible for their own ill-health, inherently sick and dysfunctional, and often beyond the pale in terms of being helped.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1743872111407022">25</xref></sup> Importantly, they comment, those viewed as unable to govern themselves are seen as undeserving citizens, both when it comes to health care services and in matters of collective self governance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1743872111407022">26</xref></sup> Factors such as alcohol abuse, whether or not they are present, ‘‘discredit’’ Aboriginal subjects as deserving of services and of respect, tying in neatly with longstanding racist ideas of Aboriginal people as polluted, child-like, and incapable of being modern subjects. Paul Alphonse confronted all of these ideas when he was admitted to the hospital intoxicated and in police custody. Once the fact of his alcohol addiction took over, he stood little chance of being thought of as deserving of care, and even less chance of being seen as a victim of police violence.</p>
<p>For most people outside his family and community, the death of Paul Alphonse was not a remarkable event. Alphonse belonged to a generation of Aboriginal men and women called the troopers, described as a population “displaced by society, phased out of employment by technology, and negatively affected by residential school and similar historical events.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1743872111407022">27</xref></sup> Alphonse often walked 11 kilometres into town from Sugar Cane Reserve, stopping along the way to have breakfast at the house of his sister-in-law, Hazel. Once in town, he spent his time drinking with other elderly Aboriginal people who shared his own colonial history, particularly the history of residential school. It was not unusual for the police to arrest him, book him and keep him overnight in the drunk tank. In fact, prior to his death, he had been arrested no less than 70 times, although he had never been criminally charged. When Alphonse failed to come home to the reserve and his niece Kristy Palmentier went looking for him, she found her uncle strapped to a hospital chair. One of the first things she noticed, as she helped him to go to the bathroom, was a large purple bruise on his right chest, a bruise that had the pattern of a boot or a shoe. As the pathologist would later conclude, somebody had “stomped” on Paul Alphonse, fracturing five of his ribs. When Alphonse died shortly after she found him, the question of the bruise, and the kind of care he had received while in police custody and in the hospital became urgent questions to be taken up in an inquest. These questions were principally taken up as <italic>medical</italic> issues related to Alphonse’s alcohol abuse.</p>
<p>Medicalizing unfolds in the inquest as a focus on the inherent frailty of alcoholics and the challenge their care poses for medical professionals. The boot print on Alphonse’s chest is briefly explored as a contributing factor, but one about which frustratingly little is known. It is never established who delivered the blow that left a boot print, or whether the injury could have occurred while Alphonse was in police custody. When the boot print matched Alphonse’s own boot, the inquest was confronted with the possibility that someone used Alphonse’s own boot to stomp on him but this line of inquiry was not pursued beyond seeking to establish (and failing) whether Alphonse’s nephew could have been wearing a similar boot. Instead, the inquest focused on pneumonia as the official cause of death, and blunt force trauma from an undetermined source as an aggravating factor. Medical personnel mostly assumed that Alphonse was a chronic alcoholic who was likely suffering from alcohol withdrawal. That he was also suffering from pneumonia and several broken ribs, and had to be treated accordingly was not uppermost in the minds of the doctors charged with his care. Perhaps the fact that alcohol withdrawal attracted considerably more attention than pneumonia is understandable given that Alphonse was indeed a chronic alcoholic who had been admitted to hospital before, but the apparent inability of hospital personnel to consider him in any other category except alcoholic in severe withdrawal has to be put in the context of other things that were happening, notably the inattention to the boot print. The hospital’s failure to inform his family of his hospitalization (and thus to consider Alphonse as a man with a community), and their apparent inattention to his deteriorating condition, when put alongside the insistence of legal counsel for the RCMP and some medical personnel that Alphonse’s vulnerability lay principally with the fact that he was a chronic alcoholic, suggest that he remained first and foremost an inherently sick body, a man who was therefore responsible for his own demise.</p>
<sec id="section4-1743872111407022">
<title>1 The issue of pneumonia</title>
<p>Dr. Thomas Perry appeared before the inquest as an expert in clinical pharmacology, internal medicine, and pneumonia. Since people with chronic alcoholism are often admitted to hospital with pneumonia, and often undergo alcohol withdrawal, Dr. Perry was asked to shed light on the role that alcohol withdrawal played in connection with the pneumonia, and how this might have influenced the medical treatment Paul Alphonse received. Reading the hospital records and the autopsy report, Dr. Perry came to one central conclusion:<disp-quote>
<p>I think what happened is at the time he was admitted to the Cariboo Hospital at around 11:30 at night on the 11th, he had something profound already going on in his lungs, and I think it’s clear from the medical and the nursing records that he had identifiable new rib fractures from the X-ray, but not – not the bruise that’s so obvious in the autopsy photographs that I have just seen here today. So – and he was also obviously drunk. And the initial focus of the medical and nursing staff was to categorize him as drunk and liable to alcohol withdrawal, and having substantial pain from fractured ribs and needing general observation. <bold>And that there was a failure to recognize that something serious was going on in his lungs right from that time.</bold><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1743872111407022">28</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Dr. Perry commented that in his reading of Alphonse’s chart, the nurses “don’t appear to have noticed how sick he was.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1743872111407022">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the nurses and the attending physician all heard crackles in Alphonse’s lungs and noted that his oxygen intake was low, they did not then conclude that pneumonia was a distinct possibility, something Dr. Perry found inexcusable. As Dr. Perry explained at the inquest, there are only three possible explanations for crackles in the lungs; pneumonia, heart failure, and, very rarely, an “interstitial lung disease.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1743872111407022">30</xref></sup> Although an x-ray did not disclose pneumonia, Dr. Perry commented that this in itself was not unusual. Given the seriousness of pneumonia in an older person, let alone one with chronic alcoholism who spent time on the streets, Dr. Perry felt strongly that published guidelines would indicate that Alphonse should be automatically hospitalized for possible pneumonia. A person this sick, Dr. Perry speculated, would have had him rushing to contact family in case of cardiac arrest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1743872111407022">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>The fact that alarm bells did not go off about the crackles in Alphonse’s lung may explain subsequent events. For Dr. Perry, once a patient is suspected of suffering from a serious illness, the proper course of action would then be to seek to confirm the diagnosis, analyze blood cultures, and ensure adequate oxygen. In Alphonse’s case, cultures were ordered for the following day, and then not again, and no effort was made to ensure that Alphonse did not pull off the oxygen mask (for instance, by contacting the family to help with care). When asked whether alcohol would have masked some of what was going on with pneumonia, Dr. Perry acknowledged that it would do so. If one was focused on alcohol withdrawal, symptoms such as delirium and erratic behaviour such as pulling off an oxygen mask would likely be attributed to it rather than other causes. Delirium, however, could have just as easily been due to low oxygen levels and serious infection, possibly compounded by drugs such as the gravol and atrophine given to Alphonse.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1743872111407022">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>Indeed, for Dr. Perry, several practices concerning alcohol withdrawal were in place at Cariboo Memorial Hospital that limited the attention that could have been paid to pneumonia. The hospital utilized a form based on the Chemical Dependency Resource Team Protocol (CDRTP) that focused on high but not low blood pressure, and a high rather than low respiratory rate. Clearly, Dr. Perry concluded, the hospital needed a better way to approach alcohol withdrawal since pneumonia would mean that low pressure and a low respiratory rate were important indices of a worsening condition. (Alphonse’s temperature may also have fallen dangerously low as a result of having been placed in a cold drunk tank while wearing only a T-shirt.) The hospital prescribed phenobarbital for the withdrawal symptoms, a powerful sedative that Dr. Perry felt has not been in use for twenty or more years owing to the fact that it stayed in the body a very long time and sometimes made patients appear brain dead.</p>
<p>If it is difficult to establish the hospital’s culpability regarding failure to treat the pneumonia aggressively, the matter of the boot print complicates matters further. Dr. Donna Rice, the pathologist, attributed Alphonse’s death to pneumonia but maintained that the broken ribs, caused by blunt force trauma, were the contributing factor. Pointing out that the broken ribs were above the right lung, and the pneumonia was in the left lung, Dr. Perry believed that the underlying cause of death was poverty and alcoholism rather than blunt force trauma. The injury, in other words, did not contribute to the pneumonia which was already far advanced at the time of admission. Had it done so, there would have been pneumonia in the right lung rather than the left.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1743872111407022">33</xref></sup> For Dr. Perry, the inquest should put the focus on the failure of the hospital to pay sufficient attention to Paul Alphonse as an old person and a chronic alcoholic suffering from pneumonia. Dr. Perry maps indifference but for him its origins lie in a lack of knowledge about pneumonia in a population of chronic alcoholics and in outmoded knowledge about drugs. (This would still, however, beg the question of why Williams Lake remains medically anachronistic with respect to its Aboriginal population and inattentive to their specific medical issues.)</p>
<p>It is difficult to determine fully the merits of Dr. Perry’s view but it is clear that both the emergency room physician on duty that night, Dr. Wilford, and Alphonse’s family doctor, Dr. Neufield, concluded that Paul Alphonse was suffering from fractured ribs <italic>and</italic> alcohol abuse. As Dr. Neufield reminded the coroner, Alphonse had had 14 visits to the hospital for alcohol-related problems and he bore the marks of chronic alcohol abuse, notably low body weight and malnutrition. If there were crackles in his lungs, Dr. Neufield believed that these were simply because his was the kind of chest that “will always have crackles and wheezes to it.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1743872111407022">34</xref></sup> Whatever symptoms Alphonse exhibited during his stay in hospital, Dr. Neufield believed, were consistent with alcohol withdrawal and with someone who probably had chronic bronchitis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1743872111407022">35</xref></sup> Furthermore, Dr. Neufield insisted that he would have continued treating for alcohol withdrawal even if he knew that Alphonse had pneumonia, simply because 15% of people who are heavy drinkers die from alcohol withdrawal: “There is no doubt that you have to treat it aggressively.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1743872111407022">36</xref></sup> He would, for instance, still have chosen to use phenobarbital and he contested Dr. Perry’s view that the drug had not been in use for 20 years. Defending himself, Neufield also maintained that no one could have seen that Alphonse had pneumonia until the day he died.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1743872111407022">37</xref></sup> Agreeing with the pathologist, Dr. Donna Rice, he also specifically rejected Dr. Perry’s opinion that the blunt force trauma did not contribute to his death. A trauma to the chest, regardless of which side it occurred, could contribute to a worsening pneumonia. In the end, although it is hard to thread one’s way through these conflicting medical opinions, it is clear that other than Dr. Perry who believed that Alphonse died of pneumonia that was not properly treated, the medical professionals concerned either assumed or concluded that Alphonse was suffering from alcohol withdrawal and fractured ribs, a condition that did not merit undue attention.</p>

<title>2 The boot print</title>
<p>The large purple bruise which shocked Paul Alphonse’s niece Kristy Palmentier, when she eventually found her uncle in the hospital on the last day of his life presented the inquest with an intractable problem. The pathologist maintained in her autopsy report and on the stand that the bruise was seven to ten days old when Paul Alphonse was admitted to hospital. She based her assessment on the fact that an injury of the kind sustained by Paul Alphonse would have led to bruising and would have been visible almost immediately owing to the fact that Alphonse did not have a lot of skin tissue. However, because of his poor nutritional state and pneumonia, the healing process would have been extremely delayed and stopped altogether. As Dr. Rice explained to the jury, the body chooses to fight the infection instead of healing the bruise. Quite certain that the bruise would have been present at the time of his admission to the hospital or very shortly thereafter, Dr. Rice’s testimony posed a central difficulty: If the bruise was there, why did no one see it? For her, it was not odd that no one noticed the bruise because it would have been covered by Alphonse’s arm. Even more mysterious, if Alphonse already had his five broken ribs at the time he entered police custody and upon his first and second admissions to the hospital, why did he not present with chest pain until the second admission to the hospital? For Dr. Rice, the answer lay once again in his chronic alcoholism. The alcohol dulled the pain.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1743872111407022">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>The first physician to see Alphonse while he was in police custody did so at 5:30 p.m. on April 11 when he was transported to the hospital. As Dr. Quigg, the physician on duty, explained, he could have missed seeing the bruise because he was looking for a head injury (he had been told by the police that Alphonse had fallen and hit his head in the police station) and because Alphonse did not complain of extreme pain.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1743872111407022">39</xref></sup> Disagreeing with Dr. Rice that a chronic alcoholic who is intoxicated feels less pain, Dr. Quigg felt certain that Alphonse was not in severe pain as might be warranted by a rib injury when he saw him upon his first hospital admission that night. One can only infer, then, that for him, Alphonse did not break his ribs until after his first admission to hospital. It is indeed contradictory that he should have had both the injury and the bruise and yet given no indication of great pain.</p>
<p>It is particularly striking that when Alphonse was taken to hospital a second time on the night of the 11th complaining of pain in the chest area, that there was so little recorded interest in what might have caused the rib fractures. Alphonse had been “stomped on,” according to Dr. Rice, but few charged with his care pursue how he came to break his ribs. The emergency room nurse Elaine Cawley testified that she asked Alphonse why his chest hurt and she had to ask him twice before she got a mumbled answer that he guessed he fell. She could not recall where the RCMP officer Irwin was when she posed this question to Alphonse.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1743872111407022">40</xref></sup> The attending physician Dr. Wilford, did not ask about the source of the fractured ribs. He did not recall seeing any bruising. Dr Neufield, Alphonse’s family physician, who saw Alphonse in the hospital, had only the vaguest recollection of a bruise and maintained, when pressed to be more specific, that the point of care for him was not the bruising but the pain from the fractured ribs and the problem of alcohol withdrawal.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1743872111407022">41</xref></sup> In sum, no medical professional displays any enduring interest in how Alphonse came to fracture his ribs. It was as though his condition required no explanation. Many knew him to be one of the troopers and whatever that meant to them, it did not include that his injuries could have come about from something other than his chronic alcoholism. Alcoholism is advanced as the reason why no one saw the bruise (he did not complain of pain), and it is advanced as a reason why we can conclude how old the bruise is (his state of nutrition exacerbated by his chronic alcoholism retarded his healing but also caused bruising to be very visible early on). No one saw the boot print, although the pathologist declared that it must have been hyper-visible. The boot’s impact likely broke five ribs and was a contributing factor to Alphonse’s death, yet little attention is given to it beyond establishing that it did not belong to a police officer and did belong to Alphonse himself. For many of those testifying, alcohol ironed out these mysteries and contradictions, explaining why Alphonse’s pneumonia was not of greater concern and why the boot print and the broken ribs were not startling facts to be investigated and considered. Alphonse, it seems, could not be simply an old man with a serious case of pneumonia, nor could he be an old man whom someone (and possibly the police) had violently assaulted.</p>
<p>In their recommendations, the jury suggested that the hospital develop guidelines for dealing with the troopers, that it pay attention to the medical expert, Dr. Perry, who had noted the hospital’s antiquated and ill-considered methods for treating alcoholics, and that it chart all bruises. Recommendations concerning the police consisted of reminding the RCMP that there should be working surveillance cameras and secure seating in booking areas, and that mattresses and blankets should be provided to elderly, Aboriginal prisoners. Incidents involving prisoners needing medical attention should be documented. Further, the RCMP should learn how to deal with First Nations populations, and in particular populations such as the troopers. Many of these recommendations, particularly those urging respect for Aboriginal peoples and those suggesting the need to have working surveillance cameras, repeat those made by Judge Anthony Sarich eight years earlier in an inquiry into police brutality in the Cariboo Chilcotin (the same area where Paul Alphonse lived) and they repeat recommendations made in other inquests into the deaths of Aboriginal people in custody, as I discuss below.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1743872111407022">42</xref></sup></p>

<title>IV. The Jail: A Population Beyond Help</title>
<p>Alcohol and Aboriginality simultaneously mark the body as one that contains within it the poisonous seeds of its own demise. Police perform the routines of maintaining public space free from contamination, duties that involve the arrest and detention of degenerate bodies, but that cannot also include the duty to actively care for such surplus, contaminated, and wounded populations. As Mbembe suggested, under Apartheid, wasting Black life had to be construed as a necessary sacrifice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1743872111407022">43</xref></sup> The sacrifice cleanses and preserves modern society, purging it of its undesirable elements. If the assumption of Aboriginal life as wasted life is shrouded in medicine when a death has occurred in hospital, in a jail this covering is less available. At the same time, since custodial care can easily be presented as a lesser kind of care than medical care, it is easier to maintain that a body has simply given out when there has been an Aboriginal death in jail. In the two cases I discuss in this part, CT and SQ died the same weekend and were both arrested the same day August 4, 2007 in the province of British Columbia. SQ died that same day, CT died in the early morning of August 5, 2007.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1743872111407022">44</xref></sup> A coincidence but an indicator nonetheless of the patterns of Aboriginal deaths, two men, in two different cells, die around the same time. The inquests into their deaths reveal that they were indeed of a kind, both treated as having bodies beyond care.</p>
<sec id="section7-1743872111407022">
<title>1 CT and a race of shallow breathers</title>
<p>At 6:30 p.m. as he waited for his buddy to find a ferry ride home to the reserve, CT was arrested for being drunk in a public place. The arresting officer knew him well as someone who frequently got drunk and, as he explained at the inquest, he arrested CT for his own good. For Sergeant Lucas, drunk Aboriginal people who are booked regularly “know now they’re in a warm place and they can just go to sleep and not worry about anything, and that’s how I viewed it.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-1743872111407022">45</xref></sup> CT was polite and friendly and thanked the officer when he was given a blanket and a mattress (something that is not given to everyone). Once in the cell, he was checked from a distance by a civilian guard who acknowledged (in conversation with a police officer that night) that it was hard to tell if someone is breathing. The log book established that CT had not moved for two hours. The camera in the cell that enables guards (who are not allowed into the cells without an officer) to check him was not working, something the guard knew. At 4 a.m. a guard called for officers and alerted them that CT had not moved. The guard called for an ambulance. A constable tried to shake CT awake, was unable to do so, and called for a mask and first aid kit. He attempted two breaths of CPR. The officer did not do chest compressions and by his own admission did not “really” attempt to do CPR because he knew CT was dead. He then took photos of the dead prisoner. When the ambulance arrived, no one briefed the attendants about what had happened.</p>
<p>At the inquest, the civilian guard testified that from past experience he knew that CT was “a shallow breather, as a lot of native people are.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-1743872111407022">46</xref></sup> He was not therefore unduly worried about CT appearing not to move or to breathe. The guard had even taught CT in kindergarten and was confident in what he knew about him. This same guard calmly accepted that CT was dead and once he phoned for the ambulance (whom he informed that the prisoner was already dead) did not go back to the cell to find out if he could help or even to establish what was going on. As he explained with irritation, “I tried to stay out of the way. I’m not – I mean, I don’t have as much first aid ability as they do, for crying out loud.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-1743872111407022">47</xref></sup> It is difficult to find a word to describe the responses of the guards and the police officers above. They were not altogether indifferent; indeed some understood detention as the most humane option possible. For all, however, custody did not mean care beyond the barest minimum, and protocols and procedures about the checking of prisoners every thirty minutes notwithstanding, the guards and police officers offered little evidence that they saw their charges as imperilled and vulnerable, even though, paradoxically, it is their prisoners’ vulnerability that justified detention in the first place. How can we make sense of this paradox?</p>
<p>The inquest offers few clues as to the presence of an outright racial hostility that might account for the guards’ and police officers’ indifference and negligence. Instead we can trace a noticeable and persistent belief in the pathological vulnerability of Aboriginal peoples and an equally strong conviction that it would be useless to provide care. The pathologist was unable to establish cause of death. Taking care to itemize CT’s medical history including his “large fatty liver,” and large heart, the coroner concluded that the actions of the police and guards did not in any way change the outcome for CT.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-1743872111407022">48</xref></sup> There is a steady culturalizing that makes wounds and injuries appear as innate and therefore unfixable. CT’s condition of ill health is so naturalized – they all breathe shallowly and have fatty livers – that it is possible to consider the guards’ indifference as reasonable. We can believe Constable Lucas when he presents CT’s detention as a humanitarian gesture – as simply the kindest thing one can do to a people so much beyond help and find no contradiction in his bringing a man who is incapacitated into the warmth, and yet failing to check if he was breathing. Even as it conveys the futility of care, the inquest preserves the possibility of room for improvement. The inquest concludes with recommendations for guards to physically check cells every fifteen minutes and to have mandatory working cameras and better CPR training. Police officers are reminded to fill out and consult C13 forms that describe a prisoner’s condition. The jury further recommends that the band receive funding for alcohol and drug prevention and that the state make an effort to provide sports facilities for younger generations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-1743872111407022">49</xref></sup> In the case below, abandonment is again demonstrated as police officers and others make clear their belief that death is always imminent for their Aboriginal prisoners, a situation about which they can do nothing.</p>

<sec id="section8-1743872111407022">
<title>2 SQ: “I don’t want him to die in the cells”</title>
<p>As with CT and so many other Aboriginal people who die in police custody, SQ was drinking when he was arrested. SQ apparently picked a fight with L and either a punch or a kick from L brought SQ smashing down on the concrete in an unbroken fall. Sgt Dickie received a call on his radio informing him that a man was down nearby and that an ambulance had been called. He found SQ conscious, not very alert, and with a good sized bump on his head. Sgt Dickie knew SQ well and thought him unusually subdued in comparison to the other times he had arrested him, times in which he had sometimes also fallen and hit his head while intoxicated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-1743872111407022">50</xref></sup> SQ was taken to a nearby clinic where he was seen by a doctor who was in fact his family physician. The doctor released SQ to the care of the police (since SQ had nowhere else to go and was very intoxicated and with a head injury). Questioned as to why it did not occur to him to send SQ to be assessed by emergency, the doctor offered the following:<disp-quote>
<p>Yeah certainly did, it was something that did cross my mind as well. As I mention, at the time he was – he was more or less stable other than the intoxication and my concern was more just monitoring, but I certainly did give consideration to having him go to the hospital. But I – I didn’t make that move. I thought he’d been in and out of the hospital so many times in – in recent weeks and months, I just wasn’t sure what the emergency department was going to say if I phoned again, and so I – but, as I say, I think the main thought was that I just wanted him monitored primarily.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-1743872111407022">51</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Apparently apprehensive about the hospital viewing SQ as a nuisance, his doctor preferred to take his chances with the police as monitors. Curiously, although he wanted SQ monitored, the doctor did not provide instructions to the police as to how to deal with prisoners with head injuries, and did not warn them that chronic alcoholics are more likely to have complications from head injuries. He was also unaware that SQ had had a seizure in the cells two days earlier and had been admitted to hospital then although he indicated that he knew of SQ’s multiple hospital admissions. [It is of note that a friend of SQ (who has since died) tried to persuade the police to take SQ to the hospital and may have tried continually throughout the day.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-1743872111407022">52</xref></sup>] What makes it possible to know a patient’s history, and thus his fragility, and yet not take steps to ensure his well-being?</p>
<p>SQ’s history, head trauma and gross intoxication did not prompt police officers to treat SQ as particularly vulnerable. Sgt Dickie did not attempt to speak to SQ when he transported him to the jail (a 20 minute ride), something one might consider strange if monitoring for a head wound is necessary. When they arrived at the station, SQ was apparently covered in drool and excrement and Sgt Slater went in search of latex gloves in order to properly deal with him. As Cst Slater told the inquest, SQ “was a biohazard to pick up and carry.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-1743872111407022">53</xref></sup> Sgt Dickie did not wait for Sgt Slater’s return and claims that he took SQ out of the police truck himself and laid him on the cold concrete ground, something that seems implausible given how hard it would be for one man to carry another, especially when the latter is almost inert. When Sgt Slater returned with the gloves, the two officers dragged SQ to the cells. There is some dispute as to whether the guard on duty was told of the head injury but the C13 form that is filled out at booking and intended to record the condition of the prisoner and other important details, contains a notation that SQ had a head injury. The form did not indicate whether a rousability check (which is a part of protocol) was done upon booking.</p>
<p>For six hours, SQ did not change position and the guard on duty noted only that she checked him and that he was breathing. When another guard, Scott Strickland, came on duty, he recalled that SQ had a seizure two days ago and he suggested that SQ should be taken to hospital. Despite his stated concern about SQ needing hospital care, Strickland did not then check on SQ more carefully. When Corporal Falebrinza overheard the conversation about the hospital that occurred between the guards, he insisted that a doctor had already declared SQ fit for incarceration and pronounced that “we can’t go doctor-shopping.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-1743872111407022">54</xref></sup> As Strickland indicated at the inquest, “that was good enough for me.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-1743872111407022">55</xref></sup> Corporal Falebrinza also maintained that Strickland’s concern was that SQ might die in the cells and (perhaps sharing that concern) Corporal Falebrinza (who also claims that he did not know of the head injury even though it had been recorded) testified that he called SQ’s name and the latter grunted, which indicated to him that there was no need to go to the hospital.</p>
<p>Corporal Falebrinza’s testimony provides insight into the nature of the response to SQ on the part of the guards and the police. SQ was someone to be warehoused, rather than cared for. The testimony bears repeating in full:<disp-quote>
<p>And they said we’re going take – I believe it’s – the guard Scotty Strickland at that point had said we’re going to take Q… up to the – the hospital, I don’t want him in – I don’t want him in cells. He had a seizure two days previously and so I don’t want him in cells, I don’t want – I don’t want him to die in cells. And I had asked well – well, what is – the seizure was two days previous. What has changed in his condition from when Sgt. Dickie had brought him in the afternoon, when he’d booked him in, like what had changed. And he’d booked him in, like what has changed. And at some point during that, I had approached the cell, the – it was actually – I believe it was the drunk tank number 2. I did approach the – the actual drunk tank and I – I’d called out and I said S, and he had sort of – he grunted and – and lifted his head, which with somebody brought in at the level of intoxication that he – was assumed that he was at, would have been proper – didn’t cause me any real concern, and so I said we can’t go doctor-shopping. We can’t take him back to Penticton Hospital simply because of – we don’t want him in our cells. He has to go somewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-1743872111407022">56</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Over the course of several hours, other prisoners were brought to the cell and the police maintained that they checked SQ’s breathing and noted that he made slight movements and grunts. When questioned about when and how such “rousability” checks were done, however, it becomes clear that checking to see if the prisoner is conscious or alive is not the priority of the police. As Sgt Dickie explained,<disp-quote>
<p>There are occasions when, you know, obviously sometimes when we bring in intoxicated people we don’t want to wake them up – … because of , you know, violent situations things like that, you know, original – or initially anyway.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-1743872111407022">57</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The sentiment that waking up prisoners was more trouble than it was worth also emerges in Sgt Tremblay’s testimony about his knowledge of the 30 minute rousability policy.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>But I – I will say this, that in most cases where drunks or people that are being brought in for – in a drunken state – if they are calm for 30 minutes, it’s a – it’s a blessing, and I can’t see a guard going in there and rousing them every 30 minutes just to have him create a disturbance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-1743872111407022">58</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Care, it seems, is the last thing on the minds of the guards and police officers.</p>
<p>At 9:30 that night, a guard asked a police officer to check SQ and the latter determined that he was not “rousable.” The guard called for an ambulance informing dispatch that it was a routine rather than an emergency matter. The paramedics who arrived seven minutes later considered SQ to be a serious case and at the hospital it was determined that he had intracranial bleeding. He was rushed to a hospital nearby where he could be seen by a neurologist but he was pronounced dead upon arrival.</p>
<p>As with CT, it is not immediately evident that the police and medical personnel bear any specific racial animus to SQ or indeed to Aboriginal people specifically. Instead, believing themselves to be on familiar terrain, terrain they understand to be the warehousing of drunks who are simply sleeping off the effects of alcohol, they find nothing in SQ’s history or head trauma to prompt them to act otherwise. It is this that is so striking. What impedes their capacity to think that the body before them is one requiring care? Perhaps this question should be asked another way: why is this body not seen as deserving of a care that might enable survival? It is easy to imagine one answer to this question: nothing the police or medical personnel can do will change the outcome. Indeed, this is the response the police formally offer to the coroner.</p>
<p>The police investigate themselves in British Columbia, something that is presently under review, and the RCMP officer in charge of the investigation into SQ’s death found little to worry him in the files of the case. Challenged about specific moments of apparent negligence, Sgt Tremblay offered a significant defence of the police’s actions. If there was a lax enforcement, for instance of the rousability requirements, he suggested, it was only because SQ had been there so often, and had always managed to walk out on his own steam.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-1743872111407022">59</xref></sup> Guards and officers could be forgiven for believing that this time was no different. The police did the best they could, he insisted, with someone who would have died anyway.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Perhaps the question that – that begs to be asked is why is Mr. Q in our custody to begin with? Let’s say, for instance – lets’ say, for instance, that Cst. – or Sgt. Dickie would have chosen not to bring him in to Penticton detachment cells. What would have happened then? Who would have been there to check on his rousability? No one. Perhaps he would have died in a park, perhaps on a park bench, perhaps on his couch …</p>
<p>Would we be here today? No. So I think we have to be careful. We have to take in – a couple of things into consideration. People who enter that threshold, the threshold of our detachment cellblock, are at extremely high risk. We accept that and there’s measures – we take whatever measures we can to prevent those people from – from dying in our custody. We don’t encourage it, we don’t like having to go through this process. But what I’m concerned about is that if it comes to ignoring those people, the needs of these people and our members begin turning their back – or turning their backs on because they don’t want to experience this type of thing, then I’m afraid that these people are in fact going to start meeting their demise in places other than the – the cellblock. So I think the question that begs to be answered – begs to be asked and answered is – is why he was there in the first place, and – and I think the answer to that is ’cause there’s nowhere else for him to go. He wasn’t admitted, so he becomes arrestable because in this case he’s not able to look after himself. There’s perhaps a chance that he’s going to re-offend by – causing a disturbance or – or getting into another altercation, so he’s taken into custody.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-1743872111407022">60</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sgt Tremblay delivers a stark warning: “we don’t like having to go through this process.” If the police decide that they will simply stop arresting Aboriginal people because of the possibility of an inquest into their death, then Aboriginal people will simply meet their demise in places other than the cellblock. They will also continue to cause disturbances. Sgt Tremblay cannot imagine that the state has a duty to care. Faced with such warnings, there is little new for a jury to propose. The jury enjoins the police to properly fill out C13 forms and ensure that guards are trained in how to assess prisoner responsiveness. As though expressing frustration with the scope of what can be said, they emphasize that police must never assume that a prisoner is simply sleeping off the effects of alcohol. To monitor, the jury notes, means to watch or observe without interruption.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-1743872111407022">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>Prior medical conditions, moments of acute traumas (blows to the head), communicative acts such as a friend’s plea that SQ be taken to the hospital, and C13 forms, so pervasively ignored, as several inquests into the deaths of Aboriginal people reveal, are outside the ambit of the task of waste disposal. SQ’s grunts in relation to a question, Paul Alphonse’s mumbles when asked about who might have stomped on him, and CT’s failure to respond when called, do not unduly disturb the police; perhaps grunts and mumbles are all they expect. It is not surprising that administrative systems fail and there is such an entrenched failure to exercise care. To exercise care is to waste effort. In the face of this logic, coroners’ recommendations that have to do with C13 forms, policies on head traumas and better monitoring procedures, will likely be ignored, as they have so many times before. Inquests memorialize Aboriginal disappearance anew, reminding us that such bodies are beyond care; they have already disappeared. Can a body that is already dead die from negligence? Inquests necessarily conclude not.</p>

Disabled people are disturbed by their marginalization and nondisabled people are disturbed by what they experience as a reminder of their own fragility, vulnerability and mortality: “Disability reminds people of something they know about but would rather act as though they do not – their mortality.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-1743872111407022">65</xref></sup> Nondisabled people deal with disturbance by installing nondisability as normalcy. The consequence for disabled people is expulsion: “Since disability is tightly bound to the biomedical model of the body in contemporary society, it is almost impossible to conceive of it as a category of societal membership.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-1743872111407022">66</xref></sup> As Michalko insightfully observes, in the biomedical model, the proper response to disability becomes humane treatment and not human rights, since disability is a medical condition and not a condition of oppression. Recalling Levinas, Michalko proposes:<disp-quote>
<p>What the nondisabled other suffers in the face of disability, then, is the suffering that comes from being present to one experienced as a “victim of misfortune.” The difference of disability thus becomes the useless-difference borne by anyone victimized (disturbed) by misfortune.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-1743872111407022">67</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Disability comes to mean (in Levinas’s words) the “moans, cries, groans, and sighs of suffering” that emanate from those “whose naturalness (or humanness) has been erased.” Those who view their own naturalness and humanness as remaining intact respond with pity and “the promised salvation of aid and curative help.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-1743872111407022">68</xref></sup> Disability, or rather the disturbance produced by disability, thus generates the ethical requirement to remedy it, a task that promises redemption for those not ‘‘suffering’’ disability themselves.</p>
<p>Aboriginality is often viewed as a disabling “condition.” Indeed, the most progressive of inquests and inquiries, those, that is, that acknowledge injury to Aboriginal people, insist on a direct parallel between Aboriginality and disability.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-1743872111407022">69</xref></sup> Not surprisingly, the ‘‘natural body’’ that is made possible by viewing disability as a flawed version of humanity, is the same ‘‘natural body’’ that installs the settler as owner of himself, and as owner of land. Flawed bodies (insufficiently modern bodies frozen in a pre-modern, pre-capitalist mode)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-1743872111407022">70</xref></sup> are not owners, as the legal principle of <italic>terra nullius</italic> confirms. The comparison between disability and Aboriginality yields both similarities and differences. Aboriginality disturbs, as does disability, and Aboriginality reminds settlers of something they know but would rather not, and indeed cannot know if they are to continue a colonial relationship. But what is remembered and consequently repressed differs. Settlers must repress knowledge of their own violent histories of conquest and occupation. The disturbance that is Aboriginality is thus intimately related to the land and to colonialism. Writing about the depiction of Indians as ghosts in American national literature, Renee Bergland observes that<disp-quote>
<p>the ghosting of Indians is a technique of removal. By writing about Indians as ghosts, white writers effectively remove them from American lands, and place them, instead, within the American imagination.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-1743872111407022">71</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is as though Native Americans have vanished into the minds of those who have dispossessed them. Confining Indians to the “spectral,” European Americans become original citizens. Bergland’s provocative argument that ghosts are also powerful figures that haunt and her declaration that the land is haunted because it is stolen reminds us that settlers cannot simply forget, particularly when we consider that the land is still being stolen. Settlers’ feelings of dread and creeping horror remain, Bergland suggests, and there is considerable anxiety surrounding the way European Americans imagine themselves as the original citizens of this land, and as a people innocent of conquest and violence. The very thought of Indians must then be forcefully repressed yet “the nation is compelled to return again and again to an encounter that makes it both sorry and happy, a defiled grave upon which it must continually rebuild the American subject.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-1743872111407022">72</xref></sup> The inquest may be usefully compared to the defiled grave of which Bergland speaks, the place where bodies (and bones) are made to give up their secrets, but only those secrets that confirm the settler as legitimate owner of the land.</p>
<p>At the inquest, the “suffering of suffering” occurs when Aboriginality is represented as an innate condition that must be borne, a condition that non-Aboriginal people must ethically cure or ameliorate. While there is always a measure of pity underpinning the curative process, the settler’s response to Aboriginal people, has often been rage, a killing rage. As Michalko has also noted with respect to disability, when nondisabled people find that disability cannot be easily “cured” or managed, they exhibit a killing rage, one that is lauded as a mercy killing. Michalko observes that mercy killing has been construed in law as an extreme form of help.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-1743872111407022">73</xref></sup> A killing rage, an extreme form of help, a killing indifference: a man who dies in custody with a boot print on his chest or one who dies in his own vomit – each is ignored, to death.</p>
<p>In drawing on Michalko’s use of Levinas, I am particularly interested in the scene, to use Michalko’s word, where disability enters the world, disturbs, and is dealt with through the ethical and compassionate response that requires that disability be understood as misfortune. I underscore, however, the geographic dimensions of the scene. That is, <italic>where</italic> does the scene unfold that establishes nondisability as normalcy, and Aboriginality as pathology? For both disability and Aboriginality, one important place is the law, and quite literally the rooms of provincial government buildings where inquests and inquiries are conducted.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-1743872111407022">74</xref></sup> I suggest that the inquest stages Aboriginality as dysfunction, incurable illness, and threat to the healthy social body. Both an event and a place, the inquest transforms the colonial condition into a medical one, legitimizing the violence that is performed at the police station, on the streets and in the hospital, wherever settlers encounter Aboriginal people and demarcate between the human and less than human through acts of violence described as help. Coroners often cast themselves as reminding others of their ethical requirement to remedy Aboriginality. They offer recommendations on how best non-Aboriginal people can suffer Aboriginality. A dutiful coroner may even instruct society in what Michalko has termed the “banal courtesies”: in the case of disability the injunction to be sensitive to the misfortune of others (don’t stare), and in the case of Aboriginality, the self conscious practice of cultural sensitivity, usually limited to an Aboriginal prayer or healing circle at the inquest, and perhaps an eagle feather decorating the printed coroner’s report and a plethora of recommendations reminding us to be sensitive to cultural practices and to the special vulnerabilities of a sick and dysfunctional population.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-1743872111407022">75</xref></sup> Amidst all of this, a killing indifference persists. How can inquests perform an anatomy of colonialism, rather than a dissection of the sick Aboriginal body, to move beyond chests that will always have wheezes, fatty livers and shallow breathing? What would it mean to dissect indifference, instead of its object?</p>

<p>Michalko discusses the killing of 12 year old Tracy Latimer whose father Robert Latimer argued that he acted mercifully in killing his daughter because her condition of cerebral palsy brought her extreme pain.

<p>Michalko, <italic>The difference that disability makes</italic>, p. 101. The inquiry into the death of Frank Paul is decorated this way (Davies, 2009). The coroner permitted healing circles and prayers in the inquest into the death of Paul Alphonse (Inquest Paul Alphonse, 2002). Notably, these “banal courtesies” sometimes provide Aboriginal people with small openings through which a colonial account might be pushed through.</p>
