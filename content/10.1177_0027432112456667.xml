<title>Learning, Teaching, and Musical Identity: Voices across Cultures</title>
<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_0027432112456667-fig1.tif"/>
<p>edited by Lucy Green. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2011; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iupress.indiana.edu">www.iupress.indiana.edu</ext-link>.</p>
<p>Recent studies indicate that music is a powerful mark of identity: It can influence friendships, clothing choices, and attitudes toward others. This musical identity is evident as early as the primary-school level in playground music games and continues through adulthood with participation in region-specific music activities. Yet, how do both formal and informal music teaching and learning experiences in specific cultural contexts shape musical identities? This is the central question of <italic>Learning, Teaching, and Musical Identity: Voices across Cultures</italic>, in which Lucy Green has compiled twenty fascinating chapters by various scholars of ethnomusicology and music education who have researched musical identity in various contexts. While each chapter is grounded in qualitative research, technical terminology is mostly avoided; the focus is instead on compelling narrative, making the book accessible to those unfamiliar with this area of research. Each chapter stands independently, although, as Green states: “taken together the chapters reveal differences and commonalities in musical identity formation, learning, and teaching practices across a range of contexts, along with many potential implications for music educationalists and others” (p. 2).</p>
<p>I found the scope of cultures, activities, and age ranges relevant to the complex questions raised about musical identity. In Brazil, for instance, Heloisa Feichas writes that the university schools of music still embrace a traditional, Western conservatory-style method of teaching, which does not necessarily meet the needs and backgrounds of a student population increasingly immersed in popular idioms and informal methods of teaching and learning. This study addresses the dilemma facing many formal music institutes, as both formal and informal teaching and learning methods, including the values, beliefs, and attitudes that are inherent with these types of training, become more commonplace. Sophie Grimmer elaborates further on the formal learning process with a focus on the master–apprentice relationship of the Guru-Shishya Karnatic classical music training system in Southern India, where, she states, “the shishya learns by emulating the guru” (p. 92), while Kathryn Marsh researches the informal music practices that take place on school playgrounds in rural Australia as children engage in musical play as a way of expression. In the United States, Sharon Davis undertook a study with a beginning band class in which she encouraged students to have a “musical say” about expressive musical decisions through both formal and informal processes.</p>
<p>We all have a musical identity that guides our interactions with the world around us. <italic>Learning, Teaching, and Musical Identity</italic> provides compelling evidence that musical identity could have significant impact on the future of music learning and teaching. Green remarks that this research “point[s] to a need for music educators and researchers to deepen our understanding of the complexity and multiplicity of the influences on children’s, teenager’s, adult-learner’s, and our own musical tastes, knowledge, and skills” (p. 18). This book is highly recommended: It will appeal on many levels and should be on every music educator’s reading list.</p>

<title>Inside, Outside, Downside Up: Conservatoire Training and Musicians’ Work</title>
<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_0027432112456667-fig2.tif"/>
<p>edited by Dawn Bennett and Michael Hannan. Perth, Western Australia: Black Swan Press, 2008; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://research.humanities.curtin.edu.au/blackswan">http://research.humanities.curtin.edu.au/blackswan</ext-link>.</p>
<p><italic>Inside, Outside, Downside Up: Conservatoire Training and Musicians’ Work</italic> is a collection of seventeen academic papers read at the 2006 CEPROM (Commission for the Education of the Professional Musician) Seminar in Hanoi. Divided into four parts (Musicians’ Identities as Teacher, Employment and Employability, Music Theory Informing Musical Practice, and New Approaches to Teaching, Learning, and Assessment), the essays present case studies and original research in music education at the university level. Individual authors approach the broad topic—how to best prepare students for a career in music—from many vantage points: musician self-identity, performer as teacher, portfolio careers, popular music work, commercial composition, technological advances, assessment, and evaluation.</p>
<p>This volume is written in a straightforward manner and contains none of the technical jargon often present in research papers. Intended for a general audience of practicing musicians, the work presents a variety of concepts for reflection and further investigation. In particular, “Portfolio Careers and the Conservatoire” offers practical advice on increasing essential nonperformance skills (communication, business, teaching) to build a performing career. “Creating a Life in Music: Theory to Praxis” describes training the “whole musician” and developing a balance of the skills involved in entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship (taking risks and trying new directions within one’s current career). “University Based Music Theory Education for Aspiring Popular Music Professionals” explores the wide knowledge of musical styles necessary for employment as a gigging musician.</p>
<p>The overall theme of introspection carries well through the book. Each author explores skills sets from multiple disciplines necessary to build a satisfying music career. However, current conservatory and university training curricula may not provide the requisite depth of complementary extramusical training. The authors frequently allude to the dichotomy between career training and essential skills, citing instances where their research will cause discomfort in academia.</p>
<p>While this volume presents discussions of many interesting concepts, they are presented primarily as case studies. Some readers may inquire if these queries are only isolated occurrences or if the research is symptomatic of larger trends. The reference list for each paper provides sources for additional study.</p>
<p>Overall, this book introduces many ideas for further exploration. The scope of topics, combined with the in-depth case studies, appeals to a broad audience base. In the academic realm, it will guide curricular patterns and serve well as a supplemental textbook for music business and arts administration courses. In sum, this is a valuable guide for the exploration of music career training in today’s changing job market.</p>

<title>Playing (Less) Hurt: An Injury Prevention Guide for Musicians</title>
<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_0027432112456667-fig3.tif"/>
<p>by Janet Horvath. Milwaukee, WI: Hal Leonard, 2010; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.halleonard.com">www.halleonard.com</ext-link>.</p>
<p>Ten years since the original publication, Janet Horvath’s highly successful work <italic>Playing (Less) Hurt: An Injury Prevention Guide for Musicians</italic> is enjoying its third reprint. Horvath’s book grew out of her own experience with injury and the road to recovery, making it not just a research interest for her but a highly personal one as well. This work serves as both a reference book and a practical guide for risk factors, injuries, prevention, and treatment that is beneficial to professional and amateur musicians as well as students, teachers, and health care professionals.</p>
<p>The book is divided into four parts. Part 1 deals with how musicians get injured, including risk factors and other checklists that can aid readers in assessing their propensity for injury and in understanding how injuries can be caused by factors that the musician has no control over, such as a demanding conductor. Part 2 presents a detailed medical explanation of the common injuries that musicians face, including shoulder tendonitis, carpal tunnel, hearing problems, and many more. Part 2 is dedicated to injury prevention and recovery and is probably the most practical and easily applied section for musicians and teachers. Finally, Part 4 is a vast resource list of recommended books, videos, associations, and so on that deal with preventive and restorative approaches for musicians.</p>
<p>The beauty of this book is that it strikes an excellent balance between the technical and the practical. Although the book does not shy away from presenting detailed medical information, the material is presented in a way that is accessible to the average musician and to the student as well. Horvath’s book also contains helpful images of healthy and injured body parts and easy-to-understand diagrams of stretches and posture suggestions.</p>
<p>Musicians of any age and skill level can benefit from this book. For those who have struggled with injury, particularly the orchestral musician, this book also serves as a validation of the demands and pressures orchestral playing imposes on its members, often at the hands of conductors and managers. For teachers and conductors who are willing to read this book and take its word to heart, Horvath’s <italic>Playing (Less) Hurt</italic> will have a lasting effect on teaching and relating to those in your studio or under your baton.</p>

<title>Guidelines for Style Analysis, Expanded 2nd ed</title>
<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_0027432112456667-fig4.tif"/>
<p>by Jan LaRue, edited by Marian Green LaRue (Sterling Heights, MI: Harmonie Park Press, 2011); <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.harmonieparkpress.com">www.harmonieparkpress.com</ext-link>.</p>
<p>This excellent book is number fifty-seven in the series <italic>Detroit Monographs in Musicology/Studies in Music</italic>. It also contains a companion textbook on compact disc, <italic>Models for Style Analysis</italic>. The late scholar Jan LaRue, an expert on eighteenth-century music and the compiler of a colossal database of nearly 17,000 symphonic themes, first published the book in 1970 and presented a second edition in about 1990. The original text is here, accompanied by a companion text edited by Marian Green LaRue, founding editor of the <italic>Journal of Musicology</italic>. Jan LaRue was a prolific author whose work includes a 1973 analysis article in <italic>Music Educators Journal</italic>. LaRue earned a doctorate from Harvard University and taught at Wellesley College and for nearly forty years at New York University. He served as president of the American Musicological Society. These <italic>Guidelines</italic> serve as a ready reference for the graduate student wishing to do in-depth music analyses, either for his or her own study or for a dissertation or thesis.</p>
<p>Written in everyday language that reveals the author’s sense of humor, the book includes an outline of the study inside the front cover of the book. Basically, the author relates music analysis to an approach that is well explained, encompassing the elements of Sound, Melody, Harmony, Rhythm, and Growth, or SMHRG—a useful acronym for the five-part structure. (Not included in the acronym is the important element of “Text Influence.”)</p>
<p>The book also includes further discussion about aspects of music analysis, endnotes, and a specific index. The text is the author’s original work, and editor Marian Green LaRue relied on the author’s original writing. She knew LaRue as a graduate student, colleague, and spouse. I can attest to the success of Jan LaRue’s methodology, as I read one of his articles on analysis in graduate school and later adapted the method for my dissertation. I can honestly speak for the importance of <italic>Guidelines for Style Analysis</italic> and its usefulness to the musician in search of enlightenment about classical music. The approach definitely works well for music analysis, and the author refers to Western music from the Middle Ages to the present.</p>
<p>I very highly recommend this book to the serious musician.</p>

<title>MENC Handbook of Research on Music Learning, Volume I: Strategies</title>
<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_0027432112456667-fig5.tif"/>
<p>edited by Richard Colwell and Peter Webster. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2011; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://global.oup.com">http://global.oup.com</ext-link>.</p>
<p>If a handbook is intended to provide timely information meant for frequent consultation as well as enjoyable reading, then the <italic>MENC Handbook of Research on Music Learning</italic> is the book for you. The editors state that “Handbooks I and II [1992 and 2002] both had chapters directly and indirectly related to learning, but it became obvious to us that what was needed was a focus on ‘learning’” (p. v). Their “task was to create a publication that would address [changes that have occurred since the earlier publications, and] at the same time offering suggestions and addressing issues of learning for musical competence” (p. v).</p>
<p>The first volume of the <italic>Handbook</italic> has seven chapters, including two by the editors. Topics include “How Learning Theories Shape Our Understanding of Music Learning” (Susan O’Neill and Yaroslav Senyshyn); “Construction of Music Learning” (Peter Webster); “Roles of Direct Instruction, Critical Thinking, and Transfer in the Design of Curriculum for Music Learning” (Richard Colwell); “Musical Development: Revisiting a Generic Theory” (Keith Swanwick); “Biological and Environmental Factors in Music Cognition and Learning” (Steven Demorest); “Motivation and Achievement” (Lisa Linnerbrink-Garcia, Martin Maeher, and Paul Pintrich); and “Motivation to Learn Music: A Discussion of Some Key Elements” (Bret Smith).</p>
<p>The ideas presented in each chapter are solidly research based, with several very recent references that add to the timeliness of the book. Caution is advised, however, in reading the chapters, for the authors may cite research that supports perspectives that are different from what other authors state in their chapters. The editors tell you to be aware of views that differ widely. For example, in Chapter 1, O’Neill and Senyshyn address learning theories from psychological points of view, “where the focus is on behaviorism and constructivism and their relation to music,” whereas in Chapter 5, Swanwick deals with a philosophical viewpoint, “where pragmatism and existentialism are strong” (p. vi).</p>
<p>Some authors write paragraphs on music teaching, such as Webster, who includes a section of “The Case for Constructivism in Music Teaching and Learning” (Chapter 2, p. 45). It seems one may be inspired—or perhaps compelled—to relate the world of research to the world of practical application, even though the title appears to exclude “teaching”!</p>
<p>The Handbook is appropriate for music teacher educators, graduate students in music education, upper-level undergraduate music education students, and music educators in the field. I find no flaws in the Handbook. The organization of topics and the reference list at the end of each chapter, which invites further inquiry, are excellent. An index is included, thoughtfully, carrying out the idea of a handbook meant for frequent consultation. The preface is so well written that you may want to read it before delving into the chapters!</p>

<title>Performance Practices in the Classical Era</title>
<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_0027432112456667-fig6.tif"/>
<p>by Dennis Shrock. Chicago, IL: GIA Publications, 2011; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.giamusic.com">www.giamusic.com</ext-link>.</p>
<p>Choral scholar Dennis Shrock’s most recent book offers a wealth of information concerning performance practices in the classical period of music history. Shrock’s extensive quotation of primary source material by more than 100 composers and authors from this prolific period supports the erudite narrative throughout this mammoth resource. Beyond the scope of well-researched content, Shrock clearly articulates the application of concepts in practice through incorporation of expertly selected music examples by Mozart, Haydn, and other major composers of the time. The integration and synthesis of scholarship with practice yields not only a text with outstanding historical perspective, but also a handy guide for continual reference.</p>
<p>As to performance practice, Shrock sets the tone as follows: “I believe that such terms as ‘authentic’ and ‘right/wrong’ as applied to performance practice are unsound and even harmful. These terms suggest categorical opinions that do not tolerate creative differences. Terms such as ‘appropriate’ and ‘compatible’ are better suited to the meanings of the primary sources and to achieving a balance between rule-oriented precepts and performer-creative involvement” (p. ix). Furthermore, he states: “The study of performance practice is really the study of notation; it is an inquiry into the meaning of written music so as to determine precise intent and, therefore, its manifestation in performance” (p. x).</p>
<p>Guided by these axioms and structured in seven chapters (Chapter 1, “Sound”; Chapter 2, “Tempo”; Chapter 3, “Articulation and Phrasing”; Chapter 4, “Metric Accentuation”; Chapter 5, “Rhythmic Alteration”; Chapter 6, “Ornamentation”; and Chapter 7, “Expression”), the author presents a convenient encyclopedic design that lends itself easily to either quick review of specific subject matter (trills, triplet conformity, vibrato, etc.) or explanation of an overarching category. In addition, some of the primary source quotes entertain the reader. In the “Extra-Musical Factors” section of Chapter 7, “Expression,” Shrock cites Gluck’s preface to his opera <italic>Alceste</italic>, including these insights from the composer: “When I undertook to write the music for <italic>Alceste</italic>, I determined to strip it completely of all those abuses, whether introduced by the mistaken vanity of singers or by the excessive obligingness of composers who have long been disfiguring Italian opera and have turned the most magnificent and beautiful of all spectacles into the most ridiculous and boring” (p. 418).</p>
<p>The necessity for informed interpretation compels all of us in a position to program classical-era works, including arrangements and transcriptions, to strongly consider immediate acquisition of this excellent resource. Shrock’s compilation of primary source material and fresh perspective provides compelling evidence about how the music was conceived by the composer and, of equal significance, how it can be revealed to the performer and, ultimately, to the audience.</p>

<title>Reaching and Teaching All Instrumental Music Students, 2nd ed</title>
<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_0027432112456667-fig7.tif"/>
<p>by Kevin Mixon. Lanham, MD: MENC/Roman &amp; Littlefield Education, 2011; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://rowman.com/RLEducation">https://rowman.com/RLEducation</ext-link>.</p>
<p>The second edition of <italic>Reaching and Teaching All Instrumental Music Students</italic> by Kevin Mixon is a valuable resource for both veteran and beginning instrumental educators. Mixon enlightens instrumental educators and offers techniques to help reach a population of students who may not be the most familiar or easiest to teach. The author addresses solutions he posits in the book by explaining that “some directors look for easy, quick fixes, but like most solutions to challenging issues in music education, many of the solutions I offer require diligence and patience” (p. 93). It was helpful to see the author’s explanation that his proposed solutions will not work without effort.</p>
<p>The book consists of eight chapters specifically designed to address issues that may arise in an instrumental music educators’ career. The chapters are thoughtfully constructed and contain strategies an instructor can use to develop, maintain, and advance a program. The author includes a useful beginning instrumental letter template (p. 7) and various graphics throughout the book. It was refreshing to see solutions that instrumental teachers of multiple cultures and economically disadvantaged students may use with students who are interested in beginning an instrument.</p>
<p>Mixon does a respectable job of conveying the importance of creating positive relationships with parents, colleagues, and administrators in the director’s school system. Seeking support from others is an especially important concept for beginning teachers to grasp. However, when the author suggests home visits with students and their parent(s), this reviewer cannot help feel a sense of reluctance to implement this idea in today’s litigious society.</p>
<p>A major strength of the book is how the author addresses multisensory teaching, notation, and the inclusion of exceptional learners. Mixon gives various examples for directors to add to their repertoire of addressing multiple learning styles and cultural differences. This is a valuable resource for any educator facing any unfamiliar population of students. Mixon thoughtfully explains to the reader that his book is not a complete resource and that a few topics are well beyond the scope of his book. The author does, however, suggest additional resources in the text, and the reader can easily use the references listed in the back of the book to further explore a given topic.</p>
<p>Overall, the book is well written and includes relevant topics and suggestions to address problems that may arise. However, it seems curious that the author chose to add the last chapter on improvisation and composition to the end of his book. Although the book is full of valuable concepts and ideas, this last section seems as though it may have been an afterthought.</p>

<title>Music Education in the 21st Century in the United Kingdom: Achievements, Analysis, and Aspirations</title>
<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_0027432112456667-fig8.tif"/>
<p>edited by Susan Hallam and Andrea Creech. London, UK: Institute of Education, University of London, 2010; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ioe.ac.uk/publications">www.ioe.ac.uk/publications</ext-link>.</p>
<p><italic>Music Education in the 21st Century in the United Kingdom: Achievements, Analysis, and Aspirations</italic> sets out to chronicle the recent history and development of several areas of music education in the United Kingdom while providing a current and future context for readers interested in a unique, but very familiar, situation for the arts. Divided into three sections, (1) “Introduction,” (2) “Current Issues in Music Education,” and (3) Contexts of Learning,” this collection of essays details and describes the status of music education in a wide variety of settings spanning twenty chapters. Written by current researchers and practitioners, each chapter provides a wealth of well-researched detail and offers thoughtful commentary on specific topics such as the role of singing, learning to play an instrument, creativity, learning through life, music in the early years, music in universities and colleges, the music studio, and the role of music leaders and community musicians.</p>
<p>When reading this book, the reader will sympathize and metaphorically nod when coming across topics such as National Standards, assessment, music and students with special needs, as well as the inclusion of music in public school education. Contributing authors not only provide valuable information and commentary on their topic, but also list further readings as well as current journal sources. This is a particularly useful resource for music education graduate students and researchers. Several chapters in this book could serve as theses and dissertations topics. Useful for education practitioners is the frequent, boxed-out descriptions of practical applications and narratives describing successful examples of programs addressed in the chapter.</p>
<p>Though this book provides a wealth of information, a criticism would be the often use of acronyms. Remembering each organization and program makes it difficult at times to hold on to the main point. It seems every program has an acronym along with multiple levels that make portions of chapters read like alphabet soup. Regardless, British music educators and policymakers show attention to detail and seem to be very organized in their approach to musically educate their citizens.</p>
<p>Much use can be found in the list of references for each chapter. Thoroughly researched sections provide current thinking on each topic. It is interesting to note that most every chapter includes a citation to a government agency publication. Most cited are the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted), the Department for Education and Skills (DfES), and the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF). It seems that each contributor has been affected in some way by legislation and education reports, similarly to what has occurred with educators in the United States.</p>
<p>Overall, this book is a British narrative on almost every hot-button, universal topic in music education. A thoughtful resource for detailing the trials and tribulations of music education on a national scale, this book provides readers food for thought on how similar situations are dealt with across the pond.</p>

<title>Play It from the Heart—What You Learn from Music about Success in Life</title>
<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_0027432112456667-fig9.tif"/>
<p>by J. Steven Moore. Lanham, MD: MENC/Rowman &amp; Littlefield Education, 2011; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://rowman.com/RLEducation">https://rowman.com/RLEducation</ext-link>.</p>
<p><italic>Play It from the Heart—What You Learn from Music about Success in Life</italic>, the title of a book authored by J. Steven Moore, is an accurate description of the text and the message the book intends to portray. <italic>Play It from the Heart</italic> contains twelve short, easily read chapters, each with multiple subheadings that lead the reader to discover the intent and purpose of the book. The author shares some of the many principles students have learned through music, specifically via band, and how these experiences relate to personal success in life.</p>
<p>The book overflows with personal accounts, experiences, student communications, and the outcomes of learning experiences from the author’s years of working closely with students of high school and collegiate band programs. The narratives are heartfelt and descriptive, as the personal accounts are related to lessons of importance in lifelong learning. The accounts are organized into short segments with appropriately titled subheadings within the chapters. They are equally relatable to readers with significant years of music teaching experience and to those who are new to their teaching careers. They may also inspire music educators to strive for similar experiences in their current teaching environment, realizing the greater importance of music in people’s lives.</p>
<p>The author includes numerous life lessons, such as the principle of putting people and relationships first, finding the value in the relationship between being a leader and a person, and creating a safe and welcoming environment where people can make mistakes, to name just a few. A strong leader can move closer to desired results through passion, excitement, and a demand for excellence, “but the more desirable approach is to attract excellence to you like a magnet. If you embody that which you want, then people who feel the same way and who share a common purpose will be attracted to you” (p. 27). In summary, a leader is someone who cares for his or her students on many levels, from personal to professional. This is just one example of the many principles the author sets forth to portray to the reader, as many valuable insights are discussed through practical example.</p>
<p>Chapter 12, “Putting It Together,” is a helpful synopsis of the author’s intentions and message of the text, including eight short subheadings/paragraphs with summarizing sentences representing the most important concepts presented. After being inspired by the personal accounts of the difference music has made in the lives of many students, I found this last chapter to be among the most helpful, as it presents the reader with a solid restatement of the author’s passions and purposes for the intent of his writing. At the end of the book is a postlude, including a list of thirty-seven bulleted items with quotation-like reminders, followed by a personal narrative by a former student who recounts the lessons learned from band and their application in her professional and personal life.</p>
<p><italic>Play It from the Heart</italic> is well written and intriguing to the reader; the accounts of students and their personal experiences with music create a compelling, inviting reason to turn the page and continue reading. Although the author’s accounts are devoted mainly to experiences with high school and collegiate band students, the overarching lessons relating to music education and life have broad implications for educators of all disciplines. The book is a valuable resource for music educators, parents of school-age students, and for preservice music teachers in the practical understanding of the value of music in their lives of people.</p>
