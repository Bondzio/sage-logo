<abstract>
<p>This study was conducted to assess the prevalence of overweight/obesity and the related demographic data and health behaviors of Thai medical students. A cross-sectional study of 5441 medical students from all the 13 medical schools in Thailand was conducted in 2006 by means of a self-administered questionnaire. Demographic data, health behaviors, and self-reported body weight and height were recorded. The results revealed that Thai medical students have a lower prevalence of overweight/obesity than the general population of the same age group. The multiple logistic regression analysis showed that higher academic year was associated with being overweight or obesity in males, having improper dietary habits were associated with being overweight or obesity in both genders, whereas alcohol consumption was associated with being overweight in male only. Therefore, medical curricula should place an emphasis not only on knowledge but also on attitudes and behaviors for healthy lifestyles.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As the epidemiology of public health problems has shifted from infectious diseases to lifestyle-related illnesses, obesity has reached epidemic proportions causing major concerns for the world.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539511428665">1</xref></sup> The World Health Organization (WHO) report on diet, nutrition, and the prevention of chronic diseases placed obesity at the top of the public health agenda as the major modifiable risk factor for lifestyle-related illnesses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539511428665">2</xref></sup> In the past 3 decades, Thai public health system focused on malnutrition. Nowadays, the focus has transitionally changed to the obesity issue. National statistics show that the percentage of Thais who have an abnormal body mass index (BMI) continues to increase. The average Thai BMI has risen from 22.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup> in 1991-1992 to 24.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup> in 2000-2001. According to the third, fourth, and fifth National Nutrition Surveys, the prevalence of obesity has been increasing particularly in the age group between 20 and 29 years of age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539511428665">3</xref></sup> If this problem persists, the Thai population inevitably will be faced with chronic noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis; and these diseases will become significant causes of morbidity and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539511428665">4</xref></sup> In 2000, the Regional Office for the Western Pacific World Health Organization, the International Association for the Study of Obesity, and International Obesity Task Force definition for Asians established new BMI classifications. BMI ≥23 and ≥25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> are now classified as overweight and obesity, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539511428665">5</xref></sup> These cutoff points can be used at early stages to identify risk factors and warning signs of chronic diseases associated with overweight or obesity such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539511428665">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Overweight and obesity are multifactorial health problems. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that being overweight or obese was attributable to health behaviors. Changes in the economy, technology, society, and culture have affected the environment and lifestyles of people. The lifestyles of most Thais, especially urban Thais, have been steadily changing from a more traditional Asian pattern characterized by a low fat and red meat, low cholesterol, high fiber, and vegetable diet, accompanied by regular daily exercise, physical activities, and eating habits, and low smoking and alcohol consumption rates, to a more Western pattern characterized largely by opposites to the Asian pattern.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539511428665">3</xref></sup> The early adulthood period is an important period of change with regard to BMI. It offers good opportunities for establishing early health promotion of healthy behaviors and the modification of unhealthy behaviors. One specific target population who may be at risk of having an abnormally high BMI is university students, particularly medical students.</p>
<p>The medical education system in Thailand delivers a 6-year medical curriculum. High school graduates qualify for admission by the Medical Consortium Entrance Examination and an interview process. First-year courses include health science subjects. The second and third years include preclinical courses in disciplines related to basic medical science, whereas the fourth and fifth years focus on clinical courses in disciplines related to clinical science. The sixth or final year of study is dedicated to extern courses, including clinical practice under the supervision of medical staff.</p>
<p>Because of the long study periods throughout the 6 years of medical course and all the associated pressure, the requirement to work on night duty from the fourth through sixth years, and long working hours in the sixth year, the healthy lifestyles of medical students may be disrupted by the lack of exercise, shortened periods of sleep, extended hours of study, and possibly by an imbalance of food consumption. The changes in behavior may lessen the medical students’ attention to the maintenance of a healthy lifestyle, which may in turn lead to a heightened BMI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539511428665">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539511428665">8</xref></sup> These unhealthy behaviors are important factors that may increase susceptibility or vulnerability to negative health outcomes from abnormal BMI.</p>
<p>Although the health status of Thai physicians has previously been studied by Wattanasirichaigoon et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539511428665">9</xref></sup> Rattanamongkolgul et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539511428665">10</xref></sup> and Vutyavanich et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539511428665">11</xref></sup> a national survey of BMI among Thai medical students has never been conducted. More than 1000 Thai medical students graduate each year, on their way to becoming health leaders in the national health care system. Being overweight, these medical students will become obese doctors and will not be good role models for health education on weight control and the prevention of obesity-related illnesses of their patients. Understanding the health profile and health behaviors of Thai medical students can provide baseline data to further develop health promotion programs in accordance with health promotion needs of medical students. Also, the health profile would benefit each medical school reach the goal of being a healthy medical school. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the magnitude of health problem by focusing on abnormal BMI and to associate it with demographic factors and health behaviors.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>This cross-sectional study was part of the National Survey of Health Status of Thai Medical Students. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Srinakharinwirot University. The study participants included all medical students from the first year to the sixth year in all 13 medical schools in Thailand. Self-administrated questionnaires, together with information sheets and consent forms, were distributed to all medical students in 2006. The questionnaire included information on demographic data such as gender, age, academic year of study, location of campus, body weight, and height. Nine health behaviors were selected for analyses in this study: (1) exercise habits; (2) hours of sleep per day; (3) adequacy of sleep; (4) vegetable consumption per day; (5) balance of carbohydrate, protein, and fat consumption; (6) enriched fatty food consumption; (7) meal regularity; (8) smoking status; and (9) alcohol consumption.</p>
<p>Regular exercise was classified by using Thai criteria: exercise ≥30 minutes per day for 3 days per week being considered “regular”, and less than this amount being considered “irregular”.Sleep status was assessed both quantitatively and qualitatively by questioning the respondents about the duration of their sleep each day (&lt;6 or ≥6 hours per day) and by the self-evaluation of the adequacy of their sleep. Four aspects of consumption behaviors were assessed: eating at least 400 g of vegetables per day or not; eating a balanced diet of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats each day or not; consuming enriched fatty or high-cholesterol food such as fast food every week or not; and regularly eating 3 meals per day or not. Smoking status was categorized into 3 groups: never smoked, ex-smoker, and active smoker. The regular consumption of alcohol was classified into drinking ≥2 standard drinks per day for males or ≥1 standard drink per day for females or drinking less than that amount.</p>
<p>The BMI is a measure of body mass relative to height, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters (kg/m<sup>2</sup>). To compare the response with national statistics, participants were divided into 5 groups based on their BMI as follows: (1) underweight, BMI &lt;18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; (2) normal weight, BMI 18.5-22.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; (3) overweight, BMI 23.0-24.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; (4) obesity grade I, BMI 25.0-29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; and (5) obesity grade II, BMI ≥30.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.These BMI cutoffs conform to The Regional Office for the Western Pacific World Health Organization, the International Association for the Study of Obesity, and the International Obesity Task Force’s definition for Asians.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539511428665">5</xref></sup> Asian culture and genetics are somewhat different from other ethnic groups and notably in terms of their BMI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539511428665">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539511428665">13</xref></sup> The WHO definition of Asian BMI has previously been used in epidemiological research in Asian countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539511428665">14</xref></sup> These cutoff points are merely a convenience for public health use.</p>
<sec id="section3-1010539511428665">
<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>Demographic data were presented as frequencies and percentages. The magnitude of the problem was reported by a prevalence with a 95% confidence interval (CI). For the logistic regression analyses, the medical students with BMI ≥18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were selected and placed in 3 groups: those with BMI 18.5-22.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (normal weight group), those with BMI ≥23.0-24.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (overweight group), and those with BMI ≥25.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (obesity grades I and II combined group). The latter 2 groups were compared with the first group (reference group). Simple logistic regression was used in the univariate analyses to determine the strength of association between being overweight and/or obese and each of the 9 health behaviors studied. Multicollinearity was checked before multivariate analysis. Then multivariate analyses were conducted by the multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted for other confounding factors with the level of statistical significance at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05. It was found that academic year correlated with age. Therefore, this study reported only academic year in the final model, and age was separately analyzed in another model. Enter procedures were used in the statistical modeling. The appropriateness of the final model was checked by Wald and Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit tests.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>From the total number of medical students, 5441 completed questionnaires were included in the sample group yielding a response rate of 54.0%. The average age of the responding medical students was 20.8 ± 2.0 years (range 17-36 years). The female to male ratio was approximately 2:1. The distribution of the students from the first to the sixth academic years was 26.3%, 23.2%, 19.5%, 12.9%, 13.2%, and 4.9%, respectively. Overall, 55.9% of the participants were studying on campuses in Bangkok, 6.9% were studying on campuses in the suburbs of Bangkok, and 37.2% were studying in regional areas of Thailand. The average BMI of Thai medical students was 20.7 ± 2.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. When classified by the WHO criteria for Asians, the prevalence of overweight was 10.1% (95% CI = 9.3% to 10.9%); obese grade I was 5.5% (95% CI = 4.9% to 6.1%); and obese grade II was 1.2% (95% CI = 0.9% to 1.5%).

<p>The multiple logistic regression analysis showed that higher academic year of medical school, eating ≥400 g of vegetables per day, and regular drinking of alcohol were related significantly to the overweight condition in males, whereas eating an imbalanced diet and regularly eating 3 meals per day were related significantly to the overweight condition in females. Also, factors including higher academic year of medical school, eating an imbalanced diet, consuming enriched fatty food, and regularly eating 3 meals per day were related significantly to obesity in males, whereas consuming enriched fatty food was related significantly to obesity in females.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study is the first national survey of the health status of Thai medical students. It shows the overall picture of the BMI of all medical students in Thailand and their associated health behaviors. The results will be advantageous in the effort to promote medical student health and the prevention of chronic diseases related to obesity. It was found that approximately 16% of Thai medical students were overweight or obese. Nevertheless, Thai medical students still have a lower prevalence of being overweight or obese than the general Thai population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539511428665">15</xref></sup> and the Asian population at large.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539511428665">5</xref></sup> When compared with the higher cutoff point of BMI (≥25.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), the results remained consistent with a lower prevalence of overweight and obesity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539511428665">16</xref></sup> This may be due to the demographic background of the medical students, their knowledge and attitudes toward healthy habits, and the surrounding environment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539511428665">12</xref></sup> When stratified by gender, the prevalence of being overweight or obese was greater in male medical students than in female students. This result is consistent with similar findings regarding Asian medical students<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539511428665">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539511428665">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1010539511428665">17</xref></sup> and Western medical students.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1010539511428665">18</xref></sup> The differences between female medical students and the general population were far greater at each level of overweight or obesity than for male medical students, and the rate of overweight and obesity in female medical students was less likely to increase over time. The gender discrepancy among medical students is probably because of the fact that Thai female medical students tend to be more health conscious with regard to healthy diet and more concerned about their body image than male medical students.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1010539511428665">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>The overweight/obese condition in males has an increased trend with the academic year after controlling confounding factors. In this study, first-year medical students were used as a reference group, and the odds ratio increased in preclinic years, clinic years, and was the highest among sixth-year medical students. These may reflect their lifestyles in the final year in medical schools, which is difficult and required the greatest effort and dedication for every medical student. This inevitably affected students’ time, especially in terms of having no time for exercise or taking care of their health. The academic year related to overweight and obesity may be also explained by increasing age. As the height after 20 years of age can be assumed to be constant, the increasing BMI would mainly depend on body weight alone. The findings of this study revealed that overweight/obese condition related significantly to age less than 30 years in males and more than 30 years in females. The result was consistent in comparison with the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1010539511428665">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Dietary habits were the most common factors related to the overweight/obese condition in this population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1010539511428665">21</xref></sup> According to Swinburn et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1010539511428665">22</xref></sup> eating vegetables is a protective factor against obesity. However, the results of this study contradict what have been found. Medical students who consumed more than 400 g of vegetables per day were more associated with the overweight condition. According to the third round of the Thai Health Examination Survey conducted in 2003-2004, Thais aged 15 years and older, both male and female, had a vegetable intake lower than the recommended daily requirement levels for health promotion and disease prevention, which were 268 g of vegetables per day for males and 283 g per day for females.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539511428665">3</xref></sup> It is likely that medical students who ate more than 400 g of vegetables per day also ate greater amount of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. This may elevate the overall risk of being overweight as found in this study. However, it does not reflect in the Asian population, which usually has high consumption of vegetables. In general, having a high-fiber diet is essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. A high-fiber diet with appropriate amounts at each meal is recommended.</p>
<p>This study found that unhealthy eating patterns and imbalanced eating of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats were associated with being overweight in females and obesity in males; and enriched fatty food consumption was associated with obesity in both genders. Generally, consuming more carbohydrates can cause carbohydrates to change into fat and then be deposited in adipose tissues. The overconsumption of carbohydrates can be as unhealthy as the overconsumption of fats. Previous studies have shown that most unhealthy eating habits or eating improper food are correlated with increased BMI, which may increase the risk of obesity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539511428665">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1010539511428665">24</xref></sup> and other chronic diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539511428665">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study revealed that more than half of Thai medical students did not eat 3 meals per day regularly. The prevalence of this practice, however, was lower than in the general Thai population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539511428665">3</xref></sup> and in other countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1010539511428665">25</xref></sup> However, it did not have any negative impact on the overweight in females and obesity in males. Several scientific reports demonstrate that skipping or eating meals irregularly are correlated with unhealthy outcomes such as fatigue or poor performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1010539511428665">26</xref></sup> Thai medical students should not eat less than 3 meals per day.</p>
<p>It was discovered that there was another factor to be associated with the overweight condition, which was the consumption of alcohol. Alcohol can increase abdominal fat particularly when combined with a fatty diet. Alcohol can interfere with the metabolic system and increase deposits of adipose tissue especially in overweight people.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1010539511428665">27</xref></sup> Overall, dietary behavior was an important factor associated with overweight and obese conditions. Other factors such as the location of the medical school campus, exercise, sleep patterns, and smoking were not found to be associated with the overweight/obese condition in this study. This was consistent with other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1010539511428665">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1010539511428665">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study, however, had some limitations. As the study design was cross-sectional, the results could not indicate definitely whether each risk factor contributed to the increase in the medical students’ BMI. The dose–response relationship between the BMI and academic schedule or age also was interpreted from the cross-sectional data. A longitudinal study in which respondents are followed up from their first year until they graduate would provide a more accurate and clear picture of their BMI status. However, the comparison of the general population with this study would clarify whether BMI increases with age rather than with academic year. A nonresponse bias also is unavoidable; the number of incomplete questionnaires may have affected the true prevalence of overweight/obesity. A small number of males answering the questionnaire may also affect the results of the study. Another limitation is that previous studies in Western countries classified being overweight as ≥25.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, but this study used the cutoff level for being overweight at 23.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, which is a more appropriate classification for being overweight in Thailand.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539511428665">14</xref></sup> BMI is a reasonably useful indicator of being overweight or obese. Finally, the self-reported questionnaire may not have reported the participants’ real data accurately. For example, it was difficult for the participants to evaluate or estimate their balanced diet in terms of health behavior and this may cause misclassification; self-reports on individual weight and height are usually underestimation, which may have an effect on the magnitude of the problem.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1010539511428665">29</xref></sup> A questionnaire was, however, convenient for this large epidemiological study. Future studies should explore other aspects or factors of health promotion needs using different methods, designs, settings, populations, or other factors. The focus should be placed on comparing medical students with nonmedical students. The findings will suggest implications for public health practice, education, and research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1010539511428665">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>As the health behaviors seem to change and adversely affect the BMI of medical students, the baseline data from this study are important in the field of prevention. This study revealed that some medical students who will become health professionals in Thai society have unhealthy behaviors. These behaviors can be modified. Early detection of health risk behaviors in this group provides an opportunity for early changes in their lifestyles and the prevention of morbidity and mortality in the future. The findings may be useful for monitoring BMI trends to prevent obesity and consequential related diseases, particularly in males and medical students with unhealthy diets and behaviors. This survey also identified some significant health issues for high-risk medical students: males with unhealthy diets or behavior. This should be addressed during their period at medical school. Health promotion strategies, such as the development of health promotion policies within medical schools or the creation of a more supportive environment (eg, cafeterias with healthy food shops) should be implemented. The findings of this study may help medical educators be more sensitive to their medical students’ needs. Therefore, medical curricula should not only emphasize knowledge but also include attitudes and behaviors for healthy lifestyles.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Thai medical students had a lower prevalence of overweight or obese conditions when compared with the general Thai population at the same age. However, some medical students had BMI levels of ≥23 kg/m<sup>2</sup> which is associated with certain unhealthy lifestyle habits. Medical students who were male, were studying in the final year of medical schools, and had improper dietary habits and alcohol consumption were associated with overweight, whereas female medical students who had improper dietary habit were associated with overweight. Obesity in males was related to medical students who were studying in the final year of medical school and had improper dietary habits; whereas in females obesity was related to improper dietary habits. The issues leading medical students to being overweight or obese should be resolved at an early stage to reduce the risk of obesity-related chronic diseases. Thai medical schools should encourage health promotion among this population. Healthy medical students can become strong role models and leaders of health promotion for individuals, patients, families, and communities once they qualify as doctors.</p>
