<abstract>
<p>The apocryphal infancy gospels (such as the <italic>Infancy Gospel of Thomas</italic> and the <italic>Protoevangelium of James</italic>) seem at first look to be ideal sources for the study of children and childhood in Early Christianity. They all feature depictions of Jesus as an infant and/or a child; some tell similar tales of other eminent Christian figures, such as Mary of Nazareth and John the Baptist. Few of these texts, however, can be considered “early” texts (i.e., 2nd–3rd centuries) and even those we can confidently date to this period are of limited value for the study of children. One text remains useful for this endeavor: the <italic>Infancy Gospel of Thomas</italic>. And in recent years, several scholars have looked seriously at the gospel for what it can tell us about the experiences of children in antiquity. Yet, even this text must be approached with caution for it has more to say about how adults of the time wanted children to be than what they truly were.</p>
<p>Les évangiles de l’enfance apocryphes (comme l’Évangile de l’enfance selon Thomas et le Protévangile de Jacques) semblent à première vue comme des sources idéales pour l’étude des enfants et l’enfance au début du christianisme. Ils ont tous des représentations de Jésus comme un bébé et / ou un enfant, certains racontent des histoires similaires des autres éminentes figures chrétiennes, comme Marie de Nazareth et Jean le Baptiste. Peu de ces textes, cependant, peuvent être considérés tôt (par exemple, 2–3e siècles) et même ceux que nous pouvons en toute confiance dater à cette période sont d’une valeur limitée pour l’étude des enfants. Un texte reste utile pour cette tâche : l’Évangile de l’enfance selon Thomas. Et ces dernières années, plusieurs chercheurs se sont penchés sérieusement sur l’évangile pour ce qu’il peut nous dire au sujet des expériences des enfants dans l’antiquité. Pourtant, même ce texte doit être abordé avec prudence car il a plus à dire sur les attentes des adultes de l’époque aux enfants que ce qu’ils étaient vraiment.</p>

<p>The study of children and childhood in Christianity is a relatively new endeavor. It was only a little over a decade ago that the first major works appeared examining Early Christian families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0008429812441338">Moxnes, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0008429812441338">Osiek and Balch, 1997</xref>), followed a few years later by studies focusing entirely on children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0008429812441338">Bunge, 2000</xref>; but note also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0008429812441338">Currie’s 1993</xref> diss.). These naturally built on earlier work on the family in antiquity by classicists (including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0008429812441338">Rawson, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0008429812441338">Bradley, 1991</xref>; J.K. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0008429812441338">Evans, 1991</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0008429812441338">Dixon, 1992</xref>) and scholars of Judaism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0008429812441338">Cohen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0008429812441338">Kraemer, 1989</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0008429812441338">Perdue et al., 1997</xref>), but it has been left to scholars of Early Christianity to apply the methodology developed in these cognate areas to the texts and artifacts important to our field. To some extent we are still determining what sources are useful for this study and how best to use them. Indeed, the New Testament itself says little about children, and what it does say is often in metaphor. We find ourselves at times in a similar position to feminist biblical theologians, reading our subject into the silences of our sources.</p>
<p>But outside the New Testament we find texts that feature children prominently. There exist numerous apocryphal texts created, at least in part, to fill in biographical information about Jesus and other NT figures absent in the gospel record. All the NT tells us about Jesus’ early years is found in a handful of tales from the gospels of Matthew and Luke—including his birth (Matt 1:18–25; Luke 2:1–20), circumcision and presentation (Luke 2:21–40), the flight to Egypt as an infant and his return to Nazareth (Matt 2:1–23), and the story of the twelve-year-old Jesus amazing the doctors in the Temple (Luke 2:41–52). Nothing is said of the childhood of other NT figures, aside from the birth of John the Baptist (Luke 1:57–80). Various apocryphal texts, on the other hand, tell us about Mary’s birth and childhood, and offer new stories of Jesus and John the Baptist; we even have glimpses of other characters—Judas, Thomas, the thieves at the cross—interacting with Jesus when all are children. The Christian Apocrypha, then, present us with an embarrassment of riches when it comes to stories of children, but the question remains as to how to use these stories. Their protagonists are more superhuman than human; their activities more supernatural than natural; and the goals of the texts are to indicate these differences to the readers. What, then, can we expect to learn about real children and views of childhood in antiquity from such tales? Despite the claims of some recent studies of this material, in the end all they reveal to us, at best, is what adults thought about children, particularly how they sought to portray their protagonists as transcending the negative qualities often associated with children in antiquity.</p>
<sec id="section1-0008429812441338">
<title>1. Tales of a Divine Childhood</title>
<p>The most commonly known stories of Jesus’ childhood, beyond the single story of Jesus in the Temple (Luke 2:41–52), are found in the <italic>Infancy Gospel of Thomas</italic> (IGT). Since this is our earliest non-canonical “infancy gospel” (an unsuitable literary category but one that has become standard), it has received more attention from scholars than other collections of childhood tales. Nevertheless, these other collections contain some fascinating, and at times alarming, stories that could be drawn upon by scholars interested in depictions of children in Early Christianity.</p>
<p>First, however, more should be said about the childhood tales from IGT. Our only text that is focused specifically on the childhood of Jesus (indeed of any figure from antiquity), IGT is difficult to work with as it comes in a number of different forms (for a survey of the various sources for IGT, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0008429812441338">Burke, 2010</xref>: 127–177; or more briefly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0008429812441338">Chartrand-Burke, 2008</xref>: 126–130). Thus it would be difficult for the investigator to understand what an Early Christian would read or hear when encountering the text. It is important, then, to recover the original (or at least an early) form of IGT if we seek to use the text for understanding Early Christian depictions of children. That said, the IGT tradition also provides insights as to changing views of children (or perhaps only views of Jesus as a child) throughout over a millennium of transmission; and that too has scholarly value. The version of IGT most well-known to scholars is the nineteen-chapter form (named Greek A) made popular by the seminal edition of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0008429812441338">Constantin von Tischendorf (1876</xref>: 140–157). After a prologue attributing the text to Thomas, Greek A begins with the five-year-old Jesus at a ford of streams, separating the waters into pools and purifying them (ch. 2). He then takes clay from the pools and forms sparrows, which he animates. The son of Annas the scribe witnesses this miracle and accuses Jesus of violating the Sabbath; in response, Jesus curses the boy (ch. 3). He then kills another boy in the marketplace (ch. 4); for this he is reprimanded by Joseph and criticized by some villagers, who are struck blind by Jesus (ch. 5). In the next story, Jesus encounters a teacher named Zacchaeus who seeks to educate the boy; instead, Jesus teaches him the arcane qualities of the letter Alpha (ch. 6), and humbles the teacher (ch. 7). After restoring those he cursed to health (ch. 8), Jesus resurrects a boy who fell from a roof (ch. 9) and heals a man’s foot (ch. 10). Then, at six years of age, he miraculously carries water in his cloak to his mother (ch. 11), and sows a small amount of wheat which yields a great harvest (ch. 12). At the age of eight, he stretches a beam to help his father Joseph construct a bed (ch. 13). Then Joseph takes him to another teacher who is cursed by Jesus for striking him on the head (ch. 14). A third teacher escapes harm by recognizing Jesus’ divinity (ch. 15). Jesus then saves his brother James from a snake bite (ch. 16), and resurrects first a boy (ch. 17) and then a fallen housebuilder (ch. 18). The text concludes with an expanded story of the twelve-year-old Jesus in the Temple (ch. 19). Along with Greek A, Tischendorf also published a Latin version of the text (1876: 164–180), which includes a group of stories that take place during Jesus’ sojourn in Egypt. In these tales Jesus makes a salted fish come alive (ch. 1) and, in an encounter with another teacher, utters a prophecy that comes true (ch. 2). This Latin IGT later was revealed to be a translation of another Greek recension, called Greek D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0008429812441338">Delatte, 1927</xref>). A third recension, Greek B, essentially abbreviates Greek A, eliminating chapters 12 and 14–19 (Tischendorf, 1876: 158–163). The fourth Greek recension, Greek S, has been shown to be a witness to an earlier form of the text that did not contain chapters 17 and 18, and placed chapter 10 between chapters 16 and 19 (all four recensions have been newly-edited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0008429812441338">Burke, 2010</xref>; Greek S is also found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0008429812441338">Aasgard, 2009</xref>: 219–241).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0008429812441338">1</xref>
</sup> And finally, scholars have determined that the earliest form of IGT, which lacked chapters 1, 10, 17 and 18, is reflected in a number of translations of the text into Syriac, Georgian, Ethiopic, and a second Latin version. All of this manuscript evidence makes IGT a challenging text to study. Anyone interested in doing so must look beyond Tischendorf’s Greek A text and take seriously the evidence of both Greek S and the early translations.</p>
<p>Additional childhood stories weave in and out of the IGT manuscript tradition. One Greek manuscript (Paris, <italic>A. F. gr. 239</italic>) features an episode of Jesus in a dyer’s shop, the Ethiopic tradition includes a brief story of Jesus riding a sunbeam and a less miraculous account of Jesus helping his father with carpentry (from Greek A, ch. 13), and the version of Greek A from which the Slavonic tradition was translated (traceable to ca. 10/11th century) contained a story of Jesus tearing down and rebuilding a pagan temple, and a tale of Jesus healing a man’s eye. Other manuscripts in the Slavonic tradition contain a few other stories—one in which Jesus transforms mischievous children into swine, another adapted from a Ukrainian popular legend where he encounters a blacksmith, and the aforementioned stories of “Jesus and the Dyer” and “Jesus Rides a Sunbeam” (for a discussion of these tales, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0008429812441338">Rosén, 1997</xref>: 44). And an Arabic translation of the Syriac tradition contains a story in which Jesus transforms his playmates into a variety of animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0008429812441338">Noja, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0008429812441338">1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Stories from IGT are also incorporated into secondary collections of infancy and childhood traditions, often alongside additional tales of Jesus as a child. The <italic>Arabic Infancy Gospel</italic> (<italic>Arab. Gos. Inf.</italic>), dating perhaps from the eighth or ninth century, includes several of the stories noted above, including “Jesus Turns Children into Goats” (ch. 40) and “Jesus and the Dyer” (ch. 37), as well as a tale similar to IGT 13 in which Jesus helps Joseph build a throne for a king (ch. 39), and a pair of stories in which Jesus first is made king by some boys at play and then heals a boy bitten by a snake (chs 41–42; English trans. in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0008429812441338">Cowper, 1874</xref>: 170–215).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0008429812441338">2</xref>
</sup> The gospel also contains a number of stories of healings occasioned by touching the infant Jesus’ swaddling clothes, or the use of his bath water. Many of these same infancy and childhood tales occur in what is likely the immediate ancestor to <italic>Arab. Gos. Inf.</italic>: the East Syriac <italic>Life of Mary</italic> (edition by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0008429812441338">Budge, 1899</xref>). Further tales of the infant Jesus in Egypt are contained in a late text of Arabic origin known as the <italic>Vision of Theophilus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0008429812441338">Mingana, 1931</xref>). And the much-neglected <italic>Armenian Infancy Gospel</italic>, believed to be a translation of a sixth-century Syriac original, contains a further assortment of childhood tales, including many of those mentioned earlier (e.g., “Jesus Rides a Sunbeam,” “Jesus and the Dyer,” and several episodes from IGT) alongside new stories of Jesus playing with, healing, and cursing those around him (text available in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0008429812441338">Terian, 2008</xref>). In the West, IGT was incorporated into the <italic>Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew</italic> (<italic>Ps.-Matt.</italic>), where the stories are placed after a few tales of the infant Jesus en route to, and in, Egypt (chs 18–24), and joined by three additional stories set in Palestine: an encounter, at eight years old, with some lions at the Jordan River (ch. 35) where he also parts the waters (ch. 36), and another story of the healing of a rich man in Capernaum (ch. 40; English trans. in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0008429812441338">Cowper, 1874</xref>: 27–83). Numerous other stories, including “Jesus and the Sunbeam,” appear in the <italic>Ps.-Matt.</italic> manuscript tradition; unfortunately, few scholars have seen these medieval tales as they await full analysis and publication.</p>
<p>Several additional sources preserve isolated stories of Jesus as a boy. The young Jesus appears in a <italic>Life of John the Baptist</italic> from the fourth century. Here Jesus, at around seven years of age, and his mother Mary are miraculously whisked to the aid of John in the desert after the death of his mother Elizabeth. There they bury Elizabeth and stay seven days to show John how to live in the desert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0008429812441338">Mingana, 1927</xref>: 242–245). Hippolytus (<italic>Refutation of all Heresies</italic> 5.26.29–30) reports a story told by Justin the Gnostic, of the angel Baruch visiting the twelve-year-old shepherd boy Jesus (excerpted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0008429812441338">Cullmann, 1991</xref>: 454); and the “Spirit” unites with a young Jesus in <italic>Pistis Sophia</italic> 61 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0008429812441338">Cullmann, 1991</xref>: 455). And last, the <italic>History of Joseph the Carpenter</italic> (4/5th-century Egypt) contains a chapter in which the dying Joseph recalls some episodes from Jesus’ youth that are reminiscent of the stories encountered in IGT 5, 9, and 10 (ch. 17; trans. in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0008429812441338">Ehrman and Pleše, 2011</xref>: 157–193, or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0008429812441338">Cowper, 1874</xref>: 99–127).</p>
<p>Scholars interested in stories of Jesus’ childhood certainly have plenty of material from which to draw. They might look also at the childhood of Mary—found principally in the <italic>Protoevangelium of James</italic> (<italic>Prot. Jas.</italic>), but incorporated into <italic>Ps.-Matt</italic>., <italic>Arab. Gos. Inf.</italic>, and other texts described above—and of John the Baptist (in the aforementioned <italic>Life of John the Baptist</italic>). But the material is not without its challenges. One cannot work on these texts simply by drawing upon translations offered by the standard Christian Apocrypha collections; often these collections derive their texts from outdated editions and their introductions poorly reflect advances in current scholarship. The interpretation of apocryphal literature must incorporate the results of ongoing text-critical studies if we are to understand these texts appropriately. This is particularly difficult when using them as sources for children and childhood in the Early Christian context, as there are few texts or tales that can be traced confidently to that time period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0008429812441338">
<title>2. Apocryphal Tales as Sources for Children in Early Christianity</title>
<p>Not so long ago, the apocryphal childhood stories, along with other texts of the Christian Apocrypha, were considered the ravings of heretics. They were often declared Gnostic and dismissed as irrelevant for the study of the social history of Early Christianity, for if Gnostics had such contempt for the world that they even refused to bear children, then what could their bizarre, esoteric, and highly symbolic literature possibly tell us about the lives and experiences of <italic>real</italic> Christians? But cooler heads have prevailed more recently so that not all apocryphal texts are labeled Gnostic—indeed, many are quite “orthodox” in their Christology—and even previous scholarly caricatures of Gnostics are being questioned. Apocryphal Christian texts, therefore, are now taken seriously as sources for Early Christianity. They are particularly important for the study of Early Christian children, because without them the pool of resources available to scholars is particularly shallow. Nevertheless, few of the apocryphal stories surveyed above are very useful for reconstructing the life of children in Early Christianity.</p>
<p>First, many of the stories were composed outside of our time period. Ideally, we want texts we can date from the first to the third centuries and, despite some scholars’ best efforts to date some apocryphal texts to the first century (see particularly the work associated with the “Bauer school,” especially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0008429812441338">Koester, 1990</xref>), very few truly can be dated that early (for a recent response to such positions, see Craig <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0008429812441338">Evans, 2006</xref>). It must be cautioned, however, that later texts can contain earlier traditions, but arguments for such positions are notoriously speculative. Problematic too, is the fact that apocryphal texts are more prey than NT texts to changes (both expansions and deletions) over the course of their transmission. Therefore, every argument we make about this literature depends entirely on the ability of text critics to establish the “original form” (or at least an early form) of the text, and this may well be impossible to accomplish. It is also apparent that the childhood stories may derive from common folkloric tales composed for other figures and transferred to Jesus. The goal of such transference is to show that Jesus is capable of the same feats as other illustrious figures who performed such feats in their youth or adulthood; there is no attempt made in these cases to convey the nuances of life for children in antiquity, Christian or otherwise, but only to drop Jesus into a story that is governed entirely by stock literary motifs and stereotypical structures. Even other, non-divine children who appear in some of the stories are merely props for Jesus to display his mysteries. Another reason for the composition of these texts, such as the <italic>Life of John the Baptist</italic>, is to establish or legitimate the locations of holy sites; so, we should take little from the <italic>Life</italic>’s portrayal of the young John, particularly since the tales of John’s childhood here are extraordinary (he lives alone in the desert, where he is provided for by angels and the ghosts of his deceased parents) and tell us nothing about ordinary children. Similarly, the stories of Mary in <italic>Prot. Jas.</italic> are intended to show how special Mary was and ultimately to bolster doctrinal arguments for the Immaculate Conception and Mary’s perpetual virginity.</p>
<p>That leaves us principally with one text: the <italic>Infancy Gospel of Thomas</italic>. IGT can be firmly dated to the second century (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0008429812441338">Burke, 2010</xref>: 201–205), and text criticism on the text in recent years has brought us closer than ever to its elusive “original” form (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0008429812441338">Burke, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0008429812441338">Voicu, 1998</xref>). And though IGT too seeks to portray Jesus as some kind of divine figure (its precise Christology is unclear), its stories contain a large amount of verisimilitude. Incidental details of children’s lives and experiences pepper these stories in ways we do not see in other texts. For example, the townspeople’s efforts to tame the young wonderworker show us something of the social expectations placed on children and their parents. Indeed, the teacher Zacchaeus’ list of the reasons for educating the young Jesus tells us much about such expectations: “Come, give him over, brother, so that he may be taught letters, and so that he may know all knowledge, learn to love those his own age, honour old age, and revere elders, so that he may acquire a desire for children, also teaching them in return” (6:1; trans. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0008429812441338">Burke, 2010</xref>). We also see a number of snapshots of the young Jesus doing things a normal child would do at his age: making birds out of clay (2:2), playing on a roof (9:1), helping his mother fetch water from the well (ch. 11), and his father to plant seed (ch. 12) and make a bed (ch. 13).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0008429812441338">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Of all the Christian Apocrypha’s tales of childhood, IGT appears to have the most utility for the study of Early Christian children. It is the earliest known collection of childhood stories (indeed, it is one of the earliest non-canonical gospels), its original form (or something near to it) has been reconstructed from the available manuscript witnesses, and, most of all, it contains a level of verisimilitude that is absent from other childhood representations of Christian figures. Several scholars have come to recognize this value in IGT and have taken it seriously as a source for understanding the lives of children in antiquity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0008429812441338">
<title>3. The <italic>Infancy Gospel of Thomas</italic> and Childhood</title>
<p>Until fairly recently IGT was confused with the “Gospel of Thomas” associated with Gnostics by early church writers. Only after the true <italic>Gospel of Thomas</italic> was discovered in 1945 was IGT free to be examined more appropriately. But only a handful of scholars have done so; most scholars either continue, without basis, to consider IGT Gnostic or simply ignore the text completely as frivolous and unsophisticated. Those who have sought to place the text in its appropriate literary and socio-historical contexts have found in it much that adds to our knowledge of children or at least attitudes toward children and childhood in Early Christianity.</p>
<p>The bulk of the credit for this change in attitude towards IGT should go to Ronald Hock. In his study of IGT and <italic>Prot. Jas.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0008429812441338">Hock, 1995</xref>), he showed effectively that IGT has more literary sophistication than previous scholars had thought, particularly in its use of the h0qopoii/a, or “speech-in-character,” in chapter 7’s lament of Zacchaeus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0008429812441338">Hock, 1995</xref>: 94–95). Building on work by Thomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0008429812441338">Wiedemann (1989</xref>) and Charles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0008429812441338">Talbert (1980</xref>), Hock also placed IGT in the literary genre of ancient biography. Such texts of this genre regularly fill in the details of the early lives of their protagonists using stories that foreshadow their adult careers. On the proclivities of ancient biography, Hock wrote:<disp-quote>
<p>Although biographies of individuals, which were decisively shaped according to the prescriptions of rhetorical handbooks, dealt with ancestry, birth, childhood, and adulthood, they were not about changes and development in their subjects’ fortunes and personalities, but about their character, and that character was assumed to have been fixed from birth. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0008429812441338">Hock, 1995</xref>: 96)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This determination has relieved many scholars of the frustration of trying to characterize the plot of IGT as a development in Jesus’ character from cursing to blessing, and directed them toward looking for other guiding themes or Christological motives behind the text’s composition.</p>
<p>My own work on IGT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0008429812441338">Chartrand-Burke, 2001</xref>; revised as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0008429812441338">Burke, 2010</xref>; with summaries in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0008429812441338">Chartrand-Burke, 2008</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0008429812441338">Burke, 2009</xref>) builds on Hock’s insights in an attempt to understand why Jesus is portrayed as such a miscreant in the text. If ancient biographies depict their protagonists as young versions of their adult counterparts, I reasoned that the author of IGT must think the adult Jesus was just as likely to curse as bless. Such a view of the powerful yet irascible holy man is common in antiquity, particularly in Jewish literature (e.g., representations of Elijah and Elisha from 1 and 2 Kings; Moses in Artapanus frg. 3; Honi the Circledrawer in Josephus, <italic>Ant.</italic> 14.22–24); Christian portrayals of such a figure are plentiful in the canonical and apocryphal Acts (see the deaths of Ananias and Sapphira in Acts 5:1–11; the blinding of Elymas in Acts 13:6–11; and cursing stories in the <italic>Acts of Paul </italic>4 and 5, <italic>Acts of Peter</italic> 2 and 32, <italic>Acts of Thomas</italic> 8 and 51, etc.; see further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0008429812441338">Burke, 2010</xref>: 276–281). What, then, of the maturity displayed by the young Jesus in the text? This is attributable to the pervasive tendency to portray children—whether heroes in biographies, or “normal” children in epitaphs—as wise beyond their years; such a depiction is called the <italic>puer senex</italic>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0008429812441338">4</xref>
</sup> For the most part, childhood was treated with disdain by ancient writers. Children, like women, lacked the virtue of reason, which was required to participate in the rational world of the Roman citizen. Childlike qualities thus were frowned upon: “they were ignorant, capricious, foolish, and quarrelsome. They spoke nonsense, lacked judgement, were physically frail, and easily frightened” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0008429812441338">Burke, 2010</xref>: 248). Given such a negative valuation of childhood, it is no surprise that children, or illustrious figures as children, are praised for or depicted as acting like adults. The Jesus of IGT, therefore, is based on an ideal: the child who is not a child.</p>
<p>The prominence in IGT of the theme of teaching has caught the attention of some of those interested in the text. IGT features three encounters with schoolteachers (chs 6–8, 14, and 15) and finishes with Luke’s story of Jesus with the doctors in the Temple (ch. 19). Clearly, teaching is of central importance in this text. Recognizing this, Lucie Paulissen offered an in-depth analysis of the letter speculation section of chapter 6 (6:4) that once again illustrates that IGT has some literary sophistication. She sees the goal of the text as to reveal progressively Jesus’ divine nature, and the teaching stories are instrumental in this:<disp-quote>
<p>Les trois passages, qui abordent l’alpha et les lettres sous différents aspects, montrent également différentes facettes de Jésus. Le premier épisode traite de la ta/cij de Jésus, c’est-à-dire sa place, son rang hiérarchique, au sein de la Trinité et l’agencement des trois parties de celle-ci. Sa du/namij, est illustrée au ch. 14, lorsque l’enfant en fait usage pour maudire le deuxième maître, et tout au long de la narration pour opérer des miracles. Enfin, le dernier épisode dévoile l’inspiration divine de l’enfant, sa capacité de voir au-delà du tracé des lettres et d’interpréter celles-ci. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0008429812441338">Paulissen, 2003</xref>: 169)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Chris Frilingos also focuses on IGT’s interest in education. He sees IGT as an example of “thinking with children” (2009: 34 n. 28) as a way to demonstrate Early Christianity’s uneasy relationship with classical education and culture (or <italic>paideia</italic>). The teaching stories, and indeed many of the other episodes in the text, associate knowledge with violence, in remembrance, perhaps, of the author’s and audience’s own experiences of corporal punishment in the classroom (see similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0008429812441338">Burke, 2010</xref>: 288).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0008429812441338">5</xref>
</sup> Jesus frustrates “conventional methods of teaching and discipline” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0008429812441338">Frilingos, 2009</xref>: 42), returns the violence of one teacher (ch. 14:2), and uses violence of his own to teach the townspeople of his divinity (e.g., the slaying of the boy in the marketplace in ch. 4). In the end, Jesus and the Christianity of IGT’s time are connected to the culture of the day (whether Greco-Roman or Jewish) but not subordinate to it: “‘Unruly’ and violent, the child Jesus fashions new knowledge that mimics tradition: he is almost but not quite a student of <italic>paideia</italic>, almost but not quite a student of the ‘law’” (2009: 52).</p>
<p>The reserve shown by Paulissen and Frilingos in seeing IGT’s young Jesus as a symbolic declaration of Christological or cultural identity is countered by Reidar Aasgaard’s bold argument that what we have in IGT is “Christianity’s first children’s story” (2009: 213). Aasgaard has brought to the study of IGT a wider interest in children and childhood in Christianity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0008429812441338">Aasgaard, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0008429812441338">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0008429812441338">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0008429812441338">2008</xref>). In several chapters of his monograph on IGT, <italic>The Childhood of Jesus: Decoding the Apocryphal Infancy Gospel of Thomas</italic>, he applies methodology from his earlier work to this text, looking at such topics as Jesus’ gender socialization (moving from boyhood in his mother’s social sphere to manhood in his father’s), IGT’s portrayal of Jesus not as an adult in the body of a boy but as “a fairly true-to-life portrait of a late antiquity child—with the physical and mental traits, and the doings and relationships typical of such a child” (2009: 101), and Jesus’ interactions with parents and teachers as a reflection of class tensions (similar to Frilingos, he sees the activities of Jesus in the text as a reflection of a low- to middle-class “testing out of social and cultural boundaries,” 2009: 84). He also quite effectively sketches out IGT’s narrative world: a rural, village world of moderate size populated with residents of various ages (adults and children) and economic backgrounds (rich and poor and in-between) (2009: 68). Where Aasgaard perhaps goes too far in his assertions is in his equating of this narrative, fictive world with the world of the author. “The world depicted in IGT,” he writes, “is neither that of the historical Jesus nor of some particular group of believers, but that of early Christian rural common people … In my view, the <italic>Infancy Gospel of Thomas</italic> is an unadorned, yet precious gem handed down to us from the heritage of the first rural Christians” (2009: 190–191). But Aasgaard’s most contentious argument is his claim that the text was written specifically for children, as “Christianity’s first children’s story” (2009: 213). If so, this would make IGT particularly important for the study of children in Early Christianity because it would give us a rare example of children’s culture, albeit children’s culture as mediated through, and created by, adults. Ultimately, however, this is a difficult argument to swallow. For one, we have no evidence for texts written <italic>for</italic> children in antiquity. Aasgaard cites some examples of adult texts that were read to children—Aesop’s fables, myths from Homer and Virgil, stories from Genesis—and some references to fairy tales and rhymes that were told to children, but can adduce no text for which children were the “<italic>main</italic> target group” (2009: 192) as he does with IGT. A second problem with his argument is that it strains credibility that a text in which the young protagonist maims or slays other children, disobeys his parents, and defies his teachers would be considered edifying subject matter for children by parents of that time. Aasgaard admits this point may be problematic, but counters that the cursing Jesus is objectionable only to “our modern taste” (2009: 213). Yet, the anachronism, it seems, is in assuming that parent–child interaction with books (including the modern children’s book market) was the same in antiquity as it is in the best homes today.</p>

<title>4. Conclusions</title>
<p>Each of these five authors deserves some praise for choosing a difficult text, one usually dismissed as frivolous and crude, and taking it seriously as a reflection of Early Christian thought. They should be applauded too for using the text to study children in antiquity—whether their focus is purely on literary representations of children or on the use of the text for the entertainment of children. Nevertheless, scholars willing to use infancy gospels for the study of children need to be cautious in the conclusions they draw from these texts.</p>
<p>All sources for children in antiquity are fraught with problems. Where children appear in art and literature it is rarely in depictions that can be considered reflections of typical life experiences. Narratives are fanciful and the children who appear in them usually serve adult interests—either as props for the unfolding of the protagonist’s story or as a representation of an adult in the form of a child—and as such, are not truly children at all. Memoirs, which rarely include childhood anecdotes, tend to view their subject’s early life negatively and through the lens of adulthood. Legal texts occasionally mention children in their rulings, but the texts uphold outdated institutions or prescribe ideals, and tend to discuss extraordinary cases (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0008429812441338">Kraemer, 1989</xref>: 65–66; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0008429812441338">Rawson, 1991</xref>: 25–27). Funerary images and inscriptions created specifically to commemorate children often praise the prematurely deceased for their adult-like qualities and represent them visually in adult-like ways (see further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0008429812441338">Burke, 2010</xref>: 261–268). Christian sources fall prey also to the same problems; indeed, they may be more difficult to use given that they are composed not only by a male, adult elite, but also by a <italic>celibate</italic>, male adult elite with arguably even less of an interest in children than their Jewish and Greco-Roman counterparts. As in feminist biblical interpretation, sources for children must be approached with a “hermeneutic of suspicion.”</p>
<p>As plentiful as the apocryphal childhood stories are, they tell us very little about real children in Early Christianity. Even those texts that we can confidently date to our time period (IGT and <italic>Prot. Jas.</italic>) present their subjects in idealized ways—not as typical children but as children the way adults want them to be: mature, often serious, and wise beyond their years. Or, perhaps better: as the type of child the authors expect their protagonist to have been, or assume they must have been, if their text is to compete against other texts written in praise of their own heroes. At best, these texts show us something of children’s lives through the attempts of peripheral characters to have the youthful protagonist conform to their society’s expectations for children—e.g., to be educated, obedient to parents, respectful of elders, gentle to peers, etc. Only in juxtaposition to abnormal children and their behavior do we get a hint of what was considered normal.</p>

<p>There is a wealth of literature that traces the lives of children in antiquity—in both the Greco-Roman and Jewish contexts—examining such topics as family organization (e.g., the role of the <italic>pater familias</italic>, rates of divorce and remarriage, the number of children and slaves in the household), infant mortality and infanticide, wetnursing and childminding, play, discipline, education, apprenticeship, and a child’s responsibility to her/his parents in adulthood (see the extensive summary in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0008429812441338">Burke, 2010</xref>: 225–243). Children in Christian families would live in homes and communities variously blending the Jewish, Greco-Roman, and other regional experiences; but they would have to deal particularly with marginalization and possible persecution due to the families’ refusal to participate in state-sanctioned worship, and perhaps face limitations on their career mobility; nevertheless, they might see some benefit from the fictive kinship of their larger Christian “family” (see ibid., 243–247). IGT reflects our knowledge of childhood in antiquity in the parents’ responsibility to educate (chs 6, 14, and 15), train (chs 11, 12, and 13), and discipline (ch. 5) their children, as well as the townspeople’s concerns about Jesus’ precocious behavior (see further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0008429812441338">Burke, 2010</xref>: 284–288; and more extensively in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0008429812441338">Aasgaard, 2009</xref>: 53–102).</p>

<p>For a discussion of these representations see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0008429812441338">Burke (2010</xref>: 250–268). The sources include extraordinary figures such as those represented in the biographies of statesmen (e.g., in the works of Plutarch, Nepos, and the <italic>Scriptores Historiae Augustae</italic>), emperors (Alexander, Augustus), divine men (Apollonius, Pythagoras), philosophers (Plato, Demonax, Heraclitus), and a range of Jewish figures (Solomon, Daniel, Josephus)—all of whom are awarded childhood tales to demonstrate their maturity. But not to be ignored are depictions of ordinary children, represented in funerary art and inscriptions as the orator, cultic devotee, or soldier they would have been had they not died so young, or credited, as in the case of the deceased two-and-a-half-year-old Roman boy Kritiès, with the intelligence of someone of gray wisdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0008429812441338">Burke, 2010</xref>: 265).</p>
