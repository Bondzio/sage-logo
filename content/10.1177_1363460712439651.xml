<p>Inspired by Simon Hardy who sees ‘pornographic realism’ as the defining characteristic of pornography, this article argues that Taiwanese men identify more with Japanese adult videos (AVs) especially <italic>bishōjo</italic> (beautiful young woman) AVs, the prototypical genre in Japanese AV industry, than other varieties, because they appear to these men as more ‘real’. However, this article goes further to move beyond the reality–representation divide by arguing that the so-called ‘reality’ is also discursively constituted. We first demonstrate how the ‘proper’ sex act of men in Taiwan is discursively constituted through Simon and Gagnon’s notion of ‘sexual script’. We then show how this discursively mediated male sex in Taiwan parallels neatly with the structure of the narrative of nine Japanese <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs featuring Yuki Maiko, a prominent Japanese AV actress. We conclude that Japanese AVs in general and <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs in particular will garner huge popularity among Taiwanese men because they appear to these men very ‘real’. That is to say, the distinction between pornographic representations of sex and the ‘real’ sex vanishes not because pornographic representations are getting more ‘real’ as Hardy has argued, but because the so-called ‘real’ sex is also culturally constituted.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1363460712439651" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>It was a scorching hot afternoon in April 2004 that we<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1363460712439651">1</xref></sup> and Larry sat comfortably in a mid-hill open café in Tamshui. The spacious balcony, which overlooks the Tamshui River provides a quiet, comfortable setting for him to share his pornography tastes. Larry told us that among the many different varieties of pornography, he identified most strongly with Japanese adult videos (AVs), because he found Japanese AV actresses much more beautiful, sweet, and languid to a degree that he felt that his role was to <italic>take care of</italic> them in sex. Larry particularly indulged in the <italic>bishōjo</italic> (beautiful young woman) style, the prototypical genre in Japanese AV industry. He thought that Japanese <italic>bishōjo</italic> actresses, who often appear as schoolgirl, young wife, or young lonely girl, are ‘<italic>rouruo</italic>’ (fragile, languid and so on). It is exactly this languidness that made him feel that he is ‘desired,’ to the effect that he can ‘feel’ he is a real man in sex. By contrast, sex in other types of pornographies always happens because the two want sex out of physical desire and the women portrayed therein show no sign of desiring <italic>him</italic> from their heart. In short, Larry found the Japanese way of sexual representation much more sexually exciting and gratifying.</p>
<p>Larry’s preference for Japanese AVs in general and <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs in particular is by no means an exceptional case among our male informants in Taiwan. Our research in Taiwan revealed that a large segment of male informants, like Larry, showed strong preference for Japanese AVs in general and <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs in particular. As we have argued in our recent joint paper (Wong and Yau, n.d.), pornography use, and, in particular, pornography preference, are rarely addressed in the studies of pornography. This is largely due to the fact that explicating pornography preference is methodologically difficult, if not unfeasible. This is especially true if it is to account for collective preference. However, Simon Hardy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363460712439651">2009</xref>: 3) has recently offered a possible answer in the wake of the emergence of new pornographic genres such as gonzo,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1363460712439651">2</xref></sup> amateur, and sexblogs. Hardy argues that the emergence of these new pornographies represents a trend toward eliminating the distinction between reality and representation. Such a trend, he argues, in fact reveals that pornographic realism is the defining characteristic of pornography as a representational genre. That is to say, the more ‘real’ the pornographic movie appears, the more it is sexually attractive to pornography viewers. We happen to concur with Hardy’s argument that realism is the mainstay of pornography production. In this article, we likewise argue that Taiwanese men would identify more with Japanese AVs in general and <italic>bishōjo</italic> in particular because they appeared to these men as more ‘real’. However, we would also attempt to move beyond this reality–representation divide by arguing that the so-called reality is also discursively constituted. This means that not only pornographic representation but also the reality of sex is culturally constituted. In other words, the distinction between real sex and pornographic representation vanishes not because pornographic representation is getting closer to real sex but because ‘real’ sex is also culturally constituted.</p>
<p>In the pages that follow, we shall first examine how the ‘proper’ sex act of Taiwanese men is discursively constituted through Simon and Gagnon’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363460712439651">1986</xref>) notion of ‘sexual script’. We shall then explicate nine videos portraying Yuki Maiko, a prominent Japanese AV <italic>bishōjo</italic> actress, to see how sex is presented and represented in her movies, thereby delineating the structure of narrative of <italic>bishōjo</italic> AV, though simplified enormously. We contend that Taiwanese men identify more with Japanese especially <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs than other varieties of pornography because the narrative structure of <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs resembles the discursively mediated ‘real’ sex of Taiwanese men. One can see that while Simon and Gagnon’s sexual scripting originally refers to the guideline for appropriate sexual behaviour and sexual encounters, our article demonstrates that their notion of sexual script can also be applied to pornography production. To better situate our discussion, we shall turn to examine how the male preferences of pornography have been traditionally theorized and discussed in academic studies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1363460712439651"><title>Literature review</title>
<p>Western academic studies of pornography have long been preoccupied with research that aims to find out whether pornography has negative effects on viewers, in particular on the lives of women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363460712439651">Check and Malamuth, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363460712439651">Donnerstein et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363460712439651">Linz et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363460712439651">Malamuth, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363460712439651">McKenzie-Mohr and Zanna, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1363460712439651">Zillmann and Bryant, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1363460712439651">1984</xref>). Such research was the general western understanding of pornography and its understanding of the effects of pornography in the 1980s. On the other hand, there are also studies that deal directly with pornography preference. Broadly speaking, there are three sets of studies in relation to the study of pornography preference. The first set of studies examines whether repeated and prolonged consumption of common, nonviolent heterosexual pornography would foster an interest in uncommon erotic materials that are still capable of eliciting excitatory reactions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1363460712439651">Zillman and Bryant (1986)</xref>, for instance, report that students, especially male, who have been massively exposed to common nonviolent pornography, and who subsequently become dissatisfied with common pornography, tend to elect to watch pornography that is more hard core.</p>
<p>The second set of studies examines whether individual differences such as interpersonal problems, impersonal sex, aggressive/anti-social tendencies, and intelligence would affect people’s preference for pornography. Anthony <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363460712439651">Bogaert (2001)</xref> reports that individual differences such as higher levels of impersonal sexual attitudes and/or interest in sexual variation, and of dominance/aggression motives were highly predictive of preference for female insatiability media (i.e. films that present sexually voracious, indiscriminate women) among a group of undergraduate men. More importantly, men who specifically preferred sexually violent pornography were lower in intelligence and higher in dominance/hostility, impersonal sex, and aggressive/anti-social tendencies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363460712439651">Malamuth and Huppin (2005)</xref> likewise report that prolonged exposure to pornography could change individuals’ sexual attitudes, arousal and fantasies, and that these factors, in turn, lead to an increase in sexually aggressive behaviours. In other words, this set of studies tends to attribute pornographic preferences for violent or uncommon pornography to some specific types of personality.</p>
<p>The third set of studies perceives pornography preference in terms of evolutionary psychology. Nicholas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363460712439651">Pound (2002)</xref>, for instance, attempts to explain pornography preference as a product of men’s sexual adaptation to increase fertility. He argues that sperm competition is the real guiding principle of pornography and that pornography that incorporates cues of sperm competition (i.e. a scene that features a female and multiple males) will be more sexually arousing to men in general. His argument expands on Malamuth’s claim that pornography is produced to appeal to male interests and preferences that evolved to solve adaptive problems associated with mating in ancestral environments.</p>
<p>From this brief review, one can see that all three approaches omit some important aspects of pornography preference. Indeed in the first set of studies, pornography preference is not actually analysed; instead it shows how preference <italic>changes</italic> as a result of artificial interventions. That is to say, these studies do not even reveal ‘what’ is the preference per se, let alone why and how this preference comes about. While not totally denying the value of such studies, we contend that explicating the preference itself is more important. This article has been written specifically to tackle the issue of pornography preference.</p>
<p>The second set of studies tends to attribute the preference for violent pornography directly to some very individual characteristics or personalities – lower in intelligence or higher in anti-social tendencies. The problem here is exactly what Sahlins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363460712439651">1997</xref>: 273) calls the ‘limitation of self-awareness’. Cultural life is an inter-subjective field in which the people involved have different social experiences and local perceptions. These experiences and perceptions involve reasons and relationships that are themselves overlaid upon the lives of the subjects of the culture. For instance, one might relate why one fought in the Vietnam War, but this cannot explain why there is a war. Similarly, one can explain why one married this or that person, but this does not explain why monogamy exists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363460712439651">Sahlins, 1997</xref>: 273). In other words, while people might attribute viewing violent pornography to a number of reasons, they might not be <italic>the</italic> reasons that they like violent pornography. Moreover, the fact that they enjoy watching violent pornography does not help explain why violent pornography or pornography in general exists. To better understand the reasons why Taiwanese men would identify more with Japanese <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs than other varieties, we are convinced that we, as we shall return to shortly, need to look at how they understand and interpret themselves <italic>as</italic> sexual beings in Taiwan.</p>
<p>The third set of studies sees pornography preference as a by-product of Darwinian sexual selection. We have to point out immediately that, to explain human sexual orientation as a function of sexual selection is nothing less than a form of biological determinism, which is already criticised by a number of scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363460712439651">Kennelly et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363460712439651">Miller and Yang Costello, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363460712439651">Spanier, 2005</xref>). While pornography incorporating sperm competition cues might be sexually arousing for men, the reason that sperm competition cues are sexually arousing might not necessarily be due to the so-called adaptive problems associated with mating in ancestral environments. As Sahlins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363460712439651">1977</xref>: 7–9) once argued, people engage in wars for a wide array of reasons and these reasons are by no means necessarily aggressive – men might be moved to fight ‘out of love’, or ‘humanness’, for ‘honour’ or ‘self-esteem’, or to save the world as in holy war. Conversely, wars do not arise out of our motivations as human beings. War is but a relation ‘between State and State, and <italic>individuals are enemies accidentally, not as men, nor even as citizens, but as soldiers</italic>’ (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363460712439651">Sahlins, 1977</xref>: 9, italics original). It is against this that to see pornography preference in terms of men’s sexual adaptation to increase their fertility indeed amounts to what Sahlins calls the ‘abuse of biology’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1363460712439651"><title>Pornographic representation and ‘real’ sex</title>
<p>More recently, Hardy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363460712439651">2009</xref>) has offered a new perspective that is arguably a possible point of entry for our exploration of pornography preferences. Drawing on longstanding arguments between pornographic representations of sex and real sex, Hardy argues that the smaller the gap between pornographic representations of sexuality and real sex, the more attractive the pornographic movie is. In short, authenticity, Hardy argues, is the defining characteristic of pornography as a representational genre. This can be, as Hardy points out, widely observed in the longstanding practices of pornographers to narrow the gap between pornographic representations of sex and real sex experiences. Erotic or pornographic novels typically employ the tactic of being written by men in the assumed authorial character of a female narrative voice. Similar use of the female first-person narration can also be observed in erotic stories commonly found in newspaper columns. For pornographic movies, it is likewise a commonplace to use audio-visual media to document the performance of the sex act and to exploit amateur participation to achieve greater realism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363460712439651">Hardy, 2009</xref>: 5). All of this is done to narrow the gap between pornographic representation of sex and real sex so that the pornographic representation of sex can appear more ‘real’. That is why gonzo, amateur, and sexblogs have continued to garner increasing popularity with many pornography users, because they all strive to remove the distance between pornographic representations of sex and ‘real’ sex.</p>
<p>We happen to concur with Hardy that pornographic realism is the defining characteristic of pornography as a representational genre. In this article, we shall argue that Taiwanese men would identify with Japanese especially <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs precisely because these AV movies <italic>appeared</italic> to them very ‘real’. However, we shall also argue that the ‘real’ sex is but discursively constituted, as Hardy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363460712439651">2009</xref>: 3) himself warns us that the so-called real sex cannot, ‘in light of postmodern thought … as the obligatory quotation marks suggest, be taken for granted’. We would suggest that such an understanding of sex in real life does not necessarily demand a postmodern explanation. The underlying theoretical issue here is the classical problem of whether human sexual needs and preferences are biological and thus universal. We point out elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363460712439651">Yau and Wong, 2010</xref>) that when Japanese AVs made their inroads into Taiwan, they were often subject to various alterations such as the adding of Chinese subtitles before they are marketed to Taiwanese customers. The rationale behind these alterations on the part of the local agents is that Taiwanese customers’ preferences are different from those of their Japanese counterparts; Japanese AVs must be modified according to the local taste in order to sell well in Taiwan. It follows that human sexual preferences are not biological and universal; otherwise all such changes would not be necessary. We further examine the Chinese subtitling of Japanese AV clips and discover that the way the subtitles are prepared for the clips casts light on what Sahlins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363460712439651">1976</xref>: 148) calls the ‘cultural code’ that governs the ‘use-values’ of pornography in Taiwan. The Taiwanese reproduction of Japanese AVs, we conclude, is therefore not about need-satisfaction but rather concerns the production of culturally constructed sexual use-values. This conclusion points precisely to the problem of the unchanging permanence of human sexual desires and preferences.</p>
<p>Readers should be reminded that we are not campaigning for the privilege of production-led over consumption-led approach. We instead argue that the old, exaggerating opposition between ‘production’ and ‘consumption’, which has been and is still lingering in the social sciences, is unnecessary if not misleading. As Sahlins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363460712439651">1976</xref>: 169) succinctly argues, ‘[w]ithout consumption, the object does not complete itself as a product; a house left unoccupied is not a house’. We argue in the same article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363460712439651">Yau and Wong, 2010</xref>) that the same cultural code that governs the ‘use-value’ of Japanese AVs can also serve as a model for Taiwanese viewers’ consumption of Japanese AVs because otherwise the reproduction of Japanese AVs would not be sexually appealing to them. Seen in this way, the relation between production and consumption is not as oppositional as is commonly believed because they in fact follow the same cultural code.</p>
<p>Following this line of argument, this article argues that Taiwanese men would prefer Japanese <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs over other pornographies because the narrative structure of the former shares a similar cultural code with that of the Taiwanese ‘real’ sex. In more concrete terms, we shall demonstrate that the discursively constituted ‘proper’ act in sex resembles very much the narrative structure of Japanese <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs. Or, along another line of development, the idea of ‘proper act of sex’ is crossed with Simon and Gagnon’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363460712439651">1986</xref>: 98) theory of sexual scripts, which consists of cultural scenarios, interpersonal scripts, and intrapsychic scripts. Cultural scenarios are a repertoire of social grammars that allow us to act properly in a given sexual context. Yet, we never act the same as others because we shape the cultural scenarios into scripts according to the specific interpersonal context and the internal rehearsal of our behaviours whereby our desires are linked to social meanings. Central to this theory is the social specification of ‘proper’ act in sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363460712439651">Simon and Gagnon, 1986</xref>: 119). Since the current article deals with the grammatically ‘correct’ act in sex rather than idiosyncratic sexual behaviours of individuals, we shall focus on the cultural scenarios of sex as a repertoire of social grammars defining the proper act of sex in Taiwan.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1363460712439651"><title>The sexual script in Taiwan</title>
<p>If Simon and Gagnon’s scripting theory is concerned with the social specification of sex, it follows that to understand this so-called ‘real’ sex in Taiwan is to understand the sexual script in Taiwan, or more accurately the cultural scenarios of sex in Taiwan. But how?</p>
<p>In her highly influential work <italic>Gender Trouble</italic> (1999[1990]: 9–11), Butler levelled criticism at the sex/gender binary system where gender is seen as the cultural interpretation of a biological sex. In the first place, Butler argues, the sex/gender distinction indicates a radical discontinuity between sexed bodies and culturally constructed genders. Even if there was such a distinction between sex and gender, it does not follow that 'the construction of “men” will accrue exclusively to the bodies of males or that “women” will interpret only female bodies' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363460712439651">Butler 1999[1990]</xref>: 9-10). In the second place, the distinction proves false because the sexed body is itself culturally constructed by ‘regulative discourses’ which decide in advance what possibilities of sex, gender, and sexuality are socially permitted to appear as ‘natural’. In other words, sexed body cannot stand alone without gender. In short, both gender and sex are culturally constructed.</p>
<p>Following Butler’s insights, we argue that the sexual script in Taiwan is in fact discursively constituted. In our another recent article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363460712439651">Wong and Yau, 2011</xref>), we explore how Taiwanese informants, men and women alike, talked about sex in terms of six pairs of binary oppositions: namely, biological vs. cultural, physical vs. spiritual, ordinary vs. non-ordinary, necessary vs. unnecessary, uncontainable vs. containable and finally ‘animal’-like vs. ‘human’-like. More crucially, they ultimately paralleled these six pairs of binary oppositions with the contrast between men and women in Taiwan. That is to say, the male sex is <italic>seen as</italic> biological, physical, ordinary, necessary, uncontainable, and thus ‘animal’-like whereas the female sex is <italic>seen</italic> as cultural, spiritual, non-ordinary, unnecessary, containable and thus ‘human’-like. The way Taiwanese informants talked about sex is therefore not only culturally constructed, but also <italic>gendered</italic> (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1363460712439651">Table 1</xref>).

<p>Our research further reveals that the ‘proper’ sexual behaviour or the sexual script of Taiwanese people, men and women alike, is heavily informed by the six pairs of binary oppositions just mentioned. Consider that if the male sex is ‘animal’-like, biological, physical, ordinary, and thus necessary and uncontainable, it follows that men must take an ‘active’ role in the pursuit of sex. For if sex is seen as necessary and uncontainable for men, it means that men have to actively look for sex, just like they would make concerted efforts to find food to relieve their hunger. More crucially, the meaning of ‘active role’ in sex often goes beyond the pursuit of sex itself to affect how men perform in the actual sex act. In the sex act, men must lead the sex by taking the initiative as well as taking charge of the act, for if they ‘need’ sex, it is ‘natural’ that they initiate and guide the sex and not the reverse. To be able to lead and guide the act, men also need to learn the mechanics of sex as early as possible and prepare themselves with other related sexual knowledge. This serves to explain why Taiwanese men were generally interested in sex and often actively solicited pornographic material from a young age and why they continue to watch these materials in adult years. In short, the sexual script of Taiwanese men is underlined by five imperatives, namely the imperative to initiate sex, to guide their women throughout the sex act, to swap into an expanded repertoire of sexual postures, to perform penetration for a certain period of time and to bring orgasm to their women.</p>
<p>By contrast, if the female sex is ‘human’-like, cultural, spiritual, non-ordinary, and thus unnecessary and containable, it follows that women must be ‘passive’ in sex. Passivity means that women need not actively pursue sex, because sex is simply not a necessary or ordinary thing for them. Given that women do not ‘need’ sex in the first place, there is no need for them to be active in the actual sex. On the contrary, women are supposed to be passive, waiting to be led and guided. As passive recipients of sex, women also do not need to pursue sexual knowledge or to consume pornography. This in part explains why Taiwanese women were generally uninterested in sex and did not consume pornographic materials even when such materials were around them throughout their teen-hood and adulthood.</p>
<p>The sexual script of Taiwanese women can be further understood through the Chinese concept of ‘<italic>shun qing</italic>’ or simply ‘<italic>shun</italic>’, which still exerts a strong cultural sway over Taiwan and Hong Kong. ‘<italic>Shun qing</italic>’ is commonly referred to a woman who is moral, naive, pure, well bred, wholesome, dignified, conscientious and good-natured. In essence, this concept prioritises her moral character rather than her sexual aspect. A ‘<italic>shun qing</italic>’ woman is highly praised by Taiwanese and Hong Kong men to the effect that it is regarded as the ideal type of woman to be the latter’s marital partner. By contrast, a libidinous woman is never positively evaluated in Taiwan and Hong Kong, though she might be sexually desired by men. That is to say, while men might sexually desire libidinous women, they will never consider them as martial partners. Sexually demanding and lustful women are described as ‘<italic>yin jian</italic>’. ‘<italic>Yin</italic>’ refers to excessiveness of sexual desire while ‘<italic>jian</italic>’ denotes vulgar, base, mean, degraded and cheap. Other similar binaries viewing women as two distinct and separate personas includes <italic>zhengjing</italic> (decent) and <italic>buzhengjing</italic> (indecent), <italic>guai</italic> (good) and <italic>huai</italic> (bad), <italic>baoshou</italic> (serious) and <italic>po</italic> (loose), and so on.</p>
<p>These cultural concepts serve to dictate the ideal image of women in the Chinese societies of Hong Kong and Taiwan. Chinese women are inundated with sexual communication from an early age. From a very young age, they are exposed to endless messages about modesty, nudity and privacy, including gender-specific messages about proper conduct. Girls are warned that sexual experimentations will not only be severely punished, but also seriously damage their future. Through daily and mundane practices, women are socialized into believing that they should not display their sexual desire publicly – for to acknowledge one’s own sexual desire is about the same as standing naked in public – and even that women do not have a need for sex. Instead, women should be <italic>shun qing</italic>, and thus passive and innocent in sex. In this process, the female identity is moralised but at the same time desexualised, especially in the initial process of sex.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1363460712439651"><title>The transformative power of the male sex in Taiwan</title>
<p>However, it must be cautioned that while a Taiwanese man is expected to initiate, lead, and guide the sex act in which his woman is passive, waiting to be caressed, penetrated, and orgasmed, it is just one side of the process. Significant as female passivity might be in the initial process of sex, it is not what a man ultimately desires from his woman. For he equally cannot enjoy himself in sex if she remains unresponsive or ‘<italic>siyu</italic>’ (a dead fish) all through the sex act. Here comes the significance of <italic>tiaojiao</italic> (train or tame) by man, who must turn his woman as active and responsive in sex as he is. Over the course of successfully <italic>tiaojiao</italic> his woman, Taiwanese men can derive a male sense of achievement. This sense of achievement in transforming the sexually uninvolved lady into a sexually active partner, who enjoys sex and attains orgasm, is arguably even more sexually pleasurable for men than the physical penetration.</p>
<p>Sex is no doubt an important cultural signifier through which manhood is presented and negotiated in Taiwan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363460712439651">Boretz, 2004</xref>). Sexual potency is called <italic>xingnengli</italic> (literally, capacity in sex). Although its opposite should be <italic>xingwuneng</italic>, very often, <italic>wuneng</italic> (lack of capacity in general) is enough to denote this meaning. One can see that sexual impotency is so terrible a failure that it amounts to incapacity in general. This usage implies that sexual potency is another critical marker of masculine character in Taiwan, in addition to talent and wealth, as can be seen in a popular Chinese saying <italic>nancai nvmao</italic>, meaning male talent/wealth and female beauty. Just as men are concerned about having prosperous careers and earning a good sum of money, they also care about their capability in sex.</p>
<p>In terms of the physical qualities, the so-called <italic>xingnengli</italic> manifests in the hardness of a man’s penis and the length of time it can remain erect, arguably two fundamental symbolic constituents of male identity in Taiwan. That is why many of our middle-aged male informants told us that they routinely took <italic>yaojiu</italic> (medicinal wines made from Chinese folk prescriptions). When asked why, their answers seem rather uniform: they wanted to ensure that they were ‘<italic>bang bang jiao</italic>’, meaning not only powerful and potent in their sexual performance, but also a firm confirmation of their male identity.</p>
<p>In terms of the sex act, <italic>xingnengli</italic> manifests in a man’s sexual skill and performance. A good number of our young male informants incessantly expressed their concerns over sexual performances. They thought that a ‘good’ boyfriend must be at once a good sex performer. In other words, whether they are good boyfriends, to a large extent, hinges upon their sexual prowess. By a good performer, our male informants primarily refer to a man who can lead and initiate the sex act, perform sexual intercourse for a certain period of time; who manages to swap into an expanded repertoire of sexual postures; and who can bring his partner to orgasm and hence satisfy the woman <italic>sexually</italic>. Central to this understanding of their role as boyfriend is the caring and good treatment of the women sexually, an idea repeatedly voiced by our young male informants. One can see that the male imperative of <italic>dandang</italic> (a sense of male responsibility) embedded in the Taiwanese cultural manhood has permeated into the arena of sex. It is through ‘taking good care of’ a woman via lengthy intercourse, different postures, and orgasm that Taiwanese men feel that they are ‘good’ boyfriends and more crucially, ‘real’ men with <italic>dandang</italic>. As a male informant of Chin Kuang-huai who analysed manhood in Taiwan remarks, ‘I have beads implanted in my genital and the beads are intended to enhance [my girlfriend’s] orgasm; listening to her groaning and looking at her orgasmic face can greatly massage my ego’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363460712439651">Chin, 1997</xref>: 62).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1363460712439651"><title>The so-called ‘real’ sex to men in Taiwan</title>
<p>Putting all of this back into the six pairs of binary oppositions outlined earlier, one can at once realise that this sense of sexual pleasure is indeed meant to ‘transcend’ the binary oppositions between the male sex and the female sex by transforming the ‘human’-woman whose sex is cultural, spiritual, non-ordinary, and unnecessary into an ‘animal’-man whose sex is biological, physical, ordinary, and thus necessary so that she will desire and enjoy sex as much as a man will (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1363460712439651">Table 2</xref>). In other words, men attempt to appropriate one side of the binary totally within the other, subsuming the ‘human’-woman in the ‘animal’-man, so that at the end only one (i.e. the ‘animal’-man) has independent existence. This sense of pleasure is predicated on whether a man can transform his woman into a ‘man’ sexually, by turning her on and bringing sexual pleasure to her.

<p>The transcendental pleasure derived through transforming the ‘human’-woman into an ‘animal’-man in turn explains why Taiwanese men generally cannot sexually identify with a woman who is <italic>from the outset</italic> an ‘animal’-man, desiring and enjoying sex as much as a man will do. For if she is an ‘animal’-man from the outset, there is simply no room for man to participate in sex by initiating, leading, and guiding it or turning her into an ‘animal’-man. In other words, the man cannot ‘take good care of’ his woman sexually. Failure to ‘take care of’ the woman sexually does not just mean that he has no function in sex. More crucially, it poses a great challenge to him <italic>as</italic> a man. That is precisely why a large number of our male informants show a blatant distaste for the sexually aggressive or experienced women, because they cannot take care of this kind of women sexually. To hide their fear or justify their inability, they could not but reject them variously as ‘promiscuous’, ‘loose', or simply ‘cheap’. A man will be equally sexually dissatisfied if he fails to turn the sexually innocent or uninvolved lady into a sexually active partner, because he cannot derive any sense of achievement in the sex. More crucially, his failure to do so, no matter whether it is because of his lack of skill, or her frigidity, speaks of his uselessness, if not sexual impotence.</p>
<p>One can see that to Taiwanese men, sex <italic>appears</italic> to be a transformative process in which a sexually innocent woman metamorphoses into a sexually adventurous woman who enjoys and desires sex as much as men do, as a result of men’s sexual stimulations. We conclude that this is what <italic>is</italic> ‘real’ to men in Taiwan.</p>
<p>One remaining question is where does the notion of sex as a transformative means come from. We argue that the transformative power of sex in Taiwanese society in fact bears a significant parallel with the Taiwanese cosmology with regard to body. Taiwanese people tend to regard a human life as made up of two elements, <italic>qi</italic> (breath or vapour) and <italic>xing</italic> (corporeal form). <italic>Qi</italic> is essentially a male essence and <italic>the</italic> source of life, which men automatically obtain from their fathers by birth. Women, by contrast, cannot obtain <italic>qi</italic> by birth and thus not a complete human being socially. They can only obtain <italic>qi</italic> from their husbands through marriage. <italic>Xing</italic> is essentially a female essence, while less significant than <italic>qi</italic>, it is nonetheless an indispensable part for creating a new life and therefore a thing which men would need when creating their own descendants. To simplify enormously here, under such Taiwanese cosmology, men ultimately strive to transform their women into a ‘complete’ human being as themselves through marriage thereby producing their own descendents. This logic has a significant parallel with the view of the male sex in Taiwan in which men attempt to transform their women’s sexual being from being ‘human’-like to ‘animal’-like, so that in the end they become the same <italic>kind</italic>. As we shall show very shortly, this so-called ‘real’ sex resembles very much the narrative structure of Japanese <italic>bishōjo</italic> AV, which in turn accounts for Taiwanese men’s preference for <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1363460712439651"><title>A brief history of Japanese AVs in Japan and Taiwan</title>
<p>Japanese AVs are a form of pornographic video that took shape in Japan in the early 1980s. From the outset, Japanese AVs were required to have genitalia including pubic hair airbrushed under the censorship laws, although the display of pubic hair is no longer illegal since 1996. Japanese AVs have two major styles of production: <italic>tantai</italic> AV and <italic>kikaku</italic> AV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363460712439651">Suitsu, 1998</xref>: 2). <italic>Tantai</italic> is a style of production that features a single actress. Usually she has a very nice face and figure, and is the key female featured throughout the whole video. For this reason, the term <italic>tantai</italic> often links with <italic>bishōjo</italic>, because being a beautiful young woman is the prerequisite for becoming a <italic>tantai</italic> actress. In early <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs, actress was often featured in a naive way, or in the ‘courtly and decent’ way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363460712439651">Yau and Wong, 2008</xref>: 35). <italic>Kikaku</italic>, by contrast, emphasises context and story line and there may be many actresses in the same video. In the 1990s, there were roughly 20 thematic genres in <italic>kikaku</italic> videos, such as rape, sadomasochism, wives, nymphomaniacs, elderly women, huge breasts, incest and so forth. The images of women portrayed in <italic>kikaku</italic> AVs tend to be diverse and multivalent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363460712439651">Fujiki, 1998a</xref>: 152).</p>
<p>However, the AV market in Japan entered a deep recession in the early 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363460712439651">Suitsu, 1998</xref>: 6). In 1991, sales dropped across the board. Almost half of the rental shops went out of business and many makers went bankrupt as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363460712439651">Suitsu, 1998</xref>: 7). The sale of <italic>tantai bishōjo</italic> AVs, which had been dominating the market until then, dropped sharply and most of the makers switched to the production of <italic>kikaku</italic> AVs. By the early 1990s, <italic>tantai</italic> AVs constituted only 30% of the whole market, while the remaining 70% was taken up by <italic>kikaku</italic> AVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363460712439651">Azuma, 1998</xref>: 97).</p>
<p>Yet <italic>kikaku</italic> AVs’ share of the adult video market in Japan has gradually diminished since the mid-1990s, due largely to overproduction as well as slipshod production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363460712439651">Suitsu, 1998</xref>: 8). It is against this background that ‘indie AVs’ (the truncated term for independence) began to take root in the Japanese AV industry. Indie movies not only departed from the mainstream AVs by stressing ‘individuality’, but also contravened the industry's regulations in that they showed pubic hair and used semi-transparent mosaic, to the effect that genitalia were partially visible. As fully mosaicked Japanese AVs were produced for rental service, indie movie makers ventured into sales and, for this reason, their videos came to be known as sales (i.e. vending) videos, as opposed to the rental videos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363460712439651">Inoue, 2002</xref>: 18). Since then, Japanese AVs can be obtained via rental shops as well as retail shops located throughout Japan.</p>
<p>This brief history reveals that Japanese AVs are, as a result of the censorship, rendered as a kind of soft-core pornographic material, as opposed to the hard-core Euro-American pornography. Even though indie movies employ a thinner mosaic, their penetration scenes including views of genitalia are all airbrushed in the same fashion as the traditional sale AVs. This is especially true for the early <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs. Some of these movies did not even have coitus scenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363460712439651">Yasuda and Amamiya, 2006</xref>: 94) and actresses such as Kobayashi Hitomi, a lengendary AV queen, even overtly admitted that they did not have ‘real’ sex in the movie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363460712439651">Suitsu, 1998</xref>: 72). Many of the <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs including the ones we are going to discuss later have their coitus scenes out of the frame.</p>
<p>The same brief history also demonstrates that Japanese AVs are primarily a kind of domestic product with no international outlet. It must be stressed that Japanese AV makers have hesitated to export their products to overseas markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363460712439651">Yasuda and Amamiya, 2006</xref>: 187) and have never exported to Taiwan. As we shall see shortly, all Japanese AVs in Taiwan are of the so-called ‘pirated’ variety. More importantly, the emergence of sale AVs that are available in retail shops throughout Japan in fact serves to encourage the piracy of Japanese AVs overseas, because it means that access to AVs has become easier for pirate merchants.</p>
<p>Japanese AV emerged in Taiwan in the mid-1980s. At that time, Japanese AVs (as videotape) were manipulated by local illegal cable television operators who directly re-broadcast them as programmes in Taiwan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363460712439651">Yeh, 1997</xref>: 42). In other words, most of the content of these Japanese AVs remained the same. However, Japanese AVs in Taiwan began to undergo significant changes from the mid-1990s, when they were remade as pirated pornographic VCDs (and later internet files) by local pirate merchants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363460712439651">Yau, 2009</xref>: 84). Unlike the illegal cable TV operators, who just rebroadcast Japanese AVs as they were, pirated VCD merchants became ‘makers’ who sourced master tapes from Japan and <italic>creatively</italic> tailored them to an audience of Taiwanese men, with an eye to extract the greatest possible profit. For instance, pirated VCD merchants would use covers of famous Japanese AVs in Taiwan to sell unpopular or unknown actresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363460712439651">Yau, 2009</xref>: 84). They would invent Chinese titles that revolved around local sexual terminologies for their pirated Japanese VCDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363460712439651">Yau, 2009</xref>: 84). The invention of new Chinese titles to replace, or place on top of, the Japanese titles means that these ‘invented’ titles were considered more sexually intelligible to, and hence more effective in turning on, Taiwanese viewers. Moreover, pirate merchants would combine movies of famous AV girls with clips of unknown actresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363460712439651">Yau, 2009</xref>: 85). The logic here is patently simple: to deceive Taiwanese customers by using famous Japanese AV girls in Taiwan to sell unpopular or unsaleable AVs. Later when Japanese AVs began to take the form of internet files, web operators in Taiwan again tailored these materials to Taiwanese users to maximise their profits. To them, all these alterations are simply ways of creatively producing attractive pirated VCDs or internet files for <italic>local</italic> viewers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1363460712439651"><title>The images of women portrayed in Japanese AVs</title>
<p>Elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363460712439651">Yau and Wong, 2009</xref>), we have delineated three different images of women commonly portrayed in Japanese AVs, namely ‘women as victim’, ‘sexually aggressive women’, and ‘the girl-next-door’.</p>
<sec id="sec9-1363460712439651"><title>Woman as victim</title>
<p>In the genres of ‘<italic>reipu</italic>’ (rape), ‘<italic>kankin</italic>’ (imprisonment), ‘<italic>chikan</italic>’ (a molester on the train), and ‘<italic>mensetsu</italic>’ (interview setting), women are commonly portrayed as victims. In <italic>reipu</italic>, women are invariably made to do fellatio, but while they initially cry in response to the act they soon after become sexually aroused by it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363460712439651">Sawaki, 1998a</xref>: 168). Equally, the genre of <italic>kankin</italic> features the confinement of a woman in a very small, enclosed apartment, where she is raped, and scenes where she is fed like a dog or made to excrete in the sink are standard. Its central aim is to arouse a sexual impulse that is obtained through the control of women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363460712439651">Udagawa, 1998a</xref>: 170–171).</p>
<p>The practice of men groping women on trains, known as <italic>chikan</italic> (a sexual molester), refers to how an anonymous assailant takes advantage of the stifling congestion to molest hapless young OLs (office ladies) or schoolgirls, who are too meek to protest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363460712439651">Udagawa, 1998b</xref>: 180).</p>
<p>The foregoing genres show one consistent pattern: women are portrayed as victims of patriarchal dominance and their misfortunes are unavoidable. More crucially, these genres deliver an important message to male viewers that even should women resist, they will eventually succumb to their bodily pleasure and the male mistreatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1363460712439651"><title>Sexually aggressive woman</title>
<p>The genres of ‘<italic>hitozuma</italic>’ (wife), ‘<italic>gibo</italic>’ (foster mother), ‘<italic>kifujin</italic>’ (noblewoman), and ‘<italic>jukuj</italic>o’ (mature women) describe the excessive sexual desires of the adult, mature woman. The attractive nature of these genres lies in the aspect of a ‘change’ in these mature women, from being reserved to being sexually aroused (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363460712439651">Hanii, 1998</xref>: 176).</p>
<p>Another genre that represents women as sexually aggressive is ‘<italic>chijo</italic>’ (female molester) which refers to the sexual seduction of men by flirty girls. Here, these female molesters are similar to the western femme fatale, who ensnares men in public places such as toilets, offices, and streets in the city in bonds of irresistible desire, often leading men to ‘fall’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363460712439651">Sawaki, 1998b</xref>: 178).</p>
<p>Bearing a resemblance to <italic>chijo</italic> but not exactly of the same fashion is a genre called ‘<italic>kateinai sōkan</italic>’ (family incest). On the surface, family incest seems to portray women (mothers, sisters or daughters) as victims of patrilineal desires. A deeper look into it, however, reveals that these women are active participants who, for whatever reason, desire their family members in the first place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363460712439651">Fujiki, 1998b</xref>: 172).</p>
<p>Inherent in these genres is the insatiable desire of women. No matter what social categories they occupy (be they young girls, wives, married women or middle-aged women), they uniformly have strong carnal desires. Once their desires are stirred up, they will be driven into various amatory adventures and have their desires satisfied at all costs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1363460712439651"><title>The girl-next-door</title>
<p>In <italic>bishōjo</italic>, women are usually presented in either a cute or a courtly way. In the early 1980s, Cosmo Plan, one of the oldest makers of adult videos in Japan, launched a label known as ‘Cosmo <italic>bishōjo</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363460712439651">Tora, 1998</xref>: 119). The Cosmo <italic>bishōjo</italic> often appear ‘in a one-piece cute dress and a straw hat, and with dimpled cheeks’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363460712439651">Tora, 1998</xref>: 119), or in a sailor suit which is imbued with a sense of amateurishness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363460712439651">Azuma, 1998</xref>: 94). Later in 1989, Shimamura Yukibiko, an AV director, launched a variant label known as ‘high-class <italic>bishōjo</italic>’. The high-class <italic>bishōjo</italic> is instead arrayed in splendid and usually white lingerie and at times, even decorated with jewellery crowns, amounting to ‘<italic>ojōsama</italic>’ (upper-class lady) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363460712439651">Azuma, 1998</xref>: 95). However, no matter whether these <italic>bishōjo</italic> are cute or courtly, their personalities are after all simple and straightforward.</p>
<p>Other genres that depict women as the-girl-next-door include ‘<italic>seifuku mono</italic>’ (costume play), ‘<italic>joshi kōsei</italic>’ (young schoolgirls), and ‘<italic>shojo</italic>’ (virgin). Costume play refers to the interest in uniform wearing, for instance nurses, flight attendants, waitresses, department-store girls, and race queens<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1363460712439651">3</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363460712439651">Saito, 1998b</xref>: 164). The genre of young schoolgirls portrays a pure, sexually innocent young girl who is the ideal for men, and occasionally a relatively more casual girl who would engage in ‘<italic>enjokōsai</italic>’ (compensated dating),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1363460712439651">4</xref></sup> or ‘<italic>yarikon</italic>’ (a sex party), for money or pure fun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363460712439651">Saito, 1998a</xref>: 162). By contrast, the genre of the virgin features the deflowering of virgin girls, who are sexually inexperienced, shy, and helpless. Their ‘fresh’ bodies and youthful skin make them look like ‘dolls’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363460712439651">Udagawa, 1998c</xref>: 186).</p>
<p>Central to these ‘girl-next-door’ styles is the theme of the consumption of virgins or/and sexually inexperienced women. To deflower a virgin certainly signifies the possession of this woman. To have sex with a sexually inexperienced woman means that the man can dominate the whole process. Behind these genres, one can also see the male sexual attraction to Lolita, a style of woman who is gorgeous, but sweet and even babyish, and who acts completely innocent and naive.</p>
<p>According to the anthropological fieldwork one of the authors conducted in Taipei between October 2002 and August 2005 in which 22 Taiwanese male informants ranging in age between 19 and 54 recruited through snowballing were approached to participate in in-depth interviews, most of our male informants displayed a strong interest in Japanese AVs in general and <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs in particular. This was in comparison with other genres such as <italic>kikaku</italic> movies or other types of pornography such as American or European pornographies. More crucially, they even conflate this specific genre with Japanese AVs as a whole. The reasons for their preference centred on the fact that Japanese bishojo AV girls are sweet, innocent, girly, and cute. In other words, most of our male informants identified with ‘the girl-next-door’ image of women. We therefore focus on exploring why Taiwanese men prefer the girl-next-door image rather than the other two through analysing the narrative structure of nine AVs featuring Yuki Maiko, a prominent Japanese <italic>bishōjo</italic> actress in Japan as well as in Taiwan and Hong Kong.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1363460712439651" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title>
<p>In this section, we shall delineate, through content analysis, the narrative structure of a set of nine <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs featuring Yuki Maiko. Yuki Maiko is a prominent Japanese AV actress, who has starred mainly as <italic>bishōjo</italic> throughout her AV career. Debuting in 1995, Yuki Maiko won such great acclaim among men in Hong Kong and Taiwan in the late 1990s that she came out of her retirement in Japan in 1998. Before her reappearance in 1998, Yuki Maiko starred in nine videos, which were all <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs. The sample movies used in this analysis were the pirated versions of these nine AVs collected by the authors in Hong Kong or Taiwan during the late 1990s. All of her movies in Hong Kong or Taiwan were pirated versions because the Japanese AV industry, as mentioned earlier, had never exported AVs overseas.</p>
<p>The principle method employed here is ‘ethnographic content analysis’ (hereafter ECA. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363460712439651">Altheide, 1987</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1363460712439651">5</xref></sup> The first phase of the analysis was to sort the movies into topics or categories. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363460712439651">Kronhausen and Kronhausen (1961)</xref> have identified 11 major categories (subplots or subthemes) of ‘mechanism’ commonly found in pornography. The 11 categories are seduction, defloration, incest, permissive/seductive parent, profanation of the sacred, sexual vernacular, supersexed works, nymphomaniac females, homosexuality and flagellation (Kronhasen and Kronhausen 1961: 850–854). However, since the pornographic movies we are concerned with here are Japanese <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs, we asked our informants in Taiwan to describe Japanese <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs and <italic>bishōjo</italic> AV girls so that we could have our own workable categories. Through asking our 22 male informants who had extensive viewing experiences of Japanese <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs, we obtained seven major categories, which were primarily concerned with images: namely, ‘childish’, ‘virginally shy’ (sexually inexperienced), ‘cute’, ‘wilful’, ‘obedient’, ‘sexually ready and adventurous’ and ‘enjoying sex’.</p>
<p>Coding movies into categories proved to be a straightforward task. Following Wosnitzer and Bridges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363460712439651">2007</xref>: 12) who conducted content analysis on pornographic movies, the unit of analysis here is the ‘scene’. Wosnitzer and Bridges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363460712439651">2007</xref>) define the scene through the demarcation of the DVD menu. However, the movies we are analysing here are VCDs, which unfortunately do not have the scene selection menu. But we followed Wosnitzer and Bridges’s alternative suggestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363460712439651">2007</xref>: 12, italic ours) to ‘record a <italic>scene</italic>, through visual and auditory cues, that showed primary characters sexually interacting in a particular setting with a finite temporality’. After developing the coding schemes and completing the coding ourselves, we communicated our coding criteria and supplied the coding scheme to a colleague familiar with ethnographic content analysis and coding but not with the particular issue of this study. We asked her to choose randomly some movies and code some scenes for us. Our coding matched in 96% of cases. In other words, the results we obtained from her are fairly consistent with the coding we had done.</p>
<p>From the results of our coding of the scenes, we found out that ‘virginal shyness’, and ‘sexual readiness/adventurousness’ constitute the most represented categories in Yuki Maiko’s nine movies. Next to them were ‘cuteness’ and ‘sexual enjoyment’. However, categories of virginal shyness and cuteness are clearly contradictory to those of sexual readiness/adventurousness and sexual enjoyment. This discovery forced us to ask: How should we understand this if these two sets of opposing themes exist in the same video? We are convinced that they in fact tell us something more crucial about the narrative structure of Japanese <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs.</p>
<p>The second phase of analysis therefore involved rediscovering and comparing the categories and further sorting the seven categories into analytical constructs appropriate for our current investigation. While pornography in general and Japanese AVs, in particular, is often thought to be sexist and misogynist, exploiting both the women inside and outside the movies, a deeper look at the contents of most of the Japanese AVs will however show that Japanese AV girls are the ones who are sexually pleasured and pleased by the male characters, but not the other way around. More importantly, the sexual stimulation of Japanese AV girls by the male characters, as we shall show shortly, is considerably longer than the reverse. Leaving aside whether these Japanese AV girls are <italic>really</italic> enjoying sex, most of them are rendered ‘sexually satisfied’ or ‘sexually adventurous’, at the end of the movies. Certainly, we do not deny the fact that these women, as Japanese AV actresses, might be exploited, but at least in these pornographic <italic>representations</italic> of sex, they are <italic>not</italic>. In other words, the accusation that Japanese AVs are sexist or misogynistic should not be taken for granted as it appears to be. The third step is to analyse what these derived analytical constructs ultimately tell us about the narrative structure of <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs.</p>

<p>Yuki Maiko is a prolific AV actress, starring in nine videos in her rather brief AV career, from 1995 to 1996 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1363460712439651">Table 3</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1363460712439651">7</xref></sup> Seven of her movies belonged to the label of ‘Tiffany’ (a high-class <italic>bishōjo</italic> as directed by Shimamura) while the remaining two belonged to Cosmo Plan.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1363460712439651">8</xref></sup> That is to say, all her videos are <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs. In her videos, she is thus often ornamented with beautiful basque or otherwise extremely innocent underwear; her hair is neatly combed and styled; her face is beautifully made up; her nails polished, and sometimes she is even decorated with a bejewelled crown, and she is surrounded by elaborately gorgeous settings. Even though there are slight differences in the style of one from another, six out of our nine sample VCDs contain similar introductory scenes.

<p>In the introductory scene of <italic>Loss of Virginity</italic>, Yuki Maiko is pictured wearing a white basque, with white suspenders and a pair of red high-heels. In moving toward the beautifully made bed by her side, she stares innocently at the camera. Now lying on the bed, while she places herself in some inviting positions, she nonetheless portrays herself in a naïve and youthful fashion by grinning at and making an air-kiss to the camera. This introductory sequence and Yuki Maiko’s characteristic cute-cum-childish behaviour within it seem to be a common occurrence in her other videos.</p>
<p>After a brief introduction, the camera moves back to the story. Usually at this point Yuki Maiko is fully dressed either in childish clothes or in a swimsuit. As the story unfolds, she then stands naked or is shown in partially removed underwear for a while, which is then followed by sexual intercourse. In her VCDs, there are at least two sex scenes.</p>
<p>A standard part of all her VCDs is the sex scene that shows the male character performing a prolonged nipple sucking on the ‘innocent’ Yuki Maiko, who lies passively and shyly on the bed. She will be often asked whether she feels good, or else she will be calmed and told that it will not hurt. Rubbing her vagina over her panties is another common motif in her VCDs. She will be asked or encouraged to do this by herself, and will obey by shyly rubbing her vagina, with the guidance and help of the male character. While the use of cunnilingus and fellatio exists, fellatio is relatively rare in her early productions. As a whole, cunnilingus performed by the male characters prevails in all of her VCDs. Moreover, the duration of foreplay is considerably longer than that of penetration. In our sample VCDs, the average duration of foreplay is about 5.26 minutes long, whereas that of sexual intercourse lasts only 2.48 minutes. Foreplay in general is understood as mutual sexual activities between sexual partners. However, in the foreplay of Yuki Maiko’s VCDs, it is almost always the male characters who perform, whereas Yuki Maiko just remains passive and extremely shy – she does not do anything, except wait to be touched, groped, caressed and kissed.</p>
<p>Her passivity is further highlighted by the predominant use of the missionary position in her movies. While our VCDs occasionally display Yuki Maiko ‘on the top’, it is still the male characters who control the movement from below. In the sample VCDs, only one out of 27 sex scenes portrays Yuki Maiko as a sexually forward woman, who takes off the male character’s clothes or puts his penis into her vagina.</p>
<p>Sexual intercourse in her VCDs almost always ends with coitus interruptus and male ejaculations either on her breasts or somewhere else on her body. External ejaculation is common in all pornographic videos, since it signifies the ultimate climax for men and for each heterosexual sex act represented. It is also significant for the viewer to see that orgasm has really taken place. Another standard feature is that Yuki Maiko experiences an orgasm almost every time. Her orgasm even coincides with the male ejaculation, and she almost always plays with the semen after the ejaculation of the male character.</p>
<p>At the end of these VCDs, there are often monologues in which Yuki Maiko is shown dressing in a school uniform or childish clothes. She ends her movie by saying ‘Thank you for viewing this video’ or ‘I hope you can continue to support me in the future’.</p>
<p>One can observe from this brief sketch that Yuki Maiko is first portrayed as a passive, innocent recipient who is after all transformed into a sexual being, desiring and enjoying sex. In more concrete terms, this transformative process can be broken down into three steps, which can arguably be applied to other typical <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs and account for their popularity in Taiwan and Hong Kong. The first step is that Yuki Maiko is portrayed as cute and childish, virginally shy, and unengaged in sex. For instance, in <italic>Sexual School Life</italic> and <italic>Hooker Prince</italic>, she always smiles and whispers with dewy-eyed innocence. It is crucial to note that her image of being cute is not only constructed in the main content of the VCDs, but is also portrayed outside of this. For example, in the epilogue of <italic>Loss of Virginity</italic> where she is supposed to act herself, she is still highly associated with the fashion of making silly faces, pulling her eyes apart, pushing her blouse up to reveal her breasts, making fun of others or behaving foolishly. In the epilogue of <italic>Blow Job</italic>, as Yuki Maiko makes fun with the production team, she playfully paints her front teeth with black ink, and as a result every member of the production team is giving a big belly laugh. This sense of cuteness is exceptionally prevalent in her early productions.</p>
<p>In addition, Yuki Maiko wears a sailor-suit style school uniform in nearly every VCD. Childish clothing and behaviours, like pulling wide-eyed silly faces and sticking out her tongue, are commonplace in her VCDs. In <italic>Breakage of Hymen</italic>, she is presented in overwhelmingly colourful fluffy dresses, such as yellow and orange. In her later VCDs, her association with childishness is lessened, yet she is still presented as a ‘cute’ and ‘sweet’ woman.</p>
<p>Likewise, in her early productions, Yuki Maiko is closely associated with qualities such as shyness, naivety, innocence, and sexual inexperience. In many of her VCDs such as <italic>Treasure</italic>, <italic>Sexual School Life</italic> and <italic>Breakage of Hymen</italic>, her underwear is predominantly white in colour. At times, she even wears a sports bra, which speaks essentially of her sexual inexperience, because a sports bra is usually worn by growing teens, especially among high-schoolgirls before the onset of maturity.</p>
<p>Closely related to virginal shyness is her disengagement in sex. In the early parts of many of her videos, Yuki Maiko is portrayed as unengaged, or simply uninterested in sex. In <italic>Treasure</italic>, she is portrayed as young girl who has no interest in sex or sometimes is even afraid of it. When she is brought to bed by the male character, she simply lies there. Even when the male character moves forward to caress her, she remains unresponsive and at times even attempts to avoid his sexual advance. In <italic>Loss of Virginity</italic>, the innocent Yuki Maiko is asked to kneel down in front of her male patron and is taught by him to perform fellatio.</p>
<p>However, her sexual disengagement does not mean that she will resist what the male character has asked her to do. For instance, in <italic>Hooker Princess</italic>, Yuki Maiko is asked by the male character to perform fellatio. Even though she is reluctant to do so, explaining that she is ‘<italic>tsukareta!</italic>’ (tired), she acquiesces and finally performs fellatio for him. Within her VCDs, Yuki Maiko is always portrayed as a dutiful, submissive woman. </p>
<p>The second step refers to the process whereby the male characters, through the use of many sexual techniques, sexually stimulate and please the innocent Yuki Maiko who responds passively and obediently. In many of her early movies such as <italic>Treasure</italic>, <italic>Breakage of Hymen</italic> and <italic>Loss of Virginity</italic>, the innocent Yuki Maiko is portrayed being sexually pleasured and stimulated by her male characters. It is a commonplace that her breasts are fondled, nipples sucked and kissed, ear kissed, limbs touched, and vagina massaged. On occasion, the male characters perform the so-called <italic>shiofuki</italic> (literally blow the tide), that is, the sexual stimulation of the vagina through a special movement of fingers such that the woman will expel a noticeable amount of clear fluid before or during orgasm. In most of her movies, the duration of the scene that portrays the male character sexually stimulating Yuki Maiko is considerably long when compared with other genres.</p>
<p>The last step refers to the very moment when Yuki Maiko is transformed into a sexual being who is capable of enjoying sex and experiencing orgasm. This can be seen through two categories, namely, sexual readiness/adventurousness and sexual enjoyment. In <italic>Treasure</italic>, while Yuki Maiko is passive and unresponsive in the beginning, she is turned into a sexually adventurous woman who is more than willing to participate in a variety of sexual postures such that she groans and moans in rhythm with the male character’s thrusting.</p>
<p>The second one is that sex per se is enjoyable. In <italic>Sexual School Life</italic>, Yuki Maiko, portrayed as a high-school student, finally metamorphoses into a sexual being who not only enjoys sex but also experiences orgasm. For instance, ‘<italic>soko</italic>’ (that place – the genitalia of the actress), ‘<italic>dame itchau</italic>’ (no…! It comes!), ‘<italic>iku iku</italic>’ (it is coming!) and ‘<italic>kimochi ii</italic>’ (good feeling!) all represent her standard expressions in the movie. These phrases are also prevalent in other movies such as <italic>Treasure</italic>, <italic>Loss of Virginity</italic>, <italic>Blow Job</italic>, <italic>Hooker Princess</italic>, and <italic>Uniform Idol</italic>. More importantly, she often says these phrases as she groans and moans loudly. When the actor ejaculates on her body, she expresses her feeling by saying ‘<italic>iku iku kimochi ii</italic>’ (literally this means ‘orgasm comes and it is a good feeling’).</p>
<p>This section has just shown that the narrative structure of Japanese <italic>bishōjo</italic> movies in general and Yuki Maiko’s movies in particular, amounts to a three-step process in which the female character is first unengaged in sex, but she is ultimately transformed into a sexual being as a result of the male character’s sexual stimulation. Since Yuki Maiko is a typical <italic>bishōjo</italic> actress and all her movies belong to <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs, it is not unreasonable to say that the above three-step process represents the typical narrative structure of the <italic>bishōjo</italic> AV. Certainly, the concrete storyline of <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs might vary from one video to another and from one <italic>bishōjo</italic> actress to another. But it is important to note that most of the <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs more or less follow this sequence of steps. One of the authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363460712439651">Yau, 2009</xref>) has analysed in detail a Japanese pornographic VCD featuring Kawashima Azumi, another typical <italic>bishōjo</italic> actress who not only won great acclaim among Taiwanese viewers in the late 1990s but also remains <italic>the</italic> Japanese <italic>bishōjo</italic> AV girl in Taiwan. Yau similarly found out that Kawashima’s VCD follows these three steps. In her movie, Kawashima first appears as a sexually reserved ‘beautiful young woman’ who acts completely naive and wears childish clothes. Later in the movie, she is sexually stimulated by the male character while remaining inert. However, she ultimately groans and moans in great pleasure and transforms herself to a sexually adventurous partner, as a result of the male characters’ sexual stimulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363460712439651">Yau, 2009</xref>: 9–12).</p>
<p>One can see that the three-step narrative structure of <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs bears a striking similarity to the sexual script of Taiwanese men outlined earlier. As previously mentioned, the meaning of the male sex in Taiwan is about the transformation of the ‘human’-woman to an ‘animal’-man through <italic>tiaojiao</italic>. We will be immediately surprised to find out that the transformative nature of the male sex in Taiwan resonates powerfully with the three-step narrative structure of <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs, as seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1363460712439651">Table 4</xref>.

<p>It is therefore not unreasonable to suggest that Taiwanese men would identify with Japanese AVs in general and <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs in particular because these movies appeared to them very ‘real’. That is to say, Japanese AVs and <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs are widely received among Taiwanese men because they appeared to be very close to their sex in real life. We might therefore conclude that Japanese AVs and <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs are to Taiwanese men documentaries or the ‘real core’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1363460712439651" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our aim in this article was to explain why a large segment of Taiwanese men would identify with Japanese AVs in general and <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs in particular. We contended that pornography preference could not simply be attributed to biological propensity or some very individual personalities. Following Hardy’s inspiration which sees ‘realism’ as the mainstay of pornography production, we submitted that Japanese AVs and <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs would find great favour with Taiwanese men precisely because the former appeared to them very ‘real’. However, we went beyond this representation–real divide by arguing that the so-called ‘real’ sex is, as undergirded by the sexual script, discursively constituted. The distinction between pornographic representations of sex and the ‘real’ sex vanishes not because pornographic representations are getting more ‘real’ as Hardy has argued, but because the so-called ‘real’ sex is in fact culturally constituted.</p>
<p>In the first part of this article, we demonstrated that the so-called ‘real’ sex is heavily underlined by the way Taiwanese informants talked about sex as well as sexual behaviours. From their discourses on sex and sexual behaviour, we contended that sex, to Taiwanese men, is discursively constituted, amounting to a transformative process in which a ‘human’-woman is metamorphosed into an ‘animal’-man. Central to this transformative process is the man’s <italic>tiaojiao</italic>, which makes his woman enjoy and desire sex as much as a man does.</p>
<p>We then moved on to show how this discursively constituted male sex resembled very much the narrative structure of <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs. Through an examination of a set of nine <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs featuring Yuki Maiko, we showed how the seven categories ‘childish’, ‘virginally shy’ (sexually inexperienced), ‘cute’, ‘wilful’, ‘obedient’, ‘sexually ready and adventurous’, and ‘enjoying sex’ as identified from our Taiwanese informants could be further grouped into a three-step process, forming the narrative structure of <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs in general. As we have seen, the narrative structure of Japanese <italic>bishōjo</italic> movies in general and Yuki Maiko’s movies in particular, amounted to a three-step process in which the female character is first unengaged in sex, but she is ultimately transformed into a sexual being as a result of the male character’s sexual stimulation. Interestingly enough, this three-step narrative structure paralleled neatly with the form of discursively mediated male sex outlined earlier. We concluded that Japanese AVs in general and <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs in particular would garner huge popularity among Taiwanese men because these movies appeared to them very close to their sex in real life, and thus very <italic>real</italic>. In the event, Japanese <italic>bishōjo</italic> AVs and Yuki Maiko’s AVs become <italic>the</italic> real core to these men.</p>
