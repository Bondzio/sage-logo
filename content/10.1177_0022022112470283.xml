<p>As a former editor of the Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, I have a fair idea of what David Matsumoto has done during his tenure and what Debbie Best can expect in the coming period. It is reassuring to see that competent colleagues are prepared to invest countless hours in maintaining the journal as the flagship of the modern cross-cultural movement, to use Walt Lonner’s metaphor. There is an old saying that if you want to get things done, you should ask busy people. The saying certainly applies to David. It is amazing what he has achieved in the past period, being a dedicated editor to his already full schedule. The cross-cultural community is greatly indebted to David Matsumoto for the further development of the journal.</p>
<p>It gives me great pleasure to announce the editorial transition as I know that the journal will fare well under Debbie’s stewardship. There is probably no other person who has served in so many positions in the International Association for cross-Cultural Psychology and who knows so many members. When it became clear during the search process that the Association would nominate Debbie to Sage (the editor of the journal), I asked various stakeholders for their opinion about the nomination. The support for her nomination was overwhelming. I am confident that the journal is in competent and dedicated hands in the coming years. I wish Debbie and all her team members a safe travel.</p>

<p>I assumed the editorship of JCCP six years ago, and these six years have been a period of great transition for the journal. For one we moved from an email-based system of processing manuscripts, where we were still receiving and processing manuscripts sometimes by hardcopy, to a totally electronic based system managed by Manuscript Central. Also, we had just moved the journal from its founding home at Western Washington University under the auspices of its founder, Walt Lonner, to its current publishing house at SAGE as an arm of the International Association of Cross-Cultural Psychology. While this was occurring, the number of manuscripts submitted (and thus processed every year) went up about 40%, from an average of 250 or so when I first became editor to well over 350 or so now, demonstrating the strong growth and influence of JCCP in the field.</p>
<p>Although the road has had its fair share of ups and downs, it’s safe to say that JCCP has successfully survived those major life transitions and is currently well poised to maintain and improve its standing in the field as the premier scientific journal publishing at the crossroads of culture and psychology. This has been due in no small part to the hard work and dedication of the editorial board, who toiled diligently in the processing and editorial duties over an ever-increasing workload. I wish to thank all of them—Juri Allik, Debbie Best, Pawel Boski, CY Chiu, Ron Fischer, Cindy Gallois, Jenny Kurman, Junko Tanaka-Matsumi, and Ute Schoenpflug. Thank you so much for your kindness, loyalty, and hard work over these past few years.</p>
<p>Of course the success of any journal depends heavily on the Consulting Editors, who agreed to take on much of the responsibilities of reviewing the many manuscripts that were submitted to the journal. The list is too large to name individually; but in any case I express my deep appreciation to all of you.</p>
<p>I also would like to say thank you to the many authors who submitted manuscripts to the journal. Although unfortunately it was possible to publish only a fraction of the many great manuscripts that were submitted, I sincerely hope that all authors took away something beneficial from their interaction with the journal. I strongly encourage all to continue to submit their work to the journal in the future as well.</p>
<p>Finally, I wish to thank the previous editor, Fons van de Vijver, who was always available for advice and direction. And I would like to give special thanks to Walt Lonner, who founded the journal over 40 years ago, and who continues to provide professional, and courteous advice and guidance with a great sense of humility, a rare combination in today’s world. Walt, it has been a pleasure to carry on your legacy.</p>
<p>To incoming Editor-in-Chief Debbie Best—the best of luck. You’re in great hands with a great editorial board and consulting editors. I am sure JCCP will remain the premier journal for work on culture and psychology for many years to come.</p>
<p>With thanks and appreciation,</p>

<p>On behalf of the Editorial Board of the Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, I would like to thank David Matsumoto for his dedication, hard work, and thoughtful leadership over the past five years as Editor. David is the seventh in a line of distinguished cross-cultural scientists who have served admirably in the Editor’s position, leading JCCP to become the foremost journal in the field of cultural research.</p>
<p>I am honored to have been nominated by the Publications Committee and appointed by the Executive Committee of the International Association for Cross-Cultural Psychology to serve as the next Editor of JCCP. David, and the Editors before him, have left me large shoes to fill. Over the past six months as I have transitioned into the position, David has given me invaluable support and has answered my numerous questions with wisdom and collegiality. I hope to maintain the high standards and professionalism that he has demonstrated as Editor.</p>
<p>Over the past 16 years, I have enjoyed serving as an Associate Editor for JCCP. I have been fortunate to work with a talented, collegial group of scholars who have spent innumerable hours managing the JCCP manuscript review process. Two of the current Associate Editors, Pawel Boski and Ute Schoenpflug, have chosen to end their terms on the Editorial Board, and I would like to thank them for their invaluable service. I am delighted to have an excellent team of continuing Associate Editors – Juri Allik, Chi-Yue Chiu, Ronald Fischer, Jenny Kurman, and Junko Tanaka-Matsumi. I am also pleased that Walt Lonner will continue as Founding and Special Issues Editor. Fortunately, I have convinced Janice Jennings, an Administrative Assistant in the Wake Forest University Psychology Department, to serve as the Editorial Assistant for JCCP. Her competence, resourcefulness, and humor will definitely make the work more efficient and enjoyable.</p>
<p>I look forward to working with the talented JCCP Editorial Board and with Will Schweitzer, Senior Editor, Sage Publications, and his team. Together we hope to continue JCCP’s legacy of commitment to scientific excellence in our contributions to the field of cross-cultural research.</p>
