<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> There is no consensus as to the amount and direction of capsular plication necessary to correct anterior shoulder instability without overconstraining the joint.</p>
<p><bold>Hypothesis:</bold> An arthroscopic capsulorrhaphy in line with the fibers of the inferior glenohumeral ligament (IGHL) in an anterior laxity model will restore glenohumeral kinematics to normal.</p>
<p><bold>Study Design:</bold> Controlled laboratory study.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Six cadaveric specimens were tested in both the scapular and coronal plane in 3 conditions: intact, anterior instability, and plicated. The anterior instability model was created by stretching the shoulder 20% beyond the physiological external rotational range of motion, and plication was achieved by performing a 10-mm arthroscopic plication in line with the fibers of the anterior band of the IGHL.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Stretching significantly increased the rotational range of motion, while plication restored it back to that of the intact condition (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). There were few significant changes in humeral head apex position across all 3 testing conditions. Plication significantly reduced anterior translation compared with the stretched condition (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Stretching and plication both significantly reduced contact area relative to the intact condition (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). There were no significant differences between any of the 3 conditions for contact pressure and only few significant differences between the conditions for contact peak pressure.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> A 10-mm capsular plication in line with the fibers of the anterior band of the IGHL effectively reduces capsular laxity without overconstraining the joint.</p>
<p><bold>Clinical Relevance:</bold> The fibers of the anterior band of the IGHL provide a useful arthroscopic anatomic landmark for the direction of anterior capsulorrhaphy.</p>

<p>Anterior shoulder instability is the result of anteroinferior capsular laxity, torn inferior glenohumeral ligament, and labrum detachment. Traumatic or atraumatic shoulder instability that is not associated with capsulolabral detachment may be the result of capsular stretching or increased capsular volume. Previous studies have established that the inferior glenohumeral ligament (IGHL) is an important static stabilizer of anterior translation of the humeral head.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546511430307">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511430307">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546511430307">29</xref></sup> Specifically, the anterior band of the inferior glenohumeral ligament (AB-IGHL) is an important contributor to anterior stability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546511430307">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546511430307">31</xref></sup> Furthermore, the importance of correcting inferior laxity has been well established and used in the clinical setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546511430307">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511430307">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511430307">18</xref></sup> Studies have shown that a Bankart lesion alone does not create enough laxity to cause dislocation and that other lesions are most likely present contributing to instability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546511430307">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546511430307">26</xref></sup> This concept lends to the idea that capsular laxity plays a critical role in anterior shoulder instability. Therefore, many authors recommend a capsular shift to reduce capsular redundancy in instances of capsulolabral injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511430307">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511430307">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546511430307">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>With regard to capsular shift, traditionally, an open approach has been used because of low rates of recurrent instability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511430307">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546511430307">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511430307">23</xref></sup> However, some studies demonstrate that an arthroscopic plication technique is superior in that it allows the surgeon an excellent view of the intra-articular structures and affords the ability to address capsular laxity in a systematic fashion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546511430307">33</xref></sup> Generally, surgeons have applied arthroscopic sutures into the anterior capsule with the goal of achieving similar results to open capsular reduction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511430307">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511430307">24</xref></sup> Many authors have shown that the arthroscopic technique reduces soft tissue trauma, has a low morbidity, and is minimally invasive compared with open surgery, and many of the results compared with open surgery have been promising.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511430307">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511430307">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511430307">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511430307">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511430307">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511430307">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546511430307">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>While the results of capsular shift have been promising, there remains little consensus as to the amount and direction of plication necessary to correct instability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546511430307">32</xref></sup> Previous cadaveric studies have simulated anterior laxity and examined the effects of capsular plication. One study showed that an open 10-mm capsular shift was superior to a 5-mm plication in terms of restoring normal rotational and translational biomechanics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546511430307">25</xref></sup> Another study looked at a direct medial to lateral arthroscopic plication in an anterior laxity model and found significant changes in the path of articulation and a significant reduction in rotational range of motion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511430307">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Arthroscopic plication in the medial-lateral direction does not address inferior laxity that commonly occurs with instability. In addition, there has been no study to date that has looked at the glenohumeral contact area and pressure after plication, both of which are important factors in determining the effectiveness of the procedure as well as possible sequelae of osteoarthritis, which has been reported with arthroscopic capsular plications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511430307">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511430307">9</xref></sup> Arthroscopically correcting both the anterior and inferior laxity is more difficult than the open approach, as the surgeon cannot rely on touch. Therefore, using an anatomic landmark for plication would be helpful to determine the direction of plication. By performing an arthroscopic capsular shift in line with the fibers of the AB-IGHL, a more oblique plication in both the medial-lateral and superior-inferior directions would be performed, which may correct both the anterior and inferior laxity.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to quantify the rotational range of motion, glenohumeral translation in the anteroposterior and superoinferior directions, glenohumeral contact pressure and area, as well as the path of glenohumeral articulation before and after plication in a cadaveric laxity model. The plication method used was an arthroscopic shift performed in line with the fibers of the AB-IGHL. Our hypothesis was that an arthroscopic capsulorrhaphy in line with the fibers of the IGHL in an anterior laxity model would restore glenohumeral kinematics to normal.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-0363546511430307">
<title>Specimens</title>
<p>Six fresh-frozen shoulders sectioned at the midhumerus were utilized for this study (mean age, 64.8 years; age range, 53-85 years). The shoulders were dissected free of musculature and tendons, preserving the glenohumeral joint capsule. The coracoacromial and coracohumeral ligaments were preserved along with the tendinous portion of the long head of the biceps tendon. A capsulotomy was made in the rotator interval between the superior border of the middle glenohumeral ligament and the anterior border of the coracohumeral ligament. The specimens were kept from desiccating by regular irrigation with normal saline. Specimens were macroscopically inspected and were free of glenohumeral arthropathy, rotator cuff insufficiency, adhesive capsulitis, or other injury.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546511430307">
<title>Shoulder Testing System</title>
<p>The shoulder was mounted on a custom testing system that allowed 6 degrees of freedom for glenohumeral positioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546511430307">Figure 1</xref>). The shoulder testing system was created to measure glenohumeral rotation, position of the humerus with respect to the glenoid, and glenohumeral translation. The scapular box was mounted onto a bearing and lever arm system attached to the top of a translation plate that allowed for application of a joint compressive force. The humeral jig was attached to a bearing that allowed rotational positioning of the humerus. Humeral elevation, abduction, flexion, and extension could also be adjusted.</p>

</fig>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546511430307">
<title>Specimen Mounting</title>
<p>The humeral shaft was potted with plaster of Paris in a 1.25-inch-diameter polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe aligning the humeral intramedullary axis with the long axis of the pipe via a custom-made intramedullary alignment jig. Two drywall screws were placed orthogonally through the PVC pipe and humeral shaft to provide additional rigidity to the humeral fixation. The scapula was trimmed and placed into a rectangular aluminum testing box aligning the long axis of the glenoid with the long axis of the rectangular box. Two 18-gauge spinal needles were placed through the joint capsule at the rim of the glenoid, one from inferior to superior and the other from anterior to posterior so that glenoid inclination and version could be aligned parallel with the rim of the scapular box.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546511430307">
<title>Glenohumeral Positioning</title>
<p>The glenohumeral joint was positioned at 60° of glenohumeral abduction to simulate 90° of shoulder abduction, accounting for a 2:1 ratio of glenohumeral to scapulothoracic abduction. This position was maintained through the entirety of testing. The humerus was placed in 2 positions for testing: in the scapular plane and in the coronal plane, which was set as 20° of horizontal abduction from the scapular plane, simulating the position of apprehension. A 60-N joint compressive force was applied throughout the testing process. Humeral rotation was determined by aligning the biceps tendon under the anterior edge of the acromion and defining this position as 90° of external rotation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546511430307">
<title>Capsular Stretching</title>
<p>Specimens were tested intact after capsular stretching (anterior laxity model) and after anterior plication. An anterior laxity model previously described was used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511430307">1</xref></sup> The anteroinferior capsule was stretched by increasing external rotation 20% beyond the external rotation measured in the intact capsule. Capsular stretching was performed with the humerus in the coronal plane, with the scapular translation plate locked.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511430307">1</xref></sup> An increase of greater than 20% in the coronal plane would have risked capsular rupture, as was frequently found to be the case in pilot testing. To achieve a 20% increase in external rotation, an external rotation torque was gradually applied not exceeding 8.5 N·m.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511430307">1</xref></sup> Once the rotational goal was achieved, the external rotation was locked in this position for 30 minutes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0363546511430307">
<title>Arthroscopic Shift</title>
<p>Arthroscopic plication was performed entirely through the rotator interval, which was opened before testing and not closed during testing. Two 3-mm Bio-FASTak anchors with No. 2 FiberWire (Arthrex Inc, Naples, Florida) were placed on the border of the labrum and articular surface, equidistant between the 3- and 6-o’clock positions. To ensure correct positioning of the suture anchors, two 25-gauge needles were placed through the capsule from outside in at the 3- and 6-o’clock positions. Once the suture anchors were in place, one limb of the suture was passed beneath the labrum outside the joint. These sutures were passed back through the capsule and IGHL 1 cm from their exiting point in line with the fibers of the AB-IGHL, such that the plication resulted in both an inferior-to-superior shift and a medial-to-lateral shift of capsular tissue. Plication was completed by tying an arthroscopic knot positioned off the articular surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546511430307">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Measured Parameters</title>
<p>This study quantified the rotational range of motion, glenohumeral translation in the anteroposterior and superoinferior directions, glenohumeral contact pressure and area, as well as the path of glenohumeral articulation before and after plication in an anterior laxity model. All measured parameters were calculated as an average of 2 trials. Specifically, the shoulder rotational range of motion was measured off the humeral rotation cylinder, which was marked at 5° increments. Maximum internal and external rotations were determined by the rotation achieved with 1.5 N·m of torque. Total range of motion was then calculated.</p>
<p>With use of the Microscribe 3DLX digitizer (Revware Inc, Raleigh, North Carolina), the glenoid and humeral head positions were determined by digitizing 3 separate points, marked with small screws, on each of the humeral heads and acromions. At the conclusion of the test, the shoulder was disarticulated, and the articular surfaces of the glenoid and humeral head were digitized, and their position relative to the screws was calculated. The distance of the humeral head apex, defined as the highest point along the articular surface from the plane of the articular margin, from the geometric center of the glenoid was calculated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511430307">15</xref></sup> Glenohumeral position was measured at 30° increments of rotational range of motion from maximal internal to maximum external rotation, specifically, maximum internal rotation, 0° external, 30° external, 60° external, 90° external, 120° external, and maximum external rotation.</p>
<p>Translational stability of the shoulders in the anterior, posterior, superior, and inferior directions was also determined. With the shoulder locked in 90° of external rotation with a 60-N joint compressive force, 20-N and 25-N translational forces were applied in the plane of the glenoid surface. Ninety degrees of external rotation was chosen to simulate the clinical position of apprehension and as the position where the anterior-inferior capsule is tightened. A 60-N joint compressive force was used to allow for pressure measurements to be taken accurately with pressure-sensitive film. The 20-N and 25-N translational forces were used to compensate for the higher joint compressive force. The positions of the glenoid and humerus at the end point of translation were recorded with the Microscribe digitizer (Revware Inc).</p>
<p>Glenohumeral contact area pressures were also recorded using a Tekscan pressure mapping system (saturation pressure, 10.3 MPa; model 4000, South Boston, Massachusetts) at 60° of glenohumeral abduction in the scapular and coronal planes. The pressure sensor was placed through the rotator interval and positioned in the glenohumeral joint. Contact area, mean pressure, and peak pressure were recorded at 30° increments in the midrange of motion as well as maximum internal and external rotations. The contact area was defined as the total pressurized area across the sensor. The mean contact pressure was defined as the average pressure across the sensor, while the peak contact pressure was defined as the highest pressure in a 2-pixel × 2-pixel area across the sensor.</p>
<p>Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to analyze the data for each set of measurements performed within the experiment, with the level of significance set at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05. A Tukey post hoc test was used to determine significance between the 3 conditions: the intact normal shoulder, the anterior stretch condition, and the plicated condition.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results from this study suggest that after stretching of the anterior capsule of the shoulder, an arthroscopic 10-mm plication performed in line with the AB-IGHL can successfully reduce anterior translation without loss of the rotational range of motion or a significant increase in the glenohumeral contact pressure. The rotational range of motion data suggest that in both the scapular and coronal plane, there are statistically significant increases in range of motion with stretching that are successfully restored by plication to that of the intact shoulder. The plication technique was able to significantly reduce anterior translation compared with the stretched condition.</p>
<p>These data are consistent with previously conducted studies looking at an anterior capsular shift in the setting of anterior laxity without a Bankart lesion. Schneider et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546511430307">25</xref></sup> used a similar anterior laxity model and looked at the differences in rotational and translational data between a 5-mm and 10-mm plication. These authors reported that the 10-mm plication effectively restored range of motion to that of the intact state while a 5-mm plication did not. They also found that translation significantly increased with stretching and was restored to that of intact with both types of plication. This study, however, did not measure glenohumeral contact pressure, and this procedure was performed in an open fashion.</p>
<p>Alberta et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511430307">1</xref></sup> performed a medial to lateral arthroscopic plication using an anterior laxity model, and their results showed a similar pattern to our results in that stretching significantly increased rotational range of motion but not translation. Their arthroscopic plication resulted in decreases in translation similar to our results, but unlike this study, the rotational range of motion was not restored to that of intact. Furthermore, they found significant shifts in the humeral head center of rotation after plication, while our data showed very few significant changes in humeral head apex position. These authors reported a posterior-inferior shift of the humerus throughout the arc of motion, which has been implicated in the pathoetiology of capsulorrhaphy arthropathy. Additionally, their repair was a direct medial-lateral plication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0363546511430307">Figure 8A</xref>), whereas this study performed the plication in an anterior-inferior direction in line with the IGHL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0363546511430307">Figure 8B</xref>), which would serve as an anatomic landmark when performing an arthroscopic plication. A direct medial-lateral plication may cause overtightening in the anteroposterior direction, which could have led to kinematic changes after plication. Also, a direct medial-lateral plication would not address the loose capsule inferiorly, which is the most likely reason why external rotation was not returned to normal.</p>

<p>In a study by Speer et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546511430307">26</xref></sup> open glenoid-based shifts were performed in the setting of a simulated Bankart lesion. The shifts were performed in either a medial direction or a superior direction, but not both. They found that while each shift could effectively reduce translation, there was a significant restriction on external rotation, as the medial shift reduced external rotation by 32.7° and the superior shift reduced external rotation by 17.4°. However, none of the previously discussed articles measured contact areas and contact pressures. While these studies have shown similar reductions in translation with plication and even demonstrated the amount of plication needed for this to occur, the question of overconstraining the joint still remains. Overtightening of the capsule has been shown to alter glenohumeral biomechanics and lead to degenerative arthritis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511430307">12</xref></sup> and is thus an important consideration for any plication technique.</p>
<p>In this study, the contact areas decreased with capsular stretching alone, although not statistically significant, and subsequent plication further decreased contact area in both the scapular and coronal planes. We believe that the reason this occurred is because the intact condition is optimized to achieve the most contact area and that any changes to the physiological capsule will only reduce contact area. There were no significant increases in the contact pressures in either the scapular or coronal plane across all 3 conditions. This is again important when considering the issue of overconstraining the joint because of plication. This result suggests that at no time did the plication place too high a strain on the joint. The concern then arises that because the contact pressure measurement was an average of the total contact pressure over the whole face of the glenoid, this parameter failed to take into consideration small areas of highly increased pressure. After plication, additional contact pressure may have occurred between the humeral head and the labrum or capsule, and changes in glenohumeral kinematics after plication may reduce joint conformity or cause abnormal loading. There was an increase in contact pressure after plication in the coronal plane at 120° of external rotation and maximum external rotation; although not statistically significant, this could be explained by the anterior capsule being tighter with the glenohumeral joint in the coronal plane as compared with the scapular plane. However, the peak pressure data showed that with this plication technique, there was only one position in the scapular plane that saw a statistically significant increase. The rest of the positions in the scapular and coronal planes saw no significant increases, indicating that there is not an abnormal distribution of the contact pressure.</p>
<p>There are a few important limitations to this study. Our model of capsular stretching, while an improvement over capsular cutting models, which most probably simulate a single instability event, does not take into account the changes to the capsule that occur with an increasing number of instability events but most likely simulates instability seen with repetitive overhead use. Tissue quality and elasticity are likely to be altered in those with repetitive instability events as well as chronic instability. Also, the mean age of the specimens was 64.8 years, which is considerably older than typical instability patients, which tend to be younger athletic patients. This has implications for tissue quality, although we expect younger patients to have thicker and less degenerative capsules compared with the cadaveric specimens used in this study. Another limitation is that this was a cadaveric study in which there was no muscle loading performed, as only a compressive force was provided to the joint. Simulated muscle loading would most likely decrease the range of motion and the effect of the capsular changes on translation or kinematic data. Previous studies showed that a compressive force of 22 N is adequate for glenohumeral stability,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511430307">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511430307">17</xref></sup> yet our study used a 60-N compressive force to allow for contact characteristics to be measured, as the pressure measuring system used required a higher degree of compression to attain accurate results. This increased compressive force could alter the amount of translation achieved in any of the 3 conditions as well as the path of articulation. In an effort to compensate for the higher joint compressive force, higher translational forces of 20 N and 25 N were used compared with 10 N and 15 N used previously. It is uncertain, however, how well this compensates and thus must be considered a limitation when comparing translational data of this study to others. The increase in compressive load even with higher translation forces decreased the amount of glenohumeral translation and limited the ability to fully evaluate how this repair affected inferior translation. A higher compressive force may decrease the magnitude of range of motion or translation seen with each condition; however, all conditions were subjected to the same loading procedures so the effect of the procedures would be similar within loading conditions. Furthermore, this study does not assess long-term stability and viability of the repair, nor does it assess healing, functional outcomes, or patient comfort.</p>
<p>The AB-IGHL provides a useful arthroscopic anatomic landmark for anterior capsulorrhaphy. In this model, which most likely represents instability due to repetitive overhead use, a 10-mm capsular plication in line with the fibers of the AB-IGHL effectively reduced capsular laxity, and the surgeon can be comfortable that the technique is not overconstraining the joint.</p>
