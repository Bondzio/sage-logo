<p>Institutions providing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) require an effective and reliable method for notification of the cannulation team, maintenance of a primed circuit, rapid access to blood products (if blood prime is being utilized), ability to mobilize the circuit and cannulation equipment to the patient location, and a qualified staff to assist the family through this process. Patients on ECMO can be the source of multiple challenges including optimizing the circuit for specific congenital heart lesions, troubleshooting circuit failures, transporting patients on the circuit, anticoagulation and bleeding, transitioning to more mobile left ventricular assist device (VAD) or biventricular assist device, listing for thoracic organ transplantation, weaning from the circuit, and educating the patient and family about mechanical support. These challenges ideally require a specialized multidisciplinary team, which includes anesthesiologists, child life specialists, ECMO specialists, intensivists, nurses, nutritionists, perfusionists, pharmacists, respiratory therapists, social workers, and surgeons.</p>

<title>Challenges at the Bedside With ECMO, “Where the Rubber Meets the Road”: Nursing Education</title>
<p>Despite the effectiveness of ECMO, pediatric patients continue to face morbidity and mortality. Among the various ECMO-related complications, mechanical failure is the most frequently reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111421794">1</xref></sup> Currently there are a variety of pediatric ECMO devices commercially available. Thus, with 30 years of experience with ECMO, the Penn State Hershey Children’s Hospital (PSCH) recently opted to change both the type of circuit and the delivery of care. This transition and the results will be discussed. Step one involved translational research, testing each component of the system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135111421794">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135111421794"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135111421794"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135111421794"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135111421794"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135111421794"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135111421794"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150135111421794"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2150135111421794">10</xref></sup> Step two involved the creation of a new bedside specialty care team.</p>
<p>The chosen circuit consisted of a Rotaflow centrifugal pump (Maquet Inc, Wayne, New Jersey), a QuadroxiD pediatric diffusion membrane oxygenator (Maquet Inc), 3 foot ¼ inch tubing for arterial and venous lines, and two Bio-Medicus cannulae (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota). The Royal Children’s Hospital in Australia reported their experiences utilizing a similar circuit with favorable outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2150135111421794">11</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Historically, children on circulatory support were managed by a bedside ECMO specialist (respiratory therapist, perfusionist, or nurse) supervising the circuit and a critical care nurse caring for the patient. The new delivery of care model requires the bedside nurse to assume primary care of the patient and the circuit, utilizing the ECMO specialist as a resource. Additional staffing of PSCH’s 12-bed pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) includes attending and mid-level physicians available 24/7, perfusionists available for circuit assembly, consultation and emergency intervention, and a 1:1 nurse-to-patient ratio. The nurse-to-patient ratio is increased for high acuity, such as continuous renal replacement therapy.</p>
<p>In January 2009, PSCH initiated staff training for the new ECMO circuit. Education included wet labs in the animal research laboratory, didactic lectures, and case reviews. During the subsequent two years, the PSCH ECMO training program has educated 147 clinicians from 11 centers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135111421794">8</xref></sup> Since October 2009, five patients have been supported at PSCH utilizing the new circuit and bedside care model. The weight of the patients ranged from 4 to 78 kg. Their diagnoses included respiratory failure (n = 4) and postoperative arrhythmia (n = 1). Venoarterial ECMO (VA ECMO) was used for three and venovenous ECMO (VV ECMO) for two. Survival was 40% and there were no mechanical circuit failures.</p>
<p>In summary, our transition to a new ECMO circuit and bedside care model utilized translational research and encompassing education. As we proceed into a new arena, numerous clinical questions provide a fertile area for further clinical research.</p>

<title>Activation of ECMO</title>
<p>There are two scenarios that require effective communication when initiating ECMO. The first is an elective cannulation where timely communication is important but it is not usually time sensitive. The second is during extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (E-CPR) when ECMO is employed as a means of rescue for patients unable to regain spontaneous circulation. In this scenario, ECMO activation is time crucial and accurate, rapid communication is paramount. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation for cardiac patients is most commonly initiated in the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU); other locations include the cardiac catheterization laboratory, step-down unit, or emergency room.</p>
<p>An example of ECMO activation for E-CPR would consist of the attending leading the resuscitation, assessing the patient for ECMO candidacy, consulting with the cardiothoracic surgeon, and activating the ECMO cannulation team. The CICU charge nurse initiates the process by alerting the unit secretary to activate the pagers, mobilizing of the cannulation equipment and obtaining blood products, if needed. The cannulation team varies but often includes a cardiothoracic surgeon, cardiac intensivist, ECMO specialist, ICU-specialized nurses, and in some institutions a cardiac anesthesiologist, cardiac operating room nurses, and perfusionists. Depending upon the institution, team members may be in the hospital or come in from home.</p>
<p>There can be significant barriers to effective communication with current telephone and automated paging systems. This is of particular importance when team members are off-site. Most concerning are a lack of guaranteed “connectivity” due to system downtimes and outages, the presence of “dead zones,” and noncompatibility between carriers. To overcome these communication challenges, manual paging or calling can be used but lengthens the process by five to ten minutes, an unacceptable amount of time. In addition, human errors can occur under pressure and with distractions.</p>
<p>An effective automated paging system should encompass the following features: (1) Ease of activation, which includes paging the entire team simultaneously with an automatic call confirmation. (2) Ease of system maintenance, which includes daily entry of the activation team and allows for minute-to-minute changes. (3) Built-in system redundancy, which includes minimal outages and an automated telephone backup system. Perhaps more importantly, the importance of a period of pilot testing cannot be emphasized enough when evaluating a new communication system. This should ideally occur over several months of testing different types of cell phones, smart phones, one- and two-way pagers, and home phones. The system should be evaluated for performance at varying times of the day, including nights and weekends. Current simultaneous multiuser notification systems can complete the emergency notification process in less than 3 minutes, can be activated from any Web-based device, and have a telephone backup with a system operator. An effective and efficient ECMO team activation system is crucially important to maximize outcomes for patients requiring E-CPR.</p>

<title>Role of the ECMO Specialist</title>
<p>The ECMO specialist is one member of a multidisciplinary team caring for the patient requiring ECMO support. The ECMO specialist may be a registered nurse, a registered respiratory therapist, or a perfusionist. This person has assumed additional responsibilities by learning to become proficient in managing this form of advance life support. Currently, there is no formal national or international certification of ECMO specialists. The individual institution grants competency for the ECMO specialist. Formal training includes didactic education, clinical simulations, and competency assessment with both written and hands-on examinations.</p>
<p>The primary goal of the ECMO specialist is to ensure safety. Patient care must be coordinated with the bedside clinical care team. The ECMO specialist is responsible for secure positioning of the cannulae. The ECMO specialist manages pump flow, sweep flow, and temperature to maintain patient parameters guided by the clinical care team. Medications, inhaled anesthetics, and blood products may all be administered through the ECMO circuit. Not infrequently, the ECMO specialist is engaged with troubleshooting, including optimizing flow by adjusting cannula position, patient positioning, pump speed, or volume status.</p>
<p>Achieving desired levels of mechanical support require an understanding of the patient’s anatomy and physiology. Historically, patients with respiratory failure have been managed on VV ECMO, often using a single venous cannula. Conversion to VA ECMO may be required if recirculation results in inadequate systemic oxygenation or if the patient has insufficient cardiac output. Initiation of VV ECMO requires careful balancing of the circuit prime (calcium, potassium, and pH) prior to cannulation to avoid acute cardiac compromise. Recent improvements in neurologic outcomes with VA ECMO have led to its increased use as a primary rescue for respiratory failure. Venoarterial ECMO has historically been used for circulatory support. Cannulation can occur percutaneously, usually via the right internal jugular vein and the right common carotid artery or directly through an open sternum. In the absence of both cardiac function and an intra-atrial shunt, the left atrium must be independently decompressed either by placement of a left atrial cannula or via a balloon septostomy. Decompression of the left atrium should not be delayed as the associated pulmonary edema can lead to pulmonary hemorrhage and the distended left ventricle is unlikely to recover.</p>
<p>Patients with congenital heart disease present unique challenges and necessitate special consideration. Patients with a patent aortopulmonary shunt may not require an oxygenator but may require higher flows to meet the demands of both the pulmonary and systemic circulations. Patients with a superior cavopulmonary anastomosis may not have adequate venous drainage with a single right internal jugular vein cannula or may not need an oxygenator with a femoral venous or right atrial cannulation. For VA ECMO patients with an oxygenator, there is a balance between pump flow, native cardiac output, sweep flow and inspired gases, and ventilator minute ventilation and inspired gases. The specialist, in conjunction with the care team, continually assesses the effectiveness of support and makes adjustments as required.</p>
<p>With experience, the ECMO specialist often takes on an educational role. Bedside teaching reinforces the knowledge base and reinforces the details of the plan of care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-2150135111421794">
<title>The Role of the Child Life Therapist</title>
<p>During mechanical support, the patient and family have special needs requiring specific attention. The goal of the child life specialist is to meet the emotional, social, and developmental needs of hospitalized children. Specifically for the patient on circulatory support, the child life specialist provides coping mechanisms and education for the patient and their families. The child life specialist is part of a multidisciplinary team that assist patients and their families to adjust to both the psychological and psychosocial impact of the circulatory support. This team often includes child life, psychology, social work, music and art therapy, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech, and nutrition.</p>
<p>The collective goals of the child life specialist for the patient on circulatory support are to increase familiarity with the device, encourage mastery and coping skills, facilitate expression of feelings, minimize the impact of living with circulatory support, and comfort and educate siblings about the device. There are four primary categories of education: (1) breaking the news, (2) living with circulatory support, (3) normalizing the experience, and (4) preparing for transplant. The child should be told why the device is being placed and the importance of the device in their course of treatment. Pictures, mirrors, and age-appropriate materials are used to explain how the device looks and works. Ideally, the optimal timing for preparing the patient is before the implantation of the device. Unfortunately, due to the rapid onset of heart failure leading to circulatory support, a majority of patients learn about ECMO following cannulation and many patients learn about their VAD after implantation. Therefore, it is critical that the child life specialist is involved in the patients' care as they begin to emerge from sedation, so they can partner with the family and the medical staff to provide developmentally appropriate support and education. In addition, sibling preparation is critical. The child life specialist provides age-appropriate education to the sibling/siblings prior to visiting with the patient in the ICU. This attenuates fears and helps increase understanding of the device.</p>
<p>For patients on VADs, the child life specialist partners with both patients and families to help manage life in the hospital. Physical and occupational therapies, ambulation, and transfer to the portable device facilitate fewer restrictions and more mobility for the patient. The child life specialist attempts to normalize the VAD experience as much as possible for the patient. For example, distraction and guided imagery techniques are used during daily dressing changes. Other strategies include the implementation of daily schedules, tutoring, participation in music and art therapy, and cardiac rehabilitation in the exercise laboratory. Visits to the ward and playroom with the help of medical staff help to foster peer relationships and to aid in social adjustment. Also, special events and holiday celebrations are recognized to support extended admissions and foster family traditions. Finally, as patients adjust to their VAD and their extended hospitalization, the child life specialist then begins preparation for cardiac transplantation. Using similar age-appropriate techniques, education occurs in concert with the transplantation team.</p>

<title>Transporting Children on EMCO or VAD</title>
<p>Since the 1990s almost no pediatric patient has been deemed too young, too small, or too sick to be a candidate for any known medical or surgical treatment. This care philosophy results in a small percentage of these high-risk patients, as well as an occasional low-risk patient, requiring cardiovascular and/or respiratory support consisting of VAD or ECMO. An increasing number of practitioners place a child with impending cardiopulmonary failure on circulatory support preemptively to minimize the potential for other organ system dysfunction. An increasing number of assist devices are available for pediatric patients with options available for younger, smaller patients, including infants. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is used as a bridge to VAD, transplant or recovery. Improvements in technology coupled with practitioners understanding of how to safely care for patients on support systems have made it possible for children to remain on either ECMO or VAD for extended periods of time, weeks to months. These children may require transport for diagnostic studies or interventions, not feasible at bedside, which result in changes in management.</p>
<p>The increased use of support, expanded support options, and longer support times results in more patients requiring transport on ECMO or VAD. Transporting these children is not without risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2150135111421794">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2150135111421794">13</xref></sup> The potential benefits of diagnosis or treatment made possible via transport need to be weighed against the potential risks. Alternative bedside imaging or procedures should also be considered. Specifics to be considered when transporting a patient on circulatory support include communication, equipment, and anticipation. The team transporting the patient should be well informed of the patient’s anatomy and physiology, details of the support circuit, venous and arterial access, and current medication administration. The team at the receiving end should be informed and all personnel required for an efficient and complete intervention or imaging should be assembled. The transport itself should be considered an intervention and parents should be informed accordingly. All necessary and no unnecessary equipment should be included (1) a well-functioning bed with variable height and easy access to the patient, (2) backup circulatory support system, (3) airway, oxygen, and suction supplies, (4) hemodynamic monitor, (5) fully charged infusion pumps, (6) resuscitation medications, (7) volume and blood products, if appropriate, and (8) adequate tubing. Personnel may include ICU attending, anesthesia attending, perfusionist, ECMO specialist, bedside nurse, respiratory therapist, surgeon, and security. Unanticipated problems can be minimized by securing a route in advance and assuring it is unobstructed and includes adequate elevator capacity. Most importantly, the time off the ICU should be at a minimum and all delays during transport should be avoided. This requires that all practitioners and decision makers be readily available to determine that the goal of the transport has been achieved, whether imaging or an interventional procedure. Transport of patients on circulatory support can be safely accomplished by a highly skilled multidisciplinary flexible team executing a well-thought-out, effectively communicated plan with readily available redundant equipment and supplies.</p>

<sec id="section7-2150135111421794">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>The use of VA ECMO and pediatric portable VADs has increased significantly over the past decade. Circulatory support can be used as a rescue, such as E-CPR, or as a means of maximizing a patient’s lifestyle while awaiting thoracic organ transplantation. With this growth is the associated need for a multidisciplinary team trained to manage the circuit and the patient. The goals of this team include effective communication for rapid cannulation, optimizing the safety and efficiency of the circuit, safely transporting the patient and the circuit, and educating and supporting the patient and their family. The recent advancements in new oxygenators, new pumps, and new portable support systems will lead to a continued growth in the use of pediatric circulatory support requiring continual evaluation and refinements to the ECMO support team.</p>
