<abstract>
<p>This article discusses two approaches to controlling the newly identified influenza A (H1N1): via Bayesian and frequentist statistical reasoning. This study reviewed the measures implemented in China as an example to illustrate these two approaches. Since May 2009, China has deployed strict controlling mechanisms based on the strong prior Bayesian assumption that the origin of influenza A (H1N1) was from outside China and as such strict border control would keep the virus from entering China. After more than 4 months of hard work by Chinese health professionals and officials, the number of confirmed influenza A (H1N1) has increased steadily against the expectations of the general public. Taking into account the great financial burden in maintaining strict measures, Chinese health authorities have slowly adjusted their policies of controlling influenza A (H1N1) in China according to frequentist reasoning since July 2009.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the identification of a new subtype virus of influenza A (H1N1) in Mexico and in the United States in April 2009, the virus has infected and sickened a large population around the world.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539510377653">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539510377653">4</xref></sup> The official number of confirmed cases increased quickly to more than 290 000 reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) by the middle of September 2009 with more than 3400 deaths associated with the newly identified influenza.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539510377653">4</xref></sup> It is generally believed that the actual number of cases would be much higher than that officially reported to the WHO.</p>
<p>During late April and early May of 2009, mass media in the United States provided extensive coverage on this new subtype of influenza A. Some schools in the United States were closed for up to 2 weeks if there was 1 identified case in the school according to the official recommendation of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539510377653">5</xref></sup> Almost a total shutdown was implemented in Mexico City in early May 2009. However, as the experience of dealing with influenza A (H1N1) infection increased, the official recommendations of the United States were revised and school closures were unnecessary if only a few cases were presented at the school.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539510377653">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>With the modern transportation of passengers and goods, infectious agents can reach almost any place within 24 hours globally. The WHO, in response to influenza control, has designed a 6-level alert system to provide advice to public health authorities of countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539510377653">6</xref></sup> The alert level was at 3 on April 25 and raised quickly to level 5 on April 29, 2009. Level 3 indicates that there are sporadic cases or small clusters in people and level 4 indicates community-level outbreak. Level 5 shows that the pandemic is imminent. On June 11, 2009, WHO declared influenza A (H1N1) pandemic (level 6).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539510377653">7</xref></sup> However, it is important to note that WHO’s influenza alert system only accounts for the geographic scale of spread of the virus and it does not reflect the severity of the disease.</p>
<p>China is the most populous country and its population accounts for more than 20% of the total world population. Most of the residents are living in rural areas with a weak public health system. The vivid experience of taking care of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 is still in the minds of top leadership. On May 1, as the WHO’s alert lever increased rapidly to level 5, the Chinese government implemented stricter border controls as an attempt to stop the virus from entering the country, with the assumption that the virus occurred only outside. Direct flights between China and Mexico were suspended after May 2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539510377653">8</xref></sup> For passengers, body temperature and other influenza symptoms were screened at ports of entry. The identified cases together with their close contacts were either mandatorily hospitalized until no influenza A (H1N1) virus was detected or quarantined for a week, respectively. Initially, the entire passengers on the plane were treated as close contacts and later, the close contacts were defined as persons within three seats of the identified cases. Studies on the management of the SARS epidemic disaster in greater China has suggested that the highly fragmented and compartmentalized intrajurisdictional public health system made marshalling resources and coordinated policy interventions very difficult.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539510377653">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this article, we have used two statistical reasoning concepts to discuss the measures to control of influenza A (H1N1) in China. The first concept to be discussed is the Bayesian approach and followed by the frequentist reasoning. These 2 schools of statistical inferences have coexisted for more than 2 centuries, and they have been extensively used in health care decision making.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539510377653">10</xref></sup> Skrepnek<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539510377653">11</xref></sup> has reviewed both approaches in the field of pharmacoeconomic analysis. In the 19th century, Bayesian inference was the main school of statistical reasoning. In the 20th century, the predominant statistical ideology has been the frequentist reasoning. However, we have observed a return of Bayesian thinking in recent years especially in health policy decision making. In modeling infectious diseases, Bayesian reasoning has been increasingly popular.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539510377653">12</xref></sup> We concluded this article with some discussions on ethical issues related to controlling influenza pandemic in practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1010539510377653">
<title>Bayesian Reasoning</title>
<p>In general, for controlling a new influenza pandemic, it is hard to justify intervention measures taken by health authority only based on current scientific evidence. Hence the Bayesian reasoning of using prior information plays a critical role in decision making. In China, because of the strict hierarchical structure of the civil society, much of the power of making decisions rests on the top leadership. For infectious diseases such as influenza A (H1N1), the decision to screen travelers entering China was implemented initially for passengers from Mexico and North America and later expanded to all travelers entering China. The reasoning of these measures assumed that the origin of influenza A (H1N1) was in Mexico or places outside China and there was none of the newly identified influenza A (H1N1) virus inside China at that time. Based on this prior assumption, border crossing passengers were screened for body temperature and influenza symptoms since May 1, 2009. This was so implemented and reinforced particularly in light of past experience with SARS prevention suggesting that infrared thermography was an effective and reliable tool ideal for mass-screening patients with fever in the initial phase of screening for SARS patients at a busy hospital during the SARS epidemic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539510377653">13</xref></sup> All passengers on the same airplane where even only a single confirmed case present would be treated as close contacts and as such they were mandatorily quarantined in an isolated hotel for a week. The confirmed cases were hospitalized in negative pressured rooms. It might be owing to difficulties in enforcement and associated cost that the close contacts were soon redefined as “people sitting within three rows of the confirmed cases” and that the facilities for treating infection cases were also less restrictive.</p>
<p>However, as with all infectious diseases, there are asymptomatic cases and there are also cases in latency/incubation periods. Hence only a few symptomatic cases could be identified at the ports of entry. From news reports, most of the confirmed influenza A (H1N1) cases were identified after the infected persons already entered China after these cases sought medical attention because of the manifestation of influenza symptoms. The authorities required all returning Chinese to have a voluntary quarantine for a week at home regardless of whether they have symptoms although some of the confirmed cases did not follow the order. In fact, at least one returning Chinese student was officially censured for violating the voluntary quarantine policy. It is interesting to note that the voluntary policy did not seem to apply to foreign visitors of non-Chinese descent. The International Health Regulations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539510377653">14</xref></sup> provide a basis for nondiscriminatory policy for infectious disease control, but Chinese authorities are accustomed to making flexibilities if there were pressures from foreign governments. If quarantining travelers from outside were useful and the Bayesian reasoning that no influenza A (H1N1) virus was inside China at that time were right, these flexibilities could reduce or compromise the effectiveness of the measures.</p>
<p>There seems a strong tendency in all countries assuming that infectious diseases originated from other places. On June 5, 2009, South Korea reported an influenza A (H1N1) case who travelled to China within a week. Hence this case was declared as an imported case from China.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539510377653">15</xref></sup> In June 2009, China sponsored a workshop in Beijing on influenza A (H1N1) for health professionals working in the field from the Association of the Southeast Asian Nations. Two of the attendees with symptoms became confirmed influenza A (H1N1) cases and 3 others were tested positive for the virus without symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539510377653">16</xref></sup> To avoid possible dispute where they were infected, the Ministry of Health of China did not publish where the infected persons came from, which was quite different from the format for most other cases reported in the media at that time. The prior belief of outside origins of infectious diseases without strong evidence may lead to biased national policy for controlling the spread of the diseases. In statistical analysis, Bayesian reasoning would be attractive and relevant in this case when prior knowledge can be taken into account for inference and decision making. However, there should be a mechanism to update the knowledge from new data and evidences promptly. In the following we illustrate the effect of belief and evidence through the Bayes theorem.</p>
<p>Suppose that there are two groups of people who are susceptible to H1N1 infection. Group A are travelers from outside and groups B are nontravelers/residents. Denote the conditional probability of a traveler from outside being diseased/infected as <italic>P</italic>(<italic>D</italic>|<italic>A</italic>) and similarly <italic>P</italic>(<italic>D</italic>|<italic>B</italic>) as the conditional probability of a nontraveler being diseased/infected.

<p>where <italic>P</italic>(<italic>A</italic>|<italic>D</italic>)<italic>P</italic>(<italic>D</italic>) = <italic>P</italic>(<italic>A</italic>∩<italic>D</italic>) and <italic>P</italic>(<italic>B</italic>|<italic>D</italic>)<italic>P</italic>(<italic>D</italic>) = <italic>P</italic>(<italic>B</italic>∩<italic>D</italic>) are the probability of finding a diseased case in travelers and nontravelers, respectively. Similarly, we define the probability of identifying a noncase in the travelers, <italic>P</italic>(<italic>A</italic>∩<italic>D</italic>−), and in nontravelers, <italic>P</italic>(<italic>B</italic>∩<italic>D</italic>−). If we assume that <italic>P</italic>(<italic>B</italic>∩<italic>D</italic>) = 0, that is, the diseased person cannot be found in the nontravelers, then we have <italic>P</italic>(<italic>D</italic>|<italic>B</italic>) = 0, (we know prevalence <italic>P</italic>(<italic>D</italic>) is nonzero). Hence, the conditional probability of finding a diseased person in nontravelers is zero and we do not need to test any nontravelers for influenza A (H1N1). The initial policies of controlling influenza A (H1N1) in many countries including China have been following this logic initially by assuming that diseased person can only be found in travelers entering from outside. From the summary of the warden message issued by the US State Department, there were about 26 countries implemented similar measures of screening incoming passengers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1010539510377653">17</xref></sup> In response to actual reported cases of local occurrences of the disease, whereas some countries have adjusted their policies in controlling influenza A (H1N1), China has continued its tough measures at the ports of entry. Since the middle of June 2009, China reported community outbreaks of influenza A (H1N1) in Guangdong and Beijing without finding a clear origin of the virus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1010539510377653">18</xref></sup> However, the official standing on controlling influenza A (H1N1) at ports of entry has not been changed much up to July 15 and it still focuses on the identification of cases at the ports of entry and mandatory quarantine of the contacts of the confirmed cases, although the mandatory quarantine has been mostly conducted at home rather than at a centralized living place since July 7, 2009. It is worth noting that, on June 18, Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China decided not to track the close contacts of confirmed cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1010539510377653">19</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section3-1010539510377653">
<title>Frequentist Reasoning</title>
<p>Frequentist thinking has been the widely accepted principle in statistical inference in the past 5 decades. The principle of frequentist reasoning is based on the assumption that the underlying distribution is defined through the actual observations. That is, the observed frequency would converge to the distribution if the number of observations is large. In the context of our study on influenza A (H1N1) control, the frequentist reasoning would not assume that the virus originated in North America at the time when the virus was newly identified in North America without the support of the evidence. The official point of view of the WHO seemed to follow the frequentist reasoning. However, government authorities and the general public tended to believe that influenza A (H1N1) virus originated from outside their borders. There have been genetic studies that showed that similar viruses have been circulating in swine population in many parts of the world prior to the identification of the human influenza A (H1N1).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539510377653">3</xref></sup> As such, influenza A (H1N1) was initially called swine flu, but the name was officially changed because of pressures from various interest groups. Without solid evidence to the contrary, frequentist reasoning would assume that influenza A (H1N1) virus may be observed in any place around the world. Before or during the implementing of the strict control measures at the ports of entry, a survey or a representative surveillance system should provide useful information in determining if the virus has been circulating in the population within the border. The initial policy should be subject to scrutiny based on the available observed information with possible adjustments in optimizing resources and effectiveness of the national control measures. In fact, China has established a quite technically sophisticated reporting system in monitoring infectious diseases. It may be because of political and economical considerations that the diagnostic procedures of influenza A (H1N1) infection focused only on travelers entering China with symptoms or their close contacts. The testing of influenza A (H1N1) avoided the majority of the patients with similar symptoms inside China although some tests were performed in school staff and students in Guangdong province and in Beijing, the capital, in late June 2009. Since June 2009, increased cases of influenza A (H1N1) were confirmed without a clear link to travelers from outside China. Consequently, more mechanisms of influenza A (H1N1) control have been implemented beyond the focus of travelers from outside. From news reports, students in schools were required to measure their body temperature twice daily and events with a large number of participants were canceled in some areas.</p>
<p>After 30 years of economic reform, Chinese population is increasingly mobile domestically and internationally. It is very costly and disruptive to daily lives to implement the current influenza A (H1N1) control policy in China. In late June 2009, among the more than 3000 confirmed cases in China, including Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, no death was reported due to the infection of H1N1 virus in mainland and one death was probably due to the infection in Hong Kong. However, on July 1, 2009, one patient died due to accidental electric shock while taking a bath at a hospital in Zhejiang Province after her symptoms disappeared according to the news report.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1010539510377653">20</xref></sup> This incidence seemed consistent with the travel alert issued by the US government that living and accommodation of some hospitals and quarantine places should be improved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1010539510377653">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Similar to many viruses circulating in humans and in other hosts, influenza A (H1N1) may also be subject to mutation; therefore, constant surveillance is needed for the entire population in China and around the world. In controlling the epidemic of the infectious diseases, frequentist reasoning should be merged with the Bayesian framework. When there was little information about a new virus, one may have to use the prior assumption in decision making. However, as more and more empirical observations are available, national intervention policies in controlling infectious diseases should be adjusted accordingly and frequentist reasoning may play a more dominant role in revising the policies. Theoretically speaking, from a Bayesian point of view, the frequentist statistical inference can be viewed as a special case of Bayesian inference with the use of noninformative prior.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>China accounts for more than 20% of the total population in the world. Its large-scale public health measures are of a global significance. The government of the United States issued a travel alert for travelers to China on June 19.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1010539510377653">21</xref></sup> The alert was not because more number of cases of influenza A (H1N1) were observed, but because of the uncertainty and random nature of being possibly quarantined. The detailed information on selecting travelers for quarantine in China was summarized in the early travel alert.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1010539510377653">17</xref></sup> Partially due to the control of the influenza A (H1N1) epidemic, the number of tourists to China in May 2009 from non-Chinese regions decreased dramatically (by 17%) as compared with the same period in 2008.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1010539510377653">22</xref></sup> The Beijing Survey Branch of the National Statistical Bureau of China conducted a survey on the attitude of the residents in Beijing about the government’s policy on influenza A (H1N1) control. The results showed that more than 85% of the responders supported the policy because the policy mostly affects travelers from the outside and has relatively minor impact on daily activities of the residents in Beijing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539510377653">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Selgelid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1010539510377653">24</xref></sup> proposed 4 aspects to be considered in pandemic influenza control: (<italic>a</italic>) obligation to avoid infecting others, (<italic>b</italic>) duty to treat, (<italic>c</italic>) allocation of scarce medical resources, and (<italic>d</italic>) coercive social distancing. First, for aspect (<italic>a</italic>), one of the official measurements in controlling influenza A (H1N1) virus infections in China required that all returning Chinese should have a 7-day voluntary quarantine at home. The censured student mentioned previously visited many places within the 7 days of his returning (we believe most did not follow the official requirement if no influenza symptom was presented) and was later confirmed to have influenza A (H1N1). It was reported that there were 88 people resulted in quarantine because of the student ignoring the voluntary quarantine requirement. The report also pointed out that the student did not keep a record of public transportation and withheld information of his close contacts with people having influenza symptoms in the United States at the port of entry. It is unknown that how many of the 88 quarantined individuals were infected, but the official censure encouraged the 88 people being quarantined to pursue legal actions against this student.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1010539510377653">25</xref></sup> Infected patients or people who might have the potential to be infective should avoid infecting others with proper precaution and the health authorities should also implement the policy based on scientific evidence and apply the measures nondiscriminatorily.</p>
<p>Second, for aspect (<italic>b</italic>), in terms of treating infected patients, the reported influenza A (H1N1) cases seemed to have low case-fatality. Up to September 23, 2009, no death directly linking to influenza A (H1N1) was reported from these more than 14 000 confirmed cases in China. However, more than 300 deaths due to influenza A (H1N1) were reported up to December 22, 2009. Some hospitals tried Chinese medicine on patients. The travel alert issued by the US government commented that some hospitals used unapproved medication to minors without the consent of the parents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1010539510377653">21</xref></sup> Because the majority of cases of influenza A (H1N1) patients can recover from illness without active treatment, hence the effectiveness of treating influenza A (H1N1) infection using unapproved medication is doubtful without the evidence from well-designed clinical trials. By the end of September 2009, vaccination became available for some people in China. However, it is still not an easy task to vaccinate more than 20% of the world population and there is much to be learned on the effectiveness, safety, and cost of the vaccination.</p>
<p>Third, for aspect (<italic>c</italic>), China has the largest foreign reserves in the world, but it is still a developing country. The health care system is relatively weak compared with that in developed countries. There are many competing public health priorities requiring limited medical resources. For example, the hand–foot–mouth disease caused by the EV71 virus has been circulating in the Chinese children widely.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1010539510377653">26</xref></sup> According to official statistics, in May 2009 alone there were 169 073 cases with 59 deaths.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1010539510377653">26</xref></sup> However, very little attention was given to controlling the spreading of EV71 virus. As the number of patients with the influenza A (H1N1) increases, who should pay for the identification and treatment of the patients will be of an important concern. Eventually all the cost has to be paid by the Chinese tax money (eg, those collected by central or local governments), by insurance, or out of pocket money (by individuals or their families). Up to the middle of September, the mandatory quarantine and treatment costs for influenza A (H1N1) have been covered by tax money. However, patients who have sought medical attention and were not confirmed to be influenza A (H1N1) have to pay for themselves for the treatment and diagnostic cost. Hence there is a financial incentive for local hospitals and local governments to not identify the cases to be influenza A (H1N1). More attention will be given if one reports that he or she comes from a foreign country within 7 days (personal communication). Since July 7, 2009, the mandatory quarantine in China for close contacts of confirmed cases has been primarily conducted at home. Most close contacts were not required to be relocated to centralized living places such as hotels because of the increasing number of close contacts and the cost. However, it is not clear if the patients will be treated mandatorily and how the mandatory home quarantine can be enforced. Since the middle of September 2009, hospitals have started to charge influenza A (H1N1) patients or their medical insurance plans for the treatment.</p>
<p>Fourth, for aspect (<italic>d</italic>), based on the lessons learned from the dramatic measures in controlling the SARS in 2003, China has continued “coercive social distancing” for influenza A (H1N1) control on symptomatic people entering China and their close contacts since May 2009 after the identification of the virus in April 2009 in North America. By late June, the coercive social distancing has also been applied to some schools and construction sites. Social distancing showed its effectiveness for islands such as American Samoa in the 1918 flu but it may be less effective for people living in a large continent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1010539510377653">24</xref></sup> As mentioned previously, comparing with many other countries, it is relatively easy for China to implement quarantine and other coercive social distancing methods because of the hierarchical structure of the Chinese society. The officials in China are much more powerful than their counterparts in developed countries. Hence it is very important to follow the orders from the higher level authorities. It has been the official position in China that SARS was brought under control due to the coercive social distancing method at the late epidemic in 2003 even though the measure is not widely recognized as effective outside China.</p>
<p>Coercive social distancing such as compulsory quarantine is very costly and disruptive to daily activities in population affected. In implementing compulsory quarantine, one needs to take into account also the burden of the diseases, for example, their potential gains of life expectancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1010539510377653">27</xref></sup> The US CDC recommends mandatory measures only for pandemics when case-fatality ratio is greater than 1%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1010539510377653">28</xref></sup> If the coercive social distancing is necessary in controlling influenza pandemic, the measure must be used nondiscriminatorily and with net gains to the society. Furthermore, those under quarantine should be provided with, when applicable, reasonable living conditions, financial compensation, and lost wages. China issued official instructions to employers to pay the wages for those under quarantine, but this instruction is only meaningful for those employees working for large institutes in China. Most travelers from outside did not get financial compensation because of coercive social distancing. The travel alert issued by the US government advised travelers to China to purchase extra travel insurance to compensate losses because of possible quarantine.</p>
<p>On June 18, 2009, Hong Kong, a special administrative region (SAR) adjusted its measures in controlling influenza A (H1N1). The authorities of Hong Kong SAR abandoned their policy of quarantining close contacts of the confirmed cases and would only hospitalize cases with serious illness due to influenza A (H1N1).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1010539510377653">19</xref></sup> On July 3, 2009, the State Council of the Central Government of China held a meeting to review and adjust measures for influenza A (H1N1) control in Chinese Mainland. The meeting emphasized the need to strengthen measures in public places such as schools and hospitals and to adjust the measures at ports of entry. The details of the new policies were yet to be published at the writing of this manuscript. Following the increase of domestic and international travel and commerce, infectious diseases would travel at the speed of airplanes around the globe. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness and cost in controlling infectious diseases. New evidence and data should be used to enhance the Bayesian and the frequentist reasoning to design and update the policies efficiently. The timely editorial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1010539510377653">29</xref></sup> and the policy review<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1010539510377653">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1010539510377653">31</xref></sup> provide us guidance in searching for more effective measures under various conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1010539510377653">32</xref></sup> On July 16, 2009, WHO decided not to count individual cases for countries already having influenza A (H1N1) and will provide updates only on newly affected countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1010539510377653">33</xref></sup> In China, up to November 2009 the government continued to report confirmed cases every 2 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1010539510377653">34</xref></sup> However, the reporting frequency for the confirmed cases has become weekly since December 2009. It is worth noting that, after the reopening of the schools and strict surveillance on students, the number of confirmed domestic cases increased dramatically to more than 600 per day, whereas, the confirmed cases of foreign origin decreased to less than 10 per day.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1010539510377653">34</xref></sup> As most areas of China enter winter in November, the number of confirmed cases increased quickly to nearly 100 000 by the end of November. It was reported that almost 90% of the influenza cases in China were of an H1N1 type. The number of deaths due to influenza A (H1N1) was greater than 300 although it is generally believed that the majority of the cases and deaths due to influenza A (H1N1) were not included in the official statistics.</p>
<p>The epidemic of influenza A (H1N1) is continuing in China and around the world. The debate regarding the Bayesian and frequentist approaches will also continue in the foreseeable future. As a large developing country with a diversity of demographic structures and economic developed levels, China has very limited resources in combating diseases. Taking into account the fact that people are living constantly in an environment of competing risks of deaths and diseases, governmental agencies and academic institutes in China should evaluate cost effectiveness and public health and ethical issues of large-scale disease control mechanisms carefully before implementing them. For example, simulations and sensitivity analysis under Bayesian and frequentist scenarios would improve decision making. Therefore, more research in disease control and prevention with different approaches, including the two discussed above, should be encouraged in China.</p>
