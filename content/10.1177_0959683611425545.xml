<abstract>
<p>Gualas Glacier is an outlet glacier of the Northern Patagonian Icefield, one of the largest temperate ice bodies on Earth. Golfo Elefantes, the depositional basin of Gualas Glacier, has a sedimentary record that spans, with some hiatuses, at least the last ~11.3±3.0 ka. During this period the gulf remained free of ice, as suggested by the absence of proximal glacimarine sediment and till in the sedimentary section. This implies that the arcuate terminal moraines that occur along the edges of Golfo Elefantes were formed during the waning stages of the local glacial maxima (Late Pleistocene) or the early Holocene. Between ~11.3±3.0 ka and ~4.2±0.3–1.4 ka, the basin received low sediment input consisting of fine-grained sediments in the form of low concentration density currents that filled bathymetric lows. Sediment discharge increased several times in the late Holocene (~&lt;1.4 ka) and started with the accumulation of ~ 0.5 km<sup>3</sup> of sandy sediments in a relatively short time span (~670 yr). This high discharge of sandy sediments is interpreted as being the result of glacial reworking of sediments stored in Gualas Glacier proglacial lake and thus implies that the glacier advanced at ~1.4–0.8 ka. The overall increase in sediment discharge in the late Holocene indicates a sharp increase in centennial timescale precipitation, which in turn suggests an increase in the intensity of the westerly winds in the area. Two recent periods of interannual sedimentation variability were identified at ~<sc>ad</sc> 1160–1460 and ~<sc>ad</sc> 1680–1890 and correlate with documented regional glacier advances.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gualas Glacier is an outlet glacier of the Northern Patagonian Icefield (NPI), one of the largest temperate ice bodies on earth. NPI has a total glaciated area of 3953 km<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959683611425545">Rivera et al., 2007</xref>), capping the Andes cordillera at altitudes between 700 and 2500 m above sea level (m a.s.l.) and extending 125 km along its NS axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959683611425545">Glasser et al., 2005</xref>). Outlet glaciers on its western side reach almost to sea level, including San Rafael Glacier, the lowest latitude tide water glacier in the world. The mass balance of the NPI has been negative during the last few decades, contributing 0.013±0.006 mm/yr to global sea-level rise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959683611425545">Rignot et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959683611425545">Rivera et al., 2007</xref>), a rate higher than the average contribution since the ‘Little Ice Age’ glacial maximum reached at ~<sc>ad</sc> 1870 (0.0018±0.0004 mm/yr; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959683611425545">Glasser et al., 2011</xref>). NPI is nourished by moisture transported from the Pacific Ocean by the southern westerly winds, which results in high precipitation throughout the year and a strong west–east precipitation gradient because of the rain shadow effect of the Andes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0959683611425545">Warren and Sudgen, 1993</xref>). The few weather stations in the region show that the NPI, and thus Gualas Glacier, is located in an intermediate zone with respect to seasonal precipitation: seasonal maxima occur during winter north of the NPI and are reached during summer south of the NPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959683611425545">Harrison and Winchester, 1998</xref>). The climate of the area is highly influenced by the latitudinal position and strength of the Westerly Wind Belt (WWB), which depends on the interplay between the Pacific Anticyclone and the Polar Front. It is hypothesized, based on pollen records, that the WWB shifted northward during the local last glacial maximum (LGM) and then shifted southward during the last deglaciation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959683611425545">Ashworth et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959683611425545">Markgraf, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959683611425545">McCulloch et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959683611425545">Moreno et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959683611425545">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959683611425545">Villa-Martínez and Moreno, 2007</xref>). However, other records suggest that instead of latitudinal wandering the WWB expanded and weakened during regional cold climate phases (e.g. late Holocene; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959683611425545">Lamy et al., 2010</xref>), as occurs today during the austral winter, and that it contracted and strengthened during the early Holocene, as occurs during the austral summer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959683611425545">Lamy et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Most of the NPI glaciers are currently receding from their historical maximum position, which was reached coincidently with the Northern Hemisphere ‘Little Ice Age’ (LIA) (seventeenth to nineteenth centuries <sc>ad</sc>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959683611425545">Araneda et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959683611425545">Harrison et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683611425545">Lopez et al., 2010</xref>). Virtually nothing is known about the Holocene behavior of the NPI outlet glaciers prior to the LIA, but it is generally accepted that the entire Patagonian region experienced a pattern of Neoglacial advances similar to that described for the Southern Patagonian Icefield (SPI) by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959683611425545">Mercer (1965</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959683611425545">1968</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959683611425545">1976)</xref> and others (see next sections).</p>
<p>In this study we focus on the Holocene sedimentary record of Golfo Elefantes in central western Patagonia (46.5°S). Most of the sediment supplied to this gulf is generated by Gualas Glacier and delivered to the gulf by Gualas River. Minor amounts of sediment is supplied to Golfo Elefantes by Reicher Glacier through Gualas River, and by San Rafael Glacier through Rio Tempanos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611425545">Figure 1</xref>). Hence, we interpret the sedimentary record of Golfo Elefantes as an archive of past variability of the coupled Gualas Glacier/River system. We present data that indicates an order of magnitude increase of sediment discharge to the basin in the late Holocene (~&lt;1.4–4.3 ka) compared with the early Holocene–Late Pleistocene (~4.3–11.3 ka). This increased sediment flux is interpreted to represent increased precipitation related to intensification of the westerly winds in the area. The deposition of sandy sediments at the beginning of the late Holocene (~0.8–1.1 ka) is interpreted as the result of advance of Gualas Glacier over its proglacial lake and reworking of the sediments stored there. Our results shed light on the history of other glaciers of western Patagonia and contribute to the understanding of the Holocene behavior of the southern WWB.</p>

<title>LGM and deglaciation</title>
<p>Maximum ice extent during the LGM was reached diachronously along the Patagonian Andes, with recent age estimations falling within the interval 22–26 ka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959683611425545">Kaplan et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959683611425545">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959683611425545">McCulloch et al., 2005</xref>; and references therein). At the latitude of Gualas Glacier (46.5°S), the ice persisted close to LGM limits until ~15–16 ka, when the extensive piedmont ice lobes that characterized the LGM ice sheet in the eastern flanks of the Patagonian Andes shrank to give way to present-day outlet glaciers that drain into fjord lakes and glacial valleys east of the North Patagonian Icefield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959683611425545">Turner et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Following the initial glacial retreat along the eastern side of the Patagonian Andes, glaciers stabilized until ~13.6–12.8 ka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959683611425545">Turner et al., 2005</xref>). At this time a second stage of retreat resulted in the separation of the Pleistocene Patagonian Ice Cap into the Northern and Southern Patagonian Icefields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959683611425545">Turner et al., 2005</xref>). Whether this two-stage retreat was mimicked on the western side of the Andes remains unknown.</p>
<p>Relatively few studies have been conducted on the western side of the Patagonian Andes and much uncertainty exists concerning the timing and geographic pattern of the Pleistocene deglaciation. In the Taitao Peninsula, west of Gualas Glacier, several studies obtained minimum ages of deglaciation around 16–18 ka (~14 000 <sup>14</sup>C yr BP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683611425545">Bennett et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959683611425545">Heusser, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959683611425545">Lumley and Switsur, 1993</xref>). This indicates that the deglaciation of Taitao Peninsula occurred at least a couple of millennia earlier than on the eastern side of the Andes, at a time when some reconstructions and models suggest that the area was still covered by ice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959683611425545">Hubbard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959683611425545">Turner et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Neoglaciation</title>
<p>The majority of studies suggest that no regional glacial advance occurred during the early–middle Holocene and that between three to six late-Holocene glacial advances took place at different latitudes within the Patagonian Andes since ~5000 <sup>14</sup>C yr BP.

However, recent works suggest additional Neoglacial advances at around 3600 <sup>14</sup>C yr BP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959683611425545">Aniya, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959683611425545">Strelin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0959683611425545">Wenzens, 1999</xref>), at ~ 1600–1288 <sup>14</sup>C yr BP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959683611425545">Aniya, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959683611425545">Röthlisberger, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959683611425545">Strelin et al., 2008</xref>) and at ~900–500 <sup>14</sup>C yr BP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959683611425545">Aniya, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959683611425545">Koch and Kilian, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959683611425545">Röthlisberger, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959683611425545">Strelin et al., 2008</xref>) in Darwin Cordillera and at some eastern outlet glaciers of SPI. Additionally, there is some evidence indicating early-Holocene (~ 6–9 ka) advances in at least three areas along the eastern flanks of the Patagonian Andes, but their regional significance and climate ties are still a matter of debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959683611425545">Douglass et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959683611425545">Röthlisberger, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0959683611425545">Wenzens, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The chronology of centennial- to millennial-scale Holocene glacier fluctuations remains obscure in the area of Gualas Glacier. The most studied glaciers in this area are San Quintin and San Rafael glaciers, the two largest outlet glaciers of the NPI. Along with Gualas Glacier, all three glaciers have prominent terminal moraines located along a fault-controlled elongated basin west of the cordilleran front (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611425545">Figure 1</xref>). The similar relative location of terminal and frontal moraines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959683611425545">Heusser, 2002</xref>) further suggests that they were constructed in response to the same climatic forcing and not by internal ice dynamics. Unfortunately, because of the lack of suitable material for age determination and the complexity of the facies architecture of these moraines, the only ages that have been obtained to date are from the dual moraine system of San Rafael Glacier known as Témpanos I and II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959683611425545">Muller, 1959</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611425545">Figure 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959683611425545">Heusser (1960</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959683611425545">2002)</xref> obtained a date of 3740 <sup>14</sup>C yr BP for near basal sediments in a small lagoon between Témpanos I and II moraines and another of 3600 <sup>14</sup>C yr BP that postdates Témpanos I–II outwash deposits along Rio de Los Témpanos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611425545">Figure 1</xref>). A third age of 6850 <sup>14</sup>C yr BP from a peat bed located inside the perimeter defined by a younger moraine system (Témpanos III; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611425545">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959683611425545">Muller, 1959</xref>) was interpreted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959683611425545">Heusser (1960</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959683611425545">2002)</xref> as implying that Témpanos I–II were formed after an early-Holocene recession. This is supported by the occurrence of deformed laminites at the bottom of the morainal sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959683611425545">Glasser et al., 2006</xref>).

<p>By comparison, the recent behavior of Gualas Glacier has received much less attention. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959683611425545">Harrison and Winchester (1998)</xref> estimated that Gualas Glacier retreated from its LIA position (moraine system Gualas IV; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611425545">Figure 1</xref>) by ~<sc>ad</sc> 1870 based on a dendrochronological study of trees on the highest trimline near the present-day ice front. According to the same author, marked retreat also occurred during the 1920s–1930s and 1960s–1970s. A similar pattern of retreat is documented for the nearby Reicher, San Rafael and San Quintin glaciers, and appears to correlate with periods of reduced precipitation in the area. This suggests that climate might effectively control the behavior of these glaciers, at least at decadal timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959683611425545">Araneda et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959683611425545">Harrison and Winchester, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959683611425545">Harrison et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959683611425545">Warren, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0959683611425545">Winchester and Harrison, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The middle to late Holocene in Patagonia might therefore have been characterized by up to six Neoglacial advances: I, ~4600–4200 <sup>14</sup>C yr BP; II, ~3600 <sup>14</sup>C yr BP; III, ~2700–2000 <sup>14</sup>C yr BP; IV, ~1600–1288 <sup>14</sup>C yr BP; V, ~900–500 <sup>14</sup>C yr BP; and VI (LIA?), seventeenth to nineteenth centuries <sc>ad</sc>.</p>

<p>Sedimentation rates and the ages of seismic units were estimated using two radiocarbon-dated sediment cores. The cores were opened, described and sampled onboard. Further analyses were made to characterize the sediments and to correlate the sedimentological facies with seismic units. Analyses included particle size distributions, physical properties, total organic carbon measurements and x-radiography (Supplement 1, available online). Radiocarbon ages were obtained on 13 samples of carbonate shell material and terrestrial plant material (JPC12: 3 samples, JPC14: 10 samples; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0959683611425545">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Seismic facies and architecture</title>
<p>We identified six seismic units in the Golfo Elefantes based on internal seismic characteristics (amplitude, spacing and continuity of reflections) and geometric relationships between units. The stratigraphic relationship between these units and their internal architecture was better imaged in north–south lines 3 and 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611425545">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683611425545">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683611425545">4a</xref>), and in east–west line 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683611425545">Figure 4b</xref>). Hence, the following description will be based mainly on these three lines (details in Supplement 3, available online).</p>
<p>Seismic unit G1 was imaged only in the western part of Line 5, near the two arcuate moraines that surround Golfo Elefantes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611425545">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683611425545">4b</xref>), and is the oldest distal glacimarine deposit in the gulf. Unit G1 is overlaid by Unit G2, which is characterized by relatively strong reflections roughly parallel to the (acoustic) basement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611425545">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683611425545">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683611425545">4</xref>). Unit G2 rests directly on bedrock or morainal deposits (acoustic basement), is laterally continuous and shows uniform thickness over large areas. Neither G1 nor G2 were sampled.</p>
<p>The oldest seismic unit that was sampled by cores is G3. It is composed of parallel, near-horizontal reflections that onlap the irregular and relatively well defined contact with underlying unit G2 and fills depressions in the sea floor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683611425545">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683611425545">4</xref>). Unit G3 is overlaid by G4, which is characterized by discontinuous and relatively strong reflections. Unit G4 has variable thickness (&lt;10 m), with a low-relief upper boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683611425545">Figure 4</xref>). As seen near the center of lines 3, 5, and 10, unit G4 onlaps underlying unit G3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683611425545">Figure 4</xref>), although the contact is difficult to follow because of its irregular and discontinuous character. The same seismic profiles show that only the top of unit G4 occurs at coring site JPC14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683611425545">Figure 4</xref>). This indicates the existence of a hiatus at the contact with the underlying unit (G3) at that location. Overlying G4 there are two units of similar seismic architecture, units G5 and G6. Unit G5 is characterized by medium- to low-amplitude reflections alternating with transparent intervals indicating thin bedding of approximately 40 cm thickness (the approximate vertical resolution of our seismic acquisition system). This unit downlaps at low angles onto underlying unit G4 and thins to the north in lines 3 and 10. Unit G6, the youngest seismic unit, is bounded by two strong, continuous and roughly parallel reflections separated by up to ~2.5 m (from peak to peak) in the central part of the basin. Unit G6 loses continuity and pinches out toward the north (lines 3 and 10; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683611425545">Figure 4a</xref>) and, to a lesser extent, to the west (line 5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683611425545">Figure 4b</xref>).</p>

<title>Sedimentology of seismic units</title>
<p>The description of the sedimentary facies associated with seismic units G3 through G6 is based mainly on core JPC14, located approximately at the intersection of seismic lines 3, 10 and 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611425545">Figure 2</xref>). Six lithofacies units were defined based mainly on changes in grain size distribution and occurrence of laminations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683611425545">Figure 5</xref>). Five of these units consist primarily of silty mud (SM1, 2, 3, 5, and 6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683611425545">Figure 5</xref>) and one is composed of silty sand (SS4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683611425545">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Seismic unit G6 corresponds to the top 196–240 cm of core JPC14 (top of unit SM1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683611425545">Figure 5</xref>). The lower boundary of G6 correlates with a silty mud interval (196–240 cm) with sandy layers (&lt;2 cm thick) and associated organic matter (leaves and pieces of wood) that marks the deepest visible layering in SM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683611425545">Figure 5</xref>). This same interval shows the highest TOC values of the core (~1–1.7%). Seismic unit G5 composes the lower part of lithofacies unit SM1 and complete units SM2 and SM3. The overall lithology is silty mud with increasing percentages of clay (from &lt;20% to ~30%) and sand (from &lt;10% to &lt;20%) towards the bottom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683611425545">Figure 5</xref>). The appearance of laminations &lt;1 cm thick between 689 and 797 cm (bottom of SM2 and all SM3) and an increase in sand correlates with relatively high TOC values (~0.9–1.4%).</p>
<p>Seismic unit G4 correlates with a 328 cm thick interval of silty, fine sand that composes sedimentary unit SS4 (796.5–1125 cm). There are three main peaks in sand content (subunits SS4a,b,c; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683611425545">Figure 5</xref>) that seem to correlate with the two internal reflections in unit G4 at the location of core JPC14 and the strong reflection that marks the top boundary of this unit. Visual inspection of the bottom contact of the silty sands of SS4 in core JPC14, as well as the grain size data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683611425545">Figure 5</xref>), shows a gradational contact associated with the hiatus inferred from the seismic records. The absence of visible organic matter in this unit is consistent with its relatively low TOC content (~0.4–0.6%).</p>
<p>The oldest seismic unit sampled by JPC14, G3, comprises two sedimentary units: SM5 and SM6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683611425545">Figure 5</xref>). Both consist of silty mud with variable percentages of sand (SM5: 20% sand; SM6: 5–10% sand) that decreases down core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683611425545">Figure 5</xref>). Some silty/sandy laminations were visually identified in unit SM5, but several intervals with layering and laminations were also observed in the x-rays of unit SM6.</p>

<title>Age constraints for seismic units</title>
<p>Accumulation rates and bounding ages for seismic units G3 through G6 were determined from 13 radiocarbon ages obtained from shells and vegetation samples in cores JPC14 and JPC12 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0959683611425545">Table 1</xref>).Three dates from the top of unit SM1 in core JPC14 (~200–220 cm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683611425545">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0959683611425545">Table 1</xref>) imply that unit G6 accumulated at a rate of ~10 mm/yr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611425545">Figure 6</xref>) since the beginning of the eighteenth century. Four radiocarbon ages with calibrated ages ranging from 328 to 729 cal. yr BP (2σ minimum and maximum interval) were obtained from core JPC14 for seismic unit G5 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0959683611425545">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611425545">Figure 6</xref>). These ages, plus the three from unit G6, show a clear linear trend in the age model (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>=0.75; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611425545">Figure 6</xref>), implying an average accumulation rate of ~10 mm/yr for these two units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611425545">Figure 6</xref>). Using this rate to estimate the age of the top and bottom of unit G5 at the location of core JPC14, we determined that unit G5 accumulated between ~<sc>ad</sc> 1160 and 1710 (~240–790 cal. yr BP). Three other ages obtained in core JPC12 (calibrated ages that fall between 454–909 cal. yr BP, 2σ minimum and maximum interval) further support this chronology (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0959683611425545">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611425545">Figure 6</xref>). These ages imply a linear accumulation rate of 12.7 mm/yr (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>=0.76; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611425545">Figure 6</xref>), which indicates that at the location of JPC12 unit G5 was deposited between ~<sc>ad</sc> 1170 and 1580 (~780–370 cal. yr BP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611425545">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<caption><p>Age model for sediment cores JPC14 and JPC12. The ages of boundaries of seismic units G3, G4, G5 and G6 are shown for JPC14. For G4, two possible scenarios are given. One scenario assumes the same average accumulation rate as for the younger units and implies the existence of a 3100 yr hiatus between G4 and G3. The other scenario assumes no hiatus and result in an accumulation rate of ~0.96 mm/yr for unit G4. See text for discussion of the validity of these assumptions. For unit G3 minimum and maximum ages for the top and bottom are estimated based on the uncertainty of calibrated ages. For JPC12 the best linear fit curve for the three existing radiocarbon ages is shown</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0959683611425545-fig6.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>No radiocarbon ages were obtained in Unit G4 because of the lack of datable material. The down-core extrapolation of the accumulation rate of G5 in JPC14 (10.1 mm/yr) implies that the portion of G4 sampled at this site was deposited in 325 years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611425545">Figure 6</xref>). However, just ~1 km from JPC14, G4 is about 6 m thick and consist of six instead of three seismic layers seen at the location of JPC14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683611425545">Figure 4b</xref>). This implies that at that location G4 represents ~600 years of sediment accumulation. A similar downcore extrapolation of G5 accumulation rates at the location of JPC12, where G4 is ~8.5 m thick (Supplement 2), implies that G4 accumulated during a time span of ~670 years. The extreme values for the time span of accumulation of G4 (325 and 670 yr) are used to estimate a maximum and minimum volume equivalent sediment discharge for this unit. However, the estimated time span from core JPC14 must be taken with caution since the section at this location includes a hiatus (see previous sections; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611425545">Figure 6</xref>).</p>
<p>Three calibrated ages ranging from 4423 to 5287 cal. yr BP (2σ minimum and maximum interval) were obtained in core JPC14 for Unit G3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0959683611425545">Table 1</xref>). Using these ages we calculated an accumulation rate of ~3.1 mm/yr for the interval 1234–1414 cm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611425545">Figure 6</xref>). Using this rate results in an age for the upper limit of Unit G3 of ~4230 cal. yr BP, with an uncertainty (~95% confidence interval) between ~4450 cal. yr BP and ~3925 cal. yr BP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611425545">Figure 6</xref>; for simplicity this age will be presented as ~4.2±0.3 ka in the discussion section). To estimate the age of the base of unit G3, we extrapolated the accumulation rate of G3 down-section at its thickest part near core JPC14 (~22 m, about 3 km north of JPC14; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683611425545">Figure 4a</xref>) and obtained an age of ~11 300 cal. yr BP. Given the few radiocarbon ages for G3, the uncertainty of the limiting ages for this unit is higher than for units G5 and G6. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611425545">Figure 6</xref> shows the uncertainty of the age model for unit G3 estimated from accumulation rates obtained from all possible combinations of calibrated ages within the 95% interval of confidence. This model implies that the actual age of initial accumulation of G3 might fall within the interval ~8500–14500 cal. yr BP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611425545">Figure 6</xref>; for simplicity this age will be presented as ~11.5±3.0 ka in the discussion section). However this is considered a conservative estimate of the uncertainty since the uniform parallel horizontal reflections that characterized G3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683611425545">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683611425545">4a</xref>) suggests little variation of the accumulation rate.</p>

<title>Sediment discharge</title>
<p>To estimate the sediment discharge corresponding to each seismic unit, we used estimates of the rock-equivalent volume of each unit (i.e. the total volume of sediments multiplied by the ratio between the density of the sediments over the source rock’s density) divided by the time span over which these units accumulated. The total volume of sediments accumulated in Golfo Elefantes was obtained by mapping the onlap of glacimarine sediments onto steeply dipping reflections of unit G2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683611425545">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683611425545">4</xref>), and then calculating the volume of sediment between this surface and the sea floor. Similarly, we mapped a reflection that lies about 9 m below sea floor (m b.s.f.) and corresponds to the boundary between units G4 and G5 using the 3.5 kHz subbottom profiler records (SBP). The volumes of units G5 and G6 were estimated from their relative proportions in the SBP sections along lines 3 and 10. Then, by mapping unit G4 in the same sections, we estimated its volume as a proportion of the combined volumes of G5 and G6. Finally, the volume of G3 was calculated as the difference between the total sediment volume and the volumes of the other units (i.e. G4+G5+G6). Errors were estimated for the total interval of uncertainty from each parameter involved in the calculations. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0959683611425545">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0959683611425545">Figure 7</xref> summarize our results.</p>

<p>For units G4, G5 and G6 the uncertainty presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0959683611425545">Table 2</xref> is produced mainly from the calculation of volumes. The sediment discharge represented by unit G4 is considered a maximum since the time span of accumulation could be longer than the estimated value if the hiatus separating G4 from G3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611425545">Figure 6</xref>) is, in fact, shorter in some other non-studied locations. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0959683611425545">Figure 7</xref> shows that, using accumulation rates and unit thickness found in JPC14, the equivalent discharge of G4 doubles. For unit G3, the associated uncertainty comes mainly from the age determination of the onset of its accumulation, and to a lesser extent, from the age of its top (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611425545">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0959683611425545">7</xref>). Even considering extreme scenarios for the time span of accumulation of G3, including the oldest possible estimate of the onset of its accumulation (~14.5 ka) and no hiatus between G3 and G4 (i.e. the age of G3’s top being equal to the estimated age of G4’s bottom, ~1.1 ka), the time averaged sediment discharge (Qs) represented by unit G3 is several times less than any of the younger units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0959683611425545">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

<title>Implications for the Late-Pleistocene glacial history of the fjords west of the NPI</title>
<p>According to our best estimates, the marine sedimentary record of Golfo Elefantes spans, with some hiatuses, the last ~11.3±3.0 ka. Between ~11.3±3.0 ka and ~4.2±0.3 ka (early–middle Holocene) mostly fine-grained sediments accumulated in the basin. These sediments were derived from turbidity currents (underflows), forming subhorizontal layers that filled bathymetric lows within the basin (seismic unit G3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683611425545">Figure 4</xref>). The lack of strong seismic reflections or evidence of channelized deposits or prograding wedges indicates relatively steady sediment accumulation, likely associated with climate and glacier stability. Additionally, no evidence was found of till or ice proximal deposits. Rather, sediments from this time interval that were sampled in core JPC14 are characterized by an absence of material coarser than fine sand and by high clay content. The grain size distribution and high clay content imply that syn- or post-depositional winnowing did not occur during the deposition of this unit (seismic unit G3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683611425545">Figure 5</xref> and Supplement 4). Thus, the low sediment discharge (Qs) calculated for G3 (~7.1 kg/s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0959683611425545">Figure 7</xref>) can be considered a good approximation of the early-Holocene sediment discharge of Gualas River.</p>
<p>The absence of ice contact sediments raises the question of the age of the arcuate (terminal) moraines that occur along the edge of Golfo Elefantes (MS Gualas I; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611425545">Figure 2</xref>). Our data suggest that the moraines were formed before the deposition of unit G3 (&gt;~11.3±3.0 ka), probably in the late/waning stages of the local LGM. This is supported by basinward dipping reflections in E–W seismic lines (unit G2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683611425545">Figure 4b</xref>) near the moraines, over which subhorizontal reflections of unit G3 onlap. Similar geometries and seismic character are found in other Patagonian fjords and have been interpreted as the contact between glacimarine/marine sediments and ice-proximal or post-retreat gravity flow deposits (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959683611425545">Boyd et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959683611425545">DaSilva et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959683611425545">Fernandez et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, the age of the formation of these terminal moraines is bracketed by the age of the beginning of marine sedimentation in Golfo Elefantes (~11.3±3.0 ka) and the age of the retreat of the eastern NPI glaciers into mountain valleys, assuming that glaciers in the western (wet) side of the NPI retreated into the present-day fjords at least as early as their eastern (dry side) counterparts (~12.8 ka; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959683611425545">Turner et al., 2005</xref>). If the terminal moraine systems of San Rafael and San Quintin glaciers were formed synchronously with those of Gualas Glacier, as suggested by their similar geometries and relative positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959683611425545">Heusser, 1960</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959683611425545">2002</xref>), the age of Tempanos I and II moraines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611425545">Figure 2</xref>) has been largely underestimated, and/or the few published radiocarbon ages have been misinterpreted. In either case, the possibility that the terminal moraines of these glaciers were originally formed in the Late Pleistocene–early Holocene and subsequently reoccupied during late-Holocene advances (e.g. some indication exists that San Quintin Glacier might have extended to its terminal moraine by the end of the nineteenth century; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0959683611425545">Winchester and Harrison, 1996</xref>) cannot be ruled out.</p>

<title>Implications for sediment discharge variations in the Holocene</title>
<p>Our data show that the millennial average sediment discharge of Gualas River during the interval ~11.3±3.0 to 4.2±0.3 ka was close to estimated modern values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0959683611425545">Figure 7</xref>). Sediment discharge increased several times during the late Holocene (~&lt;1.4–4.2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0959683611425545">Figure 7</xref>). The simplest explanation for increased sediment discharge during the late Holocene is the reworking of sediments from isolated sediment sinks (proglacial and subglacial) and/or increased glacier erosion by Gualas Glacier and, to minor degree, Reicher Glacier. Recent studies have shown that sediment production by erosion increase during retreat stages in the proximal basin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959683611425545">Koppes and Hallet, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959683611425545">2010</xref>). During advance stages the sediments of the proximal basin are likely to be eroded, affecting the record of the past sediment production. However, distal basins such as Golfo Elefantes are likely to record both advance and retreat stage sediment production. This implies that in a broad sense the late-Holocene increase in millennial average sediment discharge indicates an increase of the frequency and/or amplitude of advance and retreat events (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959683611425545">Fernandez et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The silty sands of seismic unit G4 record an important Holocene event in Golfo Elefantes. In the southern part of the basin, this unit conformably overlies early-Holocene sediments of unit G3. However, at the location of JPC14, seismic reflections of G4 onlap unit G3, implying a depositional hiatus (~&lt;3100 years; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683611425545">Figures 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683611425545">b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611425545">6</xref>). Variations in the sand content of G4 probably reflect variations in the relative proportion of sands supplied from the source. Most likely G4 is the result of the reworking of sediments from a proglacial sink, namely, the Gualas Glacier proglacial lake, and thus it records an increase in sediment production due to the advance of Gualas Glacier. Our estimates show that the sediment discharge for G4 (~40 kg/s) is several times higher than for underlying unit G3 (~7 kg/s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0959683611425545">Figure 7</xref>). Assuming that G4 was derived from a similar low sediment discharge (Qs) and low sand concentration as for unit G3, the volume of sand in Unit G4 (~1.7*10<sup>8</sup> kg) would require an unrealistic time span for deposition (~16.8 ka). Likewise, if we assume that the hiatus that separates G3 and G4 is negligible (i.e. G4 accumulated at ~ 1 mm/yr at the location of JPC14; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611425545">Figure 6</xref>), and that there was no variation in the relative percentage of sand delivered to the gulf, sediment discharge would have to have increased several times (&gt;38 kg/s) along with a significant increase in winnowing to produce the sandy sediments of G4. Although an increase in sediment discharge of this magnitude is possible, the grain size data do not indicate depletion, and therefore winnowing, of the fine fraction. Rather, the size distribution consists of two distinctive modes, one consisting of fine to very fine sand and the other consisting of a very fine silt and clay (Supplement 4, available online).</p>
<p>At the location of JPC14, Unit G4 was deposited at an estimated water depth of around 120–130 m, based on the accumulation rate and a conservative estimate of compaction of 10–30%. The core site is only 3 km from the steep slope of the innermost morainal arch of Gualas Glacier (~ 50 m water depth) (MS Gualas III; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611425545">Figure 2</xref>). Hence, either turbidity currents flowing off the arc or hyperpycnal flows emanating from the Gualas River could have delivered sandy sediments to this location. But unit G4 lacks the sedimentary structures and grain size grading indicative of turbidite deposition. Instead, unit G4 comprises three poorly sorted coarsening upward subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683611425545">Figure 5</xref>: SS4 a,b,c). Thus, sediment delivery by hyperpycnal flows is the most likely mechanism for the deposition of Unit G4.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959683611425545">Mulder and Syvitski (1995)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683611425545">Mulder et al. (2003)</xref>, hyperpycnal flows normally occur at sediment concentration higher than 36–43 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, but can occur at concentrations as low as 5 kg/m<sup>3</sup> if convective instability is considered. Using the BQART global model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959683611425545">Syvitski and Milliman, 2007</xref>) and an annual rainfall in the area of ~2000–3000 mm/yr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959683611425545">Aniya and Enomoto, 1986</xref>), we estimate that modern annual average sediment discharge (Qs) of Gualas River falls in the range Qs=4.4–6.8 kg/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0959683611425545">Figure 7</xref>), with an average particle concentration (Cs) in the range 0.2–0.4 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. Higher values of Qs and Cs (~11 kg/s and ~1 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively) are obtained if a 30% higher ice cover is introduced into the model (~72%; today ice cover is ~55%), so that the proglacial lakes that trap some of the sediments from Gualas and Reicher glaciers are covered by ice. Although the Cs values obtained from the QBART model for Gualas River are relatively low compared with other rivers that produce frequent hyperpycnal flows (10–40 kg/m<sup>3</sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959683611425545">Mulder and Syvitski, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683611425545">Mulder et al., 2003</xref>), hyperpycnal flows commonly form during periods of high discharge or flooding events when Qs and particle concentration increase.</p>
<p>A weather station at Puerto Aysen, ~140 km to the north of Golfo Elefantes, recorded maximum daily precipitation values of ~180 mm/day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959683611425545">Stappung, 2000</xref>). Based on these data, we estimate that maximum discharge of Gualas River during flooding events could reach up to 200–300 m<sup>3</sup>/s. As particle concentrations increase with water discharge, these estimates suggest that the threshold concentration for producing hyperpycnal flows could be reached during high precipitation events or during the peak of the melting season.</p>

<title>Implications for the Holocene climate of the west NPI area</title>
<p>Several authors have related modern fluctuations in glaciers on the west side of the Northern Patagonian Icefield (NPI) with precipitation trends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959683611425545">Harrison and Winchester, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959683611425545">Warren, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0959683611425545">Winchester and Harrison, 1996</xref>). Based on these studies, last century glacial advances and stillstands are related to high annual (primarily winter) precipitation whereas retreat periods are related to periods of low precipitation. If this relationship is valid for the Holocene, it implies that unit G3, which is associated with low sediment discharge, was deposited during a relatively dry early–middle Holocene (~&gt;1.4–4.2 ka) when Gualas Glacier was confined to relatively high altitudes. In this scenario, the coarser fractions delivered by glacial discharge would be trapped in Gualas’s (paleo) proglacial lakes. In contrast, our data suggest that units G4, G5 and G6 would have been deposited under relatively wet conditions that resulted in increased water discharge of Gualas River during the late Holocene (&lt;1.4–4.2 ka). The advance of Gualas Glacier during the initial period of increased precipitation would cause reworking of sediments from Gualas’s proglacial lakes producing an increase in the sand content of Gualas River sediments and the deposition of unit G4 between ~1.4 ka and 0.8 ka. Subsequently, an increase in glacier erosion and/or the release of sediments stored in the proglacial and subglacial environments produced an increase in the sediment discharge of Gualas River and the deposition of units G5 and G6.</p>
<p>The increase in long-term (millennial scale) precipitation is interpreted as the result of the intensification of the westerly winds in the area during the late Holocene (&lt;1.4–4.2 ka). This interpretation is consistent with humid conditions during the late Holocene (&lt;4–5 ka) in contrast to the relatively drier conditions that existed during the middle and early Holocene, documented further to the northwest of the Andes at ~41°S and ~34°S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959683611425545">Jenny et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683611425545">Lamy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959683611425545">Villa-Martinez et al., 2003</xref>). South of our study area, along the west side of the Patagonian Andes (~53°S), the opposite pattern has been documented; humid conditions during the early Holocene were followed by relatively drier conditions in the middle to late Holocene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959683611425545">Lamy et al., 2010</xref>). This emerging pattern of opposing trends in precipitation north (~41°S) and south (~53°S) of the study area, and the severe arid conditions at ~34°S during the early–middle Holocene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959683611425545">Villa-Martinez et al., 2003</xref>), suggest that the westerlies wind belt widened and/or its core shifted northward during the late Holocene.</p>
<p>In core JPC14, relatively high TOC content (~0.8–1.6%) and concentrations of plant and dark organic debris characterize the intervals 2–3 m b.s.f. (top of unit G5 and bottom of unit G6) and 7–8 m b.s.f. (bottom of unit G5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683611425545">Figure 5</xref>). These intervals record episodes of organic-rich sedimentation that were likely generated by reworking of deltaic sediments. Based on our age model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611425545">Figure 6</xref>), the average recurrence time of deposition of laminations is ~5–7 years for the top ~2 m of Unit G6 and within the interval 5–7 m b.s.f. of unit G5 in core JPC14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683611425545">Figure 5</xref>). An average recurrence time greater than 20 years is estimated for the rest of units G5 and G6. Thus, for units G5 and G6 a period of relatively frequent (interannual) deposition of laminations, which might indicate interannual discharge variability, followed an initial period of organic-rich deltaic sedimentation. For unit G5, the overall interval of interannual sedimentation (discharge) variability occurred during the interval ~790–490 cal. yr BP (<sc>ad</sc> 1160–1460). This interval correlates with a cold and moist period indicated by tree ring studies in northern Patagonia around <sc>ad</sc> 1270–1660 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959683611425545">Villalba, 1994</xref>), and with several glacier advances in the region that are believed to represent Neoglacial V (~900–500 <sup>14</sup>C yr BP or ~<sc>ad</sc> 1200–1460; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959683611425545">Aniya, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959683611425545">Koch and Kilian, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959683611425545">Röthlisberger, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959683611425545">Strelin et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar sedimentation patterns in the top 2–3 m of JPC14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683611425545">Figure 5</xref>) indicate that the period <sc>ad</sc> 1680–1750 was characterized by strong deltaic influence. This was followed by deposition of interannual laminations (interannual discharge variability) that lasted until <sc>ad</sc> 1890. This overall period (<sc>ad</sc> 1680–1890 or ~270–60 cal. yr BP) coincides with the advance of a number of Patagonian glaciers (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959683611425545">Araneda et al., 2007</xref>), and with the last Neoglacial (VI: seventeenth to nineteenth centuries <sc>ad</sc>) proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959683611425545">Mercer (1965</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959683611425545">1968</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959683611425545">1976)</xref> and widely correlated with the Northern Hemisphere LIA.</p>
<p>The discharge variability deduced from core JPC14 for the last ~790 yr suggest that a phenomena with a multiannual period, such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), affected the precipitation pattern of the area, likely because of its influence on the intensity of the westerly winds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959683611425545">Schneider and Gies, 2004</xref>). As discharge variability occurred when some glaciers in Patagonia advanced or were at stillstand positions, we hypothesize that increased ENSO frequency might have a positive impact on the mass balance of Patagonian glaciers. Further studies are necessary to test this hypothesis.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The sedimentary record of Golfo Elefantes, the marine depositional basin of Gualas Glacier, spans, with some hiatuses, at least the last ~11.3±3.0 ka. During this period the gulf remained free of ice, as indicated by the absence of proximal glacimarine sediment and till in the Holocene sedimentary sequence. This implies that the age of arcuate moraines that occur along the edges of Golfo Elefantes is bracketed between the age of the waning stage of the local LGM ~&lt;12.6 ka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959683611425545">Turner et al., 2005</xref>) and the beginning of glacimarine sedimentation in Golfo Elefantes at ~11.3±3 ka. Between ~11.3±3 ka and ~4.2±0.3–1.4 ka, fine-grained sediments deposited from low concentration density currents filled bathymetric lows. Millennial average sediment discharge of Gualas River at this time was low (7.1±4.0 kg/s), but similar to modern expected values (4.4–6.8 kg/s). Sediment discharge averaged over centennial timescales increased several times during the late Holocene (~&lt;1.4–4.2 ka). The simplest explanation for increased sediment discharge (36–40 kg/s) is reworking of sediments from isolated sediment sinks (proglacial and subglacial) and/or increased glacier erosion by Gualas Glacier and, to a lesser degree, Reicher Glacier. The high sediment discharge began with the accumulation of ~ 0.5 km<sup>3</sup> of sandy sediments in a relatively short time span (~670 yr; 1.4–0.8 ka) as result of the advance of Gualas Glacier over its proglacial lake and reworking of sediments stored there. The increase in Gualas River discharge during the late Holocene is interpreted as having been caused by an increase in long-term (centennial–millennial scale) precipitation. This increase in precipitation most likely results from the intensification of the westerly winds in the area during the late Holocene (&lt;1.4–4.2 ka), suggesting a widening of the westerlies wind belt and/or a northward shift of its core at this time.</p>
<p>Two recent periods of interannual sedimentation variability are characterized by abundant laminations with average recurrence time ~5–7 years. The first occurred during the interval ~790–490 cal. yr BP (<sc>ad</sc> 1160–1460) and the second occurred during the interval ~270–60 cal. yr BP (<sc>ad</sc> 1680–1890). The associated interannual discharge variability suggests that a phenomenon with a multiannual period, such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), affected the precipitation pattern of the area. Furthermore, these periods coincide with the two last Neoglacial periods in southern Patagonia (Neoglacial V and the LIA). We hypothesize that increased ENSO frequency might have a positive impact on the mass balance of Patagonian glaciers.</p>
