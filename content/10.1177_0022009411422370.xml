<abstract>
<p>This article explains two paradoxes: Firstly, why did counterrevolutionary Hungary decide to participate in Expo ’58, at a time of great economic stringency and grave political problems? Secondly, it is pointed out that the Hungarian pavilion, if it was to be raised at all, would have been expected to be thoroughly soaked in projections affirming the state-socialist identity of the country and its people. From plans to implementation, however, the pavilion was all but up to such expectations. It had, both in terms of its architecture and in terms of its exhibitions, a distinctly modernist complexion and a universalistic-ecumenistic appeal. On the basis of archival sources related to the politicians, administrators and artists-professionals involved in creating the show, this article explains this transsystemic appeal of the pavilion as a manifestation of the emerging kádárist consolidation and its political and social order.</p>

<body>
<p>At first sight, Hungary’s presence at Expo ’58 strikes one as surprising.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022009411422370">1</xref></sup> After all, this was a country where the ruling Communists had just been through the traumatic experience of an anti-Stalinist revolutionary uprising and, not less importantly, this was a country where Communist rulers were still traumatizing society by subjecting it to counterrevolutionary (red) terror. <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022009411422370">2</xref></sup> This is not exactly what one would expect from a regime determined to set up a national pavilion at a world exhibition, the overall agenda of which was ‘to give an account of the world, for a more human world’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022009411422370">3</xref></sup> Thus, the first paradox that strikes one in connection with Hungary’s presence at Expo ’58 is that most of what we know about the country and its ruling elites’ situation in 1957–8 should rather have kept them away from Brussels. Considering also the lamentable economic situation of the country in the first three to four post-revolutionary years, one cannot help being curious about how it came that Hungarian Communist leaders deemed it not only possible and affordable, but also desirable, to secure the country’s presence at Expo ’58.</p>
<p>The short answer to this question is legitimacy. In 1958, the rule of the Kádár regime was not accepted as legitimate at home because it had established itself by means of violent foreign military intervention. It had been seen as a puppet regime installed to perpetuate Moscow’s hegemony and it had sustained its power by way of terror including murders, arbitrary imprisonments, intimidation and lies. Partly for the same reasons, the ‘Revolutionary Workers’ and Peasants’ Government’ was hardly presentable abroad either. Internationally, in 1958, Kádár’s Hungary was an isolated pariah state to which no one but the countries of the Warsaw Pact and China talked (plus a few left-oriented, new post-colonial regimes of the ‘Third World’). This deficit of internal as well as external legitimacy was both reflected and reinforced by the continued, massive Soviet military presence in the country, by the emigration of almost a quarter of a million Hungarians to the West, and by the persistence, through almost six years, of the ‘Hungarian question’ on the agenda of the United Nations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022009411422370">4</xref></sup> In a nutshell, then, it was this legitimacy deficit that made an official Hungarian pavilion in Brussels desirable for the Kádárist regime.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022009411422370">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Its origins explain the regime’s initial heavy dependence on, and exposure to, the political tendencies prevalent in the ‘international communist movement’. Accordingly, the political profile and ideological orientation of the Kádár leadership was to a great extent at the mercy of the varying degree of success achieved by the Khrushchevian ‘New Course’ in its struggle with conservative Stalinist positions in Moscow as well as in the ‘socialist camp’ as a whole. In the last years of the 1950s, until 1961, much was in flux in this respect. The year of 1958, in particular, seems to have been a bad one even for moderate communist reformers – internationally, there was a new anti-revisionist campaign (with the renewed rift with Yugoslavia in its background), while in Hungary, the secret process against ‘Imre Nagy and accomplices’ during the Spring leading to the executions of 16 June 1958, make this quite evident.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022009411422370">6</xref></sup> For much of 1958 it was also still too early to be sure that Rákosi and the other prominent Stalinist leaders ruling Hungary until the autumn of 1956 could not make a comeback and would no longer play any significant role in the country’s political life.</p>
<p>This gives rise to our second paradox relating to Hungary’s presence in Brussels: under the circumstances outlined above, the expectation should rightly have been that the Hungarian pavilion, if it was to be raised at all, would have had to be thoroughly red – soaked in projections affirming the systemic (state-socialist) identity of the country and its people. Instead of the ‘abstract and soft bourgeois humanism’ of the Expo organizers, it should have showed the exhibitor’s systemic exceptionalism in terms of its ‘class-militant, socialist humanism’. Throughout, from planning to implementation, however, the Hungarian pavilion was all but up to such expectations. The rest of this article will attempt to explain this second paradox relating to the way in which Hungary staged itself at Expo ’58.</p>
<p>Top level decisions to participate in the 1958 world’s fair were taken as early as 28 June 1955 and January 1956.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022009411422370">7</xref></sup> Preparations had made some progress before they came to a complete halt due to the turmoil in the autumn and winter months of 1956. Lajos Gádoros, the architect designing the pavilion mentioned in an early article of his that the political decision to participate had been reconfirmed by the Council of Ministers in January 1957.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022009411422370">8</xref></sup> They had scarcely more than a year to turn the very early superficial sketches into a pavilion with a complete exhibition in it.</p>
<p>The architects, designers, artists, builders and exhibitors were not only in a hurry, and they did not only need to adjust to considerable changes while the work with the design and construction was underway,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022009411422370">9</xref></sup> but, unlike their Soviet or Czechoslovak comrades, they also operated within a low budget with rigorously asserted constraints.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022009411422370">10</xref></sup> To avert any possible negative consequences for the country’s vulnerable balance of international payments, the 1957 decision reconfirming participation included the proviso and objective that incomes from retail sales, the restaurant(s) and the <italic>konditorei</italic> should cover all the costs incurred by the Hungarians in hard currency.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0022009411422370">11</xref></sup> No other country (socialist or otherwise) was known to have had any similar objective and, indeed, the expo organizers emphasized the non-commercial character of the fair.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0022009411422370">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Iván Boldizsár (1912–88) was a polyglot, talented essayist, sociographer, poet and writer, with a history on the left wing of the interwar sociographers’ movement. After 1948 he followed the zigzags characteristic for many of the leftist professionals and intellectuals during the communist era.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0022009411422370">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>At the time he was contacted by the General Secretary of the Hungarian Chamber of Commerce, Iván Boldizsár had been spent weeks being interrogated in <italic>Főutca</italic> (Main Street) by the Department of Investigations of the Main Division of Political Police of the Ministry of Interior. Repeatedly he had to give accounts of his activities in October and November of 1956, particularly about his contacts with Imre Nagy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0022009411422370">14</xref></sup> Rather than an invitation to write the script for the Hungarian exhibition in Brussels, so Boldizsár remembered in 1982, he had expected (and feared) to get caught up in the processes that brought death penalties for some and long prison terms for many of the rebellious intellectuals who had sided with Imre Nagy and with the revolution. But at the Chamber of Commerce he was asked to undertake the job of writing the script for the Hungarian pavilion in Brussels. He was given the freedom to write and design the exhibition as he pleased. When he expressed his disbelief about his freedoms, he was told ‘Don’t be silly. <italic>It is no longer Rákosi’s Hungary you have to put on show</italic>.’ Boldizsár was reassured by his hosts that he did not need to be concerned: (1) about the world’s fair being a commercial event, which it was not; (2) about possible expectations that he should lie (‘You should write what you think is right’); (3) about others tampering with his script (they promised that they would either accept his script as a whole or reject it and go to someone else to have another one written); (4) that they would want him to include in the plan the display of portraits of the country’s leader(s) – to which they responded: ‘None of those. On the contrary, we’d ask you not to include the portrait of any leader.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0022009411422370">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The only source reporting this negotiation is Boldizsár’s own recollections published in 1982, which does not really enhance the credibility of the story. Yet, what it tells does not sound entirely implausible: many professionals, intellectuals, artists and, indeed, quite a few of the members of the party-state’s apparatus class – appalled, upset and/or intimidated as they may have been by the ongoing counterrevolutionary terror – did entertain hopes and certainly did wish that the emerging Kádár-regime should place at least as much (and preferably more) emphasis upon its break with the practices of the Rákosi era as it placed on crushing the (anti-Stalinist) alternative represented by Imre Nagy. The new rulers, on the other hand, themselves saw it as vitally important to distance themselves from Rákosi’s regime, its practices, methods and policies. They did so partly because the malfunctioning and demise of Rákosi’s Stalinist regime had convinced many (if not all) of them that a new style of governance and substantial reforms were necessary if socialism was to survive, and partly because to a great extent they built their claim to power on the assertion that they were the only legitimate – because genuinely socialist – <italic>alternative</italic> to Stalinism. Also, Kádár had good reasons to worry about the pretenders to his power from the conservative left, even though he seemed in 1957–8 to focus one-sidedly on the elimination of the only tendency whose mere existence could challenge his anti-Stalinist credentials. Therefore, Kádár’s emerging regime could unleash a bloody <italic>chistka</italic> on those who gave overall priority to the objective of breaking with Stalinism and, at the same time, make symbolic gestures stretching beyond what could be seen as the limits of systemic correctness in order to signal and emphasize that ‘<italic>this was no longer Rákosi’s Hungary</italic>’. To a great extent, then, this latter tendency is what the Hungarian pavilion and the script, along the lines of which the whole exhibition was arranged, was about.</p>
<p>The script of the Hungarian exhibition was accepted by the Government Commission on 22 May 1957.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0022009411422370">16</xref></sup> Belying the fears of Boldizsár, the modifications asked for and put through were rather minimal.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0022009411422370">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Boldizsár proposed to organize the pavilion and its exhibitions around a narrative which was to be propelled by the question ‘What does a small people give to the big world?’ The answers were then to be articulated along a dual structure to be asserted in each unit. The ‘what we gave’ would be shown in conjunction with a discussion of ‘this is how they [the outside world] see us’; the ‘what we are giving’ was to go hand in hand with projections of ‘this is what we are like’; while the ‘what we are going to give’ was to be made tangible through a presentation of the ‘world-wide diffusion and impact of products of Hungarian work, ingenuity-spirituality [<italic>szellem</italic>], production, art, literature, music, etc’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0022009411422370">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>As to style and form of expression, the script emphasized the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>The Hungarian pavilion is situated between the pavilions of the Soviet Union and the USA. Obviously, at a site like this one cannot use superlatives, nor can one strive after monumentality. We will, therefore, both in the script and in the implementation try to establish an easy, humorous style. Our expression is direct, we will talk to the visitors in a personal tone. We are creating an intimate ambience and, at the same time, we’ll foreground those areas in which we really are ranking first or among the best. This style has a double role. On the one hand it will appeal to the visitor and, we hope, will provide her with pleasant memories. On the other hand, it will indirectly counteract the [image created by the] general propaganda according to which life in the socialist countries is dreary and humourless [<italic>száraz, humortalan</italic>].<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0022009411422370">19</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>A crucially important nuance in the discourse of the script (and the pavilion) is manifest in this passage: The (Western) image of a joyless life under socialism is used as an argument (to the script-writer’s colleagues, the exhibitors) to promote the idea of a style and approach freed from the usual propagandistic bragging, the bombastic assertions (and counter-assertions) of systemic superiority. The script <italic>does not</italic> suggest to make a claim according to which ‘life is joyful <italic>because</italic> of socialism’ – rather it suggests to put forward the claim (to project an image about Hungary showing) that, even under socialism, Hungary and the Hungarians are partaking in the achievements and joys of the modern world. If anything particular with regard to style and form was emphasized by Boldizsár, it was that ‘Hungarian taste [<italic>magyar ízlés</italic>] is one of the omnipresent protagonists of this exhibition’, to bring home among the visitors not the systemic (nor the national) exceptionalism, but the suggestion that Hungary had been part of the modern ecumene.</p>
<p>Boldizsár explicitly stressed also the necessity to avoid the use of the typical exhibition techniques of the Stalinist era. There should be relatively few well-chosen exhibits (photos, artefacts, works of art) and they should be allowed ‘to speak for themselves’ as much as possible: no paintings, photos, statues of wise leaders bringing us to the future, no ‘didactical’ diagrams, no curves pointing upwards into the sky, no statistics and no attempts at ‘showing everything’. ‘Unimposing’, ‘low-key’, ‘selective’ and ‘tasteful’ were the norms consistently to be observed. ‘It should rather be less, but memorable.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0022009411422370">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>These norms and principles of the script were not only confirmed but emphatically reinforced by the architect of the Hungarian pavilion, Lajos Gádoros.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0022009411422370">21</xref></sup> In his ‘Guiding principles for the interior design for the Hungarian pavilion at the Brussels World’s Fair’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0022009411422370">22</xref></sup> Gádoros demanded: (1) coherence in theme and spirituality (the whole exhibition and each part of it should represent the <italic>country of Hungary</italic>, and not a particular field of social or economic life per se); (2) efforts to maintain high aesthetic quality and frugality in the use of space and surfaces; (3) the pavilion should be unconditionally respected as a given, both in terms of its outer appearance and in terms of the internal spatial structures the building creates; (4) just as much as the pavilion distinguishes itself from the neighbouring Soviet and US pavilions, both in its dimensions and in constituting an open structure and an unimposing mass, so should even the interior design of the various sections strive for easy, airy, quickly comprehensible and accessible forms and solutions. Gádoros stressed the need for a shared artistic understanding, for a ‘common denominator’ when it comes to choice of materials and colours in the various sections. Gádoros’s guide does not mention <italic>socialism</italic> at all – it states unequivocally in the opening sentences that the pavilion should represent <italic>Hungary</italic> for its visitors:
<disp-quote>
<p>Hungary is to be understood as the <italic>magyar</italic> land with all the typical beauties and natural riches of its landscapes, with a style of life, with national peculiarities, with the historical past and present, with economic and cultural achievements. In one word it is everything that is to be found within its boundaries and that, for a foreigner, might mean a country and its people.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0022009411422370">23</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The guide reaffirmed forcefully the script’s principle to avoid the use of ‘didactic means’ (diagrams, charts and other ‘demonstrations’ or direct presentations of statistics): ‘The ideal solution would be to tell the visitors everything we want to tell by the artistically installed exhibits themselves’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0022009411422370">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>An aesthetic analysis of Hungary’s pavilion and exhibition is well beyond the scope of this article and the competence of the author.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0022009411422370">25</xref></sup> What should be emphasized within the context of this discussion is the modernist complexion and universalistic-ecumenical appeal that the Hungarian pavilion had, both in terms of its architecture and in terms of its exhibitions. True to Boldizsár’s script and Gádoros’s guide, this was a spectacle whereby Hungary could claim the attention of others by virtue of her being an organic part of the modern world, contributing to it, sharing it, enjoying it and mastering its language and its communication codes at the level of high proficiency.</p>
<p>As with a number of other modernist pavilions at the expo, the Hungarian was a light and transparent structure. It housed the exhibitions in three two-level units. Both the entrance hall (A), and the art exhibiton (C) featured elevated roofs resting on glass walls to secure ample natural lighting from above during day time. Even in the case of hall ‘B’, where the economic, and technological exhibitions (including the exhibition of ‘everyday life in Budapest’ sharing space with the exhibits of light industries) were located, the generous use of glass enabled visitors to get a glimpse of the exhibits from the park outside. Glass, steel structures and veneers made of aluminium and ceramics dominated the building. Where other materials came to the fore (as in the case of the <italic>konditorei</italic>, the restaurant, and a tent-like souvenir shop), it was due to shortages of building materials and/or money. Of 200 participating pavilions, Hungary’s was among the 33 which received the Golden Star prize awarded by an international jury.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0022009411422370">26</xref></sup>

Right: the Hungarian–Bulgarian complex from above.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0022009411422370-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Not one piece of ‘socialist realism’ can be identified among the works of art exhibited in the halls and outside the Hungarian pavilion either. New works included from contemporary artists stood for a stylistic orientation characteristic for the era of Thaw and pointing towards the ‘postimpressionism’ of the 1960s. But a significant number of the exhibits were from artists of the past. Three of Tivadar Kosztka Csontváry’s (1853–1919) large canvases dominated the art exhibition in hall ‘C’. Csontváry was a major (re-) ‘discovery’of the New Course era, and a true discovery even for the organizers of the Expo’s ambitious ‘state-of-the (modern)-art’ exhibition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0022009411422370">27</xref></sup> Together with one of József Egry’s (1883–1951) highly intense Balaton landscapes, here was the excellent (leftist) interwar expressionist painter, Gyula Derkovits’s (1894–1934) work too – his <italic>Stilleben with fish</italic> from 1928.

<p>Assessing the art exhibits in the various national pavilions, the 15 member international jury awarded a golden medal to the Budapest Museum of Fine Arts for having selected Csontváry’s works. <italic>Diploms d’honneur </italic>were awarded to Endre Domanovszky for his fresco made for the agricultural section of the exhibition, and to György Kádár and Mária Túry for their fresco on everyday life in Budapest. A gold medal was also awarded to Aurél Bernáth for his fresco placed on one of the outside walls of the pavilion. But the <italic>Grand Prix</italic> went to József Somogyi and Jenő Kerényi’s dynamic statue group (‘Dancers’) greeting the visitors of the Hungarian pavilion in the entrance (A) hall. Indeed, this work was the only significant piece of art that found a local (Belgian) <italic>Maecenas</italic>: the communal authority of the city of Namur (or Nameur – since 1986, the capital of Wallonia) bought it and set it up in a central area of the city.</p>
<p>The keen effort to reach out and beyond the systemic divide by foregrounding and emphasizing what is common and shared in the modern human world was particularly pronounced in the ways the script suggested (and the exhibition itself attempted) to confront traditional images of Hungary, the country of the <italic>puszta</italic>, of paprika, or soccer.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0022009411422370">28</xref></sup> Each image would be met with counterpoints such as the ‘country of industry’, the ‘country of major innovations’, the ‘country of engineers’, the ‘country of learning, science, and high culture’. The section on ‘Hungary’s Ambassadors in the World at Large’ was to emphasize that Hungary was not merely a place where economic, cultural, social modernity had come home, but was also to be represented as the very source from where the blessings of modern life reached such places as Egypt (Hungarian motorbikes under the pyramids), Syria (Hungarian tug boats), China (<italic>Ikarusz</italic> buses in Beijing), or Tibet (Hungarian <italic>Csepel </italic>trucks). Even Hungarian tulips were claimed to have reached as far (and as competitive places) as the Netherlands’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0022009411422370">29</xref></sup> The cultural section (unit ‘C’ of the pavilion) showing the country’s achievements in arts (the largest component), literature, music and theatre, reinforced the modern ecumenism of the script, particularly by the sub-section ‘The greater world in Hungary’, showing a country eager to appropriate the values of other peoples’ cultures through publishing and staging in Hungarian theatres translated works of foreign classics and contemporary authors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0022009411422370">30</xref></sup>

<p>As the exhibits were decided upon and brought together in Budapest, and as the pavilion and exhibitions started taking shape in Brussels, the sober but unquestionably modernist profile of the project and its ecumenist outreach began to dawn upon the various authorities involved in the political and ideological supervision of the work. It would have been a miracle if Boldizsár and Gádoros’s project had passed them by without evoking anxieties (and reactions) over its failure to reaffirm the country’s systemic identity.</p>
<p>Hungary’s <italic>charge d’affairs</italic> in Brussels, László Kazimír, did not quite know, to begin with, whether he should be happy or apprehensive about what he saw. To be on the safe side, on the one hand, he started with a gesture of distance towards what was emerging: ‘The style and internal structure of our pavilion will be as it will be because of the decisions of our domestic, relevant authorities. With regard to these, I do not wish to make any particular comments, after all these have been decided upon by competent people at home’. He emphasized that all the legation could do was to control politically the implementation of what had been decided in Budapest. With regard to this task, he gave vent to his frustration over the fact that ‘professional and political issues get extremely mixed’. On the other hand, he proudly reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Budapest that he could:
<disp-quote><p>safely claim that we won’t be inferior to the other countries. In terms of its architecture, our pavilion will be more beautiful than the Czechoslovaks’, even though the latter cost much more money; it will be more interesting than the Dutch pavilion, which is quite simple but [built] similarly [to ours] in a modern style; and it follows a much more sober design than the French, who try to bring together their pavilion on the basis of a fantasy [egészen fantasztikus ötlet alapján].<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0022009411422370">31</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>It did take some time before Kazimír’s well-concealed apprehension proved to have been, to some extent, well-founded. At the 4 February 1958 meeting of the Political Bureau (PB) of the HSWP, it became manifest that cultural policies were a field within which contestation between conservative communist and liberal (or, at least, more tolerant) positions had been far from over.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0022009411422370">32</xref></sup> There was an early ‘pre-fair’ exhibition of the materials belonging to some of the sections of the future pavilion arranged in Budapest, in late 1957 and early 1958. These were visited by top political leaders too, so that they were not entirely dependent on the interim report of the Government Commission on their agenda. Central Committee Secretary (and, just a short week before, still Minister of Culture), Gyula Kállai went out hard against the ‘aesthetic defeatism’ of the Brussels project. He objected to what he had seen as ‘compromises in matters of principle’. His impression was that ‘those who designed the exhibition [<italic>a kiállítás rendezői</italic>] had wished to secure proper success by way of making, to some extent, concessions to Western taste’. He was particularly put off by what had been going on in the arts section where, as he saw it, ‘realist-communist’ artists had been discriminated against when orders were placed for the fair. Instead, the orders went to ‘artists bent on abstraction [sic]’, and works ‘included in the exhibition were of a character, quite in accordance with the original plan, that had made concessions to Western, formalist [!] tendencies’. Kállai ranted:
<disp-quote><p>we cannot and we should not either compete with the West in abstractions! We can only count upon success if we take with us there artistic works that are in accordance with our world view, with our social order, i.e., if we show primarily realist, socialist art. Even at the world’s fair in Paris the abstraction was rampaging [sic] and, yet, the first prize was won by the sickle-and-hammer.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0022009411422370">33</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p> Kállai noticed the same infestation had hit the section of light industries too. He said, he had seen that the jury excluded certain objects from the exhibition because, according to Kállai’s rendering,
<disp-quote><p>those ‘formalist things’ would not be competitive with the West. But they excluded them only because of this [i.e., because they are not competitive]. We should rather confront the outlook. We should try and achieve results not by making serious concessions to Western taste, but by trying to develop [kialakítani] all those efforts in industry and arts that are appropriate for our own ideas.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Failing to spell out just what those ‘own ideas’, not to speak of the industry and arts appropriate for them, were, he then concluded by warning against an all too frequent and detailed coverage of the Expo in Hungarian media, which might lead to an ‘admiration of the West’, and suggested carefully planned propaganda activities related to Brussels in order to secure a <italic>critical</italic> reception.</p>
<p>Kállai’s criticism was not received with uniform enthusiasm among the members of the Political Bureau. Perhaps they were a bit perplexed to hear those objections from someone who was, at the time, the highest party official in the field of ideological matters and who, even in the Government, as the Minister of Culture (from 9 May 1957 until 28 January 1958), carried a great deal of responsibility for all the failures he so vehemently attacked. Central Committee Secretary Jenő Fock had no wish to conceal his own disappointment:
<disp-quote>
<p>This job has occupied people for the whole [last] year, and [is the suggestion here that] we should now resolve that we no longer find them reliable? … The departments of Agit-Prop and Science and Culture [of the Central Committee] should have attended to these matters up till now, and so should the Ministry of Culture – instead of realizing only at one-minute-to-twelve [az utolsó percben] why socialist realism does not assert itself. By now, in most of these cases we are unable to introduce changes to solve the problems. Such a decision [to change] would be wrong.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0022009411422370">34</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Károly Kiss, Ferenc Münnich and even Dezső Nemes had a pragmatic approach and warned that a sweater with socialist-realist design might not be as easily marketable in the West as some might expect – if Hungary wanted to earn hard currency, she could neither ignore nor go programmatically against ‘Western taste’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0022009411422370">35</xref></sup> Also, by the time the Political Bureau met, not only had all the major decisions been taken and orders made, but most of the exhibits (including new artwork) had already been produced and delivered too. The project had reached a level of momentum and inertia where any substantial modifications appeared both costly and inadvisable. This is what CC Secretary Fock alluded to. Deputy minister of culture, György Aczél, who was present at this meeting because he headed the culture and arts preparatory committee, also urged the Political Bureau, with regard to the short time at disposal, to eliminate (rather than further increase) uncertainties. Then, he added, ‘nothing can be done about the artistic objects to be installed in the pavilion as they have already been ordered.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0022009411422370">36</xref></sup> 
<disp-quote>
<p>Early at the meeting, László Orbán, the head of the CC’s department of science and culture, tried to forego Kállai’s criticism by pointing out the following: The Ministry of Culture got involved in this rather late, and we have missed the train in a number of respects. This created a rather difficult situation: e.g., when the various plans were presented to the Council of Fine Arts, it turned out that no communist artists had received any commission … In this the Chamber of Commerce committed some serious mistakes as they decided and arranged things entirely on their own, and the Ministry, having been brought into the picture only rather late, could only amend but a very few things.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0022009411422370">37</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>To some extent and in some ways, what Orbán says here may have been correct in that it was the Chamber of Commerce that had been the actual culprit in the drama. However, the idea that the Chamber went knowingly against the Party’s policies requires quite an amount of believing. On the contrary, I think the Chamber allowed things to take the course they took, because they had good reasons to believe that the higher party leadership would have no objections to it. What happened, however, was that the Communist political mainstream had shifted quite considerably leftwards since about the autumn of 1957. The ousting of Molotov, Kaganovich and Malenkov from the Soviet top-leadership in late June 1957 may have had a moderating effect upon the ‘natural radicalism’ of the Hungarian counter-revolutionary regime. But the renewed rift between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union took a new turn in November, and it gave rise to an open and massive crusade against ‘revisionism, the main threat’, under the conditions of which Stalinist sentiments thrived, if only temporarily, again. That is the distinct impression readers might get from the angry words of Gyula Kállai as they are captured in the records of the Political Bureau minutes. Eventually, however, even György Marosán, at the time second in the party hierarchy right after Kádár, a former social democratic leader who cannot have treasured much of the social democratic legacy except for their ouvrierism, resigned to and accepted what seemed irreversible – an exhibition along the lines of ‘that Boldizsár who should not be allowed to define what had happened in this country during the last 13 years’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0022009411422370">38</xref></sup> He suggested that Aczél and Kállai should look at Boldizsár’s script to ascertain whether it properly treated the achievements of the country’s last 13 years of history. He was also of the opinion that the Hungarian exhibition should show that ‘the city has been restored after the counter-revolution, and that the people are joyous and they live better and they have better clothes than ever’. Having said this, he lifted a finger of warning and said ‘We should be very careful with propaganda. It should be solid, it should rely on facts, and it should be indisputable.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0022009411422370">39</xref></sup> With this good advice in mind, the Political Bureau resolved in general that ‘At international exhibitions, we should not compete with Western taste [<italic>a nyugati ízléssel</italic>]. Success can only be achieved by realist works corresponding with our world view’. As for the Brussels pavilion, they resolved that ‘during the time still at our disposal, such works of art and industry should be brought together for display as would in their character reflect the development of the last 13 years’. They also decided to instruct the Ministry of Foreign Trade and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to investigate the possibility of ‘showing, in the course of the world’s fair, an increased number of Hungarian films reflecting our life today’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0022009411422370">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>This conspicuous obsession with ‘the achievements of the last 13 years’ was a manifestation of the fear that the representation of Hungary in Brussels would fail to bring it home to the (mostly Western) visitors that Hungary was a socialist country and that its achievements were the achievements of a society under Communist rule and a socialist social order. Yet, at that particular historical juncture, even the very top of the Communist elite showed signs of uncertainty as to where to draw the chronological line beyond which they did not wish to identify with the country’s history. Marosán, for example, talked most of the time about 12 or 13 years, which would imply a claim of ownership over and identification with the whole post-1945 era, including the years under Rákosi. But at one point, he emphatically said, ‘The exhibition [in Brussels] should reflect the fruits of our work of thirteen months,’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0022009411422370">41</xref></sup> which privileged the period after the crushing of the revolution and, just as importantly, disowned the Rákosi era. Indeed, under Communist regimes with a history, even systemic identity may constitute a matter with complications.</p>
<p>The Political Bureau’s discussion and resolution did of course impress the Government Commission in Budapest as well as the Government Commissioner<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0022009411422370">42</xref></sup> in Brussels. Some gestures were improvised to show goodwill, if not to change the overall landscape: Lajos Gádoros, the chief architect of the pavilion, who transferred to Brussels already in 1957 to coordinate and control the construction work as well as the installations, was instructed on 26 March by the Government Commission to set up, ‘somewhere in the foreground of the exhibition’ József Somogyi’s statue, the<italic> Smelter</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0022009411422370">43</xref></sup> This statue from 1953 was a realist work, no doubt, but it was an early product of Hungary’s cultural New Course (post-Stalinian thaw), wherewith the effort to achieve authenticity and freedom from the obligatory idealizations of <italic>szocreál</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0022009411422370">44</xref></sup> was much more important and significant than the theme itself. Of course, such fine nuances may have easily been lost on people like Gyula Kállai.</p>
<p>As the draft report I have consulted reveals, what Baczoni wrote in the version he sent off to the Political Bureau was that ‘We [the Government Commission] wish to place in the foreground of the exhibition [<italic>a kiállítás előterébe kívánjuk helyezni</italic>] a successful statue of the artist Somogyi [<italic>Somogyi művész egy sikerült szobrát</italic>], representing a smelter’. But the draft also contains an earlier formula (struck out) in which it is stated ‘Comrade Gádoros was instructed [<italic>utasítást kapott</italic>] on 26 March [the same day when the report was conceived] to solve the placement of the statue ‘Smelter’’. The interesting point with the draft report is that ‘<italic>a kiállítás előtere</italic>’ may very well have meant the vestibule (or entrance hall) of the exhibition situated in the tower-like, highest unit (section ‘A’) of the pavilion. We know that the ‘Smelter’ ended up outside the pavilion, quite a way off the entrance hall, tucked away under the trees of the grove between Hungary’s and the Arab republics’ pavilions.</p>
<p>But it is not at all certain that this was what the Government Commission wanted Gádoros to do. The idea could very well have been to place the statue <italic>inside</italic> the entrance hall, room ‘A’, and, in that case, quite probably, if not to replace, certainly to counteract Jenő Kerényi and József Somogyi’s 4 metre, two-figure statue composition, <italic>The Dancers</italic> (two dancing female nudes mounted on a white, bow-like surface). For this work (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0022009411422370">Figure 5</xref>) had caused some headache about which Baczoni wrote as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>There are also problems with the Somogyi-Kerényi statue, a pair of dancing figures, to be installed in the entrance hall. The jury considered it to be appropriate, but [when they arrived] at the place, some concerns were raised. The hardship appears to be possible to resolve with some means of artistic decoration. Besides, we wish to place in the foreground [<italic>előtér</italic>] of the exhibition a successful statue of the artist Somogyi representing a smelter.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>But Gádoros, determined as he appears to have been to keep the project to the original script and design, must have seen to it that those ‘concerns’ about the dancers were stilled without any drastic measures of ‘artistic decoration’ and without forcing the dancers to share their room with the smelter.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0022009411422370">45</xref></sup> In fact, the dancers proved to be a highly popular feature of the Hungarian pavilion, they won a Grand Prix, they were bought by the Belgians after the conclusion of the expo, and they are still part of the public art enjoyed by citizens and visitors of the city of Namur.</p>
<p>For those who set the ‘sickle-and-hammer’ as the standard of good art it must have been pleasing to read in Baczoni’s report that, thanks to their intervention, visitors to the Hungarian pavilion were now to be greeted by the statue of an <italic>industrial worker.</italic> They can also have found it pleasing to know that the fresco, with the theme ‘life in Budapest’, on the walls of the room of light industry (section ‘B’ in the pavilion) would be made less visible ‘by way of resorting to proper exhibition technique’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0022009411422370">46</xref></sup> The head of the government commission emphasized that the fresco, painted on aluminium panels by György Kádár and Mária Túry, had been assessed and accepted by a competent jury. Nevertheless, it was later found out that ‘This decoration [sic] has not been successful, it is not a work of realism [!] and it is not at a high enough artistic niveau.’ They even thought of removing the fresco from the exhibition, but then realized, Baczoni reported, that a considerable part of it would be anyway covered by the objects and sizeable photos to be exhibited along the wall.
<fig id="fig6-0022009411422370" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>József Somogyi’s <italic>Smelter</italic> (1953) in the park outside the entrance hall, shot from the only angle which granted it some prominence.

<p>Therefore, the committee opted to allow the fresco to stay put, asking the artist, György Kádár, ‘to apply improvements according to the artistic advice rendered’, and hoped that the exhibits would cover most of it up. The fresco yielded a distinction to the artists, in the form of a diploma, and, according to what one can see on photos and newsreels of the time, it was not made invisible either. Moreover, a number of the photos put on display emphasized rather than weakened the modernist identity of the pavilion – among them the photo of the headquarters of the Hungarian Construction Workers’ Trade Union (1948-50), ‘this emblematic piece of the Hungarian architectural modern’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0022009411422370">47</xref></sup>

<p>Hungary’s national day at the fair took place on 2 May with the presence of a government delegation including the Minister of Light Industry Józsefné Nagy, a deputy minister of domestic trade, Sándor Sebes, and György Aczél, deputy minister of culture. In their report on the Hungarian pavilion and exhibition, no trace of the systemic angst of the previous two to three months can be detected. On the contrary, the time for hubris seemed to have come. The ministers proudly reported to the government that ‘The Hungarian pavilion, built in accordance with the drawings of Lajos Gádoros, is ranked, from the point of view of architecture, among the five best pavilions at the world’s fair by the experts’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0022009411422370">48</xref></sup> The report’s findings contradicted with a surprising consistency, item by item, previous accusations and objections. The ministers claimed early on in the report that the script of the exhibition and the interior design of the pavilion proved to have been correct: ‘According to general opinion, our pavilion is one of the most successful, from the point of view of culture [<italic>kulturáltság</italic>], good taste, and contents, which is confirmed by numerous entries in the guest book and by the reception in the foreign press’. They reassured their superiors that the ‘decorative fresco’ of György Kádár, the artistic value of which had been contested, had ‘a good impact’ at the exhibition. They stressed in general that ‘the works of art on display in the section for fine arts constitute a worthy representation of Hungarian art’ and, in particular, that the Somogyi-Kerényi statue in the entrance hall was a great success. They also added that the unusual, innovative aluminium frescos (the works of Kádár and Tury, and Endre Domanovszky) provoked a great deal of interest and acknowledgment.</p>
<p>The ministers’ report was no doubt a reaction (indeed, a triumphant response) to the criticism that the Brussels project had been exposed to at the Political Bureau’s meeting in February. Interestingly, this was also noticed at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs where the tendency at the time was increasingly to act as political and ideological watchdogs over the Brussels project. Their critical comments on the report focused mostly on problems of organization, but they seem to have sensed an opportunity, thanks to the February discussion and resolutions of the Political Bureau, to demonstrate their vigilance and awareness of systemic failures:
<disp-quote>
<p>The success of the Hungarian pavilion has made it impossible for our enemies to talk pejoratively about it, instead they explain the results by ‘the talents of the Hungarian people’, as if our system [<italic>rendszer</italic>] had nothing to do with it. This propaganda is assisted by the fact that we are all too ‘cautious’ in informing about our achievements since the liberation [1945]. We have all too few charts to demonstrate the results of our industrialization, when it comes to our achievements in agriculture we [the exhibition in the Hungarian pavilion] never get beyond the land reform [of 1945], and there is not even an allusion to the state farms, cooperatives, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0022009411422370">49</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In other words, the diplomatic apparatus snapped up the discontents aired by conservative communists such as Gyula Kállai and put their money on a sustained shift leftwards in the mainstream of communist politics. Szigeti’s comments repeated almost verbatim what he read in the report of László Kazimír, Hungary’s <italic>charge d’affaires</italic> in Brussels, about a week before. A petty-minded <italic>Streber</italic> with oversized ambitions, Kazimír wished to evoke the goodwill of his Budapest superiors by emphasizing the significance of his and his legation’s contribution to the (propaganda) success of the Brussels pavilion and, at the same time, by a constant stream of incriminating reports about the behaviour, the practices and the politics and ideology of the people actually creating and taking care of the whole spectacle. His 15 May 1958 report to his superiors in Budapest (the basis of Szigeti’s critical comments on the three ministers’ report) is one in a series of vicious denunciations of the failures of the pavilion and its exhibitions to assert the country’s systemic identity in their representations:
<disp-quote>
<p>As a result of the fear of all too many texts, we have ended up in a situation where several capitalist countries refer, arrogantly, to one or another paragraph in their constitution at appropriate places, or quote at relevant places citations [sic] of their big shots [<italic>idézi nagyjainak</italic> … <italic>idézését</italic>], while in our pavilion there is not even one such citation. We should absolutely find a way towards enriching our pavilion in this respect. Leading comrades visiting us were in agreement [with us] about this and several of them have made useful suggestions. For example, we are in complete agreement with Comrade Szobek’s suggestion that some photos about agricultural cooperatives and state farms should be displayed. This could be possible in the agricultural room, either by way of replacing the pictures now displayed there, or by placing the photos upon the empty 10–12 metre long wall leading to the agricultural exhibition. Such modifications are possible in each of the exhibition rooms, and it should be done too, rather soon, so that in the period when the numbers of visitors reach their peak – during the months of June, July, and August –, our pavilion will be richer in political contents.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>It comes as little surprise that the person who used to be Rákosi’s ambassador in Moscow, then the Minister responsible for the collection of agricultural tax <italic>in natura</italic>, András Szobek,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0022009411422370">50</xref></sup> would give such advice. It is of greater interest that Kazimir’s superiors in Budapest lent him an ear, relied on his reports and sided with his politics. Competition and jealousies between various agencies of power within the party-state can have been part of the background to this.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0022009411422370">51</xref></sup> A more plausible explanation could be, however, to attribute Kazimir’s reporting and its positive reception at the <italic>Bem rakpart</italic> to the fact that the political-ideological complexion of the diplomatic apparatus in 1957–8 was more towards the conservative left, and this faction did not wish to shy away from opposing to and confronting what it saw as a dangerously lax new mix of cultural policies emerging from the Central Committee’s Cultural Department under László Orbán, and, more particularly, from the Ministry of Culture’s agile deputy minister, György Aczél, whose actual influence grew well beyond the resources rendered by his formal position.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0022009411422370">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the last few days of May, the pressure exercised by the Legation appeared to lead to some results. Government Commissioner Odze made a tour of the pavilion, together with several officials of the Legation led by the envoy, to see what could be done in order ‘to enrich the political message of the pavilion’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0022009411422370">53</xref></sup> The report lists in great detail all the suggestions made – including to increase the amount of explanatory texts, statistics and other old time didactic methods to spoon-feed the visitors with the message that they were visiting the pavilion of <italic>socialist</italic> Hungary, a socialist society of amazing achievement, highly effective institutions and wise leaders. Indeed, the envoy’s purported interventions stopped only short of the idea of placing large portraits of János Kádár on one or another wall. He certainly tried to sell the idea that on a large empty surface of wall in the ‘Budapest’ (light industry) room, ‘we should place some text with a political content, a citation from Comrade Kádár, or from some other leading comrade, dealing with issues of relations between peoples, [or] with the question of the struggle for peace’. We do not know exactly what effect this meeting had on the actual shape and composition of the pavilion and its various exhibitions. It is not probable that the Government Commissioner and his staff went a very long way in accommodating the wishes of the Legation. Endre Odze told the envoy that the Chamber of Commerce back in Budapest had received the suggestions with a great deal of disbelief and even more disinclination, ascribing them to ‘exaggerated leftism’ (<italic>túlzott baloldaliságnak minősítik</italic>) – which shows that there was a certain amount of ‘mobilization’ taking place not only within the diplomatic apparatus promoting a leftist agenda, but also in those governmental and other agencies and circles where the anti-Stalinist edge of the emerging Kádárist consolidation was taken very seriously. What the Legation’s report from early August 1958 reveals is that the envoy was less than satisfied with the actual results of the leftist intervention:
<disp-quote>
<p>The changes introduced in the Pavilion had as their foremost objective to show [the world] our achievements with greater courage, so that our progress should be better reflected [in the exhibitions]. It has been a mistake that the changes got introduced only after protracted wrangling. <italic>The modifications have failed to affect fundamentally the apolitical nature of the Pavilion</italic>, but they did mollify the old mistake.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0022009411422370">54</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>After the June 5 report, it seems that the struggle conducted by protagonists of an assertive systemic, ‘sickle-and-hammer’ style in the representation of Hungary lost its momentum. It may have had to do with the replacement at the end of May of <italic>charge d’affaires</italic> Kazimir with the new envoy, whose appointment was, at long last, accepted by the Belgian authorities. More importantly, and quite paradoxically, however, it reflected a new phase of the installation of the Kádár regime.</p>
<p>With the execution of Imre Nagy, the Shakespearian stage of Hungary’s communist politics arrived at a new equilibrium. Kádár had no longer any serious pretender to his position from the right (undermining his authority and authenticity as an anti-Stalinist new course politician). While he may have felt less secure about possible challenges from the left (Rákosi could still in principle be picked out from the ‘talon’ (his exile in the Soviet Union)), yet Kádár’s patron, Khrushchev, appeared more and more able to ensure that no one in Moscow would, in the foreseeable future, lay their cards against him, particularly after the ousting of Molotov, Kaganovich and Malenkov. Thus, what remained for Kádár was to convince Hungarians at home, and the world at large, that his regime meant to deliver; not only in its brutal reckoning with the revolution, but also in terms of creating a Hungary that indeed was no longer Rákosi’s. It was hardly perceptible in the second half of 1958, but the ‘sickle-and-hammer’ people were about to lose ground and the time was ripe for those who wanted to project an image of Hungary belonging to the <italic>modern</italic> world – perhaps not as bold and experimental as the French, but nonetheless part and partner of the same modernist ecumene, with relative autonomies and with a common culture of professionalism and artistic expression, even within the hard confines set by the postwar realities of international power relations.</p>

As so many others, he then with bad conscience and, therefore, with all the greater relief and enthusiasm, sized on the opportunity of personal and nation-wide salvation offered by the New Course after Stalin, which in Hungary was introduced under the Government of Imre Nagy. In the ensuing power struggle between Rákosi and Nagy, Boldizsár was no doubt on the side of the latter and quite consistently so. In October 1956, Boldizsár hailed the purity and high moral standards of the revolution and all that it had brought to the Hungarians in terms of dignity and self-esteem. Soviet state security officers in Budapest arrested him on 8 November and held him in custody for several days. Today he is remembered, if at all, as a reliable, loyal and also quite popular public intellectual of the consolidated Kádár regime. He developed a close and friendly relationship with György Aczél who, at the time covered in this article (1957–8), as a deputy minister of education, carried the main responsibility for the cultural activities and art exhibitions in connection with Expo ’58, and who grew to become the single most important personality of cultural policies throughout the Kádár era. By the second half of the 1970s, Boldizsár had been on familiar terms with Kádár himself.</p></fn>

He studied at the School of Industrial Arts, Budapest (1926-9), at the College of Technology, Stuttgart (1929–30), and at the National Academy of Architecture, Düsseldorf (1930–3). He worked at the bureau of Lajos Kozma and Gyula Kaesz. In the postwar era, he was the architect behind some of the most significant modern buildings (like the MÉMOSZ trade union building – together with Gábor Preisich, 1947–9) as well as of the most spectacular work of ‘socialist realism’, the <italic>Szinkron</italic> (dubbing) Studio (later: Pannonia Filmstudió) of 1954–5. He was among the most influential and highly reputed architects during the post-1956 decades, and is seen today by historians of architecture as ‘a representative of the neofunctionalism emerging within the economic-stylistic [<italic>gazdasági formai</italic>] puritanism of the Kádár era.’ – Cf. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://artportal.hu/lexikon/muveszek/gadoros_lajos">http://artportal.hu/lexikon/muveszek/gadoros_lajos</ext-link> (accessed 21 October 2009). Most significantly, then, the two persons shaping and controlling the design of the pavilion and its exhibitions, Boldizsár and Gádoros, were two intellectuals/professionals of high reputation, both of them on their way to establish positions of significance in the emerging cultural-political order of elite cooptation under János Kádár, an order the main ‘architect’ and caretaker of which was György Aczél.</p></fn>
