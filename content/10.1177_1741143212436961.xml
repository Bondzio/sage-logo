<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article explores the ways in which senior leaders in the learning and skills sector understand learning leadership and the influence on shaping their practice. The article emerged from a conversation between Dr Steve Kempster and leadership tutors on the Aspiring Principals and Senior Leaders Programme (APSLP), a programme for senior leaders in the learning and skills sector.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1741143212436961">1</xref>
</sup> As tutors were interested to share what we were discovering about leadership learning through an extended reflective exercise we employed. The article examines the activity, its theoretical background, and the themes generated in conversation with participants. I begin to explore the extent to which personal theories of leadership are formed from our earliest experiences and how these inform current practice. I suggest that leadership practice is shaped by not simply the practices seen and learnt at work, nor through replicating behaviours from those who we admire or detest, but within a complex dynamic of personal, contextual and socially defined influences. The exercise, we suggest, demonstrates an important vehicle through which leadership identity and identities are explored, reinforced and commended collectively. I conclude with some thoughts on the implications for learning leadership and leadership development programmes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1741143212436961">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The research emerged from observations and conversations between me and two other colleagues, Chris Gale and Nick Barclay. The research methodology was drawn initially from action learning and action research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1741143212436961">Pedlar, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741143212436961">Altrichter et al., 2002</xref>). Both concepts include learning from action and experience. It is reflective in that we have analysed and developed concepts about our experiences of running a leadership programme. And I have made it accountable making our learning processes public.</p>
<p>We were engaged in a process of professional reflective practice and raised questions for ourselves about what we were learning about leadership and how our insights might inform our practice. The programme for Strand 1 was adapted to include a session on authenticity that make links to leadership stories, identity and self. It was clear to all of us, that the tent activity had a powerful impact on the participants. And we had the opportunity to review the activity with ten consecutive cohorts totalling approximately 200 participants. During those cohorts we began to track some of significant issues and review what we were finding. The issues emerged from individual and facilitated conversations with tutors, group feedback analysis, tutors reviews and evaluation forms. As participants shared their stories we began to record the words with permission. I kept key word notes during discussions, collected flip chart notes from small group discussions and converted them into themes. I started to compare and contrast the notes from each cohort. In the text all the participants’ words are shown in italics and remain anonymous. Retrospectively, I was also interested in a employing a grounded theory approach (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1741143212436961">Strauss and Corbin, 1994</xref>, among others), which would have enabled the emergent nature of this enquiry to be supported. Such an approach rejects the idea that knowledge is out there to be discovered and can simply be retrieved by the act of uncovering it. It is quite pragmatic in the sense that it regards theory not as a representation of truth but as ideas that will prove workable and furthering understanding. This approach would have supported our on- going concern to consider ‘what was going on’ with the data that was emerging rather than aiming for some hypothetical truth.</p>
<p>This article began to take shape over an extended period of collective and individual sense making. It began with a group of the three tutors as researchers and writers and ended with a sole writer and researcher, myself, as a pragmatic solution to employment changes and time constraints. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1741143212436961">2007</xref>, I commissioned and framed the filming of DVD of the tent activity including interviewing individuals on a new cohort who had just completed the activity on the process and their personal reactions. All those who were filmed were volunteers. Professor Steve Kempster was interviewed by Nick Barclay who provided the background and rationale for the exercise. Some of the participant interviews contained in the DVD have been directly transcribed for this article.</p>
<p>The central focus of the article is an activity which is interpretive in nature, that is, it will work from the basis that individuals and groups interpret the social world and their place in it. The research is less interested in what happened in any individual account but the significance the individual participant places on any individual role models or events with in her or his leadership learning story. The diversity of experiences and interpretation of those experiences created an interest in understanding the narrative process and the extent to which we interpret the past through the lens of the present to provide us with a coherent leadership story. Dixon (1998) reminds us that the act of summarizing strengthens individuals understanding of what they are trying to describe. However, the telling of the tale had much more significance than I imagined. I have not presented any complete stories nor subjected the stories to any narrative analysis and I am not suggesting that storytelling is unproblematic, but as Lawler states in May (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1741143212436961">2002</xref>: 254):<disp-quote>
<p>the ‘truths’ people produce through such stories are not the truths as conventionally understood in positivist social science; nevertheless, they do speak certain ‘truths’ about people’s (socially located) lives and identities.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>I was aware that as a researcher how I and my colleagues might impact on the process as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1741143212436961">Mann (1992</xref>: 279) states reflecting on researching biographies:<disp-quote>
<p>My reading and retelling of those stories will be influenced by my own life stories. I will focus on, ignore or dim aspects of the stories according to my own unconscious webs of significance.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>I was also concerned not to give preference to one story over another. Perhaps, as Simms suggests, it is not as important to attribute meaning to the stories of others but that, ‘the meaningfulness of life is what we manage to read about ourselves in our own stories’. He suggests that we are the most ‘avid listener and fiercest critic’ of our own stories. I also critically examined the notion of learning to lead from others through <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741143212436961">Kempsters’ (2006)</xref> view of observational learning and began to focus more on the learning methodology and learning frameworks that informed participants’ expectations. I detail some significant learning frameworks below that I have observed. I conclude by confirming the imperative for developmental processes and support the view of organized reflection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1741143212436961">Vince, 2002</xref>) as a social not individual process and its role in leadership development and as a critical leadership task for organizational development.</p>
<p>However, again Lawler (May, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1741143212436961">2002</xref>: 255) reminds us:<disp-quote>
<p>If we want to find out how people make identities, make sense of the world and their place in it—if we want to find out how they interpret the world and themselves—we will have to attend to the stories they tell.</p>
</disp-quote>

<title>Learning Expectations</title>
<p>The APSLP has a developmental, predominately experiential focus, and includes five residential meetings encouraging a significant element of social learning. The programme design promotes leadership learning as a process of social participation, experimentation, reflection and feedback. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741143212436961">Grint (2005</xref>: 119) acknowledges, drawing on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1741143212436961">Wenger’s (1998)</xref> notions of communities of practice, ‘both learning and leading are social rather than individual events’. The social nature of the programme enables the cohort to see themselves as a temporary organization providing a space in which individual and collective identities can emerge, compete and coalesce. Learning is shaped, facilitated and constrained by what participants (learners) and tutors bring to the interaction (expectations, knowledge and prior experiences of participants) the nature of the interaction and mechanisms put in place to facilitate experiential learning. Participants engaging in the APSLP are generally eager to develop their leadership capacity and interested in the networking possibilities the programme affords. Many of the participants have experienced more traditionally taught management training programmes that frame their learning expectations and one of our first tasks is to understand what expectations individuals might bring with them.</p>
<p>These have included:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Learning is a process of gaining knowledge from a knowledgeable source to those lacking knowledge—a deficit model - as one participant said ‘there must be something that I don’t know that I need to know to become a Principal’.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Knowledge is out there somewhere, waiting to be transferred to the participants. As a participant explained, ‘I expected the programme to be another course that would ‘teach’ me how to be a better leader’.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>There is a blue print for becoming an effective leader and getting the next job. A participant said, ‘my expectations of the programme, prior to the first strand, were that it would be based around a blue-print on what it takes and how to behave to be regarded a good leader. I anticipated that the content of the programme would include discussions around ideal behaviours and characteristics required to be a good leader, which I could use to assess where I am and learn and develop ways of leading.’</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Learning is something done to the individual, it is a safe activity, the safety of which is managed by the facilitators or ‘others’ in charge.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The other participants were a source of concern, would they be in competition or able to be part of a much needed personal and professional network? ‘I also knew (or so I thought) that the room would be filled with overconfident and high performing leaders.’ ‘My worries were that the programme would be filled with apparent heroic leaders desperate to display their Principal potential.’</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>These expectations are based on the experiences of more traditional programmes, which makes engaging in experiential learning a more risky approach and not all participants are initially convinced of its intrinsic value to developing their leadership practice. Experiential learning can involve providing learners with the opportunity to share an experience that can be subjected to analysis by the whole group. The more traditional approaches in management development tend to ensure that the impact on any emotional reaction is kept to the minimum. Discussions are generally objective and the ideas and case studies involve others ‘out there’. This approach for some writers limits the potential for personal and collective learning on management and leadership programmes. Leadership development interventions focus increasingly on the extent to which an awareness of the self and context, together with the ability to work with the complexities of organizational interactions, are recognized as essential dimensions to effective leadership behaviour. This emphasis draws attention towards the extent to which a leader is a lifelong learner. ‘Learning to lead can be achieved through leading to learn’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741143212436961">Grint, 2005</xref>: 119).</p>

<sec id="section4-1741143212436961">
<title>Managing to Pause</title>
<p>The article draws on an activity used on the APSLP, which has become known as ‘the tent activity’. Participants are guided through a reflective process on their leadership learning journey to date. Steve Kempster, the designer of the activity, found as a researcher that many senior leaders could not account for their leadership learning and this prompted him to develop an activity to encourage individuals to consider their earliest, significant and storyable leadership related moments. The tent exercise invites participants to explore their attachment to particular images of leadership through their earliest experiences—interactions with fathers and mothers, as well as early experiences with institutions such as schools and social structures. In the activity participants construct their personal story, through the lens and language of leadership, with a timeline to capture their earliest experiences. This exploration begins as a lone activity and only after an hour and a half do the participants share their thinking.</p>
<p>The tent activity links to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741143212436961">Antonacopoulou and Bento’s (2003)</xref> contention that ‘Learning leadership can be discovered if one is committed to explore one’s inner landscape’. The premise for the exercise was that a person’s understanding of leadership will be shaped by their experiences, including those that occurred prior to employment. These may have been learnt in unconscious ways, perhaps through observation and subsequent experimentation.</p>
<p>Developing reflective capabilities and becoming a reflective practitioner is a highly regarded and often uncontested part of many management, leadership and professional development programmes. A key advocate, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1741143212436961">Schon (1983</xref>), promotes the process of reflection in experiential learning, the ability to learn from and in work. The idea of reflection-on-practice requires individuals to recreate his or her experiences through remembering events, thoughts and feelings. This individualized perspective does not adequately deal with the importance of the discursive and social dimension to learning. The assumption that reflection will lead to change, also avoids engaging in the interrelationships between individual’s self awareness, emotional openness, ability to learn and capacity to change within a particular context. The activity reaches beyond <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1741143212436961">Schon’s (1983)</xref> reflection in-and-on-action to reflexivity and dialogical learning processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741143212436961">Cuncliffe, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741143212436961">Lave and Wenger (1991</xref>) have developed the idea of situated learning, exploring how learning is a process of participation in a community of practice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1741143212436961">Wenger (1998</xref>) in a later publication provides a framework for thinking about learning as a process of social participation. The idea of reflexivity, ‘challenges the idea that learning is an internal cognitive process replacing it with the idea that learning is embodied, dialogical and existential activity, intimately tied to how we feel, what we say and how we respond to others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1741143212436961">Vince and Reynolds, 2004</xref>: 37). Other writers also suggest future research should include an emphasis on reflection as a ‘collective approach, which takes account of social, organizational and cultural processes’ (Reynolds and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1741143212436961">Vince, 2004</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1741143212436961">Vince (1993)</xref> argues in an earlier article ‘it is unlikely that reflection on individual experience in itself will produce learning and change’. Collective participation and learning is not just a facet of a leadership programme but, we suggest part of the process of leadership itself. Senior leaders report that they are familiar with concepts of the ‘reflective practitioner’ but they admit that it is not common practice. A lot of participants comment about how rare it is to get some time alone to reflect and refer to reflection as a luxury. Participants explain:<disp-quote>
<p>Actually sitting and having time on your own in isolation basically, sitting in a tent on a nice sunny day, being told to think about leadership was an experience really I hadn’t been through before. Generally you don’t sit on your own thinking about things and it took me a wee while to get tuned into it.</p>
<p>It is rare luxury to be asked to reflect upon one’s own ‘leadership journey’ and then to share these with colleagues who have experienced differing pathways.</p>
<p>The priorities are work, family and … a long way behind is you.</p>
<p>I havent thought like this … for years.</p>
</disp-quote>
There is a noticeable and strong tendency for senior leaders to switch to automatic pilot too quickly to find a solution and in doing so a lot of possibilities for learning are missed. Many will experience frustration during experiential learning processes, particularly early on the programme and seek to close this down.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1741143212436961">
<title>The Setting</title>
<p>The activity is located within the Lancastrian hills close to Lancaster University chosen for their serenity and isolation. The environment has an impact, as one participant explains, ‘the cold silence and tranquillity allowed me to relax a rare experience’ and for another, ‘The combination of the sunshine, wildlife, solitude and the resulting intensity of senses provided the perfect backdrop for both relaxing and reflecting.’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741143212436961">Kempster (2006)</xref> suggests that experiencing isolation with nature heightens the awareness of one’s surroundings, provides an intensity to the activity and indeed participants comment on noticing and absorbing their surroundings ‘the swans in flight’, ‘birdsong’, ‘rabbits eating’, ‘the racing clouds promising rain’, ‘the wind blowing through my lungs’, ‘warmth of the sunshine’, ‘peaceful view, the silence’, all of which help participants to engage with a reflective task and allow for an ‘emptying my mind of worries and work related issues’ and focus on the task. Kempster suggests that:<disp-quote>
<p>The purpose of the tents was to deepen reflection of a manager’s lived experience on leadership by isolating them from competing distractions … [they] had plenty of space so that each manager could only see one other tent—the person with whom they would share their insights. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741143212436961">2009</xref>: 115)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>One commented on bliss:<disp-quote>
<p>The tent exercise itself was an hour and half of bliss. Factors in the bliss were the attractive physical environment, a challenging task, well for me at least, and space.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1741143212436961">
<title>The Process</title>
<p>The tent exercise invites participants to focus on their leadership journey to date, exploring the significance and attachment to particular images and ‘mantras’ of leadership developed from their earliest experiences. This might include, interactions with fathers and mothers, siblings, as well as early experiences with institutions such as schools and social structures. In the activity participants construct their personal story, through the lens and language of leadership, with a timeline to capture and itemize each key experiences. The leadership stories that recounted from the tent exercise demonstrate the significance of pre-work situations, the role of the family, the position within siblings, early relationships and experiences at school on learning leadership. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741143212436961">McAdams (2006</xref>: 37) explains:<disp-quote>
<p>Through their actions and words, parents expose children to a wide variety of images and symbols. Children unknowingly incorporate or take into themselves such images of their parents as the ‘good’ mother, the ‘frustrating’ mother, the ‘seductive’ mother, the ‘strong’ father and the ‘threatening’ father and so on.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1741143212436961">Sinclair (1998</xref>: 176) argues that our images of leadership are collective, constructed and unconscious.<disp-quote>
<p>Fathers and mothers are the first archetypes of male and female leaders. They provide powerful and enduring templates of where we see leadership and how we feel about it.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>As the participants begin to recollect the images of childhood these become the essential raw material from which their story is constructed. For many participants connecting leadership with their early memories has been a surprising link, which generates some productive thinking about how their practice has been shaped. Many review how they managed leadership roles within a school sports context, these early experiences of exclusion and engagement with peers—such as, rivalry, jealousies and friendships as the younger and emergent self takes on roles of leader/follower. Leadership is recognized both formally within roles and positions usually given out and informally within the peer group itself. Key to this experience is the extent to which each leadership role undertaken is legitimized by peers and then supported by people in a senior role. For some participants sporting events were recalled as a positive engagement in a competitive activity with an associated personal sense of achievement/disappointment. For others, sport was a more oppressive experience that had to be endured and/or avoided. The possible school roles identified ranged from the role of milk monitor to prefect and everything in between. Teaching staff usually had a big impact on these participants; they provide leadership role models and influenced some individuals into a positive career in teaching. Some attribute individual influence that extended from a career choice in teaching to taking roles in educational management. Commonly, participants say that they landed up in the learning and skills sector ‘by accident’; they just ‘drifted in’, ‘turned up one day’ and stayed on.</p>
<p>Many attribute the impact of past managers both negative and positive, teachers, neighbours, local heroes, and first work colleagues and friends. Some were aware of their values and morals, but had never consciously attributed these to the development of their leadership practice.</p>
<p>The process of identifying a personal leadership learning timeline helps participants to answer questions such as: Who am I? Why am I here? How did I get here? The answer to these questions is the outcome of self reflections in which a sense of leadership self or selves is subject to personal inquiry. These are initially individual reflections, however, the answers to the question, Who am I?, cannot solely be answered by the individual alone, it benefits from a conversation, and an engagement in some form of social processing. Individuals can then begin to consider an answer to the question: What leader do I want to become? We conclude by suggesting that leadership identities are an outcome of both self-reflective and social processes. This is not a particularly new connection as identities have long been seen to be subject to negotiation in social interaction (Goffman, 1958). However, this supports the view that leadership practice is constructed socially and culturally.<disp-quote>
<p>The social life in which we live and mature shapes the development of our basic belief and values. We come to understandings about truth beauty goodness through conversations with friends and family, in classrooms playgrounds and workplaces. Very few of us go off to the mountains and figure it out by ourselves—instead we consolidate the ideological settings for our personal myths through the enterprise of living with and among people. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741143212436961">McAdams, 2006</xref>: 84)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Participants comment:<disp-quote>
<p>I hadn’t considered the impact of family life, school etc but solely the experience of work. I had, without realizing only considered my leadership journey in relation to work at the exclusion of life outside this.</p>
<p>[The] significance of (my) personal life was a revelation.</p>
<p>I had never before considered the people or events that shaped my leadership approach or my views on leadership. I have always been clear that my previous manager had a huge influence on my leadership style, but I have not thought beyond that.</p>
<p>In particular I was surprised at the extent to which individuals in my life had shaped my view of leadership and also the views of my partner in the exercise.</p>
<p>I realised that the early impacts on my life certainly influenced my leadership style … what I received as a follower I am now giving as a leader.</p>
<p>I believe that I have learnt a little bit from all of the ‘leaders’ who have been part of my life, both private and personal.</p>
</disp-quote>
This link reinforces the view that ‘so-called managerial learning occurs in the lives of managers long before they even think of becoming managers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1741143212436961">Watson, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1741143212436961">Sinclair (1998</xref>) raises questions about the extent to which these early constructions of leadership employ gender and class stereotypes, which significantly challenge the unmarked canvass view of learning leadership. The stories we tell will be affected by an unconscious understanding of what is seen to be acceptable characteristics and/or stereotypes of leaders. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1741143212436961">Sinclair (1998</xref>) argues that these early experiences shape our understanding of what leadership looks like and they also shape our beliefs about our eligibility for leadership at a very early age. She continues:<disp-quote>
<p>If when we are young we are only exposed to males in designated leadership roles then we come to associate maleness with leadership. If we are women, most of us will consciously or unconsciously set our sights elsewhere. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1741143212436961">Sinclair, 1998</xref>: 80)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>And arguably it is this emerging self concept and the desire to become a leader which is critically influential on leadership learning. As Kempster argues:<disp-quote>
<p>the greater the identification with leadership, the greater salience and attentiveness to observe leadership. Thus the construction of an identity as a leader is important to leadership learning. (2009: 179)</p>
</disp-quote>

<title>Leadership Learning as Imitating Role Models</title>
<p>The past leaders or key figures are categorized as either being positive or negative and some participants describe their leadership journey either through the influence of those positive leaders or negative leaders. Participants discuss at length the impact of both negative and positive leaders and their influence on their understanding of ‘good leadership’. Some participants are quite dismayed to acknowledge the number of negative role models that they have worked for in the sector although this is not a generalized experience. Of course, negative role models can serve an important function; their behaviours can clarify how not to behave which values not to espouse, and ways not to lead. Through observational learning they can guide social comparisons and help people develop particular views. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741143212436961">Lipman-Bluemn (2005</xref>: 191) explains:<disp-quote>
<p>The toxic leader’s negative object lesson may stimulate followers to reconsider their own values, previously taken for granted under the aegis of a more positive leader.</p>
</disp-quote>

<p>It might be easy to argue that negative role models can serve as an example of what should be avoided. Of course, there is a danger that those attracted to negative role models can be offered ‘a ready road map’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741143212436961">Lipman-Bluemn, 2005</xref>). Kempster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741143212436961">2006</xref>, 2009) argues that leadership learning is dominated by the observation of ‘notable others’, who provide both positive and negative influences. And he (2009: 176) suggests:<disp-quote>
<p>If observational learning is the dominant formative learning process providing invaluable short cuts to knowledge acquisition of complex phenomenon, such as leadership.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>He is keen to situate his research within the framework of naturalistic and observational learning and proposes that these ‘notable others’ transmit meaning, practices and leadership identities within particular contexts. He also suggests that the greater the personal salience of, and identification with, the leader the greater the impact on leadership learning. This view suggests that we judge other leaders effectiveness and aspire to attain the attributes of those we wish to become. Leadership learning then is a process of imitation where we adopt or emulate new ways of being that reflects our notable others. This article seeks to extend this understanding of identity work and to throw more light on the social and dialogical dimension of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1741143212436961">Shotter, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741143212436961">Holeman and Thorpe, 2003</xref>) leadership learning and developing leadership identities through personal stories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1741143212436961">Shamir et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1741143212436961">Shamir and Eilam, 2005</xref>). ‘This form of learning is experiential because it is located within our everyday experience and dialogical because it occurs in conversation with self and others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1741143212436961">Vince and Reynolds, 2004</xref>: 36). Leaders and the development of leadership practices is clearly affected by those around us, so too will those in leadership positions directly or indirectly influence other people’s understanding of effective leadership. A participant explains:<disp-quote>
<p>I realised that I developed leadership skills from the ‘leaders’ who have been part of my journey to date. Consciously or sub-consciously, I will have accepted and developed and learned those skills which I admire and rejected those leadership attributes with which I did not agree.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Participants also begin to recognize the implausibility of creating one preferred model of leadership for all to replicate. The notion of authenticity is central to leadership for some writers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741143212436961">Goffee and Jones, 2003</xref>) and it is a message welcomed by senior leaders. Goffee and Jones suggest that to be authentic requires a consistency between words and deeds; a coherence in role performance and:<disp-quote>
<p>an authentic sense of self arises from individuals coming to terms with their own biography—and a critical part of this is to understand how their origins have come to shape them. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741143212436961">Goffee and Jones, 2003</xref>: 52)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741143212436961">Luthans and Avolio (2003)</xref> propose authenticity depicts the type of positive leadership required in these changing and challenging times. The authentic leader is ‘confident, hopeful, optimistic, resilient, transparent, moral/ethical, future orientated and gives priority to developing associates to be leaders’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741143212436961">Luthans and Avolio, 2003</xref>: 243). Implicit within their text is the message that authentic leaders have a responsibility to encourage and develop authentic followers. In many ways the leadership role mitigates against authenticity as the multiplicity of cultural norms and fantasies about effective leadership (to be decisive, strong and charismatic) often is at odds with the more inquiring mind that encapsulates the self aware, authentic leader. During the programme we discuss the favoured images and rhetoric of leadership within the learning and skills sector. We also review policy documents and critically examine the range of models of leadership within the texts. Interestingly individual participants often have an implicit blue print of leadership based on the behaviours traits and characteristics of their current Principal. The programme challenges that view much to their relief. The sector too has its own leadership myths and has a tendency to attribute celebrity status to successful ex-principals. Participants explore the ‘feeling rules’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741143212436961">Hochschild, 1983</xref>) within their different organizations, which are rooted in occupational, organizational and societal expectations and the extent to which these inform their leadership. These ‘rules’ operate as guidelines that shape our expectations, behaviours and alert us to unspoken boundaries. They are described as ‘the norms and values that shape social governance’ (Fineman, 1983). Participants consider these ‘rules’ in relation to their role, their profession and the ways in which levels of desired authenticity are condoned, constrained and manipulated within their different lived-in roles.</p>
<p>Participants are freed up from their own expectations and encouraged to question the implicit sector and societal models. A participant’s typical reaction:<disp-quote>
<p>I am liberated! … I don’t have to be like my Principal.</p>
<p>I don’t want to be like X or Y.</p>

<title>Emotion</title>
<p>Many participants experience some initial anxiety, asking themselves—What shall I disclose? How much should I say? What is expected of me here? As facilitators we acknowledge that the telling of one’s life story is very personal and can be an emotional act of self disclosure. The anxiety is managed primarily though a ‘buddy’ arrangement within the initial tent experience and in the voluntary nature of self disclosure. Experiencing the tent activity can be quite personally significant and the feelings associated with experiencing the activity will be mixed. For some it was ‘uplifting’, ‘hugely fun’, ‘enjoyable and thought-provoking’ and ‘quite profoundly illuminating’.<disp-quote>
<p>I was surprised by the emotions that came with the quiet reflection! As I delved more deeply into my past, pride rose the surface I began to think about things I am most proud of but pangs of conscience also struck as I reflected on things that I have not got right!</p>
<p>During the time we spent interviewing each other both of us became emotional.</p>
<p>This was the one of the most intense learning experiences of my life and helped me to locate the source of my values and beliefs about leadership within significant stages in my life.</p>
</disp-quote>
The literature on emotion suggests that management writers have neglected the impact of emotions on organizational life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741143212436961">Ashforth and Humphrey, 1995</xref>) and organizational learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1741143212436961">Vince 2004</xref>, Fineman in Easterly-Smith, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741143212436961">2005</xref>). Emotions per se tend to be regarded as a distraction and a disturbance undermining efficient organizational performance rather than a source of potentially crucial information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741143212436961">Fineman, 1993</xref>). In the APSLP participants are reminded of the emotional dimension in the learning process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1741143212436961">Vince and Martin, 1993</xref>) and suggest that leadership learning is not purely a rational process but a participative social experience involving reason, emotion intuition and interaction.</p>
<p>As one participant commented:<disp-quote>
<p>What surprised me somewhat was the fact that in retrospect it was my emotional response to these people (other leaders) that had coloured my judgement, rather than a cool, rational analysis of their particular strengths, skills and approaches. This in turn heightened my awareness of the significance of the ways in which emotional responses can be a key determinant of the perception of a leader, that is to say the ways in which followers attribute skills and capabilities to leaders which may, or may not, match the reality!</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Emotions can often give rise to new ways of being and relating as we engage with the possibilities of understanding how they affect our practice and our learning.</p>

<sec id="section9-1741143212436961">
<title>Leadership Stories</title>
<p>For some participants the process is reassuring:<disp-quote>
<p>I do have a leadership story to tell.</p>
<p>It allows me to organize the jigsaw pieces of my experience.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741143212436961">Brown (2006</xref>: 738) reminds us, ‘Stories do not tell themselves, they are told by storytellers’. Individuals are likely to construct a story they are comfortable with and that can be presented to others. To do this many will exercise some discretion in what they choose—to focus on and elaborate and similarly aspects they choose not to tell.<disp-quote>
<p>Life stories are not free constructions; they are constrained by the events of life, but narrators select the elements of the story to confer meaning onto prior events—events that may not have had such meanings at the time of their occurrence. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1741143212436961">Shamir et al., 2005</xref>: 17)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>As every story is subject to some editing so it then is ‘always the work of imagination, a discursive construct with hermeneutic uncertainty’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741143212436961">Brown, 2006</xref>: 37) and they are always constrained by what the authors’ understanding of what constitutes a reasonable and plausible story. In any individual story, events may be jumbled, and chronology adjusted as ‘characters and events from the past and projected futures, or indeed from the past and projected futures, descend into the constructed present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741143212436961">Brown, 2006</xref>: 743). The stories as constructions have less to do with facts and so much more to do with the meaning individuals attribute to their memories. The meaning of these stories is attributed both by the story teller and the listener. The stories while provisional attempt to make coherent pathway from the participant’s reconstructed past, their perceived present and their anticipated future. Although they are generally open-ended they are nevertheless presentable stories and tend to promote a sense of continuity not confusion. There is a tendency to choose those parts of our experience that lead to the present and render our life story coherent.</p>
<p>For some writers:<disp-quote>
<p>In order to be sane and effective social actors individuals have to achieve a degree of coherence and consistency in their conceptions of who they are. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1741143212436961">Watson 2009</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>For other writers, life stories themselves bring unity and purpose:<disp-quote>
<p>By selectively reconstructing our past we attain the status of creator. We create a self that is whole purposeful because it is embedded in a coherent and meaningful story. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741143212436961">McAdams, 2006</xref>: 92)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>We ask participants to join in this activity with a group of peers, all of whom hold broadly similar leadership positions in the learning and skills institutions. It is likely that the story that is told will have some resonance and also some noticeable differences with its audience. One participant commented on sharing their leadership stories:<disp-quote>
<p>Despite this difference there were startling similarities in how we established ourselves in leadership positions. We both articulated the following characteristics: a very strong work ethic, a commitment to quality and high standards, an innovative streak, an ability to get the best out of the teams we lead.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>But as Kelly suggests it is:<disp-quote>
<p>Much more than telling a story—they develop a sense of professional vision and play an important part in the construction of new identities both for the teller and for the community that such stories represent. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741143212436961">Kelly et al., 2004</xref>: 4)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>By sharing these stories they are creating the opportunity to be seen in particular ways, to demonstrate certain values, and traits through their experiences. They are presenting themselves as credible leaders to themselves and to their peers. The individual sense making and social nature of this activity is important. Through a process of sharing and social information processing, meaning is validated. Interaction does not merely influence the emerging leadership self concepts but is a precondition for them. Leadership identities are socially constructed through dialogue and interaction with others. Once the story is told it will be subject to multiple interpretations. The story teller is not in control of those interpretations and may never be acquainted with them. Brown reminds us of the concept of plurivocity, that is, multiple understanding of stories, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741143212436961">Goffman (1959)</xref> argues was a necessary condition for a more flexible presentation of the self. For other writers, the telling of a life story is in itself a ‘leadership behaviour’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1741143212436961">Shamir, 2005</xref>). He (2005) states that:<disp-quote>
<p>through life experiences and the way they are organized into a life story that people can develop the self concept of a leader that will support and justify their leadership role’ … biographies produce leaders.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>As we lead:<disp-quote>
<p>storied lives; we are continuously producing storied versions of what is happening in our lives, as well as revising the way we tell stories of earlier parts of our lives. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1741143212436961">Sims, 2003</xref>: 1197)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>As a person’s career progresses there will be opportunities to reconsider and renegotiate the private and public views of self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741143212436961">Goffman, 1959</xref>). Some argue that we work on our stories, consciously and unconsciously, throughout most of our adult years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741143212436961">McAdams, 2006</xref>: 109). Any personal life story, will be influenced by the social cultural context and the scripts available that are seen to be appropriate. Leadership stories not only have individual significance they convey social and cultural meaning. Our stories are constructed within the threads of our culture, and:<disp-quote>
<p>Because the stories are communicated to others, and therefore assume a network of meaning that is shared between narrator and the audience. Therefore by studying leaders’ life stories, we can access cultural meanings of leadership and compare them across contexts. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1741143212436961">Shamir, 2005</xref>: 25)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>It is often suggested in the literature that leadership is also concerned with developing and communicating a vision to others. For some the inquiry focuses on the extent to which leaders provide an overall vision, influence the understanding and manage meaning of others through words and the effective use of rhetoric and ‘framing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1741143212436961">Fairhurst and Sarr, 1996</xref>). Leaders, it is argued, will influence the ways in which their staff will interpret world and provide ‘meaningful appraisal of the situation or crisis the organization faces’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1741143212436961">Parry and Hansen, 2007</xref>: 286). Stories may be an outcome of a sense making process and one that influences future sense making. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1741143212436961">Shamir and Eilam (2005)</xref> suggest that storytelling is the most legitimate and convincing means by which leaders convey their authenticity. These life stories identify events that show development and defining moments in which they relay what they have learnt from difficult situations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1741143212436961">Shamir (2005</xref>: 115) suggests leadership life stories play an important role in the leadership process, it:<disp-quote>
<p>aids followers’ perceptions and beliefs influences initial expectations, attitudes and relationships with the leaders demonstrates traits and behaviours and has a role modelling function; and is important for leaders themselves ‘to lead people need to find or construct a life story that feels comfortable to themselves and can be presented to others’.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741143212436961">Denning (2004</xref>) suggests that leaders need to consider a variety of narrative patterns for different aims. He lists the types of stories with various objectives, offering a type for every circumstance and suggesting what feelings various stories may inspire. If the objective is to communicate who you are, he suggests that leaders will need to tell a story that provides audience-engaging drama and reveal some strength and vulnerability from the past. In telling a personal story, he argues, the leader will need to include meaningful details but warns that the storyteller will need to make sure the audience has the time and inclination to hear it. He suggests that this form of narrative should generate such responses as: ‘I didn’t know that about him’ and ‘Now I see where she is driving at.’</p>
<p>For participants on APSLP the value of using this activity and crafting a personal leadership story begins to characterize themselves and others as credible leaders all of whom have reasonable tales to tell.</p>

<sec id="section10-1741143212436961">
<title>Some Challenges for Participants</title>
<p>Several factors can diminish the impact of and the engagement in the tent activity. Some participants have been told by previous participants about the activity and this trickles through the group increasing the anxiety or disbelief in others. A participant commented, ‘Chinese whispers were rife from previous groups.’ Some will approach the activity with cynicism, questioning whether this will be a positive use of their time. Some individuals hold a stereotypical view of ‘Outward Bound’ courses, that is, an image of people being made to feel as physically uncomfortable as possible and this image only serves to fuel the feelings of anxiety. But for others, even the prospect of being outside in colder climes interfered with their ability to engage in the activity. A small proportion of the participants stated that they take time out as part of their daily lives so this exercise did not have as much value for them. Those for whom reflection was not a common practice, felt they might be challenged with the image of ’repenting in a tent’ with a relative stranger. However, these challenges are often resolved. One participant commented, ‘my initial cynicism of the activity was replaced by the later understanding of the value of the activity. However my real understanding and development came later after the event.’</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1741143212436961">
<title>Implications for Leadership Learning</title>
<p>Some participants explain the implications for leadership learning:<disp-quote>
<p>Having experienced the tent exercise, I now recognise the immense benefit of having real, quality time for reflection and am far more likely to recreate this for myself in the future.</p>
<p>It highlighted the value of refection.</p>
<p>The tent exercise was extremely illuminating for exposing the extent to which we are locked into social myths of leadership. In a multimedia world we are continually assaulted with images of what leadership is supposed to look like, who leaders are and how they are supposed to act. It’s no wonder that some people can feel as if they are not the same as the people frequently portrayed as leaders.</p>
</disp-quote>
The activity is programmed in the first meeting and sits prior to any exploration of a range of leadership literature signalling the significance we have placed on understanding how personal theories of leadership shape leadership practice. The tent activity enables participants to review their journey, their realities and identity with others. This can provide an interesting contradiction to some of the learning expectations listed above, as it supports a process in which:<disp-quote>
<p>Knowledge incorporates knowing-from-within—knowing how to be a person of a certain kind and relate with others in particular circumstances, rather than an externally imposed system of abstract propositions or critique. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741143212436961">Cunliffe, 2002</xref>: 39)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>It essentially privileges personal leadership theories over published models and therefore provides participants with a solid base from which to review critically other leadership models and perspectives on and off the APSLP. Certainly many participants conclude that they need to incorporate more reflective practice within their daily work, having experienced the benefit and gained some important insights during the tent exercise. Such a conclusion can lead them towards an individualized pathway. The programme takes individuals through a series of collective learning activities emphasizing the social nature of learning, leading and organizing. We acknowledge that learning to lead is more of a social process than simply an individual journey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741143212436961">Lave and Wenger, 1991</xref>). And the social nature of identity construction has implications for leaders of organizations. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741143212436961">Brown and Starkey (2000)</xref> remind us ‘learning to promote critical reflection upon collective identity is a crucial but under theorized management task’. For participants on APSLP, we might need to explore further the extent to which we are enabling the formation within cohorts of an emergent collective leadership identity.</p>
<p>In his book, <italic>Leadership Limits and Possibilities</italic> (2005), Grint questions the efficacy of the learning of leadership. This is a particularly relevant question for practitioners running leadership development programmes and organizations seeking to develop their leaders. Despite the high levels of recorded investment in leadership development there is a no clear mandate on best practice or what is the most effective approach to developing leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741143212436961">Hirsh et al., 2004</xref>). It may be as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741143212436961">Grint (2007</xref>: 232) argues that we ‘confuse and conflate leader development with leadership development’. Some recent contributions to this question have steered the debate towards the effectiveness of various approaches to leadership development and make a distinction between leader development and leadership development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741143212436961">Parks, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741143212436961">Heifetz and Linsky, 2002</xref>). There is much in the literature to support experiential learning as a methodology to inform development interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741143212436961">Boud et al., 1993</xref>; Antonacopoulou and Bento, 2004; Reynolds and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1741143212436961">Vince, 2004</xref>). Few writers have located the ‘effectiveness of more experiential forms of professional development’ within the further education (FE) environment (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1741143212436961">Muiji et al., 2006</xref>: 93). There is an increasing interest in social learning and organized critical reflection (Reynolds and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1741143212436961">Vince, 2004</xref>) and the use of dialogue as an essential ingredient to leadership learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741143212436961">Argyris, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741143212436961">Dixon, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741143212436961">Isaacs, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>However, our experience with this activity in particular, supports Morrisson et al. claims that an important means by which leaders identities are confirmed is in their interactions with others in groups (CEL, 2007: 27). It supports developing adaptive leadership which:<disp-quote>
<p>… calls for a willingness to be radically honest with oneself in relationship to the reality at hand. It requires self observation within a complex field of action- and the capacity to improvise. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741143212436961">Parks, 2005</xref>: 148)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>What is called for is a re-examination of how leadership is defined, experienced and enabled within organizations. In the recent report ‘Whole Systems Go’ commissioned by the National School of Government (2009: 2) acknowledged the imperative need to ‘cultivate leadership capabilities across the public sector’ and with its seven propositions says:<disp-quote>
<p>The need for new patterns of adaptive leadership to tackle tough, complex, cross-cutting problems, where there may be no clear consensus about either the causes or the solution to the problems.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The tents exercise is a way of encouraging people to take up that opportunity with all the challenges that this new thinking presents. As more traditional approaches to leadership development tend to tread ‘the high hard ground of clarity and rigour but does little to prepare them for swampy lowlands where messy and confusing problems defy rationality’ (Schon, 1983: 3). We are left with the continuing challenge, for leaders, so they can not only survive but thrive in constantly changing and often uncertain environments. If ‘learning to learn’ is seen as an increasingly important meta competence for leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1741143212436961">Winterton et al., 2000</xref>), the necessity to rethink leadership development activities may be guided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741143212436961">Antonacopoulou and Bento’s (2003)</xref> idea in placing learning at the heart of leadership and developing professional practice in general.</p>
