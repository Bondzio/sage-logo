<abstract>
<p>One of the factors affecting successful inclusion of adolescents with Asperger syndrome (AS) in mainstream schools is positive relationships with classmates. The present study investigates how adolescents with AS: (1) perceive their classmates' attitude towards them; (2) what attitude towards classmates they declare, and (3) how they assess the effectiveness of social support received from parents, teachers, and classmates. The relationship between social support received by adolescents with AS and their perception of their relationships with classmates was also analysed. There were 50 participants in the study: Two groups with equal numbers of participants, one with adolescents with AS and the other with typically developing adolescents (age 12- to 17-years-old). All participants attended mainstream schools. A set of questionnaires measuring perception of social relationships in class and perceived social support was used. Adolescents with AS gave poorer assessments of their classmates’ attitude towards them and their attitude to their classmates. They also claimed to receive less support from classmates. Moreover, that type of support was significantly correlated with their evaluation of their peers attitude towards them and declared behaviour towards their peers.</p>

<p>The number of students with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), including children and adolescents with Asperger syndrome (AS) attending mainstream schools is rising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143034311415784">Humphrey &amp; Lewis, 2008</xref>). It is therefore increasingly important to create an educational environment suited to the particular needs of this group of students. However, as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0143034311415784">Symes and Humphrey (2010)</xref>, their effective inclusion still presents a considerable challenge to mainstream schools. An important role in changing this state of affairs may be played by school psychologists, whose involvement, as international experience shows, is vital for the transition from a traditional, segregated educational system to one that promotes inclusive education and integration (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143034311415784">Forlin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0143034311415784">Williams, Johnson, &amp; Sukhodolsky, 2005</xref>). A central aspect of the inclusion process is learning more about the social situation of individuals with AS at school, as their relationships with other students may have a substantial effect on their successful inclusion.</p>
<p>It is no coincidence that most cases of AS are diagnosed in school children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0143034311415784">Scott, Baron-Cohen, Bolton, &amp; Brayne, 2002</xref>). This is associated, among other things, with social, emotional, and cognitive challenges children face in that setting. School education places a lot of requirements on children and adolescents with AS. Their social and communication skills are inferior compared with typically developing children, and social development difficulties are particularly apparent in relations with peers (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143034311415784">Bellon-Harn &amp; Harn, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143034311415784">Koning &amp; Magill-Evans, 2001</xref>). Children with AS have limited ability to play with others, cooperate during lessons and spend free time together. In everyday school situations (e.g. during breaks, meals at the school canteen, or while changing in the locker room) they may be vulnerable to noise, congestion, and chaos, since such situations tend to be poorly structured and often unpredictable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143034311415784">Betts, Betts, &amp; Gerber-Eckard, 2007</xref>). Consequently, students with AS participate in fewer social interactions at school than their peers, have fewer friends, and spend more time in quieter, calmer, and adult-supervised areas of the school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143034311415784">Koning &amp; Magill-Evans, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0143034311415784">Wainscot, Naylor, Sutcliffe, Tantam, &amp; Williams, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>A number of people with AS have very negative school experiences, especially when it comes to social relationships (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143034311415784">Connor, 2000</xref>). Social difficulties become more apparent in higher grades with growing emphasis on independence and coping with increasingly complex situations. The importance of social relationships for individual disposition increases in adolescence, and any failures in that respect coupled with the experience of loneliness significantly impact individual well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0143034311415784">Whitehouse, Durkin, Jaquet, &amp; Ziatas, 2009</xref>). Research results have shown that social relationships in children with AS deteriorate with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143034311415784">Orsmond, Krauss, &amp; Seltzer, 2004</xref>). A number of these adolescents suffer from loneliness, yearning for close relationships but are unable to establish or maintain them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143034311415784">Jones &amp; Meldal, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143034311415784">Locke, Ishijima, &amp; Kasari, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Relationships of children and adolescents with AS with their peers are an important aspect of successful inclusion in school, but they can also hamper or even completely prevent them from functioning in an educational setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143034311415784">Humphrey &amp; Lewis, 2008</xref>). Children and adolescents with this condition are particularly vulnerable to violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0143034311415784">Shtayermman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0143034311415784">Wainscot et al., 2008</xref>). They are sometimes ignored or rejected by their peers, who demonstrate lack of acceptance and hostility due to their unusual behaviour and persistent interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143034311415784">Carrington &amp; Graham, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143034311415784">Carrington, Templeton, &amp; Papinczak, 2003</xref>). In a sociometric study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143034311415784">Locke, Ishijima, and Kasari (2010)</xref>, more than 71% of teenagers with AS were isolated or peripheral in their classroom social structure, while over 92% of typically developing pupils reported significant connections with peers and were recognized in their classroom. Other researchers have reported similar results (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143034311415784">Chamberlain, Kasari, &amp; Rotheram-Fuller, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143034311415784">Kasari, Locke, Gulsrud, &amp; Rotheram-Fuller, 2011</xref>). These problems are further compounded by the fact that this type of disability is usually not immediately apparent to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0143034311415784">Portway &amp; Johnson, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0143034311415784">2005</xref>). Individuals with AS are perceived as ‘different’, but their problems tend to be underestimated, resulting in lack of adequate assistance. They experience lower acceptance and have fewer reciprocal friendships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143034311415784">Rotheram-Fuller, Kasari, &amp; Chamberlain, 2010</xref>). Adolescents with AS are often subjected to invectives, physical violence and teasing and they may also experience frustration and confusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143034311415784">Dubin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143034311415784">Humphrey &amp; Lewis, 2008</xref>). They are reported to be suffering from high levels of stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143034311415784">Church, Alisanski, &amp; Amanullah, 2000</xref>), adaptation difficulties, low self-esteem, and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0143034311415784">Vickerstaff, Heriot, Wong, Lopes, &amp; Dossetor, 2007</xref>). Difficulties in social relationships experienced by students with AS at school may be an important factor in the emergence of these problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143034311415784">Dubin, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>There are no precise figures as to the number of children and adolescents with AS in Poland, but the number of individuals with AS diagnosis attending schools rises each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0143034311415784">Rymsza &amp; Gmaj, 2006</xref>). Some of them attend mainstream schools, some frequent integrated or special schools, while others follow the so-called individual schedule of education (being taught at home by one or several tutors). Students who follow an individual schedule usually attend regular school classes for at least several hours a week. A small proportion of students with AS attend school with additional support (shadow teacher). However, support for students with AS in mainstream schools is usually limited, causing them to experience various difficulties, often putting excessive demands on their coping skills. As a result, these children and adolescents tend to switch schools often as their parents keep looking for a friendlier environment that would cater to their problems. Very few adolescents diagnosed with AS attend therapy (e.g. social skills training) organized by therapeutic centres or institutions working for people with ASD. Access to such services is very limited, as is the awareness that such provisions could be of vital importance to individuals with AS.</p>
<p>Some studies on school functioning of children with AS use information obtained from parents or educators (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143034311415784">Brewin, Renwick, &amp; Schormans, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143034311415784">Church et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0143034311415784">Williams, 2001</xref>). A growing number of authors source information directly from children and adolescents with that syndrome. In one such study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143034311415784">Humphrey and Lewis (2008)</xref> interviewed 20 teenagers with AS and analysed their drawings to assess, among other things, how they perceived their situation at school. Their results have confirmed that these adolescents experience rejection, ridicule, and lack of understanding from their peers. Other investigators have reported similar results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143034311415784">Carrington &amp; Graham, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143034311415784">Connor, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0143034311415784">Osler &amp; Osler, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0143034311415784">Wainscot et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies on how adolescents with AS perceive their social relations at school usually focus on their perception of the attitudes demonstrated towards them by others. We have very limited understanding of how people with AS view their own attitude and behaviour towards others. So far, we have had little information as to how young people with this condition evaluate the support offered to them by other people. Social support is a multidimensional and complex phenomenon (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0143034311415784">Williams, Barclay, &amp; Schmied, 2004</xref>). According to a popular definition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0143034311415784">Taylor, Klein, Gruenewald, Gurung, &amp; Fernandes-Taylor, 2003</xref>), it involves ‘information from others that one is loved and cared for, esteemed and valued, and part of a network of communication and mutual obligations’ (p. 314). It is a well-documented fact that social support has an important role in formation of psychological well-being and serves as a buffer against stress across various groups of adolescents (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143034311415784">Falci &amp; McNeely, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034311415784">McGrath, Brennan, Dolan, &amp; Barnett, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143034311415784">Rueger, Malecki, &amp; Demaray, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The question of social support has been investigated in adults with AS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143034311415784">Müller, Schuler, &amp; Yates, 2008</xref>), who were asked to specify what kind of help they would find most useful in overcoming difficulties in social interactions. Participants listed various forms of external and communication support (e.g. support in interpreting and using social cues). So far, we have limited information on how adolescents with AS evaluate social support coming from various sources. In a recent study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0143034311415784">Symes and Humphrey (2010)</xref> found that students with ASD attending mainstream schools reported lower support from peers and more bullying. Some insight has also been offered by the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143034311415784">Lasgaard, Nielsen, Eriksen, and Goossens (2010)</xref>, who found that teenagers with ASD are much more likely to experience loneliness than typically developing adolescents. They have also shown that social support from classmates, parents, and a close friend correlated negatively with the sense of loneliness in adolescents with ASD. Thus, the results of that study show that perceived social support may be an important protective factor for adolescents with ASD. Understanding relationships between perceived social support and evaluation of one’s own social relations with classmates in adolescents with AS may expand our knowledge about factors affecting the effectiveness of inclusive education for that group of students.</p>
<p>The main aim of the present study was to determine how adolescents with AS perceive their social situation at school, both in terms of the attitudes of others towards them and their own attitudes towards peers. Furthermore, the study aimed to investigate the relationship between the adolescents’ perception of their classmates’ attitudes towards them and the adolescents’ attitude to the peers in their class. We have also analysed how adolescents with AS evaluated social support received from various sources and whether there was a correlation between social support perceived by adolescents with AS and their perception of their own relationships with classmates.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0143034311415784" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title>
<p>Thirty-five parents of children with AS were asked to give their consent to their child participating in the current study. Six parents refused, mostly citing their child’s aversion to completing questionnaires as the reason. The parents of 29 adolescents with AS who agreed to their child participating in the study signed informed consent forms and completed demographics surveys. Two candidates (both aged 17) refused to join the study, giving as their reason their dislike of such studies. The remaining participants (27 people) completed the set of questionnaires. Two sets were rejected due to incompleteness.</p>
<p>Finally, a total of 25 adolescents with AS (age range 12- to 17-years-old, mean age 15.32, SD 1.70) participated in the study. The group consisted of 22 boys and three girls. All participants had a current diagnosis of AS made by a child psychiatrist. The adolescents fulfilled established diagnostic criteria for AS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143034311415784">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>). All participants attended mainstream schools, with 23 participants attending school full-time, one on a part-time schedule (approximately 70% of classes), and one following an individual schedule at home and taking part in school classes for ten hours per week. All participants were recruited from therapeutic centres that specialized in ASD, situated in Polish schools in the Warsaw region. Sixteen subjects were residents of a large city (Warsaw), five resided in a small to average-size towns (population ≤ 50,000) and four lived in the suburbs.</p>
<p>The control group consisted of 25 typically developing adolescents (22 boys and three girls). Controls were matched as closely as possible for age, gender and size of town/city of residence (15 resided in large cities, seven in small or medium-sized towns, three in suburbs). Participants’ age ranged from 13- to 17-years-old (mean age 15.92, SD 1.49). All adolescents attended mainstream schools, in most cases the same schools as the teenagers with AS.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0143034311415784" sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title>
<p>Three questionnaires were used in the study: ‘My classmates’ attitude towards me’ and ‘My attitude towards my classmates’ questionnaire set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0143034311415784">Zwierzyńska &amp; Matuszewski, 2006</xref>) and the Social support scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143034311415784">Kmiecik-Baran, 1995</xref>).</p>
<sec id="sec4-0143034311415784"><title>‘My classmates’ attitude towards me’ and ‘my attitude towards my classmates’ inventories</title>
<p>‘My classmates’ attitude towards me’ and ‘My attitude towards my classmates’ inventory set serves to measure social relationships with classmates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0143034311415784">Zwierzyńska &amp; Matuszewski, 2006</xref>). The developers of this tool took into account a number of students’ social needs, the satisfaction of which is particularly important at school. These include the need for safety, affiliation, attachment (taking care of someone and being taken care of), influencing others, as well as approval and appreciation. The tool is comprised of two inventories. The first one (‘My classmates’ attitude towards me’, A), includes 26 items to assess the student’s opinion about his/her classmates’ behaviour towards him/her. The second inventory (‘My attitude towards my classmates’, B), consists of 24 items to assess the student’s perception of his/her behaviour towards his/her classmates.</p>
<p>Factor analysis conducted on a group of 1206 mainstream school students aged 10- to 17-years-old revealed three factors associated with the participants’ perception of their classmates’ attitude toward them: (1) support versus indifference from others; (2) sense of security versus sense of threat; and (3) sense of being appreciated versus sense of being under-appreciated by others. In addition, three factors reflecting the attitude towards classmates declared by participants were identified: (1) readiness to engage in prosocial behaviour versus egocentrism; (2) aggressiveness; and (3) sociability versus tendency towards social isolation. These factors match the scales in the inventory. The total score is also established, calculated as the sum of points scored on each scale (total score range 50–250). Individual items refer to common social situations occurring in the classroom. The subject’s task is to mark on a five-point scale (5—always; 4—often; 3—sometimes; 2—rarely; 1—never) how often in a given situation his/her classmates act in a given way towards him/her (inventory A) or how often he/she acts as described towards his/her classmates (inventory B).

<p>Participants completed both inventories, starting with inventory A. Scoring for the whole inventory and for individual scales is such that the higher a score obtained by a participant, the worse is his/her assessment of relationships with classmates. The reliability of scales measured by Cronbach’s alpha is between 0.702 and 0.869. In the present sample, the reliability coefficients (Kuder-Richardson) were found to be 0.97 for total scores, 0.91 for support versus indifference from others, 0.88 for sense of security versus sense of threat, 0.86 for sense of being appreciated versus sense of being underappreciated, 0.90 for sociability versus tendency towards social isolation, 0.90 for readiness to engage in prosocial behaviour versus egocentrism, and 0.82 for aggressiveness.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0143034311415784"><title>Social support scale (SSS)</title>
<p>The Social support scale (SSS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143034311415784">Kmiecik-Baran, 1995</xref>) measures the amount of social support received by schoolchildren and adolescents. Following the theory proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0143034311415784">Tardy (1985)</xref>, it evaluates four types of support: (1) informational support—delivering information, suggestions and guidance; (2) instrumental support—provision of specific help (e.g. lending money, school materials); (3) appraisal support—delivering evaluative feedback (e.g. ‘you’re doing a good job!’); and (4) emotional support—delivering messages informing of acceptance and understanding.</p>
<p>The inventory consists of 16 items. There are four items for each type of support (sample items are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0143034311415784">Table 2</xref>). The participant’s task is to mark on a four-point scale (0—not; 1—rather not; 2—rather yes; and 3—yes) to what extent a given statement applies to people from a given social group. Three groups were covered in the study: parents, teachers, and classmates. The higher the score obtained in the overall scale and in individual subscales, the more support of a given type the subject receives (total scores range from 0–144, scores in each subscale range from 0–36).

<p>The SSS has a high reliability measured by Cronbach’s alpha (0.94 for total scores, and between 0.79 and 0.88 for individual subscales). In the present study, the Kuder-Richardson coefficients were found to be 0.93 for total scores, 0.81 for informational support, 0.67 for instrumental support scale, 0.81 for appraisal support scale, and 0.86 for emotional support.</p>

<p>Adolescents with AS and their parents were contacted at schools or therapy centres. They were informed about the purpose and nature of the study and invited to take part. The study was conducted on an individual basis. Adolescents completed the questionnaires in the company of the second author (Eł), in a quiet place at school. A typical session lasted approximately 30–50 minutes. Parents of typically developing adolescents, and then the adolescents themselves were approached at schools. Ethical approval for the study was granted by the University of Warsaw Research Ethics Committee.</p>

<p>Statistical analysis showed that adolescents with AS reported lower social support (in total) compared to typically developing adolescents (<italic>t</italic>(50) = − 2.525, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.71). Moreover, there were differences between groups in terms of the amount of support received from specific sources: Support from teachers (adolescents with AS reported more support, <italic>t</italic> (50) = − 2.966, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.79) and support from peers (adolescents with AS perceived less such support, <italic>t</italic>(50) = − 6.434, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 1.82). No differences between groups were found in terms of support from parents.</p>
<p>With respect to perceived social support, the two groups differed in terms of appraisal support (<italic>t</italic>(50) = − 2.718, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.77) and emotional support (<italic>t</italic>(50) = − 2.047, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.58). In both cases adolescents with AS reported receiving less support than typically developing adolescents. No differences were found in terms of informational and instrumental support.</p>
<p>In order to find out whether perceived social support correlates with one’s perceived social situation in class, Pearson <italic>r</italic> correlation coefficients were calculated separately for each group. Total support, as well as support from parents, teachers, and classmates were correlated with the indicators of perceived social situation in class. It should be remembered that the higher the result in terms of indices of perceived relationships with classmates (both total, as well as on individual scales), the worse was the participant’s assessment of his/her situation; while in the support scale, the higher score reflected greater support received by the participant.

<p>The present study compared perceptions of classmates’ attitude towards participants and their attitude towards classmates in adolescents with AS and typically developing peers. Adolescents with AS assessed their situation as worse compared to typically developing peers for almost all variables under analysis. This was true for all analysed aspects of the attitude of peers towards participants (i.e. indifference, sense of threat, and of being under-appreciated). Similar results were obtained for the two variables dealing with participants’ attitudes to their classmates: Tendency towards social isolation and lack of readiness to engage in prosocial behaviour. Only in the case of aggressiveness were no differences between the groups found.</p>
<p>Our results are fully consistent with findings from other studies, suggesting that adolescents with AS perceive their social situation in their class to be inferior in terms of relationships with classmates (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143034311415784">Carrington &amp; Graham, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143034311415784">Connor, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0143034311415784">Osler &amp; Osler, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0143034311415784">Wainscot et al., 2008</xref>). In the light of the results of this study we can conclude that adolescents with AS, compared with typically developing peers, have a greater sense of threat, feel more under-appreciated by peers and treated indifferently. These results offer a further proof of the need to actively improve the social situation of teenagers with ASD at school.</p>
<p>A further contribution to our knowledge on social relationships of adolescents with AS at school obtained from other studies is derived from our data suggesting differences between adolescents with this condition and their typically developing peers in terms of declared attitude and behaviour towards classmates. These include greater tendency towards social isolation and less involvement in prosocial behaviour. These results merit deeper consideration. The direction of revealed differences is consistent with our knowledge about the specific difficulties in social functioning reported in individuals with AS (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0143034311415784">Gutstein &amp; Whitney, 2002</xref>). Our results may reflect these young people’s ability to gain insight into their relationships with classmates. The question of self-reflection in children and adolescents with AS in the context of difficulties experienced by them, e.g. in theory of mind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143034311415784">Frith &amp; Happé, 1999</xref>) has not been answered conclusively. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143034311415784">Frith (2004)</xref> notes that the analyses of these children’s utterances have demonstrated that their self-knowledge and sharing of knowledge with others is poor. She adds, however, that we can surmise from autobiographical publications that at least some adults with AS are capable of in-depth analyses of their experiences. Furthermore, research shows that young people with AS (aged 18- to 35-years-old) have a sense of ‘not quite fitting’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0143034311415784">Portway &amp; Johnson, 2005</xref>). This term describes the experience of people ‘who were not obviously different, but did not quite fit in to many aspects of daily living’ (p. 76). In a study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0143034311415784">Portway and Johnson (2005)</xref> participants reported experiencing the sense of ‘not quite fitting’ comprising a sense of being lost and misunderstood as early as in their school years. Our results seem to suggest that adolescents who participated in the study were able to assess their own situation in a questionnaire-based design. Similar results were obtained by other authors (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0143034311415784">Williamson, Craig, &amp; Slinger, 2008</xref>), who used questionnaires and found that young people with AS had lower self-esteem in social and athletic domains, as well as declaring that they received less peer approval. Based on similar analyses, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143034311415784">Cederlund, Hagberg, and Gillberg (2010)</xref> noted that self-rating questionnaires may supplement the process of diagnosing AS in adolescents.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that the only scale in which there were no differences between study groups in terms of perceiving their relationships with classmates was aggressiveness. The results could be slanted by need for social approval and unwillingness to admit to having acted in a way that is not accepted and considered reprehensible. The above interpretation would assume that adolescents with AS are sensitive to social evaluation of their behaviour. This is possible, especially in that the statements in the questionnaire referred to very specific and clear behaviours (e.g. ‘I tease and pick on my classmates’), directly reflecting basic norms and conventions of school life. Obviously, we cannot rule out that participants indeed rarely acted aggressively towards their peers. Such interpretation, however, is inconsistent with the higher incidence of declared sense of threat in the group of adolescents with AS compared to controls. The present study used no objective measures of social relationships of participating adolescents. Items covered in the ‘My classmates’ attitude towards me’ inventory are not designed to identify the types of violence they experienced. For that reason, the issue of interpretation of the lack of difference in terms of declared aggression between the groups remains open.</p>
<p>The results in terms of the relationship between the appraisal of classmates’ behaviour towards subjects and the behaviour subjects declared towards their peers were interesting. The relationship was similar in both groups. In each case, there was a positive correlation between declared tendency towards isolation from peers and assessment of their indifference, experienced sense of threat and sense of being under-appreciated. In addition, lack of readiness to engage in prosocial behaviour was positively correlated in both groups with the level of indifference from others and sense of being under-appreciated. Overall, the direction of the above relationships was consistent. Our results may reflect the importance of classmates’ attitudes for the regulation of social behaviours in adolescents with AS, similarly to typically developing adolescents. Thus, the specific difficulties in social relationships experienced by adolescents with AS may be compounded by their peers’ negative behaviours towards them, with the perception of peers’ behaviour by individuals with AS playing an important role in this process. A well-designed intervention may break the cycle of increasing social difficulties, thereby providing the potentially role for the school psychologists.</p>
<p>Perceived social support was also analysed in the present study. The amount of global support perceived by adolescents with AS was lower than in the control group. Similar results were obtained for appraisal and emotional support (no differences were found for informational and instrumental support). These results cannot be readily compared with other research studies, since we have not found similar studies on adolescents with AS. The differences revealed in the study seem to be compatible with the type of differences experienced by these young people in social relationships. It follows from our results that, not unlike their peers, they experience support in the form of receiving necessary information, advice, as well as concrete, material help from others. These forms of support are associated with specific actions of other people, which are easily described and understood by individuals with AS. Matters could be different in the case of behaviours aimed at providing appraisal or emotional support. They usually involve verbalization of messages which adolescents with AS may not recognize as supportive. It should be emphasized, though, that the statements contained in the questionnaire referred to specific behaviours (e.g. ‘They usually give me important tasks to do’). Thus, if we were to assume that participants understood the nature of these statements correctly, it would mean that they felt less supported emotionally. It is worth mentioning here the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143034311415784">Müller et al. (2008)</xref>, in which adults with AS specified the type of support they needed most. The forms of support they mentioned included various forms of assistance, but the majority focused on provision of information and proper structuring of the environment. Our results may suggest that young people with AS also require more and receive less emotional help than typically developing peers. Another possible interpretation is that individuals with AS are unable to make use, or even take notice of supportive behaviour of this kind. We also cannot rule out that due to the specific way individuals with AS function in social relationships, people in their surroundings provide them with less appraisal and emotional support.</p>
<p>Results regarding the sources of support received by these young people also merit closer scrutiny. Adolescents with AS, compared with typically developing peers, claimed that they received less support from classmates and more support from teachers. On the other hand, there were no differences between groups in terms of the amount of support from parents. These results may suggest that the efforts to support adolescents with AS by teachers are both recognized and appreciated by these young people. It should be noted, nevertheless, that the difference between the groups could result from the fact that typically developing adolescents were very critical of the support received from teachers. This is probably related to developmental patterns which see the importance of relationships with peers and friends increase alongside rising independence in the relationships with adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143034311415784">Laursen, Furman, &amp; Mooney, 2006</xref>). Despite this limitation, the important issue is that support provided by parents and teachers may play a key role in social inclusion of adolescents. It is an important moderator of the relationship between the violence they experience and the resulting emotional and behavioural problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0143034311415784">Yeung &amp; Leadbeater, 2010</xref>). Support from classmates was assessed as lower by adolescents with AS for all analysed types of support. This result is fully consistent with findings of studies that reveal the sense of loneliness experienced by this group (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143034311415784">Harvey, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0143034311415784">Whitehouse et al., 2009</xref>). It should be noted that, as was demonstrated in a study on typically developing children conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143034311415784">Murray-Harvey and Slee (2010)</xref>, poor social support from peers is a significant contributor to the experience of bullying/victimization. The experience of victimization, in turn, negatively affects the development of global self-worth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143034311415784">Boulton, Smith, &amp; Cowie, 2010</xref>). Poor peer relationships, lack of approval, and experience of rejection are also correlated with worse academic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143034311415784">Greenman, Schneider, &amp; Tomada, 2009</xref>). Problems of this sort are experienced by many adolescents with AS. Thus, an improvement in the relationships between students with AS and their typically developing peers could be particularly effective in preventing the experience of violence and in improving school achievement, as well as promoting the development of a positive self-image.</p>
<p>In the context of the results mentioned above, it would be interesting to answer the question whether social support received by adolescents correlates with their perception of their own relationships with peers. The results of correlation analyses performed separately for each group revealed some similarities between groups. Total social support correlated negatively with perceived relationships with classmates (total scores), support from others, sense of being appreciated and sociability in both groups. There were, however, interesting differences between this group of adolescents with AS and typically developing adolescents in terms of correlations between social support from parents and peers with perceived relationship with classmates. In the group of adolescents with AS, social support from peers was significantly correlated with perceived relationships with classmates, while the correlations between social support from parents perceived relationships with classmates were less profound. This was true both for of the overall perception of relationships with peers and for specific aspects of those relationships: Experiencing indifference, sense of threat, being under-appreciated, and tendency towards social isolation. The less peer support experienced by participants, the worse was their appraisal of their relationships with classmates in the aforementioned domains. In the group of typically developing adolescents, social support from parents played a more important role, while the correlations between support from peers and perceived relationships with classmates were non significant. Therefore, the appraisal of participants’ situation in class was positively correlated with the amount of support from parents. The results of these analyses show that perception of relationships with classmates in adolescents with AS is specifically associated with the level of support they provide. This finding is particularly significant if we consider the fact that adolescents with AS gave poorer assessments of support received from classmates than their typically developing peers. Hence the need to undertake actions to activate typically developing students to support their classmates with AS and to create social networks with peers taking important roles in them. It should be noted that the study investigated only one aspect of school inclusion: Relationships with peers. We did not take into account other indices of adaptation, such as learning achievements, absenteeism, or the well-being of participants. Thus, the pivotal role of support from classmates in the context of perceived relationships with peers was, to some extent, obvious.</p>
<p>There are a number of limitations of the present study. The study groups were relatively small. In addition, they included mostly individuals who participated in a full schedule of school activities. In the context of limited support offered by the majority of mainstream schools to students with AS in Poland, the implication is that the subjects were likely to be relatively high-functioning individuals. The level of functioning was not measured directly. Therefore we should be cautious when extrapolating our results and conclusions to the entire population of individuals with AS.</p>
<p>Moreover, there was significant variation in the experimental group in terms of age (12- to 17-years-old). Due to limited sample size, no analyses on the effects of age on study variables were performed, but this factor should certainly be accounted for in further studies.</p>
<p>The tools used in this study have good psychometric properties. The analysis of reliability performed on the study sample also showed the questionnaires we used to be highly useful. However, the questionnaires that were used were designed for the population of typically developing individuals. We do not know whether participants with AS had the same understanding of statements in the questionnaires as adolescents in the control group. Other authors found, for example, that adolescents with AS define friendship differently than their typically developing peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143034311415784">Carrington et al., 2003</xref>). Teenagers with this condition tend to refer in their definitions to issues of secondary importance: Similar interests, having fun together, or the length of relationship. The relationships they perceive as friendships are characterized by poor stability, and other people do not recognize them as true friendship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143034311415784">Church et al., 2000</xref>). Such reservations must also be taken into account in the interpretation of our results.</p>
<p>Despite those limitations, the study yielded interesting data, which may serve as a starting point for further research. Most importantly, it demonstrated a difference between adolescents with AS and typically developing adolescents not only in their evaluations of their classmates’ attitudes towards them, but also in their asserted behaviour towards their peers. Another finding was that these two aspects of relationships with classmates were related, also in the case of young people with AS. The lower the subjects’ perception of their peers’ attitude towards them, the less they were willing to engage in prosocial behaviour and the greater was their tendency towards isolation from others. The correlative paradigm adopted for the analysis of these variables do not render it possible to formulate cause-and-effect conclusions. The evidence for the co-occurrence of the above phenomena is in itself an interesting addition to our understanding of how adolescents with ASD perceive their social relationships. And finally, the confirmation of the special role of support received from classmates for the social inclusion of young people with AS should channel our efforts towards developing such methods for assisting these individuals that will incorporate ways of activating their peers. This is a role that is well suited to the skills and the position of school psychologist.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that school psychologists have a particularly important role to play in promoting inclusive education of children and youth with ASD. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143034311415784">Bartolo (2010)</xref> observes, although school psychologists often insist on recognizing the uniqueness and autonomy of each of their diverse clients, they often operate within a biomedical model which locates the origin of problems within clients. In order to fully understand the social situation of students with AS at school and identify the sources of difficulties they experience, it is necessary to abandon the confines of that model and analyse the complex web of influences between subjects who together form the school environment. An insight into the way adolescents with AS perceive classroom events would certainly contribute a great deal to our understanding of obstacles on the road to inclusive education. The knowledge gained from the present study emphasizes the importance of social support from peers for adolescents with AS. Obviously, with AS individuals’ difficulties in establishing social relationships being at the core of their condition, improving their relationships with peers is no easy task. However, effective work on enhancing that aspect of relationships which is related to classmates’ support seems possible, and methods to achieve that end are already available. One of them is the circle of friends approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143034311415784">Kalyva &amp; Avramidis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0143034311415784">Newton, Taylor, &amp; Wilson, 1996</xref>). It was designed to support school integration of children with AS by working with their peer group to get them involved in supporting individuals with AS. This approach helps create an environment where a pupil with AS may experience positive interactions with peers, learn to communicate with them successfully, while his classmates begin to understand his problems better.</p>
<p>Educational practice may benefit from the findings of the present study which suggest that adolescents with AS perceive more social support from teachers than typically developing adolescents. It is likely that pupils with AS receive objectively more support from their teachers, which could be associated with the teachers intervening in difficult situations which push the coping abilities of pupils with AS. Their support is certainly important in overcoming a range of problems. One can wonder, however, if in the case of adolescents it could be yet another factor negatively affecting their difficult relations with peers. While no negative correlations were found in the present study between the quality of relations with peers and the extent of support received from teachers, it seems that if some of the responsibility for integration could be transferred from teachers to classmates, it could have a positive impact on school adaptation of teenagers with AS.</p>
<p>The results of this study expand the body of knowledge on social relationships of youth with AS at school already found in literature with data from a country other than USA and UK, where the majority of research has been done to date. They show that despite significant differences between educational systems in Poland and these countries, in all of them adolescents with AS experience similar problems in their relationships with classmates. As such, their problems appear to have a universal dimension and to pose similar challenges to schools as far as inclusive education of children with ASD is concerned.</p>
