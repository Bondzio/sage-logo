<abstract>
<p>An avulsion fracture is a separation of a small fragment of a bone cortex at the site of a ligament or tendon attachment. It is commonly seen in adolescent athletes. The mechanism of injury is either a sudden violent muscular contraction or an excessive amount of muscle stretch across an open epiphysis. This may also occur where the bone has been weakened by osteoporosis or local lesion. The common sites of avulsion injuries are the tibial tubercle and the medial epicondyle. However, hip avulsion fractures are not uncommon. They may occur in adolescents, young adults and in elderly people. There are various protocols for management depending on the patient’s age, mechanism of injury and the underlying pathology.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1460408611420356"><title>Anatomical review</title>
<p>The hip joint is a synovial joint formed by the articulation of the rounded head of the femur and the cup-like acetabulum of the pelvis. Its primary function is to support the weight of the body in both static and dynamic postures.</p>
<p>Both joint surfaces are covered with a strong but lubricated layer of articular hyaline cartilage. The cup-like acetabulum is formed from the union of the three pelvic bones, the ilium, pubis and ischium. The Y-shaped growth plate that separates them, the triradiate cartilage, is fused definitively at age 14–16 years. The hip is a special type of spheroidal or ball and socket joint where the roughly spherical femoral head is largely contained within the acetabulum, and has an average radius of curvature of 2.5 cm. The acetabulum grasps almost half of the femoral head, a grip augmented by a ring-shaped fibrocartilaginous lip, the acetabular labrum, which extends the joint beyond the equator. The head of the femur is attached to the shaft by a thin neck region that is prone to fracture in the elderly as a consequence primarily of osteoporosis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1460408611420356"><title>Ligaments</title>
<p>The hip joint is reinforced by five ligaments. Four ligaments are extracapsular and one is intracapsular. The extracapsular ligaments are the iliofemoral, ischiofemoral and pubofemoral ligaments attached to the bones of the pelvis (the ilium, ischium and pubis, respectively). All three strengthen the capsule and prevent an excessive range of movement in the joint. Of these, the Y-shaped and twisted iliofemoral ligament is the strongest ligament in the human body. It prevents the trunk from falling backward without the need for muscular activity in the upright position. In the sitting position, the ligament becomes relaxed, thus permitting the pelvis to tilt backward into its sitting position. The ischiofemoral ligament prevents medial rotation while the pubofemoral ligament restricts abduction in the hip joint. The zona orbicularis, which lies like a collar around the narrowest part of the femoral neck, is covered by the other ligaments which partly radiates into it.</p>
<p>The zona orbicularis acts like a buttonhole on the femoral head and assists in maintaining the contact in the joint. The intracapsular ligament, the ligamentum teres, is attached to a depression in the acetabulum. It also attaches to the acetabular notch, and the fovea of the femoral head which is seen as a depression in the head on radiographs. It is only stretched when the hip is dislocated and may then prevent further displacement. As a ligament, it has a small role in restraint of the femoral head but acts as an important conduit for a small artery to the head of the femur. This arterial branch is not universally present but can become the only blood supply to the head of the femur when the neck of the femur is fractured or disrupted by injury in childhood.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1460408611420356"><title>Epidemiology</title>
<p>The mechanism of an avulsion fracture is essentially a failure of the bone placed under tension through a tendon or ligament attachment. This may occur where the bone has been weakened by osteoporosis or a local lesion. It has also been described following surgery after hip replacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1460408611420356">Maheshwari et al., 2010</xref>) and in young people where the forces through the growing skeleton lead to apophyseal detachment. The common sites of avulsion injuries include the tibial tubercle and the medial epicondyle.</p>
<p>Avulsion fractures are uncommon and occur in a number of sites in the hip region presenting with similar symptoms and signs. The reported sites include the anterior inferior iliac spine, the lesser and the greater trochanters, the ischial tuberosity and finally the ligamentum teres.</p>
<p>Traumatic lesser trochanteric fractures result from a sudden pull of the iliopsoas muscle and have been described most commonly in the literature as a consequence of a hip injury while playing football, often when going to clear the ball (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1460408611420356">Figure 1</xref>). Fractures without a good history of trauma should be treated as suspicious because they often occur in weakened bone. Malignancies resulting in lesser trochanteric fractures have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408611420356">Afra et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1460408611420356">James and Davies, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408611420356">Heiney and Leeson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1460408611420356">Figure 2</xref>). Spontaneous rupture of the iliopsoas tendon has also been described as happening a few days after total hip arthroplasty. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1460408611420356">Figure 3</xref>).

<p>Ischial tuberosity avulsion fractures occur as a result of a sudden forceful hamstring contraction or stretching. The latter occurs when the hip is excessively flexed with the knee in full extension. Among athletes, the injury is most commonly seen in footballers and gymnasts. Ischial tuberosity fractures also occur in sprinters, long-jumpers and hurdlers. The athlete usually presents with severe buttock or groin pain. Sitting may be painful. Patients often have difficulty walking and are unable to run (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408611420356">Bolgla et al., 2001</xref>). Avulsion fractures are sometimes misdiagnosed initially as soft tissue injuries leading to late representation often with chronic pain and disability from reduced mobility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1460408611420356">Figure 4</xref>).
<fig id="fig4-1460408611420356" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Left-sided ischial tuberosity avulsion fractures approximately 1 year old.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1460408611420356-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Anterior inferior iliac spine avulsion fractures are rare and once again the diagnosis is often missed. Patients often present with pain during sporting activity preventing them from being able to compete effectively and causing a limp after activity. A high index of suspicion is needed to detect them in order to prevent ongoing symptoms and facilitate a return to sport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1460408611420356">Rajasekhar et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1460408611420356">Figure 5</xref>).
<fig id="fig5-1460408611420356" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Anterior inferior iliac spine fracture.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1460408611420356-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Dislocation of the hip joint in young children is uncommon following trauma. Since the hip skeleton remains cartilaginous until teenage years, this may occur after relatively low-velocity trauma in comparison to adults. It often occurs in association with other signs of ligamentous laxity and instability in other joints. Spontaneous reduction often occurs and if the hip remains out of joint, relocation can quite easily be achieved through closed methods under general anaesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408611420356">Bigelow, 1878</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1460408611420356">Stimson, 1889</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408611420356">Allis, 1895</xref>).</p>
<p>However in a few cases of hip dislocation in children, ligamentum teres avulsion has been described. This often occurs following fracture of the acetabulum and may on occasion be seen in association with a femoral head fracture. This may lead to segments of the femoral head which are often cartilaginous at this stage, becoming trapped within the joint causing mechanical symptoms.</p>
<p>One case has been reported in the literature in a 5-year-old girl who essentially stumbled down three stairs and then was unable to weight bear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408611420356">Barrett and Goldberg, 1989</xref>). Clinically, hip movements were restricted and painful. A radiograph revealed a widened joint space suggesting something was trapped within the joint. In view of the incongruity seen on imaging, the hip joint was explored and an osteocartilaginous fragment which was attached to the ligamentum teres was found. The ligamentum teres and fragment of bone were excised. The hip was then reduced easily.</p>
<p>Isolated greater trochanteric fractures have been reported to occur after direct trauma and can also result from avulsion injuries in adolescents. A possible iatrogenic case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1460408611420356">Figure 6</xref>) occurred in a 13-year-old boy after surgery for slipped capital femoral epiphysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1460408611420356">Ceroni et al., 2004</xref>).
<fig id="fig6-1460408611420356" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Left-sided greater trochanter avulsion fracture.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1460408611420356-fig6.tif"/></fig></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1460408611420356"><title>Clinical findings</title>
<p>Regardless of aetiology, patients will have pain in the groin and weakness of hip flexion. It is possible to detect this reduction in strength when the patient is either supine or in the standing position. Patients often describe difficulty moving the hip and leg or trouble sitting.</p>
<p>The pain is often worse when the affected area is palpated. The patient may also have trouble walking, requiring the aid of crutches or may not be able to walk at all.</p>
<p>Undiagnosed anterior inferior iliac spine and ischial tuberosity avulsion fracture is common. Patients present more insidiously with chronic hip pain similar to that described by patients with osteoarthritis which often leads to a radiograph being requested and the diagnosis being made fortuitously. A high index of suspicion in these cases is required.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1460408611420356"><title>Investigations</title>
<p>Plain radiographs often detect trochanteric fractures in healthy adolescents with a history of sudden localised hip pain after heavy exercise that does not settle. The patient will often be struggling to walk.</p>
<p>When there is no history of trauma, the investigation of choice is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan as this will rule out other diagnoses for hip pain in the young child (for example). This is also the investigation of choice when the plain radiograph is normal and the patient cannot weight bear. MRI has been shown by many authors to reveal occult fractures including those in the greater trochanter. MRI detected greater trochanter fractures have a high association with intertrochanteric fractures which may require stabilisation depending on the stability of the fracture configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1460408611420356">Chana et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In ligamentum teres and femoral head avulsion fractures, plain radiographs are often not enough to make the diagnosis and further imaging including computerised tomography (CT) and MRI scans may be required in order to detect these avulsions. These imaging modalities will also pick up muscle avulsions, bone bruising and in some cases infection or rarely malignancy.</p>
<p>The presence of a destructive lesion on radiographs should lead to a suspicion of metastatic disease or another underlying pathological process. In this situation, further diagnostic studies including technetium-99 bone scanning are required to look for spread. A CT of the abdomen/pelvis/chest allows the detection of the majority of primary tumours likely to lead to skeletal metastases and facilitates staging. MRI and CT scans of the lesion allows the surgeon to determine the local extent of the deposit and consider any site specific problems with reconstruction or potential to damage important local structures such as neurovascular structures.</p>
<p>While the most likely cause of a destructive lesion in a patient over the age of 40 years is a secondary deposit, other tumours such as myeloma and lymphoma should also be suspected. Immunoprotein electrophoresis should be performed along with the usual chemistry panels, haematological studies and measurement of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate.</p>
<p>If the investigations are indeterminate or there is evidence of a primary bone tumour or isolated renal metastases, an urgent referral to a specialist bone tumour centre should be made.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1460408611420356"><title>Treatment</title>
<p>Isolated lesser and greater trochanteric fractures are normally treated conservatively. The need for any operative intervention depends on the individual’s level of activity and the quality of the bone. Reattachment in the presence of osteoporosis or a destructive lesion may not be technically feasible.</p>
<p>Conservative treatment is advised initially unless the hip joint itself is affected. The aim is to control pain with rest and pain killers including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and to re-establish a normal gait. Physiotherapy will assess how the patient transfers weight between each leg and single-leg stance balancing. Patients then begin exercises to improve hip range of movements, hip strength and neuromuscular coordination.</p>
<p>Surgery includes various reattachment techniques such as screws or sutures, thus reversing the forces of tension that led to the avulsion. Surgeons may need to address changes in the tendon or recess the tendon as it has often been stretched before the avulsion has occurred. Often tension band wiring techniques or a simple reattachment via a lagged screw achieve good reduction and hold the avulsed fragment in a well-reduced position. Transosseous sutures augment the repair or may be used as primary stabilisation for smaller lesions with or without anchors.</p>
<p>Ischial tuberosity avulsion fractures are usually treated conservatively. An indication for surgical exploration is disturbance of the sciatic nerve.</p>
<p>Anterior inferior iliac spine avulsion fractures are most often treated conservatively but operative intervention is carefully considered in patients with long-standing pain and disability. Indications radiographically for surgery are significant displacement of the avulsed fragment more than 2 cm, non-union of the fracture and avulsion in relation to exostosis formation. The surgery will then involve a open reduction and internal fixation technique.</p>
<p>In case of the acetabular fractures with significant avulsion, fragment fixation may be indicated but this is often carried out in specialist centres when the congruency of the joint is affected. Once open reduction is secured, a provisional fixation is established by means of Kirschner (K-wires) and, sometimes, cerclage wires. Definitive fixation is then established by means of screws or plates depending on the fracture shape.</p>
<p>Osteochondral lesions may require reduction or excision to restore congruency within the joint where these fragments develop after dislocation as previously detailed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1460408611420356" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Accurate history taking and thorough physical examination followed by adequate imaging are essential factors in making a diagnosis of hip avulsion fracture. Most cases will settle with conservative treatment. However, surgical reconstruction may be required depending on the condition of the skeleton locally. If a pathological fracture is suspected, investigations to detect the primary and any spread should be carried out prior to any local treatments.</p>
