<p>We begin the year with good news for <italic>Humanity and Society (H&amp;S)</italic>. Sage is now the official publisher of the journal. In considering the future sustainability of H&amp;S, identifying a publisher that could centralize the submission process and handle the mechanics of production became a priority when we stepped in as editors. We saw in Sage, a good fit for the Association for Humanist Sociology (AHS), an association founded as a reaction to mainstream sociological organizations. In additional to their reputation as an academic press, Sage has a history of social engagement, green initiatives, and corporate responsibility. Sage is also a founding member of the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association. The press is run by publishers, <italic>not</italic> investors, and, like AHS, Sage believes that “that engaged scholarship lies at the heart of any healthy society.” Sage currently publishes a number of sociology journals and typically sells an entire sociology “package” to libraries. This means that <italic>H&amp;S</italic> subscriptions will be sold along with a long list of other sociology journals will enable us to reach a wider audience. We look forward to a long and productive relationship with Sage.</p>
<p>This issue of <italic>H&amp;S</italic> begins with the second installment of Charles Koeber’s two-part series on consumptive labor. In his first article, “Consumptive Labor: The Increasing Importance of Consumers in the Labor Process” (H&amp;S, Vol. 35(3)), Koeber demonstrated how businesses manipulate consumers to perform work. In Part 2, “Self-Service in the Labor Press: Control and Consent in the Performance of ‘Consumptive Labor’,” Charles Koeber, along with David Wright and Elizabeth Dingler, examine why consumers are so willing to perform consumptive labor. Taken together, this series on consumptive labor offers compelling insights into the inner workings of the “new economy.”</p>
<p>In “What is it that these people want? Are we part of some kind of experiment?”: Mentoring in a Women’s Prison,” Lora Bex Lempert and her graduate students Christina LaRose, Laura Freeman, and Lesia Liss discuss their experiences with mentoring women prisoners in college-level courses. Through their account we receive first hand insight into not only how sociology, pedagogy, and theory played out in the mentoring but also how the authors grew and were challenged by the experience. Beyond seeking to change the prison system, the importance of building learning communities, respect for intelligent thinking, and finding the language to critically examine opportunities and challenges became evident to Lempert and her students.</p>
<p>In “Title IX and the School Experiences of Pregnant and Mothering Students”</p>
<p>Mary Erdmans offers us a compelling look into the larger systemic problems that lead to educational inequality among pregnant and mothering students. Through conducting life-story interviews, Erdmans identifies patterns that indicate why pregnant and mothering students stay or leave school. A final discussion on “fragile students and fragile schools” provides insight into how social and economic disadvantages contribute to school failure and how friendly school environments helped students stay connected to school.</p>
<p>In his action note, Ben Brucato, follows in the footsteps of cultural critic Douglas Rushkoff by leaving behind 20th-century perspectives of politics and economics to analyze a 21st-century movement—Occupy Wall Street. In doing so, Brucato posits the Occupy Wall Street movement as the first worldwide postmodern uprising, one lacking the hierarchy and rationalization present in other social movements. His analysis provides a view of Occupy that has not been examined in the mainstream media, specifically the ways in which the movement is structured to allow participants to shape its evolving politics.</p>
<p>The reviews in this issue offer a potpourri of astute and creative analyses of book and multimedia material for our consideration. Mary Chayko’s review of Korgan and White’s <italic>The Engaged Sociologist</italic> contemplates the many ways we can use Korgan and White’s highly accessible book into our courses. Emma Bailey’s review of Dunn’s <italic>Judging Victims: Why We Stigmatize Survivors, and How They Claim Respect</italic> offers an analysis of how this work contributes to our understanding of the victims of gendered violence as well as the shortfalls in Dunn’s analysis. Damien Contessa explores how the film <italic>127 Hours</italic> exemplifies the notion of “ecological identity” and the negotiation of the social and ecological embeddedness of human existence. Finally, Bhoomi Thakore’s review of <italic>Slumdog Millionaire</italic> highlights the challenges that film representations of life in India have with addressing the social problems that they aim to portray.</p>
<p>Our “Final Thought” ends with a piece of visual sociology that examines race and class through the lens of a political cartoon created by Rick Hotton and Shawn Bingham. Each contribution here raises poignant questions and continues an important humanist dialogue that we feel is lacking in our discipline. We look forward to amplifying this voice as we partner with Sage. Thanks for reading and sharing H&amp;S with your colleagues.</p>
