<abstract>
<p>Information about the undergraduate psychology courses preferred by graduate programs is useful for a number of purposes, including (a) advising psychology majors who are interested in graduate school, (b) undergraduate curriculum planning, and (c) examining whether graduate programs’ preferences reflect national guidelines for the undergraduate psychology curriculum. The authors examined the undergraduate course preferences of U.S. psychology graduate programs (<italic>N</italic> = 548). Among Clinical/Counseling (C/C) programs, PsyD programs’ course preferences were more likely than those of master’s and PhD programs to reflect national undergraduate curriculum guidelines. Differences also emerged among various types of training (e.g., C/C vs. Educational/School), and these are important for advisors and students to understand.</p>

<p>To provide valuable information to undergraduate students interested in graduate school and their advisors, several authors have summarized data on graduate school admissions criteria, such as grade point averages, Graduate Record Examination scores, and the importance of nonobjective criteria such as letters of recommendation and work experience (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0098628312450430">Keith-Spiegel, Tabachnick, &amp; Spiegel, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0098628312450430">Landrum, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0098628312450430">Lawson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0098628312450430">Norcross, Kohout, &amp; Wicherski, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0098628312450430">Smith, 1985</xref>). The American Psychological Association’s (APA) <italic>Graduate Study in Psychology (GSP)</italic> has been a popular source for this information, and recent editions of <italic>GSP</italic> (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0098628312450430">APA, 2010</xref>) provide updated summary statistics on these criteria. Undergraduate course preferences of graduate programs (as reported in the <italic>GSP</italic>) have also been analyzed by previous researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0098628312450430">Lawson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0098628312450430">Smith, 1985</xref>). However, <italic>GSP</italic> no longer reports undergraduate course preferences.</p>
<p>Information about the undergraduate psychology courses preferred by graduate programs is useful for a number of purposes, including (a) advising psychology majors who are interested in graduate school (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0098628312450430">Lawson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0098628312450430">Smith, 1985</xref>), (b) undergraduate curriculum planning, and (c) examining whether graduate programs’ preferences reflect national guidelines for and actual requirements of undergraduate psychology curricula (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0098628312450430">APA, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0098628312450430">Dunn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0098628312450430">Stoloff et al., 2010</xref>). We updated and expanded upon the course preference information provided by Lawson more than 17 years ago. Because of the growth in industrial/organizational (I/O) and PsyD programs during the past two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0098628312450430">Norcross et al., 2005</xref>), we (a) compared Clinical/Counseling (C/C) PsyD, master’s, and PhD programs and (b) examined course preferences of I/O graduate programs.</p>
<sec id="section1-0098628312450430" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>We searched for course preferences on the websites of all 548 U.S. graduate departments listed in <italic>GSP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0098628312450430">APA, 2010</xref>). Consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0098628312450430">Smith (1985</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0098628312450430">Lawson (1995</xref>), we also (a) recorded the highest degree (master’s, PsyD, or PhD) and type of training (C/C, experimental, educational/school ([E/S]), I/O, or mixed); (b) classified as experimental any programs (e.g., developmental, social) that did not offer C/C, E/S, or I/0 training; (c) classified as E/S any programs that offered training in educational, school, or school counseling; and (d) classified as Mixed any programs that specified identical course preferences for at least two different types of training from the aforementioned categories (or offered general psychology training). If a department listed separate course preferences for different degrees or for different types of training, we recorded these as separate programs; the result was a total of 645 programs.<sup>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We found that 332 (60.6%) of the 548 departments listed at least one psychology course that was not general psychology, and we recorded course preferences for 429 programs within these departments. Under the assumption that we obtained the population of graduate programs of interest, we did not conduct inferential statistical analyses. Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0098628312450430">Lawson (1995</xref>), we calculated that percentage of the 429 programs listing each course and considered a difference of 10% or more between programs meaningful. Consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0098628312450430">Smith (1985</xref>) and Lawson, general psychology and any courses not listed by at least 5% of programs were excluded from the analysis. Overall, Statistics and Research were listed by a majority of programs (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0098628312450430">Table 1</xref>). Abnormal and Developmental were listed by more than 30% of programs. Personality and Biopsychology were listed by more than 20% of programs; and Learning, Social, Testing, and Cognitive were listed by more than 10% of programs. History and Sensation/Perception were listed by more than 5% of programs.</p>

<p>Statistics and Research were listed most frequently by all of the different types of programs. C/C programs listed Abnormal, Developmental, Personality, and Biopsychology more frequently than the overall group of programs. E/S programs listed Developmental, Learning, and Testing more frequently and Biopsychology less frequently than the overall group. I/O programs listed Research, Abnormal, Developmental, Personality, Biopsychology, and Learning less frequently than the overall group of programs; Social, Cognitive, Testing, and Personality were the most preferred content courses among I/O programs. Experimental programs listed Abnormal, Developmental, Personality, and Testing less frequently than the overall group; these programs listed Cognitive, Biopsychology, Developmental, and Learning most frequently. Mixed programs listed Abnormal, Developmental, and Personality less frequently than the overall group, but these three courses were among their most preferred content courses, along with Learning, Biopsychology, and Social.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of this study provide useful information for undergraduate advising and curriculum planning. Our faculty used the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0098628312450430">Lawson (1995</xref>) and this study to help design our psychology major requirements to best prepare students for graduate study. Advisors may use this information to make beginning psychology majors aware of the important differences in the course preferences of different types of programs. For example, Abnormal, Developmental, and Personality are important for students planning on applying to C/C programs, but less important for students applying to Experimental, I/O, or Mixed programs. Students applying to E/S programs should take courses in Abnormal, Personality, Developmental, Learning, and Testing. Although I/O programs seemed to have very few specific course preferences, Research and Social appear to be the most important courses for students interested in I/O programs (followed by Cognitive, Personality, and Testing). Finally, students who have interests in multiple areas of psychology and are considering applying to different types of graduate programs should take the top courses listed by All or Mixed programs, which include Abnormal, Developmental, Personality, Learning, Biopsychology, and Social.</p>
<p>Because C/C PsyD programs tend to focus primarily on preparing students for clinical practice and typically have less extensive research training than do PhD programs, it’s not surprising that Research was listed less frequently by the former than the latter. We found it interesting, however, that PsyD programs listed Abnormal, Developmental, Personality, Social, and Testing more frequently than did PhD programs. Perhaps this reflects PsyD programs’ emphasis on clinical practice, ensuring that students have broad training in a variety of content domains relevant for professional practice.</p>
<p>Recent recommendations for the undergraduate psychology curriculum suggest that all psychology majors should be trained in certain core content areas. Following the recommendations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0098628312450430">APA (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0098628312450430">Dunn et al. (2009</xref>) suggested that “students should complete at least one course in each of four specific domains: biological bases, developmental, learning and cognition, and sociocultural approaches” (pp. 55–56). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0098628312450430">APA (2007)</xref> also recommended training in the history of psychology. Both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0098628312450430">Dunn et al. (2009</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0098628312450430">Stoloff et al. (2010</xref>) suggested that courses in general psychology, research methods and statistics, biopsychology, developmental psychology, social psychology, cognitive psychology, personality, and history and systems are part of the core content of psychology programs.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0098628312450430">Stoloff et al. (2010</xref>) found that undergraduate psychology programs are ensuring that virtually all students take courses in general psychology and research methods and statistics, but fewer than half of students are required to take the other core content courses. Similarly, we found that among graduate programs that specified course preferences the vast majority listed research methods and statistics as preferred courses. However, fewer than half listed Abnormal, Developmental, Personality, and Biopsychology; and less than 20% listed Learning, Social, Cognitive, and History. Thus, it appears that neither the requirements of undergraduate psychology programs nor the undergraduate course preferences listed by graduate programs are completely in compliance with the aforementioned curricular recommendations. However, PsyD programs are much closer to this goal than are PhD and master’s programs. Chairpersons and directors of PhD and master’s programs might want to consider listing more of these core content areas as preferred courses. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0098628312450430">Dunn et al. (2009</xref>) suggested, trends in doctoral programs might “motivate changes in the undergraduate psychology curriculum” (p. 51).</p>
<p>One potential limitation of our study is the method we used to collect data on graduate programs’ course preferences. Previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0098628312450430">Lawson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0098628312450430">Smith, 1985</xref>) obtained data from <italic>GSP</italic>, which made it easy to find course preference information. Because <italic>GSP</italic> no longer includes this information, searching schools’ websites seemed to be the best way to obtain it for our study. We assumed that websites would be updated regularly to provide accurate information to prospective graduate students. In addition, we found that a number of departments listed separate course preferences for different types of training, but <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0098628312450430">Smith (1985</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0098628312450430">Lawson (1995</xref>) did not report a similar phenomenon. Thus, we suspect that websites might also allow departments to provide more detail than was provided in <italic>GSP</italic>. However, course preference information can be difficult to locate on some schools’ websites, and different schools place it in different areas of their websites (e.g., in some cases, we had to examine online application forms to find course preference information). To make our search comprehensive, we had two or three researchers search the websites where no course preference information was found on the first attempt. The facts that (a) our percentage of departments reporting course preferences (60.6%) was similar to a previous study that used the <italic>GSP</italic> (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0098628312450430">Smith, 1985</xref>; 63.6%) and (b) our list of the top 12 courses and overall percentages associated with most of them were similar those presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0098628312450430">Lawson (1995</xref>) gives us more confidence in the adequacy of our method of collecting data.<sup>

<p>Consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0098628312450430">Lawson (1995</xref>), courses were counted as preferred if they were listed as required, recommended, or as an option among several courses. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0098628312450430">Stoloff et al. (2010</xref>) reported the predicted percentage of undergraduate students who would take various psychology courses based on undergraduate psychology program requirements. To examine comparable data based on graduate school recommendations, we created a second data base in which optional courses were assigned scores that reflected the percentage of students who might take each course if they followed the graduate school’s recommendations (e.g., a score of .60 was assigned to each course if students could choose three out of five courses); required and recommended courses that were not optional were assigned a value of 1. Because the mean percentages from this analysis were quite similar to the percentages reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0098628312450430">Table 1</xref>, we did not include these data in our report. The differences between the mean percentages and those listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0098628312450430">Table 1</xref> ranged from 0 to 8.6 points (<italic>M</italic> = 3.31, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.28), therefore none of them reached the 10% criterion we used to examine meaningful differences.</p>

<label>2.</label>
<p>Note, however, that there were some interesting differences between our results for all programs and those of previous studies. For example, the percentage we found for Learning was 13.3 points lower than that reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0098628312450430">Lawson (1995</xref>). In addition, Cognitive has continued to grow in popularity, from below the 5% criterion in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0098628312450430">Smith (1985</xref>) to 8.8% reported in Lawson to 14.9% in our data. These changes may reflect a historical decline in popularity of Learning and increase in popularity of Cognitive, but they may also reflect differences in data collection methods or changes in the types of programs listed in the <italic>GSP</italic> over the years.</p>
