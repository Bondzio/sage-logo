<abstract>
<p>In this article we explore the micro-social context of parental tobacco use in the first years of a child’s life and early childhood. We conducted individual interviews with 28 mothers and fathers during the 4 years following the birth of their child. Using grounded theory methods, we identified the predominant explanatory concept in parents’ accounts as the need to reconcile being a parent and smoking. Desires to become smoke-free coexisted with five types of parent–child interactions: (a) protecting the defenseless child, (b) concealing smoking and cigarettes from the mimicking child, (c) reinforcing smoking as bad with the communicative child, (d) making guilt-driven promises to the fearful child, and (e) relinquishing personal responsibility to the autonomous child. We examine the agency of the child in influencing parents’ smoking practices, the importance of children’s observational learning in the early years, and the reciprocal nature of parent–child interactions related to parents’ smoking behavior.</p>

<p>The early childrearing years can be a period of significant change for families, resulting in personal, caregiving, and work-related challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732313494118">Deave, Johnson, &amp; Ingram, 2008</xref>). Parents who smoke make decisions about tobacco use amid these changes, and various smoking practices and related interactions emerge for individuals and couples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732313494118">Bottorff et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732313494118">Bottorff et al., 2006</xref>). Knowledge of the health effects of secondhand smoke (SHS) prompts parents who smoke to minimize their infant’s exposure to SHS and, for some, to reduce or stop smoking. The adverse health effects of children’s exposure to SHS are well established and include reduced immunity, increased risk of infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049732313494118">Tebow et al., 2008</xref>), and respiratory disorders including bronchiolitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732313494118">Gürkan, Kıral, Dağlı, &amp; Karakoç, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732313494118">Moshammer et al., 2006</xref>) and otitis media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732313494118">DiFranza, Aligne, &amp; Weitzman, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the disease outcomes of SHS are well established, the social and behavioral impacts of parental smoking on children have also garnered research attention, and evidence suggests that children’s future use of tobacco is impacted by their parents’ smoking behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732313494118">Bauman, Foshee, Linzer, &amp; Koch, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732313494118">Paul, Blizzard, Patton, Dwyer, &amp; Venn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732313494118">Richter &amp; Richter, 2001</xref>). A 9-year prospective study of 3,000 children and their parents showed that when parents quit smoking they reduced the chance of their child becoming a smoker by almost 40%. When both parents had never smoked, the risk of their child smoking was reduced by approximately 70% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732313494118">Bricker et al., 2003</xref>). Efforts to prevent child and adolescent smoking have included interventions directed at parents to foster long-term cessation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732313494118">Müller-Riemenschneider et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Research on the protective influences of parents’ antismoking socialization on children suggests that the children of parents who smoke are less likely to initiate smoking if the parents make cigarettes inaccessible, talk disapprovingly about tobacco, and impose consequences for smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732313494118">Jackson &amp; Dickinson, 2006</xref>). Counter-arguments to this view indicate children are more likely to model parental substance use when the parent–child relationship is positive and conflict-free (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732313494118">Andrews, Hops, &amp; Duncan, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The changing social context of smoking in many Western countries associated with significant declines in smoking rates has resulted in increased stigmatization of smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732313494118">Bayer &amp; Colgrove, 2002</xref>). Although parents who smoke are increasingly aware of how others view their smoking and might be motivated to quit, many parents find it difficult to quit smoking and to maintain their cessation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732313494118">Bottorff et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732313494118">Greaves, Oliffe, Ponic, Kelly, &amp; Bottorff, 2010</xref>). For example, although close to half of pregnant women who smoke (46%) stop smoking during pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732313494118">Colman &amp; Joyce, 2003</xref>), relapse rates reach 50% at 6 months postpartum (Colman &amp; Joyce) and 70% to 90% by one year postpartum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732313494118">Klesges, Johnson, Ward, &amp; Barnard, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732313494118">Mullen, Richardson, Quinn, &amp; Ershoff, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732313494118">Secker-Walker et al., 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Although smoking cessation rates during pregnancy have increased, prepregnancy smoking prevalence and postpartum relapse rates remain stable, especially among younger women with less education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732313494118">Colman &amp; Joyce, 2003</xref>). Even though men who smoke are often prompted to reconsider their smoking practices as they transition into fatherhood, men’s smoking is often compartmentalized and separated from their domestic life and direct fathering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732313494118">Bottorff, Radsma, Kelly, &amp; Oliffe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732313494118">Oliffe, Bottorff, Johnson, Kelly, &amp; LeBeau, 2010</xref>), and these arrangements support men’s continued smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732313494118">Johnson, Ratner, Bottorff, Hall, &amp; Dahinten, 2000</xref>). Efforts to protect fetal and infant health have focused on women’s smoking cessation, whereas expectant and new fathers who smoke have rarely been the target of smoking cessation programs.</p>
<p>Although most attention has focused on reducing SHS in homes to protect children’s health, there are some examples in the literature addressing the significance of children’s vicarious learning about cigarette use in family contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732313494118">Dalton et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732313494118">de Leeuw, Verhagen, de Wit, Scholte, &amp; Engels, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732313494118">Jackson &amp; Henrikson, 1997</xref>). Supported by longstanding evidence that confirms new behaviors are acquired through social learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732313494118">Bandura, 1986</xref>), this research points to the influence of parental modeling of smoking as well as parental communication, rule setting, and other socialization practices on children’s perceptions of smoking (Bandura; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732313494118">Dalton et al., 2005</xref>). However, tobacco research has focused narrowly on parental smoking patterns in terms of prevalence, demographics, prevention, and cessation, emphasizing the biomedical risks of tobacco exposure for children, and neglecting, for the most part, perspectives from social learning or developmental psychology. In addition, it is unclear how children and their behaviors might influence parents’ smoking practices. Although much research has focused specifically on mothers or fathers, we hold the position that parents (regardless of gender) are important social units and it is important to consider how their practices influence and are influenced by their interactions with their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732313494118">Gatrell, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The objective of this study was to understand how young children influence parental smoking practices. We reasoned that an in-depth understanding about parents’ smoking practices in relation to their constructions about their child’s understanding of smoking, response to SHS, and developmental change might be helpful in planning effective tobacco-reduction programs for parents. For the purpose of this study, we conceptualized the mothers and fathers as parents in accord with sociological literature that has identified a trend among contemporary couples with young children to live and parent as a “tag-team,” both performing work outside and inside the home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732313494118">Dienhart, 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>We employed grounded theory methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732313494118">Charmaz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732313494118">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>) to explore family social processes and to understand how the presence of a child in a family might impact parental smoking over time. It is important to note that parents’ knowledge about developmental milestones was not the focus of this study; participants’ descriptions about how their smoking practices shifted as their child developed was the key consideration.</p>

<sec id="section2-1049732313494118">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>Twenty-eight parent dyads (defined as individuals living in a heterosexual relationship in the same household) were recruited. We included couples with a diverse range of smoking histories. Among the female participants, all were smokers prior to pregnancy. More than half (<italic>n</italic> = 15) reduced or quit smoking during pregnancy and relapsed during the postpartum period, and the remaining women quit during pregnancy and remained smoke free. Among male partners, there were only 10 who were nonsmokers or exsmokers prior to their partner’s pregnancy. Among the 18 men who smoked, the smoking patterns of 11 remained unchanged during pregnancy and following the birth of their infant; although 3 men reduced their smoking, 2 relapsed to regular smoking. Only 2 men quit during their partner’s pregnancy and remained smoke free. The ages of the participants ranged from 22 to 43 years; however, most of the men and women were in their 30s (<italic>n</italic> = 20, respectively). The majority of the women reported annual incomes under CAD$60,000 and the majority of men reported annual incomes under CAD$80,000. Forty percent of the women and 57% of the men identified as being Anglo Canadian; other ethnicities in the sample included Asian, European, First Nations, Latino, and Pacific Islanders.</p>
<p>The participants were recruited at a maternity hospital and through advertising in local community newspapers. The women and their partners who were recruited in the maternity hospital were enrolled in a larger study and interviewed initially for this part of the investigation when their child became a year old. To expand the sample and include couples with children of different ages, we recruited and interviewed women and their partners from the community who had a child between 12 and 48 months of age. The participants were told that the study was about smoking in families with young children and was part of a research program to reduce tobacco use in families. They received a consent form with a plain-language description of the study. Participants were offered an honorarium of CAD$25 for each interview to acknowledge their contribution to the study. The study was reviewed and approved by a university behavioral ethics board.</p>
<sec id="section3-1049732313494118">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Individual, in-depth interviews were conducted with 28 women and their male partners. Because the topic of smoking is often a sensitive issue, to ensure honest and reliable responses we interviewed parents separately. Three of the couples who were interviewed when their child was a year old agreed to participate in a follow-up interview when their child was between 2 and 3 years of age. The remaining parents each participated in one interview. This sampling approach enabled us to explore variations in parental smoking practices in relation to children’s development during three phases: (a) 12 to 19 months, (b) 20 to 35 months, and (c) 36 to 48 months. We interviewed 16 dyads at Age-stage 1 (12 to 19 months), 12 dyads at Age-stage 2 (20 to 35 months), and three dyads at Age-stage 3 (36 to 48 months).</p>
<p>We selected the three time frames because they mark important milestones in children’s behavior and cognitive and motor development that might have implications for parental smoking. At Age-stage 1 most children are able to take independent steps or walk well on their own; grasp small objects with their fingertips, understand up to 100 words, and recognize objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732313494118">Johnson &amp; Blasco, 1997</xref>). In the study region, a child’s first birthday is also associated with many mothers’ return to work. At Age-stage 2, typically, children have learned how to walk up and down stairs with their hand held, or by using a railing; move independently; show curiosity; repeat and combine words to make simple phrases; mimic others; and identify as a separate self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732313494118">Gemelli, 1996</xref>; Johnson &amp; Blasco). By Age-stage 3 children move fluidly, run well, ask questions, tell simple stories, feed and dress themselves, explore their environment with intense curiosity, and have the capacity for self-observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732313494118">Child Development Institute, n.d</xref>.; Gemelli).</p>
<p>Parents of 12- to 19-month-old children focused on their perceptions about the transitions from birth to infancy and the influence of these transitions on smoking practices. Parents of older children focused on their current smoking practices in relation to their child’s developmental milestones, but they also recalled details about the changes that had occurred around their smoking in response to their toddler’s/child’s growth and development at the earlier time points. Although the interviews focused on the child in the respective age stage, almost half the couples had other children, and the influence of those children on parents’ smoking was also reported in the interviews. Eight couples had older children, and 5 of those couples also had a child who was younger than the child we focused on in the interview. Parents with older children often chose to talk about their smoking plans in reference to these children. The parents without older children (i.e., no older than Age-stage 3) also often imagined their projected smoking patterns when their children became adolescents.</p>
<p>We began semistructured interviews with a number of open-ended questions, including: How has your child’s awareness of or reactions to smoking influenced your smoking (or your partner’s smoking)? Tell me about the first few instances when your child saw somebody smoking? How do you and your partner feel about your child being around second-hand smoke? When do you think your smoking and the smoking of others begins to influence the way children think about smoking? If your child is not currently aware of people smoking, when do you think he or she might become aware? Additional questions were added as needed to prompt parents to provide additional details and explore interesting leads. As the study proceeded we included other questions to check emerging concepts with participants, and to fill in gaps within and between categories. We also sought data to develop categories by including questions about parents’ experiences with their child at different ages, and with their other children.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The analytical process involved grounded theory methods of coding and constant comparative analysis as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732313494118">Strauss &amp; Corbin (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732313494118">Charmaz (2006)</xref>. These analytic tools have been widely used in exploratory qualitative research studies seeking to explore and describe social situations and to understand social phenomena. Participants’ interview data were transcribed verbatim and checked for accuracy before being read and reread line by line by the authors. To maintain confidentiality and anonymity, participant names were replaced with numerical identifiers. The analyses began with a close reading of the data collected for each time point to identify data that directly related to the connections between the parents’ smoking and their constructions of their child’s level of development. These data were assigned to an overarching label titled “smoking and childhood development” using the qualitative software program NVivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732313494118">QSR International, 2008</xref>). We subjected these data to more detailed analysis using open coding and constant comparative techniques. First-level coding involved making comparisons between data segments, searching for similarities and differences, and then labeling similar phenomena as open codes. We orientated our analyses toward the processes used by the parents to manage tobacco in the presence of their children.</p>
<p>Second-level coding involved making propositions about connections between open codes and reassembling them into more abstract codes to represent tentative concepts to form a more precise and complete explanation of the phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732313494118">Charmaz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732313494118">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>). The emerging analyses were discussed by the entire research team until consensus on the interpretation of patterns in the data was reached. Throughout the analytic process constant comparison was used to compare data segments and identify the process and the core category, or central explanatory concept (Strauss &amp; Corbin). For example, data were compared within couple dyads and across dyads within each time point to identify common and divergent explanations of smoking practices.</p>
<p>In addition, comparisons were made across age stages to explore changes in smoking practices over time. In looking at changes over time among the couples, we decided to include in our analysis the comments from parents that related to their older children, because this unanticipated data also referenced rationalizations predicated on the parents’ views of the child’s growth and development. In addition, these data focused on older children foreshadowed how parents would likely respond to their infant or young child regarding smoking as he or she developed. We also drew on related theories to facilitate exploration of the data, and diagramming was used to link emerging categories and reach consensus about the core category and underlying parent–child interactions related to smoking.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Parents’ attempts to reconcile being a parent and smoking was the central explanatory concept that underlay their various smoking practices and strategies to accommodate smoking. Parents continued to smoke while fulfilling the responsibilities of parenthood in ways that were commensurate with changes in children’s development. This was evident, for example, in the way parents pushed forward quit dates by tying them to significant but future-oriented childhood development milestones and rationalizing these perspectives as responsible parenting. Most parents with children at Age-stage 1 described plans for quitting amid acknowledgments that they had been “forced” to become increasingly creative in their efforts to smoke away from their child when she or he began to crawl. Similarly, parents with 2-year-old toddlers cited age 3 or 4 years as the inevitable quit time, because their child’s awareness of tobacco and their smoking would be more fully developed. In these ways, quitting was a future-oriented plan that enabled parents to rationalize their smoking as a transitional misdemeanor best dealt with in the short term with innovative damage-control measures.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasize that more than half of the parents in this study mentioned the ages of 3 to 4 years as significant in terms of when they believed children became aware of cigarettes and adults smoking. These parents expressed the belief that children might mimic smoking behavior at younger than 4 years of age, but they maintained that the child did not have any understanding of the activity, and would therefore not be influenced by it. Because we interviewed parents during their child’s first few years of life, and therefore most children in the study were younger than 3 years of age, we interpreted these comments as another strategy parents used to push cessation into the future. The dominant concept of reconciling parenting and smoking, and the desire to be future smoke-free parents, coexisted with five types of parent–child interactions that allowed strategies for continued smoking across the child’s development. These interactions are highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049732313494118">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Protecting the Defenseless Child From SHS and Tobacco</title>
<p>The presence of a baby in the home made parents highly aware of their own smoking practices and created the need for parents to reconcile their desire to smoke with their need to feel and be perceived as caring and responsible parents. The defenseless and vulnerable qualities associated with infancy elicited the principle process of protecting the new infant from any harm. Regardless of their smoking practices, all of the parents declared how they ensured that their infant was protected from any exposure to SHS. Parents smoked outside the house, or in rooms that were separate and sealed off from where their baby slept. As described elsewhere, the use of cleansing rituals, protective clothing, and other methods were also used by parents who smoked as they strove to protect their newborn infants from even a hint of SHS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732313494118">Bottorff et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732313494118">Bottorff et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732313494118">Haines, Oliffe, Bottorff, &amp; Poland, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the presence of an infant inspired intentions to quit and invoked the social stigma of being a parent who smoked, parents experienced relative ease at this stage in rationalizing their desire to continue smoking while protecting the infant from any adverse effects of tobacco. In fact, women who had quit smoking during their pregnancy to protect the fetus from tobacco harm maintained they could resume smoking after the birth with less social judgment as long as they protected their child by smoking outside the home. Within the first year, however, protecting the child from contact with tobacco became more complicated as the child became more mobile and transgressions related to smoking rules held new consequences. A 25-year-old mother who had resumed smoking outside and urged her husband to not only smoke in another room but to confine his smoking to outside the home stated that sometimes he “forgot.” She explained that her increased attentiveness with respect to SHS was related to the distress she experienced when her child began to reach for and “dump ashtrays,” and started wheezing. Although her child was not formally diagnosed with asthma, these experiences strengthened her commitment to end the couple’s indoor smoking practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1049732313494118">
<title>Concealing Smoking and Cigarettes From the Mimicking Child</title>
<p>In addition to concerns about SHS, parents expressed discomfort with being seen smoking by their children, a problem they believed would arise when infants became “more aware.” Uncertain about when an infant might begin to pay attention to smoking behaviors, parents were often taken by surprise when their children began to mimic smoking behaviors. Immediately this prompted more vigilant efforts to conceal smoking. For parents with infants this was managed by smoking when the baby was settled or asleep; however, as the child advanced in age, becoming more mobile and crawling, concealing smoking and tobacco-related paraphernalia became less straightforward. A 28-year-old father had difficulty concealing his patio smoking from an actively mobile 2-year-old who, although housebound, played with the blinds and could “just open them up” enough to render visible his father’s smoking. This father also reminisced about being able to go to the beach with his family a year earlier and smoke unnoticed by sitting a short distance away, whereas now he was “never invisible.” Moreover, he worried that his child was “starting to really understand what’s going on in the world, what’s going on with smoking and stuff.”</p>
<p>Many parents lamented the inevitability of being seen and the potential that their behavior would influence their child to smoke. A 30-year-old mother whose husband also smoked wanted to be a good role model because, “You know, ‘monkey see, monkey do,’ if they see their mum [mother] or dad smoking, chances are they’re going to want to smoke.” That being said, concerns about being a good role model often resulted in parents working harder to conceal their smoking rather than quitting. A 23-year-old mother explained that she and her sister became smokers because their parents smoked: “We didn’t really have anybody there saying well, no, so we smoked.” Now, as the mother of a 10-month-old and 2-year-old she self-identified as “the number one role model, except if they [children] are in bed; if they are in bed, what they don’t see doesn’t hurt them.” The parents’ certainty about their ability to conceal their smoking became increasingly fragile as the child’s mobility, language, and cognitive skills developed. This change was illustrated by a 43-year-old father who claimed that his 24-month-old son had never, nor ever would, see him smoking. Later in the interview he softened that assurance, admitting that he had been caught “maybe once or twice in the past,” because “you can’t really hide it from them, but it was always outside.”</p>
<p>Many parents narrated accounts of how children mimicked smoking, imitating specific smoking gestures. A 26-year-old father who had smoked for 10 years described how when watching an actor smoke on television (TV), his 3-year-old son mimicked holding a cigarette and commented, “Uncle smokes like this.” Likewise, an 18-month-old emerged from his bedroom with a crayon in his mouth, imitating his parents and their friends who smoked while watching a hockey game on TV. The parents had broken their outdoor smoking rule because they were entertaining. The mother recounted removing the crayon, saying to the child, “Yucky, bad,” and stated in the interview, “I was so embarrassed. That’s when we decided we should smoke outside, so he doesn’t see us.” There were also examples of parents admitting that their children demonstrated an increasing awareness of smoking in other ways. A 34-year-old father who smoked outside the home was certain that his smoking was invisible to his 2-year-old daughter until one day, when he began to walk outside, she asked, “Daddy going out for a smoke?” The child’s comment prompted her father to deny that he was going outside to smoke at the time, and from that day on he refrained from telling his wife that he was “just stepping out for a smoke.”</p>

<title>Reinforcing “Smoking is Bad” With the Communicating Child</title>
<p>Parents predicted that when their child developed language skills and began communicating verbally they would explain the risks of smoking, reinforcing that smoking was “bad” and dissuading children from ever starting. As a prelude to these more sophisticated conversations, a majority of parents described using admonitions of “yucky,” “gross,” and “bad” to signal to their child that cigarettes and smoking paraphernalia were off limits. Although parents acknowledged that these messages were discordant with their own smoking practices, the contradictions were rationalized as safety measures for toddlers best delivered with a “do as I say, not as I do” approach to parenting.</p>
<p>Despite the use of discursive persuasion amid ongoing efforts to conceal smoking, parents shared many stories about their child exploring cigarettes and related equipment. A 23-year-old mother recounted how her 18-month-old “grabbed” the father’s pack of cigarettes, opened it, pulled one out, and handed it to him. The woman responded, “That’s yucky, that’s an adult thing. . . . Don’t touch this again.” Similarly, a 30-year-old mother who quit smoking while pregnant and then resumed with her partner who also smoked, described her 2-year-old child picking up an empty cigarette pack and exclaiming, “Mommy, smokes all gone!” The mother recalled her immediate response to the child, “Garbage, garbage,” emerging from a mixture of shock and urgency to dispose of the empty pack.</p>
<p>The use of “do as I say” strategies were contingent on children’s speech development. A 20-year-old father suggested that when his 3-year-old child began asking him questions about cigarettes, he might be more likely to quit, and similarly, his partner wanted to quit before her son questioned why she smoked if it’s “so yucky.” However, among the participants whose children had begun to ask questions about smoking, quit plans remained future oriented. A 37-year-old mother who reduced smoking during her pregnancy but gradually returned to former levels explained, “I don’t want her to know that her mom smokes. . . . I would rather just quit altogether.” As an interim measure, this woman and her husband who also smoked stated they were committed to teaching their child about the health risks of smoking. Similarly, a 31-year-old father who resumed smoking following the birth of his child stated he “sat down with her [2-year-old daughter] a couple of times to explain that it’s a dirty habit,” and suggested that the information he provided “will be in the back of her head when she grows up.”</p>
<p>In these and many other examples a mixture of individual choice and autonomy coexisted with parenting ideals for teaching children right from wrong. Contradictions were also embedded in the parents’ narratives; for instance, children were simultaneously depicted as not being “fully aware” of their parent’s smoking, yet able to comprehend information about the dangers of smoking. Parents explained how children as young as 2 years of age verbally labeled cigarettes “yucky,” and some children had broken cigarettes and/or objected to parents going outside to smoke. Many parents interpreted these behaviors and other demonstrations of their children’s dislike for smoking as evidence that their discursive, reinforcing, “do as I say” strategies were effective.</p>

<title>Feeling Guilty and Making Promises to the Fearful Child</title>
<p>Increased understanding of the harmful effects of smoking prompted anxiety and fear among older children about their parents’ health. Despite concealing the activity of smoking and attempting to keep cigarettes and ashtrays out of reach, some children exerted their own will in response to cigarettes in their environment and simply destroyed them—sometimes entire packs. Because 8 of the couples had preschoolers and school-age children in addition to infants and toddlers, parents disclosed that many of these older children pleaded, begged, and nagged their parents to quit smoking. For example, one woman stated that her two oldest children, an 8-year-old and 10-year-old, often encouraged her to quit: “They are on my back about quitting, they’re at that age. ‘When are you going to quit? Smoking is disgusting,’ When I’m ready, I tell them.” Another woman stated that she hoped her partner might quit because their older girls constantly expressed disgust that their father smoked. The woman interpreted her daughters’ distain for smoking as a sign that they would never initiate smoking themselves; she rationalized that she would never pressure her partner to quit, because her daughters held the right attitude about smoking.</p>
<p>A 30-year-old mother described how her 5-year-old boy nagged and pleaded with her to quit since she relapsed after her pregnancy, saying he was “always on her case.” She promised the boy she would quit when she got a full-time job, telling him that she just wanted to “have this one [cigarette].” Whenever she went out for a smoke, the boy insisted, “Stop it. That’s bad for you.” The mother’s account of sneaking outside to smoke is reminiscent of how teenagers respond when getting caught by watchful parents. She said the boy would always “catch us” smoking, and so she played it “pretty cool, pretty casual,” because she “did not want to make a big deal out of it.” The child also confronted the father, who subsequently decided to quit again, but the mother continued saying it “breaks her heart” that her boy sees her smoking.</p>
<p>Although older children—fearful for their parents’ health and pleading with them to quit—induced more guilt than at earlier stages, some parents still chose to interpret these interactions as evidence that the right message was being learned, and as rationalizations to continue smoking. There were, however, a few exceptions. A 33-year-old father recalled some “really nasty ads on TV about smoking and what it can do to you,” which prompted his 10-year-old son to ask him why he smoked. The father, interpreting this as his son asking, “Why would you want to die? Why would you do that to yourself, dad?” admitted, “I didn’t really have much of a good reason for it.” This epiphany resulted in the father’s promise to quit, something he accomplished: “That was actually the first time I ended up quitting.”</p>

<sec id="section10-1049732313494118">
<title>Relinquishing Personal Responsibility to the Autonomous Child</title>
<p>Parents who smoked also began to think ahead. They anticipated that their efforts to conceal their smoking and leverage “do as I say” strategies would be challenged as their children began to make their own decisions and were influenced by peers. Despite this, they remained hopeful that their child would never become a smoker, and provided commentaries about increasing public awareness of smoking-related health risks, and the cultural norms for policing and discouraging smoking as key factors for ensuring that outcome. A 27-year-old mother who had reduced but not quit smoking was certain that “the harsh laws and bans against smoking in public places” would render her child smoke-free and protect her from the smoking of others.</p>
<p>Parents also predicted that the social stigma associated with smoking would inoculate their school-age children against smoking. Connected to these ideals, parents downplayed their influence as smoke-free role models, suggesting instead their children’s true role models were peers and schoolteachers, and that behaviors were governed by broader social norms and enforcement of smoke-free policies. A 35-year-old mother who quit smoking, but whose partner continued, hoped the social stigma associated with smoking in their region would protect her child from ever starting to smoke. She and her husband planned to enroll their child in extracurricular school activities to maximize her fitness and exposure to nonsmoking environments, claiming, “That’s all you can do.”</p>
<p>Although some parents expressed concerns about the potential for smoking in adolescence, confidence prevailed that social stigma would continue to increase and counter any peer pressure for their children to smoke. In addition, a few parents suggested that they could not ultimately determine what their child chose to do in the future. As a 32-year-old mother of four, including a 2-year-old and 4-year-old, explained, “The best you can do is arm them with information because you’re not going to be there every minute of every day to control what they’re doing.”</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The findings of this study provide detailed descriptions of parents’ efforts to reconcile their need to smoke with parental responsibilities and desires to protect their children’s health. Not previously described in the literature is the continuum of strategies parents use to reduce their children’s exposure to tobacco and the ways these strategies shift as children grow older and are increasingly able to interact with adults about smoking. Adamant that they did not want their children to take up smoking, parents engaged in an array of efforts to conceal tobacco and dissuaded children from exploring smoking and related paraphernalia. When these efforts were perceived to be successful, parents dismissed any immediate need for smoking cessation while positioning themselves as good parents. Finally, parents who could not imagine themselves quitting and who recognized the impending futility of their efforts to conceal and defend their own smoking to children defaulted to social stigma and municipal smoking bans as the ultimate deterrents to their child’s potential to smoke.</p>
<p>Social ties have been recognized as important influences on health habits across the life course, and represent social processes that evolve over time to effect health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049732313494118">Umberson, Crosnoe, &amp; Reczek, 2010</xref>). Parenthood represents a significant social connection that facilitates healthful habits because it fosters a sense of responsibility and obligation to take care of family members. For both men and women, parenting promotes a sense of responsibility to protect and care for children, and motivates individuals to protect their health so as to care for others. Internalizing a sense of responsibility for family might also foster a stronger sense of personal control, which has also been associated with healthier behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732313494118">Mirowsky &amp; Ross, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Lower rates of substance abuse have been associated with transitions to parenting. For example, heavy drinking for both men and women has been observed to decrease when they become parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732313494118">Chilcoat &amp; Breslau, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732313494118">Paradis, 2011</xref>). The tasks and responsibilities associated with childcare make it difficult to allot time and resources to drinking, and parents are less likely to gather in locations (e.g., bars) where heavy drinking often takes place. The findings of this study indicate that parents’ sense of responsibility to their children prompted changes in smoking behavior to protect children’s health, and to protect images of themselves as responsible parents. Although it is possible that smoking is reduced by time spent in providing childcare, based on the findings of this study, the responsibility of parenthood does not appear to consistently prompt smoking cessation. These findings also support previous research evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732313494118">Irwin, Johnson, &amp; Bottorff, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732313494118">Oliffe et al., 2010</xref>). showing that although parents are aware of the health effects of smoking and SHS and have intentions to quit, they often continue to smoke .</p>
<p>Our study findings offer a unique perspective on tobacco reduction and cessation in families from the point of view of the agency of a young child. These findings complement previous research that has examined social factors influencing parents’ tobacco use: tobacco-control campaigns that have targeted fetal health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732313494118">Johnson, Oliffe, Kelly, Bottorff, &amp; LeBeau, 2009</xref>); barriers to smoking cessation among mothers, such as poverty and associated coping needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732313494118">Graham, 1987</xref>); the role of fathers in tobacco cessation and couple interactions in family tobacco use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732313494118">Bottorff et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732313494118">Bottorff et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732313494118">Gage, Everett, &amp; Bullock, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732313494118">Oliffe et al., 2010</xref>); and other complex reasons that mothers continue to smoke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732313494118">Bottorff, Johnson, Irwin, &amp; Ratner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732313494118">Greaves, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732313494118">Irwin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732313494118">Robinson &amp; Kirkcaldy, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results demonstrate how children impact the way parents handle tobacco in everyday life, and the degree to which a child’s presence and growth and development influences parents’ tobacco use. In attempting to hide, conceal, and separate cigarette smoking from the child, parents underestimated the child’s capacity for social and cognitive learning and did not keep pace with the child’s growth and development. Even more important, parents largely dismissed the capacity and influence of observational learning in their child’s development, emphasizing instead verbal exchanges. Our study findings point to the significance of connecting early childhood learning, the modeling of health behaviors in families, and the potential impact of these interactions and behaviors on children’s future health habits.</p>
<p>The widespread belief that words speak louder than actions on the part of parents is an important consideration in light of research evidence that demonstrates the complete lack of positive effect of parent–child communication in mediating or deterring smoking initiation among adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732313494118">Ennett, Bauman, Foshee, Pemberton, &amp; Hicks, 2001</xref>). Empirical research shows that neither quantity nor content of parent–child communication has influenced adolescents’ smoking behavior or decisions to smoke; however, parental modeling of smoking cigarettes has predicted the initiation of adolescent smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732313494118">Ennett et al., 2001</xref>). Our study findings show how children, including those at prelanguage stages, observed and were influenced by watching parents handle tobacco; this finding perhaps complements longitudinal research such as that completed by Ennett et al.</p>
<p>The evidence that parental modeling of substance use might overshadow other strategies, such as verbal communication interactions to inoculate children from smoking, is crucial and missing from most programs intended to protect children from the hazards of tobacco. In addition, research with adolescents shows that although all children perceive tobacco to be “disgusting” when they are young, they become more tolerant of tobacco as they grow older, rationalizing its use as a personal decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049732313494118">Treacy et al., 2007</xref>). The findings from this research contradict the views of the participants in our study who expressed hope in the future personal decisions of youth. Our findings might be incorporated into cessation programs for parents to emphasize the important difference between and influence of observational learning vs. talking about health behaviors with children.</p>
<p>The sole emphasis on the physical protection of the child from SHS (the mainstay of tobacco-control messaging) becomes limited in the childhood years, because it does not accommodate the cognitive, emotional, and social capacity of the child to interact with parents who smoke and cigarettes. It is interesting that in one situation in which a father described having successfully quit after his “fearful child” confronted him about smoking, the father had been influenced by the child’s direct comment about his potential death from smoking. In this case cessation was the outcome of pointed communication initiated by the child, an interaction some might view as a reversal of the usual parent–child roles and relationship.</p>
<p>Overall, the lack of emphasis on the personal health effects of tobacco among the parents in this study is also noteworthy. Striving for good health as a parent to be able to fully engage and model an active and fulfilling life to children did not figure prominently in most of their tobacco strategies. In some families, the current effects of tobacco smoke exposure on their children’s health conditions did not prompt cessation either. Instead, we observed parents’ overreliance on social stigma as a kind of future “guarantee” that their child would not become a smoker. There are contradictions at play here related to the influence of social stigma on what people choose to do (or not do), parental responsibility for a child’s health and relationship with tobacco, and the complex connections between parenting and societal norms and governance. Aside from who is responsible for the child’s future smoking, the efforts of participants to position themselves as “good parents,” protective of their child’s health and well-being, cannot be considered as separate from contemporary discourses that reinforce the repugnancy of smoking cigarettes. Such discourses result in mothers who smoke being considered irresponsible (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732313494118">Graham, 1976</xref>) and fathers who smoke being increasingly stigmatized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732313494118">Greaves et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Messages to parents about the ill effects of SHS on their children and themselves could be reinforced by health care providers. However, there continues to be a general lack of tobacco reduction and cessation approaches for parents. Innovative approaches that build on motivations inherent in the social ties of parenthood to facilitate smoking cessation, as well as other healthful habits, hold potential. For example, nonsmoking adolescents show promise as formal interventionists by supporting and encouraging their parents to quit smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732313494118">Patten et al., 2012</xref>). In a randomized pilot study, Patten et al. evaluated a Web-based approach for providing adolescents with the appropriate skills and information for influencing their parents to become nonsmokers. By 6 months posttreatment, half the parents had made a quit attempt (Patten et al.). In addition, parents expressed surprise at the degree to which adolescents hoped parents would become nonsmokers. The authors recommended more research to identify effective interventions adolescents might employ in supporting parents to quit. This study is novel and important in light of our findings, which demonstrate the influence children have on parents’ smoking behaviors, as well as studies in the United Kingdom that demonstrate most adolescents desire to influence a parent to quit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049732313494118">United Kingdom Department of Health, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, the potential usefulness of child-related testimonials, much like those reflected in our findings, could be explored as messages to prompt parents to reflect on their smoking in authentic but nonjudgmental ways. This approach has been used successfully in the STARSS (Start Thinking about Reducing Secondhand Smoke) program, a harm-reduction program for low-income women who smoke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732313494118">Action on Women’s Addictions—Research and Education, n.d.</xref>). In this program, one of the messages is in a child’s voice: “My mother loves me and cares for me in many ways. When she can, she goes outside to smoke.”</p>
<p>The inclusion of mothers and fathers, as well as longitudinal data collection using semistructured interviews, contributed to the rich descriptive findings from this study. However, we acknowledge that these findings need to be considered in light of several caveats. The study was conducted in a region where rigorous tobacco-control polices have resulted in low smoking rates in the general population and have influenced social norms related to smoking. These norms were likely an important factor in influencing parents’ experiences, and might have constrained what they were willing to share in interviews. In addition, we did not compare the views of parents within households regarding smoking to identify divergent and convergent views and the effects on smoking patterns. Although we focused on parents’ experiences as their children transitioned from infancy to early childhood, some participants had older children and commented on their responsibilities related to protecting them from smoke and smoking. Future studies should explore the experiences of parents who smoke in families with children of all ages and in a variety of contexts.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Children’s observations of parental smoking is a significant factor in the normalization of smoking. These experiences, along with the agency of a child in influencing parental smoking practices, have garnered limited attention. Based on the findings of this study, we suggest that the presence of a child is directly responsible for parental changes in smoking practices and is the impetus behind intentions to quit. However, children’s lack of success in engaging parents in quit attempts suggests that additional supports are needed for those parents who are interested in smoking cessation. Parents who smoke require targeted programs to motivate them and support efforts to reduce or stop smoking in ways that take into account their desires to be good parents and the challenges of effective and responsible parenting.</p>
