<p>From the outset the Barbican Centre’s Summer 2011 exhibition, <italic>Watch Me Move: The Animation Show</italic>, signals its attitude to the history of animation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1746847712442126">1</xref></sup> The visitor to the Centre’s art gallery enters the exhibition space through a small vestibule, in which Christian Boltanski’s 2011 <italic>Shadow Cinema</italic> is projected on two lightboxes. Upon first perception, one may think the flickering, cut-out silhouettes of <italic>Shadow Cinema</italic> form an example of early experimentations in image projection and animation, the beginnings of animation perhaps? But, closer inspection reveals the contemporary date of their production. That the curators (lead by Greg Hilty) chose this work for the portal between the outside world and the exhibition space is surely no accident. Boltanski’s work simultaneously conjures up animation’s origins and its contemporary practice, and challenges the visitor’s expectations and presumptions about animation’s history and canon. By resisting the temptation to begin with the first forays into animation, or with familiar work from a big name or studio, such as Disney or Pixar, the <italic>Watch Me Move</italic> exhibition promises to go beyond any superficial, or simple, concept or history of ‘animation’.</p>
<p>The exhibition is organised thematically, rather than chronologically, under the seven headings of <italic>Apparitions, Characters, Superhumans, Fables, Fragments, Structures</italic> and <italic>Visions</italic>. These themes interweave, conceptually and spatially, and are spread over the two floors of the gallery space. <italic>Apparitions, Characters, Superhumans, Fables</italic> and <italic>Fragments</italic> are found on the ground floor, with <italic>Fables and Fragments</italic> continuing upstairs along with <italic>Structures</italic> and <italic>Visions</italic>. The connecting stairwell is given over to displays of animation ephemera and objects, such as magic lantern slides, superhero figurines and stop-motion puppets. The real modus operandi of the exhibition, however, is the moving image and various techniques are used for displaying the dozens of films in the exhibition, most of which play in their entirety. <italic>Apparitions</italic> are displayed on back-projected small screens in a series of partitioned black-walled spaces, sectioned-off by floor-to-ceiling black string curtains. <italic>Characters</italic> and <italic>Superhumans</italic> take up the central, large gallery space, with large screen projections of clips on opposing walls. The visitor can sit on low, brightly coloured stools and put on headphones to dip in and out of the films. Most striking is the display of <italic>Structures</italic> on the upper level. Here, screens are suspended from the ceiling over the stairwell at alternating depths from the viewing space on the landing, creating a vibrant, gauze-like patchwork of mostly abstract animation. It is in this display in particular that the handprint of the exhibition’s German exhibition designers, Chezweitz &amp; Roseapple, can be seen, who were also responsible for the design of the successful Andy Warhol exhibit that toured Europe and the United States between 2007 and 2009.</p>
<p>While the exhibition is visually impressive in its architecture and design, its real impact is in the exhaustive scope of its content. The historical, geographical, technical and commercial range of the exhibits feels as all-encompassing as possible in the space available. We can see the earliest experiments in moving image production alongside more recent explorations. <italic>Apparitions</italic> shows Stuart Blackton’s 1906 <italic>Humorous Phases of Funny Face</italic> a few feet away from Zhou Xiaohu’s 2002 hand-drawn body animation <italic>The Gooey Gentleman</italic>. A small room highlights animation’s ongoing interest in prehistoric life with a looped clip from Spielberg’s 1993 blockbuster <italic>Jurassic Park</italic> along with Winsor McCay’s <italic>Gertie the Dinosaur</italic> (1914) and Willis O’Brien’s <italic>The Dinosaur and the Missing Link: A Prehistoric Tragedy</italic> (1917). Work from China shows alongside that from Japan and Germany in the intimate viewing pods of the <italic>Fragments</italic> and <italic>Fables</italic> rooms. The show resists giving precedence to any one country, filmmaker, or style. So, while two complete Disney features are on show (<italic>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</italic> [1937] and <italic>Pinocchio</italic> [1940]), Stan Brakhage’s <italic>Dante Quartet</italic> (1987) is given a dedicated room, where the centrally-placed, clattering 16mm projector is as much of an attraction as the intricate, abstract patterns we see on screen. There is one notable lack in the exhibition’s scope, however, with the underrepresentation of female animators. Suzanne Buchan, one of the curatorial advisors, estimates that women make up approximately thirty percent of those working in independent animation, yet only eleven of the films on show in <italic>Watch Me Move</italic> are by women, and half of those are the product of male-female teams.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1746847712442126">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The vast array of animation techniques represented demonstrates that animation goes beyond the frame-by-frame manipulation of drawn images. There is plenty of this on offer, but also included are, for example, pinscreen, sand-on-glass, direct animation in the form of painting or scratching directly onto film, and a wide range of computer and digital animation. Avant-garde, experimental and independent animation is given equal footing with the commercial and mainstream. The usual suspects of feature film animation Disney, Studio Ghibli and Pixar, as well as television favourites such as <italic>The Simpsons, Tom and Jerry</italic> and <italic>Yogi Bear</italic>, appear in the central <italic>Characters and Superhumans</italic> room, but space here is also given over to three superb examples of independently produced animated documentary in the form of Tim Webb’s <italic>A is for Autism</italic> (1992), Bob Sabiston’s <italic>Snack and Drink</italic> (2000) and Peter Lord’s claymation animated interview, <italic>Going Equipped</italic> (1989). Elsewhere the exhibition does not shy away from presenting lesser-known, challenging and experimental fare. The <italic>Visions</italic> section seems particularly to lean in this direction, with a selection of work that explores animation’s ability to construct virtual worlds. In Semiconductor’s <italic>Matter in Motion</italic> (2008), for example, images of the natural and human world are distorted and deconstructed. Igloo’s installation <italic>SwanQuake: House</italic> (2007) immerses the visitor in a virtual East End underworld via a constructed set and basic video player controls.</p>
<p>The exhibition is, according to the Barbican, ‘the most extensive exhibition ever mounted to present the full range of animated imagery produced in the last 150 years.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1746847712442126">3</xref></sup> These aims are admirable, but also result in an exhibition that has the potential to be both overwhelming and dissatisfying at the same time. It would take any visitor many days to watch all the animation on show within the exhibition, before one even begins to consider the rotating programme of features being shown in the cinema annexe of the gallery. Necessarily, the visitor must dip in and out of films as one passes through the gallery space. This leads to a feeling that one is just glossing past the wonderful array of material on offer, without having an opportunity to really delve into any one area. It is especially hard to get a real sense of many of the full-length films shown in the <italic>Fables</italic> and <italic>Fragments</italic> viewing pods. The labelling of these pods, which comprise dovetailed seat boxes, with integrated speakers, facing each wall of a room on which the films are projected, does not help and it is often hard to discern what film is showing.</p>
<p>One of the joys of animation is the sheer ingenuity and virtuosity in production techniques. This is certainly on display in <italic>Watch Me Move</italic>, yet no contextualising information is given within the exhibition for the work displayed. It is a shame that the visitor is not offered any information about the production processes of the films, particularly those created using more unusual or inventive techniques such as Alexandre Alexieff’s pinscreen method, Bob Sabiston’s proprietary digital rotoscope Rotoshop software, or Caroline Leaf’s beautiful, ethereal sand-on-glass technique. How much would our pleasure be enhanced, for example, through knowing that Run Wrake’s bizarre and unsettling <italic>Rabbit</italic> (2005) was created using educational stickers from the 1950s? Similarly, I wonder how many of the films on display lose their impact or meaning without some information that situates them within the social, political and historical context of their production. To the uninitiated, for example, Yuri Norstein’s <italic>Tale of Tales</italic> (1979) would surely have more impact were some information included regarding its allegorical references to Norstein’s childhood and World War II, and its use of elements of traditional Russian folklore and mythology.</p>
<p>The lack of context means that films are often reduced to aesthetic objects, things to be admired for their surface rather than their depth. The same problem exists with many of the objects of animation production on display in the central stairwell, where zoetrope picture bands and zoopraxinoscope plates are shown in illuminated glass cabinets, but with no explanation or demonstration of their use. One is left wondering, therefore, who this exhibition is aimed at. It seems to favour those already knowledgeable in the history and production of animation, and one fears that only the surface is accessible to the uninitiated. On one visit a companion, well-versed in the history of cinema, but less familiar with animation, commented that he enjoyed the exhibition very much, but was not sure how much he learned. The lack of context and information within the exhibition is somewhat compensated for by the many associated events that are programmed during the summer at the Barbican Centre and elsewhere in London. These include a number of ‘gallery talks’ from animation experts, including Suzanne Buchan, Paul Wells and Helen McCarthy, as well as filmmaker appearances from Jan Švankmajer and Marjane Satrapi and live animation by Caroline Leaf, among many other events that cover the range of the exhibition. Beyond the Barbican, there are site-specific events in Hackney and screenings in Canary Wharf. There is also the opportunity to purchase the catalogue that accompanies the exhibition - a glossy, 220-page book that offers some contextualising material and essays from curatorial advisors, illustrated with images from the films and objects on display.</p>
<p><italic>Watch Me Move</italic> is undeniably an impressive, exhaustive and striking exhibition of the history of animation. Just the fact that such an exhibition is occurring is a thing to be celebrated – an indication of animation’s increasingly significant position in the cultural landscape of the twenty-first century. Its challenges could also be seen as positive attributes. Suzanne Buchan notes that the thematic organisation of the exhibition ‘allows permeation between different animation techniques and historically and stylistically discrete canons’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1746847712442126">Buchan, 2011</xref>: 28). This is true also of the exhibition’s approach to the history of animation, something that is so often seen as a teleological march from early optical toys to contemporary CGI photorealism. <italic>Watch Me Move</italic> encourages a reading of animation history as interconnected occurrences and repetitions, and denies a single historical point from which animation evolved or any geographical, commercial or technical base point to which ‘other’ animation can be compared. As such, the exhibition is bound to expand the visitor’s conception of animation and, one hopes, will spur further exploration into the diversity of animation on display.</p>
