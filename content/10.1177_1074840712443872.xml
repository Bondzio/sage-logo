<abstract>
<p>Though recent progress in family nursing science can serve the family nurse practitioner (FNP) to intervene in the regulation of family health, whether those advances are taught to FNP students has been unclear. All 266 FNP programs in the United States were invited to participate in a survey to assess the content and clinical application of family nursing theories in the curriculum. The majority of FNP programs frame family as the context of care for the individual. Though FNP students receive a foundation in family nursing theory in core courses, they are not usually expected to use family assessment methods in clinical practicum courses or to plan interventions for the family as the unit of care. The authors challenge educators to consider family nursing science as an essential component of the FNP program as the Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) evolves and becomes requisite for entry into advanced practice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Family nursing science has matured in the past three decades. Theories and explanatory models of family health have emerged and illustrate how family beliefs and living patterns influence the health of individuals as well as the health of the family as a whole. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1074840712443872">Wright and Leahey (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1074840712443872">2009</xref>) advanced the application of Family Systems Nursing to the family as the unit of care through development of the <italic>Calgary Family Assessment Model</italic> and the <italic>Calgary Family Intervention Model</italic>. The <italic>Family Health Model</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1074840712443872">Denham, 2003</xref>) suggests ways to attend to the family as the unit of care and consider the implications of family complexity from ecological perspectives. The <italic>Trinity Model</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1074840712443872">Wright, 2005</xref>) examines the connections between beliefs, illness suffering, and spirituality. <italic>The Illness Beliefs Model</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1074840712443872">Wright &amp; Bell, 2009</xref>) explores the beliefs of the patient, family, and health care providers and connects these beliefs to illness suffering.</p>
<p>Several family nursing models, applied and refined in clinical laboratories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1074840712443872">Bell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1074840712443872">Duhamel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1074840712443872">Eggenberger &amp; Regan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1074840712443872">Flowers, St. John, &amp; Bell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1074840712443872">Wright &amp; Bell, 2009</xref>), provide family nurse practitioners (FNPs) with ways to assess families and predict outcomes of family nursing interventions. However, little is known about the scope or depth to which FNPs actually utilize family models; and, despite the logical conceptual extension of family nursing science to the education of FNP students, the two may be paradoxically disconnected. In other words, while one might expect FNP programs to embrace family nursing science, evidence is insufficient to corroborate this supposition. Previous studies about FNP curriculum and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1074840712443872">Berlin, Harper, Werner, &amp; Stennett, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1074840712443872">Burman, Stepans, Jansa, &amp; Steiner, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1074840712443872">Cogdill 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1074840712443872">Hart &amp; Macnee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1074840712443872">Pulcini, Jelic, Gul, &amp; Loke, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1074840712443872">Rasch &amp; Cogdill, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1074840712443872">Scherer, Bruce, Montgomery, &amp; Ball, 2008</xref>) were not designed to study whether family nursing science is part of the core curriculum or practice competencies.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate ways FNP programs in the United States incorporate family theories and models into the curriculum. This study is based on the assumption that family nursing science benefits FNP education and practice. As the FNP role in primary care grows increasingly autonomous in the United States, the opportunity to integrate science from the discipline of nursing into the practice of primary care also grows. Patterns of daily living that promote or detract from health and potentiate illness occur within the family context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1074840712443872">Denham, 2003</xref>). Beliefs about the meaning of family life influence the health of the entire family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1074840712443872">Wright &amp; Bell, 2009</xref>). Application of family nursing science would assist FNP students to conceptualize beyond individual needs; to consider the health of the whole family as well as the impact of the family on the health of the individual members. FNPs who understand how to intercede at the family systems level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1074840712443872">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>) might consequently enhance primary care outcomes. However, little work has considered whether FNP students learn principles of family nursing science or whether they are expected to apply those principles in primary care settings.</p>
<sec id="section2-1074840712443872">
<title>Historical Perspective</title>
<p>Over the last three decades, scholars have contributed meaningfully to family nursing, a specialty that emphasizes <italic>family as the unit of care</italic>. The amalgamation of family concepts from various disciplines that gave rise to the domain of family studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1074840712443872">National Council on Family Relations Task Force on the Development of the Family Discipline, 1988</xref>) inspired interested nurse scholars to incorporate family science into nursing. In 1988, attendees at the <italic>First</italic> International Family Nursing Conference acknowledged that nurses had long honored the importance of family in health care, enthusiastically reclaimed family as important to individuals’ health care needs, and identified family as an essential aspect of nursing care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1074840712443872">Bell, Wright, Leahey, Watson, &amp; Chenger, 1988</xref>). At this first conference, the call went out to advance family nursing science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1074840712443872">Wright &amp; Leahey, 1988</xref>). Scholars responded to that call, and by the start of the new millennium, following the <italic>Fifth</italic> International Family Research Conference in Chicago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1074840712443872">Bell (2000)</xref> confidently reflected about the progress in family nursing science, acknowledging that scholars of family nursing had made significant inroads. By this time, the term <italic>family</italic> was well-defined as more than the sum of its members; rather than focusing on the health of the individuals within the family, scholars had formed theories about how family functions as a unit and about the health of the family as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1074840712443872">Mercer, 1989</xref>). With “family” as the unit of investigation, nurse researchers had been grappling with practical issues related to family research methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1074840712443872">Feetham, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1074840712443872">Gilliss, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1074840712443872">Uphold &amp; Harper, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1074840712443872">Uphold &amp; Strickland, 1989</xref>) and began tackling problems related to the health of the family as an entity. As interest in family nursing grew rapidly, many nurses identified themselves as <italic>family nurses</italic> and convened in section groups of the <italic>National Council on Family Relations (NCFR)</italic> and the <italic>Midwest Nursing Research Society (MNRS)</italic>. Advances in the discipline of family nursing, chronicled in the <italic>Journal of Family Nursing</italic>, became readily accessible to practicing nurses. Scholars were poised to test family nursing theories and apply their findings to practice and educational curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1074840712443872">Feetham, Meister, Bell, &amp; Gilliss, 1993</xref>). By the mid 1990s, the scholarly discipline of family nursing was coming of age, and at the dawn of the 21st century, continues to grow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1074840712443872">Ganong, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In light of the progress in scholarship around family nursing science, it is important to gain an understanding about the parallel development of FNP program curricula. At the same time family health science was evolving in nursing scholarship, the role of the FNP was emerging to meet the needs of underserved populations for health promotion and prevention caused by a scarcity of primary care physicians in the United States. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1074840712443872">Sullivan, Dachelet, Sultz, &amp; Henry, 1978</xref>). Both <italic>family nurse practitioner</italic> and <italic>family nursing</italic> education programs included the notion of <italic>family</italic>. While family nursing programs developed to teach about caring for the family as a unit, FNP programs—adhering to early guidelines established by the National Organization of Nurse Practitioner Faculties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1074840712443872">Crabtree &amp; Pruitt, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1074840712443872">National Organization of Nurse Practitioner Faculties,1995</xref>) and AACN Essentials of Master’s Education for Advanced Practice Nursing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1074840712443872">American Association of Colleges of Nursing, 1996</xref>)—developed to prepare advanced practice nurses to provide care to individuals across the life span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1074840712443872">Gagan, Berg, &amp; Root, 2002</xref>). How much (or little) influence the growth of family nursing science in the decade of the 1990s had on those who conceptualized the curriculum standards for master’s education in the FNP program is difficult to ascertain. If Hanson’s observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1074840712443872">Hanson, 2005</xref>) are correct, U.S. graduate nurse practitioner programs have shifted emphasis to skills required to practice medical models of care at the expense of teaching family nursing science.</p>

<title>Relevant Scholarship</title>
<p>Over the years, several nursing texts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1074840712443872">Bomar &amp; McNeely, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1074840712443872">Freidman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1074840712443872">Hanson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1074840712443872">Hanson &amp; Boyd, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1074840712443872">Hanson, Gedaly-Duff, &amp; Kaakinen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1074840712443872">Kaakinen, Gedaly-Duff, Coehlo, &amp; Hanson, 2010</xref>) have compiled a growing body of robust theoretical notions about the relationship between the health of individuals and their family members. However, research regarding the integration of these concepts into nursing education is limited. Findings from two early studies about nursing education (Hanson &amp; Heims, 1992; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1074840712443872">Wright &amp; Bell, 1989</xref>) investigated ways family concepts and theories were incorporated into nursing curricula. These studies demonstrated that while family concepts were included, they were not integrated throughout the curriculum; instead, family content was limited primarily to community, maternal child, or mental health courses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1074840712443872">Wright and Bell (1989)</xref> identified gaps in teaching family interview and intervention skills in Canadian nursing programs and concluded that Canadian graduate nursing programs were not adequately teaching family concepts or family intervention skills. Similarly, Hanson and Heims (1992) investigated nursing curricula in the United States and also discovered gaps in the core curriculum, clinical family assessment, and intervention courses. Furthermore, they found that many faculty members teaching this content lacked expertise in family nursing science, casting some doubts about the quality of family nursing pedagogy in graduate nursing education.</p>
<p>Two studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1074840712443872">Hart &amp; Macnee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1074840712443872">Scherer et al., 2008</xref>) concentrated on the composition of FNP curriculum and the preparedness of nurse practitioner graduates, but inquiry about family science in the FNP curriculum was notably absent. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1074840712443872">Hart and Macnee (2007)</xref> determined graduates’ levels of preparation in several key areas—skills like differential diagnosis, pathophysiology, pharmacology, clinical management of acute diseases, and procedures such as splinting, suturing, casting, coding and billing—but failed to inquire about intervening with families in clinical settings. Similarly, a study investigating nurse practitioner graduate preparedness to care for older adults inquired about students’ levels of comfort with health promotion and prevention, knowledge of disease management, and physical and psychosocial issues of older individuals, but omitted inquiry about family in relation to care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1074840712443872">Scherer et al., 2008</xref>). Findings from these studies raise questions about whether family models of care are actually used by FNP students in their clinical practica and by graduate FNPs in practice.</p>
<p>The National Organization of Nurse Practitioner Faculties (NONPF) together with the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) published the most comprehensive joint survey of nurse practitioner program curricula, including core master’s didactic and clinical practicum content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1074840712443872">Berlin et al., 2002</xref>). The majority of FNP programs indicated offering theory as part of the core curriculum or incorporated theory in practicum courses. The report does not specify types of theory, so it is unknown whether family theory was included in didactic course work. Other possible domains in which principles of family science likely are integrated in these programs include assessment, human development, sociocultural diversity, community health, evidence-based practice, and genetics. The vast majority of the FNP programs listed those topical areas, but family health and family nursing were not explicitly referenced.</p>
<p>Other research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1074840712443872">Burman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1074840712443872">Cogdill, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1074840712443872">Rasch &amp; Cogdill, 1999</xref>) had focused on the integration of evidence-based information in clinical decision making, but these investigators did not inquire about application of family theories in clinical judgment. A more recent international survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1074840712443872">Pulcini et al., 2010</xref>), also including programs in the United States, focused on advanced practice nursing education, practice, and regulation, but inquiry about application of family science in the FNP program again was absent. To date, research about integration of family nursing science in clinical practice courses has not been a priority for inquiry.</p>
<p>In summary, researchers have studied the content of family science in undergraduate and in some types of graduate nursing programs but not in graduate FNP programs. A review of research on graduate FNP programs and preparedness to practice sheds light on many aspects of clinical knowledge application, but the research has overlooked the use of family nursing in the clinical setting. Hence questions remain regarding whether FNP students learn principles of family nursing science in didactic courses and whether they are expected to apply them in clinical practice. The present study conveys a practical summary for U.S. educators about the nationwide status of one area of nursing science—family nursing—in the advanced practice curriculum; the findings may provoke FNP educators to engage in a new conversation about family nursing science in graduate nursing education.</p>

<title>Research Questions</title>
<p>The aim of this descriptive study was to gain an understanding about the current pedagogy pertaining to family nursing in FNP programs in the United States. These questions guided the study: (a) What underlying philosophies guide FNP programs? (b) Which family theories and models are taught to FNP students? (c) What family concepts are included in the FNP curriculum? (d) Are family concepts integrated into clinical practicum courses?</p>

<title>Definitions</title>
<p>Three paradigms of nursing care were identified for this study: (a) <italic>family as the unit of care</italic>; (b) <italic>family as the context of care for the individual</italic>; and (c) <italic>individual as the unit of care</italic>. For the purpose of this study, the concept of <italic>family as the unit of care</italic> originated from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1074840712443872">Wright and Leahey’s (1987a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1074840712443872">1987b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1074840712443872">1990)</xref> key philosophical tenet regarding Family Systems Nursing, which focuses on the whole family as the unit of care. The scope of caring for the family as a unit includes attending to health and illness consequences ensuing from shared beliefs, relationships, interactions, and interrelated transactions in the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1074840712443872">Denham, 2003</xref>). The goal of caring for the family unit is enhancement of health for the family as a whole and nursing care is directed toward the whole family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1074840712443872">Wright &amp; Leahey, 1987a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1074840712443872">1987b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1074840712443872">1990)</xref>. From this perspective, nurses seek to understand the family’s health based on their shared and distinct perceptions; <italic>family health</italic> is defined by agreed on beliefs about health, illness, and suffering in families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1074840712443872">Wright &amp; Bell, 2009</xref>), and persists beyond dwelling in the family home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1074840712443872">Denham, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>An alternative conceptualization of family nursing also takes the family into account, but with the <italic>family as context of care</italic> for the individual. Assessment of the family as context includes family-related information, but focuses on presenting needs of identified individuals. From this perspective, family members serve as sources of information about the individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1074840712443872">Gilliss, 1991</xref>) and the family is characterized based on the needs and perceptions of individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1074840712443872">Denham, 2003</xref>); family health care is directed at resolving individuals’ unmet needs within the family rather than influencing the needs of the family as an entity or responding to the interactional health effects between individuals in the family.</p>
<p>In the United States, health care delivery systems developed at a time when medical care was concentrated on episodic care of the individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1074840712443872">Wright &amp; Leahey, 1990</xref>). The metaparadigm emphasis in nursing on “person” as the beneficiary of care evolved in that same health care delivery environment. When the <italic>individual is the unit of care</italic>, the clinical focus is on individual health needs, demands, or requisites in isolation from the needs of the family. Assessment is focused solely on the individual’s health, and interventions are targeted at resolving these unmet needs without involving the linked family members.</p>

<sec id="section7-1074840712443872">
<title>Survey Instrument</title>
<p>The <italic>Family Nurse Practitioner Curriculum Survey</italic> was developed by the investigators after a review of family nursing subject matter in textbooks commonly used to teach family nursing and an analysis of topical themes from the <italic>Journal of Family Nursing</italic>. Before deploying the survey, the questionnaire was examined by experts in family nursing science and FNP education to establish face validity. The final questionnaire comprised 26 structured response items, including the following topics: institutional demographics, underlying philosophies of the FNP program, use of family theories and assessment models, family concepts taught in the FNP core curriculum, and the integration of the concept of <italic>family</italic> into clinical practicum courses. While reliability is a critical concern in instrumentation, the analyses for this article did not utilize any composite scores; therefore, reliability coefficients were not calculated.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The survey was sent to directors of all the identified FNP programs. Strategies to improve return rates suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1074840712443872">Dillman (2000)</xref> were used to maximize survey returns. An initial e-mail was sent to participants to inform them that the study was taking place. Shortly after this initial e-mail, directors of FNP programs were mailed a copy of the survey. Three weeks later, a follow-up e-mail was sent to thank those who had already completed the survey and to remind those who still had not returned one. After another 3 weeks, the principal investigator and a graduate assistant called nonrespondents, inviting them to participate. A total of 92 surveys were returned for an overall response rate of 34.6%. Unique identifiers were removed from data to preserve participant confidentiality.</p>

<p>The survey respondents were primarily FNP Program Directors/Coordinators (83.7%) and FNP instructors (9.8%), with a few respondents holding multiple positions or other administrative positions: department chair and FNP instructor (2.2%), program director and FNP instructor (1.1%), department chair (1.1%), associate dean of graduate programs (1.1%), and one missing response (1.1%). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1074840712443872">Table 1</xref> presents an overview of the institution and program characteristics. Across the programs, the number of certified FNP faculty was split; slightly less than half of the programs employed three or fewer FNPs (44.6%) and slightly more than half employed four or more FNPs (53.3%). The numbers of faculty members considered to be experts in family theory or family nursing ranged from <italic>no faculty experts</italic> (28.6%), <italic>one faculty expert</italic> (25.0%), <italic>two faculty experts</italic> (20.2%), and <italic>three or more experts</italic> (26.2%).

<p>Approximately half of the FNP programs surveyed were located in public schools (55.4%). Survey responses were obtained from 37 of the 50 states and the District of Columbia.

Of the 92 surveys returned, 44 (47.8%) were from the South, 18 (19.6%) were from the Northeast, 18 (19.6%) were from the Midwest, and 12 (13.0%) were from the West. Approximately half (47.8%) of all the programs graduate 11 to 20 students annually, with the remaining programs divided between less than 10 (22.8%) and more than 20 (27.2%).</p>
<p>More than a third (38.0%) of the schools also offered a PhD in nursing or doctor of science in nursing (DSN). Nearly half of the programs that offered a DSN also reported having a PhD program (46.7%, <italic>n</italic> = 7). Most FNP programs were taught within multiple degree and certification programs in the same school (78.3%). The FNP program was most often taught in the master of science (MS) or master of science in nursing (MSN) program (94.6%); 77% of these schools also included the FNP program in other degree areas. Frequently (72.8%), a post-master’s FNP Certificate program was offered alongside other programs granting FNP preparation in the same school. Only a small number of schools nest the FNP program in the doctor of nursing practice (DNP) program (7.6%).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to discover the extent to which family nursing science is imparted in FNP programs. The current findings represent FNP programs from every geographic area in the United States, from small and large programs, with a variety of faculty expertise in family theory. Most of the participating FNP programs granted the MSN degree or a post-master’s FNP certificate. Only a small percentage of programs that offered the DNP were represented. Findings from this study provide useful information that can assist us to better understand the current state of family science application in U.S. FNP programs.</p>
<sec id="section21-1074840712443872">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>We have tried to ensure that the survey findings are as representative as possible, but it is important to acknowledge the limitations of this study. Given the nature of survey research, the respondents of this study and the programs they represent may not accurately reflect the FNP programs in the United States. However, as the survey was clearly about the use of family theories, models, and family focus, the program directors responding to this survey are more likely to represent programs that incorporate these elements into their curriculum. Therefore, this study might actually <italic>overrepresent</italic> the amount of family content taught to FNP students. Nevertheless, as only 16.3% of programs reported teaching <italic>other</italic> family theories and models in the FNP curriculum, we feel confident that the survey appropriately captured the most popular and widely used theories and models.</p>
<p>Only a small percentage of programs that offered the DNP were represented in this study. While nursing theories may be imparted differently in DNP/FNP programs than in MSN/FNP programs, the small number of schools that reported having the DNP/FNP did not allow us to investigate whether differences exist between MSN/FNP and DNP/FNP programs. Given the uneven sample size across geographic regions, differences in regional preference for family theories and models taught in FNP programs were impossible to identify.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1074840712443872">
<title>Discussion of Findings</title>
<p>Study results indicate that most FNP programs instruct students about family theories in some way, whether in courses dedicated solely to family theory, in forums that teach various theories applicable to advanced nursing practice, or integrated with other coursework. Notably, the most frequently taught theory was <italic>Family Systems Nursing Theory</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1074840712443872">Wright &amp; Leahey, 1988</xref>), the heart of an expansive development in family nursing science—the <italic>Calgary Family Assessment Model</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1074840712443872">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>). This <italic>Calgary Model</italic> lends a cogent structure for assessment of families and could be used by FNPs in primary care to appraise family health. Indeed, the <italic>Calgary Family Assessment Model</italic> is presented in almost half the FNP program. Additionally, the majority of programs indicated that they give students at least some conceptual grounding in family processes, contextual and environmental factors related to family health, and family roles. A good number of FNP programs instruct students about family support, coping, decision making, and health and illness roles in the family. These findings suggest that FNP students generally receive a conceptual family science foundation on which to build clinical training in family health appraisal and intervention. However, not all FNP programs report teaching family theories and models.</p>
<p>Given that most students are receiving a foundation in family theory, it was interesting to find that it is not typical for FNP students to be taught how to apply family health concepts or to adopt assessment models from family nursing science into the clinical practicum. For instance, in striking contrast to the 48.9% of respondents reporting that they present the <italic>Calgary Family Assessment Model</italic> and the 30.4% who reported teaching the <italic>Friedman Assessment Model</italic> in didactic courses, less than a quarter of programs often teach FNP students how to actually use these family assessment tools in clinical practice. Even though a preponderance of FNP students are instructed in many of the contextual and environmental factors influencing family health, fewer than half of the programs require students in the clinical practicum to appraise these factors, as demonstrated by how few expect students to assess family roles and family decision making or to construct a family tree, genogram, or eco-map.</p>
<p>This study corroborates findings from previous investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1074840712443872">Blasdell, Klunick, &amp; Purseglove, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1074840712443872">Nicoteri &amp; Andrews 2003</xref>) indicating that advanced practice nurses in primary care settings prefer medical models over nursing models of care. In the early days of family medicine as a certified specialty, the emphasis was placed on the “family as patient” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1074840712443872">Ransom, 1983</xref>). In much the way that family medicine has moved away from intervening in the family as the contextual focus of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1074840712443872">Dickinson, 2011</xref>), primary care nurse practitioners are trending toward that medical model; the direction of family health science in FNP education seems to be evolving in ways similar to what has occurred in family practice medical education.</p>
<p>If only a minority of the programs expect students to perform family assessments or interventions, students likely will not perceive these skills as critical aspects of the FNP role. Fewer than 19% of the respondents indicated that they <italic>often</italic> expect students to intervene in <italic>the family as the unit of care</italic>. Nurses graduating from FNP programs are unlikely to see themselves as family nurses if 95% of the practicum courses teach them to attend to the <italic>individual as the unit of care</italic>. These graduates may be less likely to identify the complexity of family contributions to the health and illness of individuals. Given that the majority of programs (60.4%) teach <italic>family as the context of care for the individual</italic>, FNP students might not clearly understand the implications for the entire family’s health when the individual seeks care. Although research suggests that the daily living patterns of families serve as health determinants for the family and its individual members, assessment of health related family routines are not emphasized in most of the participant FNP programs.</p>
<p>Finally, students do not seem to be learning how to intervene in the shared family decisions that influence daily health routines and use of family resources. Without supervised practice in applying principles of family assessment, FNP students may fail to recognize the significance of family influences on the individual’s lived experiences of health and illness; more importantly, students may miss opportunities to intervene as the family strives for health within the contextual and larger system interactions surrounding family health routines. Few students educated in the FNP programs represented in this study are being taught to fully appreciate the complex, dynamic, interactive, and ecological family influences on health and illness care needs of individuals, or on the health of the family as a whole.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The findings of this study give educators a report about the status of teaching family nursing science in the nation’s FNP programs. This study raises philosophical as well as practical questions about family nursing science pedagogy in the United States. In the philosophical realm, the results highlight the difference between what is believed about family health and what is expected of students in the clinical arena. Notably, dissonance exists between the most frequently presented theoretical family framework, <italic>Family Systems Nursing Theory</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1074840712443872">Wright &amp; Leahey, 1988</xref>), which is based on holistic notions of the family, and the predominant expectation in nursing practicum courses to attend almost exclusively to the <italic>individual as the unit of care</italic>. Also, discrepancies between what is most often embraced as the FNP program guiding belief—in <italic>family as the context of care for the individual</italic>—and what is expected of students in the clinical practicum—to assess and plan for <italic>the individual as the unit of care</italic>—underscores ambiguities in education about the metatheoretical underpinnings of the FNP role.</p>
<p>These discrepancies identified by this study may provoke FNP educators to engage in a new conversation about family nursing science in graduate education. This dialogue is well-timed. As the DNP evolves and becomes requisite for entry into advanced practice, discussions about what constitutes the essential body of knowledge for advanced practice have been front and center among educators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1074840712443872">Burman et al., 2009</xref>) and associations that establish the standards for graduate nursing programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1074840712443872">American Association of Colleges of Nursing, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1074840712443872">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1074840712443872">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1074840712443872">National Organization of Nurse Practitioner Faculties, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1074840712443872">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1074840712443872">2011</xref>). Results of this FNP family nursing curriculum survey may contribute to the deliberations among educators as they continue to grapple with what constitutes the program of study for advanced practice nursing. Such philosophical questions about the core purposes of the FNP role in primary care are begging to be addressed by FNPs dually prepared in both nursing scholarship and primary care practice. Like all sentinels of the discipline of nursing, scholars who are FNPs need to question what models guide their practices. It is incumbent on scholars to examine the assumption that FNP practice will be co-opted by other health disciplines into adopting their models of care. Now is a particularly opportune moment to articulate the philosophy and scope of FNP practice at a time when, in the “Future of Nursing” report, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1074840712443872">Institute of Medicine (2011)</xref> has insisted on removing the barriers that restrict nursing’s response to the primary care needs of patients as they call on nurses to practice to the full extent of their education and training. The DNP program development affords the discipline of nursing a prime opportunity to refine the definition of knowledge for practice. The challenge from this article goes out to FNP/DNP educators to firmly ensconce family science into the nursing curricula used to prepare FNPs.</p>
<p>Looking at the study results from a practical perspective raises the question, “How can dissonance be resolved between what is imparted theoretically about family science to FNP students and what is practiced?” This pragmatic question brings to the forefront several concerns. Are FNP faculties adequately prepared to instruct students about how appropriately to intervene with families in the primary care setting? Three quarters of the FNP programs surveyed reported to have at least one family nursing expert teaching family nursing theory. However, the competencies of FNP faculties to integrate family principles into clinical practicum courses were not investigated in this study, leaving questions about the ways FNP faculty members view families, the things they actually teach students, and the behaviors they model. Further investigation is needed to address the lingering concern about the preparedness of FNP faculties to teach students about application of family concepts and theories in the clinical practicum. Perhaps in collaboration with expert teachers in family nursing science, FNP educators can create new models of family nursing care education tailored to meet the needs of FNP students preparing to enter primary care environments. FNP educators could subsequently design faculty practice models, where FNP students would see examples of family nursing care in clinical practice, encompassing demonstrations of family assessment, appropriate interventions, and ways to evaluate outcomes. Certainly, FNP faculties could obtain training in clinical family nursing pedagogy from colleagues who currently direct family nursing clinical laboratories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1074840712443872">Duhamel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1074840712443872">Eggenberger &amp; Regan, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Another pragmatic concern for curriculum design relates to whether the competencies for clinical practice as outlined by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1074840712443872">National Organization of Nurse Practitioner Faculties (1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1074840712443872">2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1074840712443872">American Association of Colleges of Nursing (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1074840712443872">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1074840712443872">2011)</xref> clearly designate family nursing science as an essential component for FNP education. In addition to defining “family” competencies as caring for each individual in the family at each family member’s developmental stage, FNP competencies could incorporate norms of family nursing science. <italic>The essentials of doctoral education for advanced nursing practice</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1074840712443872">American Association of Colleges of Nursing, 2006</xref>) requires the DNP graduate who is prepared for advanced practice to demonstrate expertise with “expanded responsibility and accountability in the care and management of individuals and <italic>families</italic> [emphasis added]” (p. 18). However, unless family nursing science is defined as a critical component of the FNP clinical practicum, nurses learning to become FNPs in most of the nation’s programs likely will not learn to attend to the <italic>family as the unit of care</italic> or <italic>family as the context of care for the individual</italic>; thus graduates will be unlikely to consider the complexity of family needs or to assist the family in their responses to health and illness.</p>
<p>For family nurse scientists, discoveries from this study deliver a progress report on how the theories and practice models they have generated and tested are being promoted in graduate education. We have responded to an important concern about how the development of the FNP role may be contributing to the dilution of family scholarship in graduate nursing programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1074840712443872">Hanson, 2005</xref>). We offer an optimistic rejoinder to this concern: Practicing FNPs could become principal consumers of family nursing science. To this end, we hope that the study findings will challenge practicing FNP faculty to raise questions about the ways they personally use family models to guide practice, integrate methods of family assessment, and deliver family interventions in primary care settings. We ask FNP faculty, who most reasonably could propagate family nursing science in clinical practicum courses, to consider becoming as expert in family nursing science as they are in pathophysiology, physical assessment, diagnostic thinking, and pharmacology. We realize that as quality outcome indicators become pivotal for the further development of innovative practices by nurses in primary care, evidence-based interventions will be essential. Hence, we reiterate the plea made by others to continue to refine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1074840712443872">Chesla, 2010</xref>) and increase the number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1074840712443872">Ganong, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1074840712443872">Loveland-Cherry, 2006</xref>) of family nursing intervention studies. We believe practicing FNPs will make use of studies that answer clinical questions about how the FNP can assist families in regulating routines to promote or detract from well-being during times of developmental change and growth; how to intervene in the family management of acute and chronic illnesses; and to assist the family when a member suffers from disability, mental illness, chronic suffering, or the end of life. We call on FNP faculty and family nursing scientists to collaborate in developing methods of teaching family nursing assessment and intervention models for primary care settings.</p>
