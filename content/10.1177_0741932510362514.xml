<abstract>
<p>This article provides a methodological illustration of how to conduct randomized controls trials (RCT) for secondary levels of prevention within the context of three-tiered models of support. First, the authors demonstrate one method of using school-wide data to identify middle school students (<italic>N</italic> = 45) who were struggling in academic and behavioral domains. Second, the authors describe the procedures for conducting an RCT to compare two interventions (study skills [<italic>n</italic> = 34] and conflict resolution [<italic>n</italic> = 31]) relative to a business-as-usual condition (study skills [<italic>n</italic> = 34]). Third, the authors conclude by offering recommendations for conducting scientifically rigorous—yet feasible—investigations within three-tiered models of prevention that adhere to the core quality indicators recommended by Gersten, Fuchs, Compton, Coyne, Greenwood, and Innocenti.</p>

<p>In the past 10 years, a number of mandates have been issued addressing concerns regarding school safety, with an effort to prevent problem behaviors from occurring so that teachers and students can fully concentrate on the tasks of teaching and learning. For example, Title IV of <italic>Improving America’s Schools Act of 1994</italic> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0741932510362514"><italic>The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act</italic> (1994)</xref> urged state and local agencies to develop school-wide violence prevention programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0741932510362514">Satcher, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0741932510362514">Turnbull et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, zero-tolerance policies and stringent consequences for disruptive and dangerous behaviors have been instituted in efforts to support a get-tough initiative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0741932510362514">Kartub, Taylor-Greene, March, &amp; Horner, 2000</xref>). The White House issued a call for systematic change to ensure safe and nonviolent schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0741932510362514">Kern &amp; Manz, 2004</xref>). The Surgeon General’s report on youth violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0741932510362514">Satcher, 2001</xref>) provided four recommendations to address antisocial behavior in schools: eliminate antisocial groups, improve academic achievement, facilitate more positive school climates, and implement primary prevention plans. The reauthorization of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0741932510362514"><italic>Individuals With Disabilities Education Act</italic> (2004)</xref> also called for</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>providing incentives for whole-school approaches, scientifically based early reading programs, positive behavior interventions and supports, and early intervening services to reduce the need to label children as disabled in order to address the learning and behavioral needs of such children. (p. 4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Collectively, these mandates emphasize the need for a systematic method of preventing the development of and responding to existing instances of antisocial behavior within an overarching goal of improving academic, behavioral, and social outcomes for students.</p>
<p>In response to these mandates and concerns surrounding antisocial behavior, many schools have shifted away from traditional, reactive approaches to discipline toward more proactive solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0741932510362514">Lane, Kalberg, &amp; Menzies, 2009</xref>). To this end, many schools have adopted three-tiered models of prevention, such as response to intervention (RTI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0741932510362514">Gresham, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0741932510362514">Sugai, Horner, &amp; Gresham, 2002</xref>) and positive behavior supports (PBS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0741932510362514">Lewis &amp; Sugai, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0741932510362514">Sugai &amp; Horner, 2002</xref>). These data-driven models provide a systematic approach to (a) preventing the development of new instances of learning and behavior problems and (b) responding more effectively to students with existing learning and behavior problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0741932510362514">Lane, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0741932510362514">Lane, Little et al., 2009</xref>). These models include primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of prevention that increase in intensity with a goal of providing supports based on students’ needs.</p>
<p>Primary prevention efforts focus on preventing harm from occurring. Examples of such programs include violence prevention and conflict resolution programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0741932510362514">Stevens, De Bourdeaudhuij, &amp; Van Oost, 2000</xref>). As part of these programs, school-wide expectations are established and taught to all students. Students are given opportunities to practice and receive reinforcement for meeting these expectations. Secondary prevention efforts are designed to reverse harm by providing the requisite supports for students who are not responsive to primary prevention efforts. Oftentimes, secondary supports include small group interventions for students with common acquisition or performance deficits such as social skills (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0741932510362514">Lane et al., 2003</xref>) and reading skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0741932510362514">Lane, Little, Rhodes, Phillips, &amp; Welsh, 2007</xref>). Tertiary prevention efforts are designed to reduce harm by providing individualized, intensive interventions for students exposed to multiple risk factors and for those who have not responded to secondary prevention attempts. Examples of tertiary supports include function-based interventions and mental health services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0741932510362514">Kern &amp; Manz, 2004</xref>). Central to this model is the use of a data-driven system to analyze data collected as part of regular school practices to determine how students are progressing over time and identify students who may benefit from targeted interventions.</p>
<p>Currently there is widespread application of three-tiered models of prevention at the elementary level and to a lesser extent at the middle and high school levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0741932510362514">Lane, Robertson, &amp; Graham-Bailey, 2006</xref>). Yet despite the growing trend toward the application of these models, there is limited information about how to (a) use a data-based approach to identify students for secondary supports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741932510362514">Cheney, Blum, &amp; Walker, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741932510362514">Kamps, Kravits, Stolze, &amp; Swaggart, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0741932510362514">Lane, Kalberg, Bruhn, Mahoney, &amp; Driscoll, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0741932510362514">Lane et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0741932510362514">Lane et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0741932510362514">Walker, Cheney, Stage, &amp; Blum, 2005</xref>), (b) conduct scientifically rigorous studies (e.g., RCT) of secondary supports within three-tiered models of prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0741932510362514">Robertson &amp; Lane, 2007</xref>), and (c) apply these models in middle schools—possibly because of the unique features of working in secondary schools (e.g., interacting with multiple teachers and curricular demands; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0741932510362514">Isakson &amp; Jarvis, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0741932510362514">Lane, Pierson, &amp; Givner, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>As we attempt to advance the science of three-tiered models of prevention in applied settings—particularly at the middle school level—it is increasingly important to offer illustrations and applications that adhere to the highest standards. Recently a series of articles were published as part of a special issue published by the <italic>Exceptional Children</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741932510362514">Gersten et al., 2005</xref>) to provide guidelines for constructing and evaluating a range of studies conducted using descriptive, single case, and group design methodologies. The guidelines specified for group design experimental and quasi-experimental studies specified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741932510362514">Gersten et al. (2005)</xref> were intended to help research and teaching communities establish evidence-based practices to support students and teachers. Only when interventions adhere to the core quality indicators for establishing the underlying conceptualization, describing participants, implementing interventions and describing comparison conditions, selecting outcome measures, and analyzing data as recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741932510362514">Gersten et al. (2005)</xref> can we draw accurate conclusions regarding intervention outcomes. It is critical that we determine what is evidence-based practice before it is recommended to schools for wide-scale implementation.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0741932510362514">Robertson and Lane (2007)</xref> attempted to offer such an application by providing a model of a pre-post experimental design aligned with quality indicators recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741932510362514">Gersten et al. (2005)</xref>. In this study, they attempted to answer the question, How do we best support middle school students who have behavioral and academic concerns? To this end, they offered a methodological illustration of how to use extant data collected as part of regular school practices to identify middle school students in need of secondary support. Then, they examined the impact of (a) academic (study skills [SS]) and (b) academic and behavioral (SS and conflict resolution skills [CRS]) interventions for middle school students identified by school-wide data as having academic and behavioral deficits. However, this study had two key limitations. First, this study did not include a comparison (business as usual) group. Second, treatment integrity was collected using self-report techniques (which involved teachers completing daily behavior component checklists, reporting the extent to which they completed each intervention component each day) rather than direct observation procedures (e.g., outside observers completing behavior component checklists).</p>
<sec id="section1-0741932510362514">
<title>Purpose</title>
<p>In the present article, we had both methodological and theoretical objectives. The methodological objective was to provide an illustration of how to conduct and evaluate a secondary support implemented at the middle school level as part of a three-tiered model of prevention. We extend the previous work in this area by improving on the scientific rigor of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0741932510362514">Robertson and Lane (2007)</xref> illustration. To this end, we added a comparison condition and a more direct measure of treatment fidelity.</p>
<p>The theoretical objective of this study was to further elucidate the relation between academic underachievement and problem behaviors at the middle school level—when (a) the consequences of limited academic, social, and behavioral skills become more severe and (b) competencies in SS and CRS become increasingly more important given the task demands (e.g., long-term assignments) and nature (e.g., interactions with numerous teachers and students) of the middle school environment. It may be that intervention efforts must address both domains rather than academic skills in isolation to influence middle school students’ academic and behavioral performances. Furthermore, it may be that certain student characteristics (e.g., level of problem severity and reading ability) may differently influence the extent to which students require more comprehensive intervention efforts. For example, it may be that students with weaker reading skills or with more intense behavior problems may require interventions targeting academic and behavioral domains rather than interventions targeting only academic domains.</p>
<p>To accomplish both objectives, the article is organized as follows. First, we demonstrate how to use school-wide data collected as part of regular school practices to identify students who are nonresponsive to the primary prevention program. Specifically, we identify students with academic and behavioral concerns. Second, we use a randomized control design to examine the utility of secondary interventions focusing on either SS or CRS relative to a business as usual condition in improving the academic and behavioral performance for student participants. Features of the secondary intervention include random assignment of students to intervention condition, monitoring of treatment integrity from teacher and research assistant (RA) perspectives, and assessment of social validity from student and teacher perspectives. Finally, we conclude by offering a brief description of intervention outcomes and a detailed evaluation of the core quality indicators as applied to the current study.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 45 students (33 males and 12 females) with academic and behavioral concerns according to school-wide data (inclusion criteria to follow; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0741932510362514">Table 1</xref>). Seventeen (38%) were in seventh grade, and 28 (62%) were in eighth grade. All participants were Caucasian, with a mean age of 13.33 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.78; range = 12.00–15.02 at project onset). Chi-square analysis contrasting Group × Grade Level, χ<sup>2</sup>(2, <italic>N</italic> = 45) = 1.26, <italic>p</italic> = 0.53, was not significant. Because of low cell sizes, chi-square analyses contrasting Group × Gender and Group × Ethnicity were not conducted. One-way analysis of variances revealed no significant differences between groups in age, <italic>F</italic>(2, 42) = 1.24, <italic>p</italic> = 0.30, or reading skills, <italic>F</italic>(2, 42) = 0.49, <italic>p</italic> = 0.61.</p>

<title>Procedures</title>
<p>Foster Garden Middle School (FGMS; pseudonym) participated in a privately funded professional development training series focusing on PBS at the secondary level after obtaining the appropriate university and district approvals. FGMS is an inclusive, rural middle school located in middle Tennessee. Students included approximately 536 sixth, seventh, and eighth grade youngsters during the 2005–2006 academic year, approximately half of whom are male (51.24%; <italic>n</italic> = 289). The vast majority of the students were Caucasian (<italic>n</italic> = 522; 97.38%). Approximately, 30.8% of FGMS students received free or reduced lunch status, which was a substantially greater percentage than the district mean of 8.9%. Approximately 20% students (<italic>n</italic> = 113) received special education services. This percentage, while higher than the national percentage (1%–5%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0741932510362514">Sugai &amp; Horner, 2002</xref>), was comparable to the district percentage of 12.4% during the 2005–2006 academic year.</p>
<p>FGMS employed 37 teachers, all of whom agreed to implement the school-wide PBS (SW-PBS) plan as part of regular school practices. However, only 72.97% (<italic>n</italic> = 27) of the teachers consented to participate in the evaluation study of the SW-PBS plan. Teacher responsibilities in the evaluation study included completing monthly treatment fidelity ratings and allowing research staff to directly observe at random times throughout the year but no more than once a month.</p>

<sec id="section5-0741932510362514">
<title>SW-PBS Plan</title>
<p>At the time of this study, the middle school was implementing the second year of its SW-PBS plan. The plan included three areas of support: academics, behavior, and social skills. Specifically, the plan delineated behavioral expectations for students and teachers in each focus area, procedures for teaching and reinforcing expectations, and procedures for monitoring plan implementation and student progress. Academic and behavioral expectations were identified as those skills rated by the majority of the faculty as critical for student success. Social skills expectations were those specified by the Character Under Construction program, a district-wide social skills program. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0741932510362514">Figure 1</xref> provides a description of school-wide procedures for teaching, reinforcing, and monitoring. In terms of monitoring, FGMS monitored a wide range of student outcomes including office discipline referrals, course grades, attendance, referrals (general education intervention team, counseling, alternative learning center, and special education), and the at-risk status using the <italic>Student Risk Screening Scale</italic> (SRSS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0741932510362514">Drummond, 1994</xref>). The SRSS is a teacher-completed 7-item screener used to identify students who are at moderate or high risk for antisocial behavior. Homeroom teachers rated each item (steals; lies, cheats, and sneaks; behavior problems; peer rejection; low achievement; negative attitude; and aggressive behavior) on a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from <italic>never</italic> (0), <italic>occasionally</italic> (1), <italic>sometimes</italic> (2), to <italic>frequently</italic> (3). Total scores from 0–3 indicate low risk, 4–8 indicate moderate risk, and 9–21 indicate high risk. The SRSS is a psychometrically sound, cost-effective tool for distinguishing between students who do and do not show characteristics of antisocial behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0741932510362514">Drummond, Eddy, &amp; Reid, 1998</xref>).</p>

<title>Identifying Nonresponsive Students</title>
<p>The PBS team members and the project director analyzed the school-wide data at the end of the academic year to identify returning students (rising seventh and eighth graders) who continued to have academic and behavioral concerns at year-end, despite participation in the SW-PBS plan. Inclusionary criteria were as follows: (a) an academic concern referred to earning a fourth-quarter grade point average (GPA) less than or equal to 2.7 or earning one or more failing grades during the fourth quarter and (b) a behavioral concern referred to earning a moderate (4–8) or high risk (9–21) rating for antisocial behavior on the SRSS during the year-end administration or one or more discipline referrals during the final semester of the school year. A total of 74 students (25 rising seventh graders, 49 rising eighth graders) were identified at the end of the academic year and randomly assigned to participate in one of three conditions: SS (25; 8 rising seventh graders, 17 rising eight graders), CRS (24; 8 rising seventh graders, 16 rising eight graders), or regular school practices (25; 9 rising seventh graders, 16 rising eight graders), using a stratified random sampling procedure to distribute the severity of problem behavior and reading difficulties evenly. These interventions were scheduled to take place separate from this research project.</p>
<p>At the onset of the following school year, 68 students were still enrolled in the school and began the secondary prevention program. The other students had moved out of the district, decided to home school, or had been placed in an alternative learning center. Parental consent and student assent were requested for the students who were still present at the onset of the year (<italic>n</italic> = 68). Parental consent and student assent were obtained for 13 students in the SS condition, 15 in the conflict resolution condition, and 17 in the control condition. The remaining 23 parents did not return the consent forms; there were no consents returned in which parents declined to participate. Although data were collected and analyzed for the 45 consented students, all students still in attendance participated in the program.</p>

<sec id="section7-0741932510362514">
<title>Intervention Conditions</title>
<p>During the previous academic year, the PBS team identified two basic concerns for students: (a) limited SS, which made it difficult for students to manage long-term assignments and learn materials not taught explicitly through teacher-led instruction, and (b) limited skills to resolve conflicts with and negotiate the varying expectations held by teachers and peers. Collectively, the PBS team members voiced concerns that these two areas of deficits often prompted office referrals. Because time during the school day is limited, this study was conducted to determine which approach—improving SS or improving CRS—would best support students in managing the academic and interpersonal demands of the middle school setting relative to regular school practices.</p>
<sec id="section8-0741932510362514">
<title>SS</title>
<p>The SS curriculum included skills and strategies to acquire and demonstrate knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0741932510362514">Deschler et al., 2001</xref>), which had been validated for use with adolescents with behavior and academic problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0741932510362514">Bos &amp; Vaughn, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0741932510362514">Deschler et al., 2001</xref>). Namely, the curriculum teaches strategies to acquire knowledge from text, discussions, and teacher-directed lessons. Topics include note-taking strategies (e.g., Cornell, Two Column; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741932510362514">Faber, Morris, &amp; Lieberman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0741932510362514">Roberts, 1999</xref>) and graphic organizers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0741932510362514">Bryant, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741932510362514">Englert &amp; Mariage, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0741932510362514">1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0741932510362514">McCormick &amp; Cooper, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0741932510362514">Ogle, 1986</xref>). Next, students were taught strategies for demonstrating knowledge on various assessments and products. Topics included organization and goal settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0741932510362514">Lenz, Ehren, &amp; Smiley, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0741932510362514">Miller &amp; Kelley, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0741932510362514">Raskind, Goldberg, Higgins, &amp; Herman, 1999</xref>), test-taking, and writing skills (e.g., planning and editing; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0741932510362514">Bos &amp; Vaughn, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0741932510362514">Rekruk, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0741932510362514">Sabornie &amp; deBettencourt, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0741932510362514">Swee-Eng, Cheng, Lam, &amp; Ngan, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>CRS</title>
<p>The Productive Conflict Resolution Program (PCRP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0741932510362514">School Mediation Center, 1998</xref>) was selected by the PBS team and the university from a list of recommended conflict resolutions programs identified in the report <italic>A Guide to Implementing Programs in Schools, Youth-Serving Organizations, and Community and Juvenile Justice Settings: Program Report</italic>. This report was published by the U.S. Department of Education, in conjunction with the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program, U.S. Department of Justice, and the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. The Attorney General and Secretary of Education recommended that schools use this report as a guide for implementing effective school-based approaches. PCRP was cited as an effective program for teaching sixth through eighth grade students the following goals:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(a) empower students and teachers with the skills necessary to resolve conflicts productively, (b) develop emotional intelligence, (c) create and uphold social justice, (d) aid in the development of responsible citizenship, and (e) create a caring and cooperative whole school environment. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0741932510362514">School Mediation Center, 1998</xref>, p. B-3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Instructional topics included understanding conflict, cooperation, conflict styles, valuing diversity, listening skills, expression skills, problem solving, forgiveness, and reconciliation. Supplemental lesson overviews and required instructional materials were provided by the university to the school to facilitate instruction and, thereby, increase treatment fidelity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0741932510362514">
<title>Control</title>
<p>Students randomly assigned to the control condition participated in regular school practices. Specifically, they were placed in “focus” classes, which provided students an opportunity to work on homework and ask some questions. However, there was no formal instruction provided on any topic, with the major focus to provide students an opportunity to study and obtain some remediation and support if needed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0741932510362514">
<title>Intervention leaders</title>
<p>The PBS team recruited teachers for the SS and conflict groups based on expertise and interpersonal skills with students. Specifically, two teachers who had previous experience with the curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0741932510362514">Robertson &amp; Lane, 2007</xref>) were asked to teach the seventh- and eight-grade sections of the SS groups. School counselors who were members of the PBS team were asked to teach the seventh- and eighth-grade sections of the CRS curriculum given their expertise with the content and feedback from a previous secondary intervention at this school. Specifically, two of teachers who previously taught a combined intervention group addressing social skills and conflict resolution indicated that they did not feel comfortable or prepared to respond to the information students shared when teaching the CRS lessons. Thus, four new classes were taught daily: two SS classes and two CRS classes, with one section offered for each grade level. Teachers had 3 and 6 years of teaching experience and both were fully certificated for middle school. The counselors had 3 and 28 years of experience as school counselors.</p>
<p>Students randomly assigned to the control condition were placed into study halls according to scheduling convenience. The 17 students in this condition were in one of six study hall classes, all of which were conducted under the direction of fully certified teachers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0741932510362514">
<title>Training procedures</title>
<p>Teachers and counselors participated in a 2-hour training session with the first author (a master’s student in special education who also completed additional courses in applied behavior analytic training and had 4 years of experience as a project coordinator of federally funded grants) during the week prior to onset of the academic year. An overview was conducted to familiarize them with the three-ring binder containing lessons and instructional materials (e.g., transparencies), lesson format, implementation calendars, and treatment fidelity forms. Lessons included the following components: advanced organizer, assessing background knowledge, modeling, guided practice, independent practice, review, and closure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0741932510362514">
<title>Intervention dosage</title>
<p>Students in the SS and CRS groups participated in 31 lessons during the first quarter. The number of sessions was determined by the number of instructional days available during the first quarter. Each lesson was taught during a regularly scheduled 50-minute instructional period. Lessons were taught during the first 30 minutes of class, followed by a 20-minute period allotted for applied practice. The rationale behind the 20 minutes for applied practice was to allow students the opportunity to practice and/or apply immediately the content addressed in the previous 30-minute period. Too often, students are taught strategies but then not given an opportunity for applied practice. This deviates from the direct instruction paradigm, which has demonstrated success with students attempting to learn new skills. In sum, students receive 15.5 hours of explicit instruction in the respective intervention area.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0741932510362514">
<title>Treatment integrity procedures</title>
<p>Treatment integrity was assessed daily by the teachers and weekly by project staff using a 12-item behavioral checklist containing specific lesson components (i.e., completion of rationale, modeling, guided practice, independent practice, and review) and recommended teaching practices (i.e., verbal praise, routines, positive tone). Immediately after teaching a lesson, teachers rated each item on a 3-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 0 (<italic>not at all</italic>), 1 (<italic>part of the time</italic>), to 2 (<italic>all of the time</italic>). Session fidelity was computed by dividing the total number of points by 24 (total points possible) and multiplying the quantity by 100 to obtain a percentage. RAs completed the same treatment integrity checklist once per week. An overall intervention average was computed for each intervention condition from the teacher and RA perspectives.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0741932510362514">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>Measures included student outcome, social validity, and descriptive measures. Student outcome measures were administered to examine proximal and distal outcomes associated with intervention outcomes. Social validity measures were administered to teachers and students to examine perceptions regarding intervention goals, procedures, and outcomes. Descriptive measures were administered to determine reading ability and student participation in the intervention conditions. In addition, a measure of classroom atmosphere was administered to examine environmental variables across the intervention conditions. For each measure, RAs assessed reliability of scoring and data entry for 100% of the students.</p>
<sec id="section16-0741932510362514">
<title>Student outcomes</title>
<p>Student outcome measures included proximal and distal measures. Proximal measures included measures of knowledge of SS (KSS) and knowledge of CRS (KCRS). Knowledge was assessed via a criterion-referenced test, <italic>Study Skills and Conflict Resolution Skills</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0741932510362514">Lane, 2004</xref>) containing 50 multiple-choice items: 25 items measuring SS and 25 items measuring CRS. The KSS score referred to the percentage of student skills items answered correctly. The KCRS score referred to the percentage of CRS items answered correctly. The test was completed in one class period during pre-intervention (KSS-T1, KCRS-T1), postintervention (KSS-T2, KCRS-T2), and maintenance (KSS-T3, KCRS-T3) administrations. Tests were scored by RAs and accuracy verified by a second RA. Accuracy of data entry was also assessed for 100% of the tests, with greater than 90% accuracy for both time points.</p>
<p>Distal measures included the <italic>Study Habits Inventory</italic> (SHI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0741932510362514">Jones &amp; Slate, 1990</xref>), ConflictTalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0741932510362514">Kimsey &amp; Fuller, 2003</xref>), and the <italic>Social Skills Rating Scale</italic> (SSRS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0741932510362514">Gresham &amp; Elliott, 1990</xref>). These measures were administered to ascertain if students demonstrated changes in their study habits, conflict resolution styles, or problem behaviors. The SHI is a 58-item student-completed survey comprising true-false statements that are either inappropriate (<italic>n</italic> = 31) or appropriate (<italic>n</italic> = 27). Total scores range from 0 to 58, with high scores indicating more positive study habits. Validity studies suggest positive correlations between SHI scores and (a) course grades and (b) GPAs (alpha coefficient = .85) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0741932510362514">Jones &amp; Slate, 1990</xref>). There were no data entry errors for this measure.</p>
<p>ConflictTalk is an 18-item, factor analytically derived scale used to determine conflict management styles across the kindergarten through 12th grade span. Items are equally distributed across three conflict resolution styles: avoidance, adversarial, and collaborative, with the collaborative style rated the most favorably. Students rate each item on a 5-poing Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (<italic>never</italic>) to 5 (<italic>almost always</italic>). Alpha coefficients are .65, .87, and .81. Total scores on the collaborative scale were used (range 1 to 30), with high scores indicating more favorable CRS. There were no data entry errors.</p>
<p>The problem behavior standard score of the secondary version of the SSRS was also analyzed to monitor students’ behavioral progress. The Problem Behavior subscale of the SSRS contains 12 items equally distributed across two subscales: Internalizing and Externalizing. Teachers rate each item on 3-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (<italic>never</italic>), 2 (<italic>sometimes</italic>), to 3 (<italic>very often</italic>). The alpha coefficient for the problem behavior scale is .87 for males and .85 for females. There were no data entry errors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0741932510362514">
<title>Social validity</title>
<p>Teacher and student perspectives of social validity were assessed pre- and postintervention using the <italic>Intervention Rating Profile–15</italic> (IRP-15; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0741932510362514">Witt &amp; Elliott, 1985</xref>) and the <italic>Children’s Intervention Rating Profile</italic> (CIRP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0741932510362514">Witt &amp; Elliott, 1985</xref>). The IRP-15 is a factor analytically derived, teacher-completed instrument used to asses the social significance of the goals, social acceptability of the treatment procedures, and social importance of intervention outcomes. Teachers rate each of 15 items on a 6-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 6 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>). Total scores range from 15 to 90, with high scores suggesting high acceptability. Internal consistency reliabilities range from .88 to .98.</p>
<p>The CIRP measures students’ perceptions of social validity. Wording was modified slightly to better fit the intervention context as in other investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0741932510362514">Robertson &amp; Lane, 2007</xref>). The CIRP consists of 7 items rated by students on 6-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (<italic>I do not</italic> agree) to 6 (<italic>I agree</italic>). After reflecting negatively worded items, total scores range from 7 to 42, with high scores suggesting high acceptability. Internal consistency reliabilities range from .75 to .89. There were no data entry errors on either measure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0741932510362514">
<title>Descriptive</title>
<p>Descriptive measures were collected to assess level of reading ability, percentage of attendance to intervention lessons, and classroom atmosphere. The Reading subtest of the <italic>Metropolitan Achievement Test Eighth Edition–Short Form</italic> (MAT8; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741932510362514">Harcourt Educational Measurement, 2001</xref>), a group-administered achievement test, was administered by teachers (alpha coefficients = .80). Intervention attendance was monitored by computing the percentage of sessions attended for each student. The <italic>Classroom Atmosphere Rating Scale</italic> (CARS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0741932510362514">Wehby, Dodge, &amp; Greenberg, 1993</xref>) was completed in each classroom setting to obtain a measure of overall level of classroom disruptive behavior. The CARS is a 7-item questionnaire developed by Fast Track (Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group). Project staff completed four 30-minute observations in each classroom during which they rated student (compliance, consistency in following rules, cooperation, interest, and involvement) and the general classroom (level of focus and engagement, responsiveness to individual differences, and supportiveness of students’ efforts). Ratings range from 1 (e.g., <italic>students show high levels of compliance and on-task behavior; no instances of acting out / disruptive behavior</italic>) to 5 (<italic>students displaying high levels of arguing, loud speaking, horseplay, noncompliance, with instances of disruptive behavior exceeding seven; these behaviors clearly interfere with the ongoing activity of the group</italic>). Average scores were computed for each observation session and then across the four observation sessions, with low scores indicating more positive classroom atmosphere. Internal consistency is strong, with Cronbach’s alphas ranging from .94 to .95, and interrater reliability was adequate.</p>

<title>Experimental Design and Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Student outcome data were analyzed with a longitudinal random coefficients analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0741932510362514">Littell, Milliken, Stroup, &amp; Wolfinger, 2006</xref>) applied to three repeated measurements: pre-intervention, postintervention, and maintenance, the latter of which was collected 8 weeks following the intervention. This model, also known as “individual growth curves” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0741932510362514">Rogosa &amp; Saner, 1995</xref>), estimates a separate starting intercept for each child to control for the clustering of repeated measurements.

<p>In the statistical model, intervention condition (SS, CRS, or regular school practices) and student identification number served as class variables. Intervention group, time, and the Group × Time interaction were used to model the student performance for each outcome. The time coefficient is a slope estimate that measures linear change over time. The Group × Time interactions show whether SS and conflict resolution groups differed in their progress on each outcome as shown by their slopes of change over time. Significant Group × Time interactions show group differences in the magnitude and direction of growth over time. These differences in slope can be interpreted parsimoniously as an overrate of improvement or decline, and the longitudinal model with all three time points has greater statistical power than a complicated set of <italic>t</italic> tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741932510362514">Diggle, Heagerty, Liang, &amp; Zege, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Social validity, treatment integrity, and descriptive data were analyzed using descriptive procedures (e.g., means and standard deviations) as well as one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to detect group differences (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0741932510362514">Table 3</xref>). Effect sizes were also computed using the pooled standard deviation in the denominator [(M<sub>1</sub> – M<sub>2</sub>) / SD<sub>pooled</sub>] to determine the magnitude of differences between groups in their classroom atmosphere scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0741932510362514">Busk &amp; Serlin, 1992</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0741932510362514">Cohen (1988)</xref>, small, medium, and large effect sizes are 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8, respectively.</p>

<p>Treatment integrity data suggest high levels of implementation for the SS group from the teacher (<italic>M</italic> = 98.82, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.86) and RA (<italic>M</italic> = 92.11, <italic>SD</italic> = 9.63) perspectives. However, the CRS group’s ratings suggest lower levels of implementation from teacher (<italic>M</italic> = 73.72, <italic>SD</italic> = 25.16) and RA (<italic>M</italic> = 69.32, <italic>SD</italic> = 27.44) perspectives, with substantial variability across sessions as evidenced by the standard deviations.</p>

<title>Student Progress Over Time</title>
<p>The SS and CRS groups were compared with the control group on near transfer measures. Results revealed that the Intervention Group × Time was significant for only one near transfer measure, KSS, <italic>F</italic>(2, 87) = 3.66, <italic>p</italic> = 0.03, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0741932510362514">Figure 2</xref>, Panel A. Pre-intervention scores showed no difference among the three groups, <italic>F</italic>(2, 87) = 2.13, <italic>p</italic> = 0.12. The control group (■) showed no growth over time, <italic>t</italic>(87) = −0.30, <italic>p</italic> = 0.77, but the SS (●) and CRS (▼) groups showed significant positive growth over time. Compared to the control group, the SS group increased by 7.51 more points per time interval, <italic>t</italic>(87) = 2.48, <italic>p</italic> = 0.02, and the CRS group increased by 6.05 more points per interval, <italic>t</italic>(87) = 2.08, <italic>p</italic> = 0.04. A follow-up analysis compared the two intervention groups with each other. This analysis found no significant pre-intervention differences, <italic>F</italic>(1, 54) = 3.63, <italic>p</italic> = 0.06, and the approximately equal slopes of growth, <italic>F</italic>(1, 54) = 0.21, <italic>p</italic> = 0.65, in the two intervention groups. These results suggest that SS and conflict resolution intervention conditions led to growth that was absent from the controls and that the two interventions appear equally effective. The magnitude of the change between pre- and postintervention time points for the SS group was large (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 1.38) and medium (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.55) for the CRS group.</p>

<p>Next, we examined transfer measures, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0741932510362514">Figure 2</xref>, Panel B. Again, the SS and CRS groups were compared with the control group. Results indicated that the Intervention Group × Time interaction for SHI was also significant, <italic>F</italic>(2, 85) 3.37, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001. No group differences were observed during the pre-intervention time point (<italic>p</italic> = 0.48), suggesting that the groups had no significant differences in SHI scores prior to the intervention. The effect of time was not significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.23), suggesting that the control group scores remained about the same over time. The CRS group decreased more than controls but change in the SS group was not significantly different from that of the control group (<italic>p</italic> = 0.62). The CRS scores decreased 4.53 points more than the control group at each time point, <italic>t</italic>(85) = −2.03, <italic>p</italic> = 0.046. Subsequent comparisons between the SS and CRS groups indicated that SHI scores of the SS group increased 5.69 points at each time point, <italic>t</italic>(54) = 2.47, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0167, more than the CRS group. The effect size for the increase between pre- and postintervention time points for the SS group was small (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.20). By contrast, the conflict resolution group showed a decrease (<italic>d</italic> = −0.14), also a small effect.</p>

<sec id="section23-0741932510362514">
<title>Social Validity</title>
<p>Social validity data indicated that teachers conducting the SS group (<italic>M</italic> = 61.50, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.12) rated the intervention as far more socially valid at intervention onset relative to the counselors conducting the CRS group (<italic>M</italic> = 36.50, <italic>SD</italic> = 17.68). Furthermore, teachers conducting the SS groups rated the interventions as less socially valid than did teachers conducting the regular school practices (<italic>M</italic> = 72.83, <italic>SD</italic> = 8.49). This pattern was consistent following intervention completion as well (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0741932510362514">Table 3</xref>). Furthermore, social validity ratings decreased for teachers in the SS and CRS groups following intervention completion.</p>
<p>Student ratings revealed differing perceptions. One-way ANOVAs revealed no significant differences between groups in social validity at intervention onset, <italic>F</italic>(2, 34) = 3.15, <italic>p</italic> = 0.06. However, postintervention social validity scores revealed significant differences between groups, <italic>F</italic>(2, 40) = 8.71, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0007, with students in the CRS groups reporting significantly lower levels of social validity than students in the SS or control conditions.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As previously explained, this article was written to address methodological and theoretical objectives. Methodologically, we illustrate how to conduct and evaluate a secondary support program implemented at the middle school level as part of a three-tiered model of prevention, extending the initial work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0741932510362514">Robertson and Lane (2007)</xref>. Theoretically, we attempted the relation between academic underachievement and problem behaviors at the middle school level. In the sections that follow, we first address the theoretical issues followed by methodological considerations.</p>
<sec id="section26-0741932510362514">
<title>Theoretical Issue: The Relation Between Academic Under Achievement and Problem Behavior</title>
<p>For more than a decade, researchers have speculated on the relation between academic underachievement and problem behaviors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741932510362514">Hinshaw, 1992</xref>). Questions have been raised as to whether academic underachievement leads to problem behaviors and if problem behaviors lead to academic underachievement, the presence of a transactional relationship, or the possibility that the relation is influenced by other moderating variables (e.g., cognitive ability, hyperactivity).</p>
<p>Another consideration is that the nature of these constructs may vary across the developmental continuum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741932510362514">Bullis &amp; Walker, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0741932510362514">Robertson &amp; Lane, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0741932510362514">Robertson and Lane’s (2007)</xref> initial study addressed this relation at the middle school level. They focused on the middle school level as this is a time when (a) the consequences of limited academic, social, and behavioral skills become more severe; (b) competencies in SS become essential to manage an increasingly differentiated curriculum with assignments (e.g., term papers) that require self-determination skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0741932510362514">Eisenman &amp; Chamberlain, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0741932510362514">Wehmeyer, Field, Doren, Jones, &amp; Mason, 2004</xref>); and (c) competencies in CRS become essential to negotiate the multiple academic and social demands that come with entering adolescence. However, the Robertson and Lane study was limited in two key ways. First, in terms of intervention groups, there was an SS intervention and a combined intervention that addressed SS and CRS. There was not a control condition, nor was there an isolated intervention group for CRS. This meant that it was only possible to examine the added benefits of CRS instruction. Second, treatment integrity data were only collected using a teacher-completed checklist, which was not confirmed by an outside observer. Given that treatment integrity data collected using self-report techniques tend to be inflated, this was not the most conservative method of measuring the extent to which the intervention was implemented as planned.</p>
<p>The present study sought to extend this line of inquiry by conducting a similar study that addressed these two limitations. In this study, identified participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: SS, CRS, or regular school practices. This assignment would allow for the relative benefit of each intervention condition relative to the business-as-usual condition. Also, it would enable the two interventions to be compared. Additionally, treatment integrity was assessed from two perspectives using behavior rating scales: teacher self-report and RA observations.</p>
<sec id="section27-0741932510362514">
<title>Treatment integrity</title>
<p>Findings indicated that treatment fidelity was quite high for the SS groups according to teacher and RA perspectives, with mean fidelity scores exceeding 90%. In contrast, treatment fidelity scores were much lower for the CRS groups. Mean counselor ratings were 74%, and RA ratings were even lower at 69%; however, scores were quite variable. This suggests that there was substantial variability in the level of implementation. In conversations with the school counselors, they indicated that they felt equipped to teach CRS in small group and one-to-one settings. However, they also indicated that they lacked the classroom management skills to work more effectively in a whole group setting. Future studies may consider the possibility of exploring a team teaching or co-teaching option in which teachers and counselors work together to teach the class. It may be that the expertise of both sets of professionals will be necessary to teach CRS successfully within a small group context.</p>
<p>Social validity scores also indicate a struggle with respect to implementation and procedural issues. Namely, SS teachers’ mean social validity scores prior to intervention onset and following intervention completion were quite low, with respective mean scores of 62 and 52. The social validity scores for the CRS group were substantially lower prior to intervention onset (37) and following intervention completion (36).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-0741932510362514">
<title>Academic domain</title>
<p>Results indicated that all three groups were equivalent in terms of KSS and SS habits (SHI) at intervention onset. As expected, students in the control group (regular school practices) did not show significant improvement in KSS or SHI. However, students in both the SS and CRS groups did improve in their KSS scores. Despite these improvements, mean scores were still quite low, ranging below 80% accuracy on the proximal measure of SS knowledge.</p>
<p>Given that students showed only nominal improvement in terms of KSS, it is not surprising that students in the SS groups did not show statistically significant improvement in their SS habits relative to the control group. However, the comparison between the SS and CRS groups indicated that the SS groups’ study habits scores improved significantly relative to students in the CRS group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section29-0741932510362514">
<title>Behavioral domain</title>
<p>The Group × Time interaction was not significant on the proximal measure of KCRS. Furthermore, the Group × Time interactions were not significant for either of the distal measures: conflict resolution style (ConflictTalk) or problem behavior as measured by the SSRS. The absence of findings is not surprising given the low level of program implementation for the CRS groups.</p>
<p>In brief, findings are consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0741932510362514">Robertson and Lane (2007)</xref>, suggesting only nominal changes in students’ KSS, with limited transfer to SS habits. The modest improvements in SS were not associated with improvements in problem behaviors, providing limited additional information regarding the relation between academic underachievement and problem behavior at the middle school level. Yet the students’ social validity ratings suggest that the intervention met their respective expectations, with students’ ratings closely paralleling teachers’ expectations. From a practical standpoint, this may be indicative of the extent to which a teacher sets the tone in the classroom. Namely, if the teachers view the intervention as targeting significant goals, acceptable procedures, and important outcomes, it may be that students follow in suit.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of pragmatic success with respect to theoretical objectives, the strength of this study lies in the methodological contributions. In the sections that follow, we will illustrate how to (a) use school-wide data to identify students requiring secondary support and (b) conduct randomized trials within the context of three-tiered models of prevention.</p>

<title>Methodological Issues</title>
<sec id="section31-0741932510362514">
<title>A systematic approach to identifying nonresponsive students</title>
<p>Whereas the PBS team in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0741932510362514">Robertson and Lane (2007)</xref> study analyzed school-wide data to begin a secondary intervention in the Spring semester of the same academic year, the PBS team members in the present study wanted to begin the following academic year with a secondary intervention for returning students who were nonresponsive to primary prevention efforts. To this end, they analyzed the school-wide data at the end of the academic year to identify returning students (rising seventh and eighth graders) with academic and behavioral concerns at year-end. In conjunction with the project director, an academic concern was operationally defined as earning a fourth-quarter GPA ≤ 2.7 or earning one or more failing grades. A behavioral concern was operationally defined as scoring in the moderate- or high-risk range on the SRSS during the spring administration or earning ≥ office discipline referrals (ODR) during the final semester of the school year.</p>
<p>One of the main benefits of analyzing all school-wide data to identify potential students rather than relying solely on teacher nomination is that all students are considered for this extras support. Ultimately, this makes the chance of a false negative (excluding a student from this support when he or she actually should be included) less likely than if PBS teams relied solely on teacher judgment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0741932510362514">Lane, 2003</xref>). Also, we contend that systematic screening efforts such as these are more respectful of the multiple demands placed on teachers. More specifically, teachers have enormous responsibilities as they attempt to serve increasingly diverse student populations in inclusive settings. If we rely primarily on teacher judgment to assess behavioral risk, then it is quite possible that students with some behavior patterns (e.g., covert antisocial behaviors and internalizing behaviors) may be overlooked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0741932510362514">Lane, Little et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0741932510362514">Walker, Ramsey, &amp; Gresham, 2004</xref>). By implementing systematic screening tools as part of regular school practices eliminates this burden—and possibly any bias—in teacher nominations.</p>
<p>Another benefit of the this application of systematic screening to identify students with behavior and academic concerns is that the school began the year ready to support the initial 74 students (25 rising seventh graders, 49 rising eighth graders) identified at year-end. However, because of the practicalities associated with applied research (e.g., students moving, alternative placement, parents not willing to consent), the actual number of students supported was only 45. This substantial attrition poses threats to data analysis procedures. Namely, this lower sample size decreases the power to detect statistical significant differences that may exist between intervention conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0741932510362514">Kleinbaum, Kupper, Muller, &amp; Nizam, 1998</xref>). Yet despite this limitation, this study provides a methodologically successful illustration of a study implemented with many of the core quality indicators recommended for experimental research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741932510362514">Gersten et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section32-0741932510362514">
<title>Adherence to quality indictors</title>
<p>The primary intent of this article was to offer a methodological illustration of how to design, implement, and evaluate an RCT within the context of a three-tiered model of prevention. In this section, we will discuss the extent to which this illustration addressed the quality indicators for experimental investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741932510362514">Gersten et al., 2005</xref>). Specifically, we will review the following criteria: establishing the underlying conceptualization, describing participants, sample size, implementing interventions and describing comparison conditions, selecting outcome measures, and analyzing data as recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741932510362514">Gersten et al. (2005)</xref>.</p>
<p>First, the study was designed with a theoretical intent. The underlying conceptualization focused on addressing research questions designed to provide an empirical test of the hypothetical models regarding the relation between academic underachievement and problem behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741932510362514">Hinshaw, 1992</xref>). Rather than focusing on the elementary grades—which has been the focus of most research in this area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0741932510362514">Lane, 2004</xref>)—this study was conducted at the middle school. This is an important extension of the literature, as the nature and direction of these hypothetical causal models may shift at different developmental periods across the K-12 continuum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741932510362514">Bullis &amp; Walker, 1994</xref>). In addition, the hypothetical causal models were examined within the context of a three-tiered model of prevention, building upon the limitations of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0741932510362514">Robertson and Lane (2007)</xref> study.</p>
<p>Second, in this study, participants were described with replicable precision. Participant selection criteria were explicit, as denoted above. Furthermore, data were analyzed to determine that random assignment to three conditions “worked” in the sense that the three groups were comparable on the five key variables of interest, which included proximal (KSS and KCRS) and distal (study habits, conflict resolution style, and problem behaviors). Furthermore, the characteristics of interventionists were explained (e.g., fully certified teachers) to ensure equality of instructors across conditions.</p>
<p>Third, although students were randomly assigned to one of two groups (either an intervention group or a comparison condition), the number of participants in each condition fell short of the recommended number. Specifically, the U.S. Department of Education indicates that groups should contain no less than 150 participants. Clearly, the number of participants in the current study is well below this standard. We encourage other researchers and practitioners to further this line of inquiry by increasing the number of participants per condition.</p>
<p>Fourth, detailed information was provided describing the intervention and comparison conditions. In addition to describing the specific content of the intervention conditions (SS and CRS groups) and the comparison (business-as-usual condition—in essence a placebo group rather than a waitlist-control group), a measure of classroom atmosphere (the CARS) was administered to detect any potential differences in these respective environments. Results of the CARS data indicated that class classroom atmosphere was more positive in the SS and control conditions (which were comparable) relative to the CRS group. Had the sample size been larger, it would have been possible to conduct additional analyses to determine the relative predictive power of classroom atmosphere in mediating intervention outcomes. In addition, treatment integrity data and social validity data were collected from multiple perspectives. Whereas the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0741932510362514">Robertson and Lane (2007)</xref> study reported only self-report data, in the present study treatment integrity was also reported from an outside perspective. As with the classroom atmosphere data, had the sample size been sufficient, it would have been interesting to determine the extent to which treatment integrity and social validity ratings (which were markedly different between intervention groups) mediated intervention outcomes.</p>
<p>Fifth, as with the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0741932510362514">Robertson and Lane (2007)</xref> study, this study included proximal and distal measures with established reliability and validity. We encourage other studies to examine distal measures monitored as part of regular school practices. For example, it would be feasible and meaningful to see if these interventions yielded changes in terms of GPA, course failure, risk status, and ODRs. However, given that these were the measures used to identify students who were not responsive (known as “cut” variables), it would not be methodological sound to use these as outcome measures. Furthermore, given the limited changes in near transfer (proximal) measures, changes in these measures would have been unlikely.</p>
<p>Another issue related to measurement is the possibility of regression to the mean as a possible source of error. This is an issue that can—and should—be addressed to improve the research on secondary level prevention programs. Specifically, in this study, rating scales (e.g., SSRS) as well as other measures were administered before and following the intervention. Another option is to not just administer the instruments on a pre- and posttest basis because of regression to the mean. Instead, behavior rating scales could be administered a week before the actual “pre-test” administration. In other words, one approach to address regression to the mean is to have two pre-test administrations approximately a week apart and then use the second one as the actually pre-test score to reduce the likelihood that improvements were due to regression to the mean rather than the treatment. In this study, we elected not to conduct two pre-tests because of issues of social validity. Namely, we were concerned that doing so might increase the likelihood of attrition in an already small sample. We hope other researchers and practitioners will be more willing and able to meet this higher standard to control for regression effects—either using this proposed technique or even a Solomon four-square design.</p>
<p>In terms of experimental design and statistical analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741932510362514">Gersten et al. (2005)</xref> recommended that appropriate data analysis techniques be employed and linked to research questions and corresponding hypotheses. They also recommended that variability in the sample be accounted for by sampling and/or statistical techniques and that a power analysis be computed to ascertain the minimum cell sizes. Although the design of this study represents a marked improvement from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0741932510362514">Robertson and Lane (2007)</xref> study, with the addition of a comparison group, the hypothetical models cannot be completely examined empirically unless there is a czombined condition. We recommend that future studies include two additional interventions: SS and CRS (full dosage of each) combined as well as SS and CRS (partial dosage of each), with the later condition intended to control for the effects of time and attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0741932510362514">Kleinbaum, Kupper, Muller, &amp; Nizam, 1998</xref>). Also, we recommend developing this line of inquiry by employing more sophistical models to examine the extent to which mediating (e.g., classroom atmosphere, treatment integrity, and social validity) variables influence intervention outcomes. Had all students meeting the participant inclusion criteria consented and returned to the same school the following year, we would have had sufficient power to conduct the originally intended analyses. However, the attrition over the summer severely limited the sample size and consequently the data analysis plans.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>Although the theoretical objectives fell short because of issues of attrition, low treatment fidelity, and limited statistical inquiry, we contend that it met the intended methodological objectives. Namely, this article offers a scientifically rigorous illustration on how to conduct and evaluate a secondary support implemented at the middle school level as part of a three-tiered model of prevention, extending the initial work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0741932510362514">Robertson and Lane (2007)</xref>. We hope that other research teams in conjunction with practitioners will continue to use the quality indicators as a guide for improvement of the scientific rigor of PBSs—particularly for secondary-level prevention efforts, implemented as part of three-tiered models of prevention. To this end, we hope to generate a defined set of evidence-based practices that can be implemented to support students who are not responsive to primary prevention efforts but who do not yet require resource-intensive tertiary supports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0741932510362514">Lane, 2007</xref>).</p>
