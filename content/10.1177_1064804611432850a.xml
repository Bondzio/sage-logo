<p>This book addresses both the safety and legal issues of ladder use. Although its prime audience is legal professionals, it is an excellent resource for any ladder user.</p>
<p>The authors have taken a scientific approach in dealing with the safety issues of ladders, with up-to-date references for readers who appreciate an evidence-based approach. Coverage includes different types of ladders, task suitability (based on ANSI standards), typical ladder designs, mode of use (in particular, at the workplace, adhering to OSHA standards), ladder inspection and maintenance, typical safety features, and incidences of ladder-related accidents and injuries. Figures show incorrect ladder use, followed by the corresponding and preferred safe ladder use. The “Human Factors and Ergonomics” chapter, though brief, has sufficient information for the inquisitive professional who wants to further investigate key issues – for example, the design issues related to the safety aspects of the ladder.</p>
<p>The legal aspects are described for attorneys who are interested in handling ladder-related disputes, with examples of legal cases involving ladder accidents and the resulting injuries. The authors highlight the importance of approaching a typical ladder-related dispute by using a fault tree analysis, such as identifying the design, any manufacturing defects, testing procedures of the ladder manufacturer, and possible ladder misuse on the plaintiff’s part. A worksite visit to the actual accident scene is stressed as well.</p>
<p>The book emphasizes the importance of understanding the forensics of an accident reconstruction with the possible help of an industrial designer or a mechanical engineer and understanding the statute of limitations. This section also discusses trial strategies with specific legal case information and decisions pertaining to various jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The appendices are an excellent source of information. There are quick and easy checklists to obtain accident or injury-related information of ladder users, ladders, and the accident environment and a guide to OSHA rules and Code of Federal Regulations pertaining to ladders. Interestingly, the authors failed to use gender-neutral pronouns in some chapters.</p>
<p>In summary, this book is legal-centric, but the authors’ approach in presenting scenarios of different ladder-related issues is valuable for any reader, including forensics human factors professionals.</p>
