<abstract>
<p>Blown films of high-density polyethylene (HDPE)/fumed silica (FS) composites were prepared by melt-mixing in twin-screw extruder. Maleic anhydride grafted polyethylene (PE-g-MA) was introduced to improve the state of filler dispersion during melt processing. The blown films were tested for thermal, mechanical, morphological, barrier, and optical properties. The Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy-Attenuated Total Reflectance (FTIR-ATR) study indicated that interaction between FS and HDPE was slightly enhanced by PE-g-MA. No change in percent crystallinity was observed but mechanical properties improved after modification. Morphological analyses showed large FS clusters at higher loading which decreased after modification. Both oxygen and water vapor transmission rates of the films increased in composites as compared to HDPE, plausibly due to formation of nanogaps in blown film and/or increased solubility of penetrant molecules at filler–matrix interface.</p>

<sec id="sec1-8756087911432971" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Polyethylene (PE)-based light-weight, rigid and flexible packaging materials have revolutionized the food packaging industry as they increase the shelf life of foods, decrease spoilage, and also reduce the transportation costs as compared to other traditional materials. The vast majority of packaged foods require a barrier to gases, flavors/odors to maintain product quality and consumer appeal. The PE film manufacturers have been aggressive in reducing the production cost without sacrificing its thermomechanical and other enabling properties so that they can be more competitive in the global market.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8756087911432971">1</xref></sup> The high-density polyethylene (HDPE) films are used in many packaging applications where strength and dimensional stability are the key attributes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-8756087911432971">2</xref></sup> It is comparatively stiffer than other low-density and linear low-density PE films, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), and thus can maintain their shapes and mechanical performances even at lower thicknesses and can provide cost advantages.</p>
<p>The mechanical properties of the HDPE films are a strong function of its morphology, which in turn, is controlled by a combination of the process variables and the molecular characteristics of the resin. In blown film, a planar biaxial orientation promotes changes in the mechanical properties along the machine direction (MD) as well as the transverse direction (TD), relative to an isotropic sample.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-8756087911432971">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-8756087911432971">3</xref></sup> To further improve the thermomechanical properties of HDPE films; controlled amount of different nanofillers like nanoclay, fumed silica (FS), and more, are added as reinforcing agent without sacrificing much on their optical properties. When these materials are processed during film blowing operation, better end-use properties are expected, besides the improvement in the ability to withstand the tensions during blowing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-8756087911432971">4</xref></sup> A lot of research work has been published in the past on the structure–property relationship of HDPE-nanoclay-based composites and blown films<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-8756087911432971">4</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-8756087911432971">7</xref></sup> and LDPE/LLDPE-silica-based blown films<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-8756087911432971">8</xref></sup> but except for few,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-8756087911432971">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-8756087911432971">10</xref></sup> literatures on HDPE-FS-based composites and blown films are limited.</p>
<p>The FS is a unique material because of its unusual surface characteristics. Due to their small size and high specific surface area, they are prone to self-aggregation and can consequently form a network of connected or interacting particles in the polymer matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-8756087911432971">11</xref></sup> The FS particles are hydrophilic due to the presence of surface silanol groups, which generally results in poor interaction with the nonpolar HDPE and nonuniform dispersion of FS within matrix. To achieve better dispersion of FS and to enhance interaction with HDPE, interface modification is generally done using maleated PE. In the present study, the HDPE–FS composites were prepared by melt-mixing using maleic anhydride grafted polyethylene (PE-g-MA) and their blown films were investigated for thermal, mechanical, optical, and barrier properties. Attempt has also been made to understand the role of PE-g-MA on morphological behavior of the composites to elucidate the structure–property relationship of the HDPE–FS films.</p>

Mixing operation was carried out in a Krupp Werner &amp; Pfleiderer Twin Screw Co-rotating Intermeshing extruder of diameter 25 mm and L/D ratio 25. The screw speed was maintained at 300 rpm and temperature of the barrel was varied from 160 to 220°C. In the compositions, FS was varied from 1 to 5 wt%, whereas the level of PE-g-MA was maintained at 5 wt%. In a typical nomenclature, ‘H’ stands for HDPE, ‘F’ stands for FS, and ‘M’ stands for PE-g-MA. Thus, for example, ‘HMF1’ indicates a composition of HDPE and 1 wt% FS with 5 wt% PE-g-MA.

<p>After compounding, blown films of HDPE–FS composites were prepared in Haake Blown Film Processing Unit using compounded pellets. The schematic of film blowing setup is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-8756087911432971">Figure 1</xref>.

<p>The specifications of the single-screw extruder of blown film unit were: L/D 20, compression ratio 3:1, die diameter 2.4 cm, die gap 1 mm. The temperature was kept at 230°C, screw speed was 25 rpm, and nip roller speed was 700 cm/min. The lay flat width (LFW) and blow-up ratio (BUR) were kept constant at 9.5 cm and 2.5, respectively. The average thickness and standard deviation (thickness variation) of the blown films are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-8756087911432971">Figure 2</xref>. It was observed that overall thickness variation was higher in presence of silica particles as compared to neat HDPE film and average film thickness decreased in presence of PE-g-MA as compared to their unmodified counterparts.

<p>The FTIR-ATR spectra of the FS powder, PE-g-MA pellets, and blown films of the composites were recorded in Perkin Elmer – GX Spectrum using Diamond Crystal Background. The resolution for each spectrum was 2 per cm and the wave number range considered was 500–4000 per cm. The spectra presented were baseline corrected and reported in the transmittance mode.</p>

<p>Perkin Elmer Diamond differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) scans were performed with small cut pieces of the pristine HDPE film and other blown films. DSC analysis of injection-molded samples of same compositions was also performed for comparison purposes. The samples were heated from 25 to 200°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min and held for 2 min to erase previous thermal history followed by a cooling cycle from 200–25°C at a cooling rate of 10°C/min.

From the cooling cycle and second heating cycle crystallization temperature (<italic>T<sub>c</sub></italic>), melting temperature (<italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic>), and enthalpy of melting (Δ<italic>H<sub>m</sub></italic>) were obtained. Theoretical melting enthalpy of 100% crystalline HDPE was considered as 293 J/g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-8756087911432971">12</xref></sup></p>

<p>Tensile testing of the HDPE–FS films was performed in accordance with ‘ASTM D882-95a’ standard using an Instron series IX (model 3365) instrument with pneumatic jaw to ensure proper clamping of the films. The samples were tested at a crosshead speed of 50 mm/min and gauge length of 50 mm under a load of 1 kN. Five samples of each composition were tested and average values are reported. Tests were conducted in both MD and TD of the blown films.</p>
<p>Trouser tear resistance (N/mm) is defined as average force required for propagating a tear (cut) at a constant tearing speed across a specimen divided by the specimen thickness. An internal organizational standard was followed to conduct the test in both machine and TD to compare the effect of filler and modification on the tear properties of the blown films. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-8756087911432971">Figure 3</xref> represents the dimension of the film samples for trouser tear test.

<p>Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on the films having 5 wt% of FS with and without PE-g-MA in FEI QUANTA 400 ESEM instrument in bright field, backscatter mode under accelerating voltage of 20 kV. The TEM of the composites was done in TECNAI G10 instrument in bright field, transmitted mode at different magnifications. Sample for TEM was prepared by microtoming 100 nm thin sections from the impact bars using a microtome and a diamond knife at room temperature.</p>

<p>The oxygen transmission rate (OTR) of the HDPE–FS films was tested in MOCON OX-TRAN2/21 instrument according to ‘ASTM D3985-05’ at 23°C and 50% relative humidity, using 4.2% oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) as test gas. The test area was taken as 5 cm<sup>2</sup> and the results were expressed in cc-mm/m<sup>2</sup> day after compensating for 100% O<sub>2</sub> as test gas. Water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) measurements were carried out in MOCON WVTR MG 3/33 instrument according to ‘ASTM F1249-06’ at 37°C and 100% relative humidity.

<p>The measurement of transmittance and haze of the films were performed in a UV/vis spectrophotometer BYK Gardner Haze-Gard Plus following the ‘ASTM D1003’ in visible spectrum by placing the sample in front of the beam. It is to be noted that the transmittance is considered as the percentage of incident light that is able to pass through a material, whereas haze is the percentage of transmitted light that is scattered more than 2.5° from the direction of the incident beam, and hence they are not additive properties.

<p>The finely ground silica particles show an intense peak around 1050 cm<sup>-1</sup> attributed to the streching vibration of Si–O bond and a peak between 3400 and 3800 cm<sup>-1</sup> attributed to the surface hydroxyl groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-8756087911432971">13</xref></sup> The most characteristic peak of PE-g-MA is the peak between 1700 and 1800 cm<sup>-1</sup> corresponding to the C = O bond of anhydride groups. The FTIR spectrum of neat FS used in the experiment showed one strong peak at 1053 cm<sup>-1</sup>, typical for asymmetric streching of Si–O bond and a peak at 3738 cm<sup>-1</sup> due to hydroxyl groups. The Si–O peak in the composite HF5 shifted to 1106 cm<sup>-1</sup>, which indicates that FS agglomerates were broken due to shearing during melt processing and lesser H-bonding is present in the system as compared to neat FS. In maleated composite HMF5, containing 5 wt% PE-g-MA, the anhydride peaks of the copolymer were not recorded, maybe due to very small amount present in the composition (0.05 wt% of MA groups). The Si–O peak was further found to shift slightly to 1110 cm<sup>-1</sup>, as a manifestation of a plausible interaction between MA groups of PE-g-MA and the surface hydroxyl groups of FS, again leading to reduced H-bonding in the composite.</p>

<p>The DSC data of the HDPE–FS films are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-8756087911432971">Table 3</xref>. Thermal properties of injection-molded bars are also presented in the same table for comparison purposes. Though no appreciable changes were observed in the melting and crystallization temperatures of the composites for both films and bars, the overall percent crystallinity was significantly reduced in case of film samples as compared to injection-molded samples. As blown films were quenced at the frost-line (refer <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-8756087911432971">Figure 1</xref>) immediately after film blowing, the crystallites did not get sufficient time to grow resulting in lower percent crystallinity. But in case of injection-molded samples, relatively slow cooling allowed the crystals to grow, and hence percent crystallinity was relatively high. It can also be seen that the percent crystallinity of all the films as well as all the bars were almost comparable with each other. This implies that filler addition and as well as in-situ interface modification did not induce any kind of nucleating effect in the system and has very little effect on crystallinity.

<fig id="fig5-8756087911432971" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Tensile strength of the high-density polyethylene (HDPE)–fumed silica (FS) blown films in both machine direction (MD) and transverse direction (TD).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_8756087911432971-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-8756087911432971">Figure 5</xref>, it could be seen that tensile strength is higher in MD than in TD for all the films, probably due to preferential lamellar orientation of polymer chains in MD during film blowing operation. On addition of PE-g-MA, the tensile strength of the films enhanced considerably in both MD and TD as compared to their unmodified counterparts, with a maximum increase of ∼110% for HMF1 composition in MD. The influence of PE-g-MA in the interface modification possibly resulted in effective load transfer from filler to matrix during tensile deformation. The composition with 3% FS content resulted in &gt;20% increase in tensile properties in both MD as well as in TD as compared to either no FS or 1% FS compositions. But, an increase of FS content from 3 to 5% is associated with a drop in the tensile strength, which can be attributed to the formation of agglomerates at higher concentrations of fillers which probably acted as the defect points.</p>
<p>Elongation at break (EB%) of the film samples in both MD and TD are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-8756087911432971">Figure 6</xref>. The EB% remained almost same in TD for all the films, however, for unmodified compositions, the EB% was decresed in MD as compared to neat HDPE at 3% and 5% FS loading. The FS particles are known for their lubricating effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-8756087911432971">14</xref></sup> and if they are well-distributed within polymer matrix, the polymer chains could easily slip-past over them during extension, resulting in high EB%. In case of unmodified compositions, the FS particles are well distributed within polymer matrix at lower loading (to be discussed in detail in Morphology section), and hence higher EB% was observed for HF1. At higher FS loading, the particles tend to form agglomerates which restricted the polymer chain mobility and oriention during stretching and also acted as defect points, thus a decrease in EB% was observed for HF3 and HF5. When modified with PE-g-MA, the EB% increased for all the compositions due to smaller agglomerate size (refer to Morphology section) and better dispersion of FS within polymer matrix as compared to their unmodified counterparts.

<p>Another indication for significant increase in EB% of the blown films in MD was high stretchability during extension. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-8756087911432971">Figure 7</xref> depicts the representative stress–strain plots of pristine HDPE, unmodified and modified blown films with 1 wt% FS loading. The plots clearly revealed increased stretchability in HF1 as compared to HDPE, which further increased significantly in HMF1 possibly due to improved interfacial interactions in the presence of PE-g-MA, resulting in high EB% value for the HDPE–FS films.

<p>Trouser tear resistance of the HDPE–FS films in both MD and TD are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-8756087911432971">Figure 8</xref>.
<fig id="fig8-8756087911432971" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Trouser tear resistance of high-density polyethylene (HDPE)–fumed silica (FS) films in both machine direction (MD) and transverse direction (TD).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_8756087911432971-fig8.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>It could be seen from the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-8756087911432971">Figure 8</xref> that except for HF1 in TD, the tear reistances of all the films are either at par or lower than that of pristine HDPE film in both MD and TD. Also, in contrary to the trends of tensile properties, the tear resistances of the films were either higher or almost comparable in TD than in MD. The preferential lamellar orientation of the polymer chains plausibly resulted in higher tear resistance in TD than in MD, which is opposite to the observations made for tensile strength. The correlation between structural parameters with mechanical properties of PE blown films have also been reported by Lafleur et al. earlier.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-8756087911432971">15</xref></sup> When unmodified, the tear resistance decreased more with increased loading of FS, but on modification, improvement in tear was observed in TD. Thus, it could be concluded that PE-g-MA was able to modify the HDPE and FS interphase, which in turn improved the overall film mechanical properties.</p>

<sec id="sec16-8756087911432971"><title>Morphological properties</title>
<p>The representative SEM micrographs of the HDPE–FS films with 5 wt% FS loading before and after modification are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-8756087911432971">Figure 9</xref>. From the micrographs, it could be observed that after reactive compatibilization with PE-g-MA, size of the FS agglomerates reduced considerably and filler dispersion was comparatively better as a manifestation of plausible interaction between PE-g-MA and FS. Improved mechanical properties of the films as discussed in the section <italic>Mechanical properties</italic> also supported this notion.

<p>As the films were very thin (∼0.02 mm), it was difficult to obtain proper TEM images of the films at higher magnification even after several trials. Thus, to have a representative view on dispersion of FS particles in HDPE matrix, TEM was performed on injection-molded samples at ×97 k magnifications. The TEM micrographs of HDPE composites with 1 wt%, 3 wt%, and 5 wt% FS loading are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-8756087911432971">Figure 10</xref>(a), (b), and (c), respectively, which showed the presence of larger aggregates at higher filler content.

<p>On addition of PE-g-MA, reduction in average agglomerate size was observed in 1 wt%, 3 wt%, and 5 wt% FS loading as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-8756087911432971">Figure 11</xref>(a), (b), and (c), respectively. Especially for higher FS contents, the number of large aggregates decreased, and instead, more aggregates were created with moderate or small sizes. Thus, from the TEM micrographs, it was evident that some interfacial interaction might have taken place between PE-g-MA and hydrophilic FS. This observation has been cited in one of our earlier communications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-8756087911432971">16</xref></sup> as well. Effect of similar noncovalent filler–matrix interactions for finer filler dispersions in other nanocomposites are also repoted in some recent literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-8756087911432971">17</xref></sup> The filler dispersion is expected to be comparatively better in blown films as compared to the injection-molded samples due to de-agglomeration of FS during film blowing operation.

<sec id="sec17-8756087911432971"><title>Barrier properties</title>
<p>The permeation (P) of a gaseous species through a pure polymer matrix is controlled by two main parameters: the diffusion coefficient (D); a kinetic factor, strongly linked to the molecular size of the species which permeates through the polymer and the solubility coefficient (S); a thermodynamic factor, a measure of the mutual affinity between permeant molecule and polymer matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-8756087911432971">18</xref></sup> Permeability defined as volumetric flow rate of particular molecules (O<sub>2</sub> and water vapor in this case) through a defined film area under a fixed pressure difference and normalized on film thickness, measures the intrinsic value of the permeation rate of that molecule through a specific material.</p>
<p>The OTR and WVTR of the HDPE–FS composite blown films for both modified and unmodified compositions are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-8756087911432971">Figure 12</xref>(a) and (b), respectively, as a function of FS loading. It could be observed from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-8756087911432971">Figure 12</xref>(a) that OTR of the HF films increased consistently with FS loading but after in-situ modification (i.e., for HMF films), it remained almost similar to that of HDPE upto 3 wt% FS and then increased for 5 wt% FS loading. Thus, PE-g-MA showed some significant effect in controlling OTR of the films due to improved interfacial interactions. The WVTR of the films, on the other hand, remained unchanged upto 1 wt% FS content. The WVTR increased sharply at 3 wt% FS loading and then remained virtually unchanged. For films modified with PE-g-MA, the WVTR increased steadily upto 3 wt% FS and then leveled off.

<p>As discussed earlier, the permeation could be increased either due to increase in diffusion coefficient which makes the passage of O<sub>2</sub> and water vapor molecules easy through the film or due to increased solubility coefficient as a result of higher affinity of penetrant molecules toward polymer films. Appparently, one would postulate for increased diffusion coefficient as the outcome of increased amorphous content in the studied composites which might help in easy passage of O<sub>2</sub> and water vapors through the films. But, DSC studies showed no significant changes in percent crystallinity (refer <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-8756087911432971">Table 3</xref>) upon addition of FS to support this observation. However, the hydrophilic FS particles when dispersed in polymers plausibly increased the solubility of penetrant gas molecules (O<sub>2</sub> and water vapor) at the filler–matrix interface due to intermolecular interactions, which might be the reason for increased permeation through the films. Similar observations are also repoted earlier by Hu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-8756087911432971">19</xref></sup> for permeations of different gases through poly(amide-imide)/titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) membrane.</p>
<p>Another probable reason for increase of transmission rates could be the transfer of O<sub>2</sub> and water vapor molecules through gaps between filler agglomerates as is schematically represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-8756087911432971">Figure 13</xref>. Though FS particles are nonporous and do not permeate gas molecules by themselves, but being spherical in shape, they attain specific packing inefficiency in their aggregate form.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-8756087911432971">20</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-8756087911432971">22</xref></sup> These gaps might act as a passage for both O<sub>2</sub> and water vapour molecules. As discussed earlier, TEM analysis (refer <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-8756087911432971">Figure 10</xref>) revealed the increased agglomerate size in case of higher FS loading, which plausibly increased the total number as well as volume of interparticle gaps between fillers, resulting in increase of both OTR and WVTR. An 130% increase of OTR and 68% increase of WVTR was observed for HF5 as compared to pristine HDPE. After improved interactions using PE-g-MA, the size of FS agglomerates reduced considerably (refer <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-8756087911432971">Figure 11</xref>) leading to less available passage, and hence OTR did not increase upto 3 wt% FS content. At higher FS loading, 65% increase in the OTR value was observed as compared to that of pristine HDPE.
<fig id="fig13-8756087911432971" position="float"><label>Figure 13.</label><caption><p>Gaps between spherical fumed silica (FS) fillers in agglomerates.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_8756087911432971-fig13.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The incorporation of polar groups like maleic anhydride in PE-g-MA compatibilizer and the presence of surface hydroxyl groups of the FS particles might have increased the solubility of water vapour in films, which in turn increased the WVTR of the HDPE–FS films. Thus, even if the rate of increase of OTR was reduced considerably after in-situ modification, the same trend was not observed for WVTR.</p>
<p>Another mechanism behind the increased OTR and WVTR could be the formation of nanogaps at the interface of nanosized FS particles and polymer matrix due to physical debonding caused during film blowing/stretching operation, as could be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-8756087911432971">Figure 14</xref>. Those nanogaps might result in interconnected nanoporous structure film and acted as a pathway for the penetrant molecules to pass through.
<fig id="fig14-8756087911432971" position="float"><label>Figure 14.</label><caption><p>Nanogaps formed due to film blowing operation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_8756087911432971-fig14.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Similar finding was also reported for calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>)-filled polyolefin blown films,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-8756087911432971">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-8756087911432971">24</xref></sup> which can allow the transmission of gases (i.e., breathability) while retaining a liquid barrier properties, and hence is used as breathable films. Though TEM images of the blown films are not available to support this postulate, this theory of nanogap is worth considering from the perspective of some other reported studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-8756087911432971">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-8756087911432971">26</xref></sup></p>

<p>The transmittance and haze of the blown films are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-8756087911432971">Figure 15</xref>. The figure revealed that the transmittance of all the films are ∼95% and it remained unaffected both upon filler addition as well as after interface modification, possibly due to the micron level thickness of the blown films through which light can be easily transmitted without any disruption. Haze, on the other hand, is dependant on both filler and PE-g-MA, as it depends on the scattering of the light beam from film surface. The haze of pristine HDPE film was 60% which might be due to its high crystallinity but upon addition of FS, the haze value increased. This might be attributed to the scattering of the light beam by the silica agglomerates present on the film surface as is evident from the SEM images (refer <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-8756087911432971">Figure 8</xref>). As the film thickness was very low, the light scattered by surface FS, and hence the corresponding haze% as a function of filler content was not evident and after 1% loading, a plateau was observed. The addition of PE-g-MA resulted in considerable drop of haze% as compared to their unmodified counterparts, and in this case, also a plateau-like trend was observed after 1% FS loading. As was evident from the TEM images (refer <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-8756087911432971">Figure 11</xref>), the interface modification with PE-g-MA leads to decrease in FS agglomerate size, thus reduced light scattering from fillers, and hence haze% dropped in case of modified composites as compared to those of unmodified samples.

<p>The present study discussed the thermal, mechanical, and film barrier properties of melt-compounded HDPE–FS composites before and after reactive compatibilization in the presence of PE-g-MA. Surface characterization performed by FTIR-ATR spectroscopy showed the plausible interaction between PE-g-MA and FS in the composites. The DSC studies did not reveal any appreciable changes in percent crystallinity in the blown films, indicating that FS did not act as nucleating agent. Mechanical properties showed that both tensile strength and EB% are higher in MD than in TD for all the films, whereas opposite trends were observed for trouser tear resistance. Though addition of more FS leads to decrease in film mechanical properties, the improved interfacial interaction due to the presence of PE-g-MA helped in considerable increase in mechanical properties of the composite blown films. The SEM and TEM images revealed the presence of FS aggregates homogeneously dispersed in the matrix, the size of which decreased considerably as a result of enhanced interfacial interactions. Both OTR and WVTR of the films increased with filler loading, as well as after in-situ interface modification using PE-g-MA. This is plausibly due to formation of nanogaps within FS particles and between HDPE and FS due to physical debonding caused during film blowing/stretching and/or due to increased solubility of gases at the filler–matrix interface induced by surface silanol groups of FS and PE-g-MA. Transmittance of the films remained same for all compositions, but haze reduced in presence of PE-g-MA as compared to their unmodified counterparts.</p>
