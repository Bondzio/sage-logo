<sec id="sec1-0265691412451813s"><title>Gabriel Piterberg, Teofilo F. Ruiz and Geoffrey Symcox, eds,<italic> Braudel Revisited: the Mediterranean World, 1600–1800</italic>, University of Toronto Press: Toronto, 2010; vi + 281 pp., 8 illus.; 9781442641334, $65.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>It has now become a trope to start any text on Braudel’s work and influence (including reviews of works inspired by his oeuvre) with a statement about its towering importance in twentieth-century scholarship, and indeed this review is no exception to this rule. This volume is a selection from the papers originally presented in a series of conferences organized under the auspices of the UCLA Center for Seventeenth and Eighteenth Century Studies to evaluate and assess the impact of Braudel’s work in light of its influence on the scholarship that followed it and its subsequent methodological shifts. It is a fitting testament to Braudel’s breadth and width of interests that a collection of such diverse studies could all fit under a single title.</p>
<p>The contributions engage with what happened ‘after Braudel’ both chronologically, dealing mostly with the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries which were beyond the scope of his analysis, and conceptually by engaging with topics which were marginal in Braudel’s work. As in all similar endeavours some essays are more convincing than others in their analysis, but, taken together, these contributions are clear evidence of the longstanding influence of Braudel’s approach and methodological innovation over many subfields of historical research (social, economic, political, cultural, literary and musical).</p>
<p>The book is divided into two sections ‘Thinking with Braudel’ and ‘Thinking Beyond Braudel’, this distinction is not always clearly followed in the essays and some common interpretative threads run throughout them. One of those is the attempt at tracing the intellectual genealogy of Braudel’s – we might call it his <italic>terroir</italic> – which is the focus of Lucette Valensi’s essay, but is also very evident in those of Geoffrey Symcox, James Amelang and Ş evket Pamuk. The latter’s contribution is probably the most successful in fulfilling the book’s ambitions, as Pamuk displays his usual sharp and sophisticated analytical skills in testing if and how Braudel’s analysis of the early modern Mediterranean economy has withstood the test of time.</p>
<p><italic>La Méditerranée</italic> is frequently criticized for its lack of a deeper engagement with the Ottoman world, Pamuk concludes his essay by rightly underlining instead the importance of Braudel’s work in integrating ‘the historians of the Ottoman Empire, and more generally the historians of the eastern and southern Mediterranean, to the international scholarly community’. Apart from Pamuk’s, two other essays engage directly with the Ottoman Empire: Jane Hathaway provides some evocative considerations on ‘bilateral factionalism’, although the Mediterranean specificity of this phenomenon is not really clearly elucidated in her essay, and Leslie Peirce introduces the concept of ‘polyglottism’ – ‘languages encompassing not only tongues but also the cultural idioms of groups’ – to convincingly argue for the resilience and flexibility of the Ottoman Empire across the centuries.</p>
<p>Another frequent criticism of Braudel’s work is his supposed neglect of the ‘cultural’ dimension, three contributions in this volume attempt at reintegrating ‘culture’ in a wider Mediterranean narrative through different case studies. Under this rubric Bryan Givens discusses Portuguese Sebastianism, Allan Tulchin sketches the interplay of politics and religion in Protestant Nîmes, and Matteo Casini successfully embeds the cultural displays of Baroque Venice into Braudel’s concept of ‘social time’.</p>
<p>Carroll Johnson’s and Gary Tomlinson’s essays’ connection with the overarching theme of the volume is more elusive. In the case of Johnson this is probably due to the fact that the essay is in a draft form (as he passed away before completing it), Tomlinson provides indeed some evocative and erudite thoughts on the connection between the development of the Annales school post-Braudel and the practice of microhistory, but the link between a long-term analysis of musical developments and Braudel’s methodology is not clearly stated, and the reader is left puzzled by how this essay fits within the general aims of the volume.</p>
<p>Such was the strength of the novelty of Braudel’s approach in the first and second section of <italic>La Méditerranée</italic> that scholars in general belittle the third section – the one dedicated to <italic>histoire événementielle</italic> – and generally treat it as an unwieldy afterthought, a ‘traditional’ appendix to his analysis that might as well have been discarded if it wasn’t for tradition’s sake. Regardless of the contributors’ position on this particular issue (on which most of them briefly comment), the essays in this volume clearly show how Braudel’s concept of ‘civilization’ was a wide and strong one, which indeed encompassed the political and the religious as well as the economic and social. Reading these essays and their endnotes references, one cannot but marvel at how much of the socio-economic scholarship, over the 60 years since the publication of <italic>La Méditerranée</italic>, has been dedicated across various historiographical traditions just to analyse in detail questions which were originally raised in it. It is difficult not to be in awe of such a giant of history, as, in fact, all the contributors freely admit to being.</p>
