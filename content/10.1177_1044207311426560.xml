<body>
<p>This article provides an analysis of the cost and effectiveness of seven class action lawsuits filed against school districts and subsequent consent decrees related to the provision of special education services between 1989 and 1999. Based on our experiences with these cases, we review characteristics of scenarios that benefit students and districts using a framework of high and low yields, and we provide recommendations for the development of consent decrees.</p>
<p>Class action lawsuits often cost a great deal of time, money, and energy. Several of the cases reviewed in this article continue today. Because of the considerable investment of resources involved in a class action lawsuit, professionals and parents alike should be familiar with the successes and failures of previous cases. To this end, we review common pitfalls of class actions and consent decrees that may create barriers to resolution. After a brief review of the literature, we review seven cases, then provide recommendations for attorneys, school staff, and parents to support improved outcomes of class action lawsuits or the avoidance of similar lawsuits.</p>
<sec id="section1-1044207311426560">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>The Education for All Handicapped Children Act (EAHCA) was passed in 1975, and reauthorized in 1997 as the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). It was again reauthorized in 2004 as the Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1044207311426560">IDEIA; 2004</xref>). This legislation represented “a national commitment to provide free, appropriate public education for student with disabilities [and] was an effort to end the isolation of students with disabilities by requiring that they be educated with their nondisabled peers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1044207311426560">Yell, 1998</xref>, p. 70). As students with disabilities began attending school, families, advocacy groups, and schools turned to the courts to resolve disputes about the inclusion of students with disabilities and the parameters of the legislation. Gartner and Lipsky noted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1044207311426560">1998</xref> that while schools served all children, with few exceptions, an “emphasis on students with disabilities receiving their education in the general education environment makes increasingly salient the involvement of parents of students with disabilities in broader educational reform and restructuring efforts” (p. 74). Educational reform and restructuring have included lawsuits, class actions, and consent decrees; we focus here on several class actions and the outcomes.</p>
<p>Lawsuits that emerged after the passage of EAHCA included defining inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1044207311426560">Yell, 1998</xref>), determining what “full inclusion” entails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1044207311426560">Lipton, 1994</xref>), how to manage procedures in special education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1044207311426560">Zirkel, 2007</xref>), and how the legal system interprets the least restrictive environment (LRE) mandate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1044207311426560">Palley, 2006</xref>). Each case brought to the courts refines our understanding of what schools are obliged to offer in the way of special education services and how those services are provided.</p>
<p>Some court cases in education continue even after more than 30 years—a review of four court cases that reached the Supreme Court between 2005 and 2007 illuminates continuing debates about the implementation of the IDEA related to the burden of proof, experts’ fees, and the definition of a free and appropriate education (FAPE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1044207311426560">Yell, Ryan, Rozalski, &amp; Katsiyannis, 2009</xref>). Clearly, the intersection of special education and the court is here to stay.</p>
<p>What is problematic about this intersection is the complicated role of the courts in special education cases. Special education law cases often include courts working in a middle ground somewhere between a traditional adjudicatory process and the legislative process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1044207311426560">Mayrowetz &amp; Lapham, 2007</xref>). This middle ground is often complex and fluid, including tension in the “connection between the problem and solution, the quality and breadth of representation and participation, and the balance between finality and flexibility” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1044207311426560">Mayrowetz &amp; Lapham, 2007</xref>, p. 390).</p>
<p>How a flexible role emerged has been explained as a form of fiscal federalism, a strategy used by the federal government to impose standards on such programs as “education, welfare, medical assistance, water quality, and highway construction” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1044207311426560">Sandler &amp; Schoenbrod, 2003</xref>; p. 19). The outcome of the federal government writing more regulations that require compliance by states, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1044207311426560">Sandler and Schoenbrod (2003)</xref> assert, is the courts governing the compliance of states in adhering to federal regulations—and as a result, the courts becoming more and more integral to the development of policy.</p>
<p>This idea, that the courts have become far too enmeshed in the making of policy, is one that can be applied to special education. The “middle ground” the courts often operate in is, in part, predictable and explainable. First, the establishment of an enforceable entitlement as an educational statute is unique. Second, the implementation of federally defined entitlements, through the development of state educational standards, state accountability, due process, educational practice, and guaranteed benefit is challenging and has proven difficult. The web of practice, substance, law, and accountability is left, in large measure, to the courts to sort out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1044207311426560">Rostetter, 1994</xref>). The need to fill the void between federal requirements and the processes necessary to implement those requirements results in parents and schools seeking resolution from the courts. In this way the courts, in fairness, must take the “middle ground” and make new policy. The reality that many cases are decided in the courts is the context for the case reviews that follow.</p>

<title>Characteristics of Class Action Lawsuits in Special Education</title>
<p>Before reaching the point of a lawsuit, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1044207311426560">Zirkel (2007)</xref> notes that mediation and a resolution session are the appropriate steps to address, and hopefully resolve, disputes related to identifying a disability, evaluating a child, or the placement of a child with a disability. If these steps do not resolve the dispute, a due process hearing may be scheduled. In the event that the due process hearing does not bring resolution, the decision from the hearing, which is binding, can be appealed to the State Education Agency (SEA) if the SEA did not conduct the hearing. If these steps are not sufficient to resolve the dispute, the decision may be appealed—by bringing civil action in state or federal court (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1044207311426560">Procedural Safeguards, n.d.</xref>). Civil actions may include class action lawsuits, which is defined by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>One or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf only if:</p>
<p>(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable;</p>
<p>(2) there are questions of law or fact that are common to the class;</p>
<p>(3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class;</p>
<p>(4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1044207311426560">Federal Rules of Civil Procedures, 2007</xref>, p. 27)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Given the many steps that are in place to resolve disputes, only the most egregious cases become class action lawsuits. These lawsuits are typically brought to clarify the regulations related to the lack of service provision for a class of children with a particular disability label or placed in a particular setting. This is important because <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1044207311426560">Palley (2006)</xref> notes that systemic change is not usually the outcome of cases brought on behalf of individuals; in her discussion of the implementation of the LRE regulations of the IDEIA, she notes,<disp-quote>
<p>When a decision is made in an individual suit, the funding for the overall system is unlikely to be considered, because it is not directly related to the individual student’s rights. However, without this consideration, there is unlikely to be permanent structural change. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1044207311426560">Palley, 2006</xref>, p. 233)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A lack of permanent structural change is problematic; without it, sustainable changes are difficult. Class actions are one strategy that can extend beyond individual suits through the development of consent decrees; the development of effective decrees that support sustained reform is reviewed in the recommendations.</p>
<p>Once a class action lawsuit has been filed, the result is often a consent decree with a series of requirements that include significant change across a district that has limited experience or success with systemic change. This happens for several reasons. First, class action lawsuits are typically “last resort” lawsuits. They happen when large groups of students are not receiving services, and occur after considerable efforts to arrive at solutions to problems have been expended by the district, parents, and advocates. Sometimes years of back and forth discussions and agreements precede the actual lawsuit. A broad review of educational reform is beyond the scope of this article, but it is worth mentioning that three strategies commonly used in the late 1980s included a rational-planning model, a market-incentive strategy, and a political interaction strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1044207311426560">Timar &amp; Kirp, 1989</xref>). Each strategy has benefits and drawbacks; for the purposes of effecting systemswide change, we agree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1044207311426560">Ornstein (1992)</xref>, who notes that “educational reform, if it is to be successful, cannot come from only one group—politicians, state officials, taxpayers, administrators, or teachers; cooperation is needed among all groups.” (p. 48-49) Describing ways to support such cooperative efforts in the context of situations that have escalated into lawsuits is our goal.</p>
<p>A second reason that consent decrees often include requirements for significant change is that lawsuits are often filed on behalf of students with significant and complex needs; as a result of the complexity of students’ needs, the solutions are also complex. Organizational changes of a sweeping nature may be demanded, extensive training efforts may be required, and collaborations among groups who typically may not communicate, such as special education administrators and principals, may be necessary to make concessions and change. The context is often a situation that has already been identified as one that has not produced satisfactory outcomes for students with disabilities. Finally, class actions require a school system to extend beyond what has been provided and to do more than has been the case, and requisite changes are typically required on a schedule that is fixed and set by those outside the school system. Change requirements frequently involve state education agencies and typically result in extraordinarily difficult circumstances for change and improvement of services for students with disabilities.</p>
<p>Statements such as the ones listed below are examples of such sweeping—and impossible—outcomes:</p>
<list id="list1-1044207311426560" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>all students will achieve at grade level (<italic>Chanda S. v. Los Angeles Unified School District</italic> [LAUSD], 1996/2003; <italic>Duane B. v. Chester Upland School District</italic>, 2000);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>all staff will be qualified and trained to demonstrate the skills necessary to include all students with disabilities in regular education settings (<italic>Vaughn G. v. Amprey</italic>, 1997);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>all students will be screened for academic performance on a quarterly basis (<italic>Duane B. v. Chester Upland School District</italic>, 2000);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>all students will receive tutoring and extra instructional help sufficient to attain passing grades the next two quarters consecutively (<italic>Chanda S. v. LAUSD</italic>, 1996/2003).</p></list-item></list>
<p>These outcomes are certainly something to hope for; to mandate that these outcomes occur on a short timeline with little additional support is not often realistic and sets up the school district in question for failure and noncompliance. The result is a frustrated, defeated attitude at the school, and a significant disconnect between theory and best-case scenarios and actual practice. The mismatch between sweeping outcome demands and district capacity for change is the type of long-term, nonproductive class action lawsuit that is a frequent form of litigation in special education. To explore how this result occurs, we next review the differences in how educational agencies and the legal community function.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1044207311426560">
<title>Educational and Legal Systems</title>
<p>The legal system functions very differently than the educational system. First, the decision-making process in law is essentially linear. It is driven by precedent and operates within fairly discrete sets of rules and procedures. Point A is considered to precede Point B. It is, at its core, logical, sequential, and final. Second, law is specifically purposeful and engages the participants in a process to prevail or not prevail. It does so by establishing one or more versions of the “truth” and results in some choice among those versions or some synthesis of those versions to describe a final version.</p>
<p>In marked contrast to the legal system, education agencies are chaotic in their essential style. Continuity consists of a superintendent who lasts more than 2 or 3 years in a job (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1044207311426560">Natkin et al., 2002</xref>). The never-ending tasks of selecting textbooks, assessment tools, credential standards, finance schemes, board members, consultants, and even the district mission result in recursive and evolving decision-making structures and plans.</p>
<p>Most class action cases in special education attempt to create large-scale organizational change that will result in better services for students with disability labels. However, one obvious problem is that special education cannot drive the entire educational system even though the demands of a class action lawsuit frequently require systemwide change. The result can be minimal change and little or no improvement despite years of effort, even if the district agrees that change is needed. Class action lawsuits, which result in court action, frequently yield consent decrees. In the next section, we review how consent decrees are developed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1044207311426560">
<title>What Causes Consent Decrees?</title>
<p>A consent decree “is a judicially approved settlement agreement that is based on an agreement between the parties, yet has the force and effect of a final judgment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1044207311426560">Swift, 2004</xref>, p. 37). Consent decrees result when plaintiffs and defendants agree about what the parties will do to address the problems in a lawsuit. The consent decrees considered in this analysis concern class actions—cases where a similar group of persons with similar characteristics suffer a similar kind of harm.</p>
<p>One example of a class is a group of students with emotional or behavioral disabilities who are denied access to school due to the application of inadequate discipline procedures. Another class might be when all students residing in a state who have been identified as having mental retardation are unnecessarily isolated from nondisabled peers. A third example of a class can also be all students identified as needing special education or suspected of being disabled.</p>
<p>In most instances, the call for members of the class is prospective as well as retrospective. For example, members of the class might include all those individuals who should have been class members since the inception of the dispute. If the issue were raised initially in 1985, a consent decree entered into in 1995 can confer all the benefits of the decree to those students who should have been served in 1985. In this way, a class member might be 30 years old and still be entitled to some form of remedial relief.</p>

<p>Seven cases with consent decrees were selected for review. They were selected because they serve as examples of how the intersection of law and educational systems can be less or more effective in supporting students with disabilities. Five cases that indicated high cost and low yield and two cases characterized by high yield and low cost were chosen. Then, characteristics regarding the factors that appeared to contribute to high- or low-yield cases are identified and are reported. Those factors form the basis for the recommendations set forth in the final section.</p>
<p>One author has served as a monitor, master, federal official, or expert in each of the 16 cases. This working knowledge provided an initial basis for review. Using an inductive and recursive process for review and selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1044207311426560">Denzin &amp; Lincoln, 2003</xref>), all cases were reviewed and 7 cases selected to represent the breadth of a particular period of time, namely, 1989 to 1999. Once the 7 cases were selected, the analysis was conducted through review of extant documents and phone interviews with key participants in the litigation, including counsel and administrators. Documents reviewed included court orders, consent decrees, expert reports, and records of cost.</p>
<p>Subsequent to the analysis of the content of documents, the cases were sorted into two categories: low cost/high yield, and high cost/low yield. By yield we mean the intended outcome of the lawsuit as stated in the initial complaint has been substantially achieved.</p>
<p>The seven selected cases concern the state role in ensuring inclusive placements for students with mental retardation throughout the state of Connecticut (<italic>Mrs. W. v. Tirozzi</italic>, 1989); the role of the state of Texas ensuring a FAPE to students in residential facilities (<italic>Angel G. v. Texas Education Agency</italic> [TEA], 1994); placement in the LRE as well as the SEA role and the Chicago Public School (CPS) obligations to ensure appropriate placements (<italic>Reid L. v. Ill. State Bd. of Educ.</italic>, 1995); the provision of services in the LRE for students in the Los Angeles School district in California (<italic>Chanda S. v. LAUSD</italic>, 1996/2003); the provision of FAPE and LRE in a small urban district, and was brought against the state of California and the Ravenswood School district (<italic>Emma C. v. Eastin</italic>, 1997); complaint resolution procedures and the state’s role in investigating and enforcing findings on behalf of individuals (<italic>Dunajski v. Keegan</italic>, 2001); the provision of services to a low-incidence population throughout the state of Pennsylvania when multiple agencies are necessary to ensure FAPE (<italic>Cordero v. Pennsylvania Dep’t of Educ.</italic>, 1992).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1044207311426560">
<title>Case Reviews</title>
<p>These cases represent an array of defendants at the local and state level, and also address both small and large school districts. In addition, all of these cases involve the responsibility of state education agencies in ensuring appropriate services. As a result, they are representative of class action lawsuits in special education brought in the 1990s. Of additional significance is the fact that six of the seven class action lawsuits are still ongoing; Djunaski is the only one to be resolved to date.</p>

<title>Cases With High Cost/Low Yield</title>
<p>The five cases reviewed in this section include <italic>Mrs. W. v. Tirozzi</italic> (1989), <italic>Reid L. v. Illinois State Board of Education</italic> (ISBE; 1995/2002/2004), <italic>Chanda S. v. LAUSD</italic> (1996/2003), <italic>Emma C. v. Eastin</italic> (1996/2001/2007/2008), and <italic>Angel G. v. TEA</italic> (1994/2004).</p>
<sec id="section8-1044207311426560">
<title>Mrs. W. v. Tirozzi (1989)</title>
<p>This case is a class action on behalf of students with intellectual disabilities and their placement in the LRE. The case was initiated in 1989 in Connecticut (<italic>Mrs. W. v. Tirozzi</italic>, 1989). The Connecticut data on participation by students with mental retardation in general education and resource rooms at the time were among the lowest in the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1044207311426560">Twentieth Annual Report, 1998</xref>). In the 1995–1996 school year in Connecticut, 7.69% of students with the label <italic>mental retardation</italic> were served in the regular class, in stark contrast to the 57.28% of all students with disability labels served in Connecticut’s regular classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1044207311426560">Twentieth Annual Report, 1998</xref>). In fact, several large school districts had no students with mental retardation in placements less restrictive than self-contained classrooms.</p>
<p>This case went to trial and ended in a consent decree that established a panel of experts to guide the implementation of increasing the more inclusive placements of students with the label of mental retardation (<italic>P. J. et al. v. State of Connecticut, Board of Education</italic>, 2002). Despite considerable expertise and sophisticated, data-driven efforts, placements in less restrictive settings have not increased dramatically as a percentage of overall enrollments. Annual reports to Congress establish that in 2004, the percentage of students with the MR label included in the regular class more than 80% of the day was 19.43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1044207311426560">Twenty-Eighth Annual Report, 2006</xref>). The majority of this increase in percentage in regular education placements is most likely attributable to a significant decrease in the actual size of the class. The number of students in the class has decreased from 4,301 to 2,653 since the panel was empowered. Absent sufficient data to investigate the effect of this decrease, it is not possible to conclude that inclusive placements have substantially increased (D. C. Shaw, personal communication, May 4, 2009).</p>
<p>This case reveals the limitations of trying to change local behaviors through statewide class actions. The argument was around the methods of administration by the state to monitor and enforce the LRE requirement. That is, the state needed to change its behavior related to LRE placements. The assumption was that the state had the capacity to effect large-scale change in local districts. This was not the reality.</p>
<p>The yield in this case was low because the case was brought to special education instead of general education. Placement decisions should be made by a group of people based on students’ identified needs as per their Individual Education Plans (IEPs). These individualized determinations should form the basis of placements in specific educational environments. However, the environment required to provide integrated services is not within the purview of the IEP teams, the special education departments, or the State Special Education Departments. The implementation of the IEP decisions is completely within the purview of general education. A lawsuit in special education cannot directly affect the behavior of general educators even if one yields minimal change in educational placements for students with disability labels.</p>
<p>This case involved significant expenditures of time and resources in an effort to change the State Department of Education and school districts in Connecticut. The intent was that through increased oversight, training, and technical assistance, general administrators will understand, vest in, and comply with the LRE regulations. This case is headed back into court to seek an enforcement action against the state for failure to implement the 2002 settlement agreement (D. C. Shaw, personal communication, May 4, 2009).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1044207311426560">
<title>Reid L. v. ISBE (1995/2002/2004)</title>
<p>Reid L. is a class action on behalf of students with disabilities placed in segregated settings and their educational placements in 1995. The defendants were the Chicago Public Schools (CPSs) and the ISBE. CPS reached a settlement and entered into a consent decree to establish a monitor and staff to ultimately result in a significant change in the way placement decisions were made as well as an actual reduction in students placed in segregated settings. ISBE refused to settle and was found to be noncompliant and the court eventually accepted a separate agreement regarding what ISBE was required to do to support integrated educational environments (<italic>Cory H. et al. v. The Board of Education of the City of Chicago</italic>, 2001).</p>
<p>Reid L. was significant because of its long reach into state behavior and general supervision. This included teacher preparation programs, funding of special education, and certification standards became part of the court’s oversight, even though the case was only initiated against a single school district in Illinois. To date, despite the court’s efforts to significantly change CPS patterns of placement, and despite tens of millions of dollars in litigation and fees for the monitor’s office, no significant movement toward integrated settings has been achieved.</p>
<p>The low yield of this case is evident in a review of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1044207311426560">Illinois State Performance Plan under Part B for 2005–2010 (2009)</xref>. This Plan projects minimal change (less than 1%) in the number of students with disability labels receiving services more than 60% of the day outside of the general education setting. This statewide lawsuit began more than 14 years ago and will apparently yield no change in the rate of placement in restrictive settings in Illinois.</p>
<p>This case was expensive because of the scope of the monitoring requirements and the resources necessary to effect significant change resulting in compliance with the initial consent decree. Diminishing returns were almost a foregone conclusion given the extensive expectations of the initial consent decree. Both the requirements for the independent monitor and the requirements imposed on the ISBE far exceed any requirements set forth in the federal statutory scheme, or any other state monitoring system. The slower the progress of the CPS, the more the scope of the monitor’s office increased.</p>

<sec id="section10-1044207311426560">
<title>Chanda S. v. LAUSD (1996/2003)</title>
<p>This case was brought initially in 1995 in California on behalf of all students needing, or suspected of needing, special education services in the LAUSD. A quick review of the demographics of the district today include the fact that the LAUSD serves 688,000 students daily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1044207311426560">Fingertip Facts, 2009</xref>) and the district student population is extremely diverse; in the 2008–2009 school year, 72.8% of students were Hispanic, 11.2% were African American, 8.9% were White, and the remaining students were American Indian/Alaska Natives, Filipino, or Pacific Islander (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1044207311426560">Fingertip Facts, 2009</xref>). The California Legislature has enacted a requirement that all students must pass an exit examination to receive a high school diploma. This has imposed a significant challenge on all students, particularly students with disability labels.</p>
<p>The LAUSD has undergone four leadership changes since the beginning of the lawsuit, and each superintendent demonstrates varying interest and commitment to the resolution of the case. LAUSD has also simultaneously embarked on the largest civil engineering project in the history of the state and is building 116 new school buildings (F. Weintraub, personal communication, April 27, 2009). These factors combine to make progress on a consent decree very difficult because of the lack of continuity, shifting foci, and resource shortfalls.</p>
<p>The initial consent decree in 1995 required systemwide changes in regular and special education. It also required a substantial investment in consultants and external technical assistance. Several plans were required in the consent decree; plans that covered areas such as resource development, staff development, LREs, organizational structure, policy and procedure development, and dispute resolution procedures.</p>
<p>Each of the plans were developed, reviewed, and adopted by the parties. This process took 3 years before any change could change for any individual student in the district. The implementations of the plans cost millions of dollars and after 8 years, resulted in no change in district performance and complete frustration on the part of all parties. The intended beneficiaries, the students with disability labels, received little in the way of improved services (T. Hehir, personal communication, June 18, 2004).</p>
<p>The second phase was initiated when LAUSD sought, in 2003, relief from the District Court and an exit from the consent decree. The District Court refused. The appeal to the 9th Circuit was remanded with an order to attempt to mediate a new consent decree (<italic>Chanda S. v. LAUSD</italic>, 1996/2003). This was accomplished and the modified consent decree was put into place. In comparison with the first consent decree, the modified consent decree has 18 outcomes (<italic>Chanda Smith et al. v. LAUSD Modified Consent Decree</italic>, n.d.). The outcomes are measurable by percentages of completion, and are, for the most part, attainable. Of the 18 outcomes, 11 have been attained as of June 2008 (F. Weintraub, personal communication, February 4, 2009). The remaining outcomes are indicative of characteristics of consent decree that directly affect yield. The outcomes require changes throughout the school district over which Special Education has little or no control.</p>

<sec id="section11-1044207311426560">
<title>Emma C. v. Eastin (1996/2001/2007/2008)</title>
<p>Emma C. is selected because of the extraordinary cost and relative minimal yield. Emma C. represents a class of all special education students in Ravenswood City School District (RCSD), California (East Palo Alto, California). The case was initially brought in 1996, when the RCSD served 350 students with disabilities in 11 buildings. The case is about the pervasive denial of FAPE for children in special education.</p>
<p>RCSD is in a low socioeconomic area in transition from a predominantly African American community to a predominantly Hispanic community. It is a good example of a district that is highly vulnerable to litigation as its politics have been fragmented and its economic status is, at best, challenging. RCSD also sits in the middle of one of the wealthiest areas in California. It is 8 miles from Stanford University and 15 miles from the headquarters of Oracle and other giants of the Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Ravenswood has a corrective action plan/consent decree that is 800-pages long with multiple objectives and outcomes. The consent decree was arrived at between the plaintiffs, school district, and the California Department of Education. Costs for Emma C. since 1996 exceed 19 million dollars. It is the best example of a systems change lawsuit which has yielded no significant improvement in services. The school district was brutalized by the state and the monitor, and the case was politicized.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1044207311426560">
<title>Angel G. v. TEA (1994/2004)</title>
<p>This case is the best example of a successful outcome with minimal and long delayed outcomes. Angel G. was a student with significant disabilities in a residential service agency in (city), Texas. As such, educational responsibility for Angel rested with the school district in which the institution was housed. The original complaint asserted that school districts were not fulfilling their responsibilities to students in residential agencies.</p>
<p>The case was brought in 1992 and resulted in a consent decree designed to improve educational services to children in residential facilities in Texas. According to the court-appointed monitor, the original consent decree yielded no significant improvement in the problem after 5 years of oversight. The plaintiffs went back into court and asserted that the TEA system for monitoring and supervising educational programs throughout the state ignored the institutions where children were housed.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs prevailed and in so doing, established a new method that TEA and other states might use to improve monitoring and enforcement of educational entitlements for all children. The decision that the plaintiffs had prevailed, however, did not come from the Federal Court for 5 years. As a result, nothing occurred to significantly improve services for Angel and other members of the class during this 10-year period. Coincidentally, the Monitoring system advocated by the plaintiffs has now become the prototype system mandated by IDEIA 2004 and is known as focus monitoring as a result of this case.</p>

<title>Shared Characteristic of Cases With High Cost/Low Yield</title>
<p>Now that we have discussed the particulars of five cases that involved relatively high cost with relatively low yield, we review an essential characteristic of an ineffective consent decree and provide examples. This characteristic is an effort to change the entire school system, including both general and special education, through litigation in special education. This kind of effort typically fails. One example found in <italic>Emma C. v. Eastin</italic> consent decree requires increased performance on statewide assessments for reading and math. Instruction in these two areas is carried out by regular education teachers in regular classes. A second example concerns suspensions and expulsions and graduation rates. In LAUSD, suspension and expulsion is a principal responsibility, and special education administration has relatively little effect on these decisions. Also in LAUSD, graduation rates were part of the consent decree. Graduation requires attaining specific numbers of academic credits and passage of a comprehensive examination. Management of this process is completely the responsibility of regular education. A third example can be found in <italic>Mrs. W. v. Tirozzi</italic> consent decree. In this case, the plaintiffs sought increased participation of students with mental retardation in the general education classroom. Meaningful participation and academic success in general education classes depends on support and leadership from principals and teachers alike. However, such staff fall outside the supervisory reach of special education.</p>

<title>Low-Cost/High-Yield Cases</title>
<sec id="section15-1044207311426560">
<title>Cordero v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (1992)</title>
<p>The named plaintiff in the Cordero case was a student with emotional needs that extended across traditional education services, and required considerable mental health support as well. The case focused on the inability of the Pennsylvania Department of Education to significantly influence the mental health bureaucracy so that students like the ones named in the class action could be served through collaborative efforts rather than fragmented ones.</p>
<p>The case was aided by the fact that the leadership of the Department of Education and Health and Human Services in Pennsylvania saw the need to collaborate to solve their interagency differences (G. Champagne, personal communication, May 7, 2009). Some of these differences were attributable to actual policy that hindered collaboration, and some were due to the historical disconnect that many states have experienced between educational and mental health services. An important factor in the high yield of this case is the significant effort of the State Board of Education to increase interagency efforts in response to the Cordero case:<disp-quote>
<p>The Department has participated with other child-serving agencies in developing a system for providing intensive interagency coordination to students with disabilities whose school districts have determined that they cannot be appropriately educated in a public educational setting and who have waited more than 30 days for the provision of an appropriate educational placement. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1044207311426560">Basic Education Circulars, 2008</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The Cordero Consent decree focused on the identification of each class member statewide, and the vehicle to resolve their service delivery issues, student by student. It also demanded regular meetings of all agencies that serve students like the class members. Eventually cost-sharing agreements yielded a relatively seamless relationship between agencies at state and local levels.</p>
<p>What is significant here is that the service providers that were necessary to resolve the problem were all engaged because of state oversight and the monitoring of the court. This appears to be an essential characteristic when class actions have demonstrably positive effects.</p>
<p>This case served to further define the general supervisory role of state education agencies when students are served by multiple agencies simultaneously.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1044207311426560">
<title>Djunaski v. Arizona Department of Education (1999/2001)</title>
<p>In this case, the Arizona Protection and Advocacy Office focused on the fact that Arizona State Department of Education (ASDOE) was not investigating and resolving complaints consistent with the IDEA federal requirements for complaint resolution. Like Cordero, this is a general supervision case. However, this case focused on complaints management, a specific component of general supervision.</p>
<p>The IDEA has a section that details the role of the SEA as guarantor of a FAPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1044207311426560">IDEA, 2004</xref>). General supervision is carried out through several methods of administration. Methods of supervision include interagency coordination, establishment of policies and procedures, investigation, resolution, of complaints, provision of technical assistance, and monitoring, and enforcement. In Cordero, the provision of technical assistance and the implementation of interagency agreement were at issue. In this case, the investigation and resolution of complaints was at issue. The consent decree established a monitor and guidelines for completion of a complaint process.</p>
<p>The Department was very committed to the full implementation of the consent decree, which resulted in a collaborative relationship between the parties and the monitor’s office. Because of this collaboration, the bulk of monitoring was spent on problem solving rather than problem identification. The clarity of expectations and the mutual identification of the problem were the key elements that led to a successful resolution of this statewide class action.</p>
<p>The first step in insuring progress was the establishment of a database which was viewed as reliable by the monitor and both parties. The characteristics and design of the data collection system were agreed to, and its development and implementation were reviewed on a monthly basis. The result was a credible reporting system on which the state could rely to improve its own performance, and the plaintiffs could rely on to demonstrate the goals of the consent decree. With a reliable data system in place, specific complaints could be identified as problematic and resolved quickly. The final result of that work was the capacity of the Department of Education in Arizona to demonstrate compliance with the federal requirements, thus eliminating the need for a monitor and the consent decree.</p>

<sec id="section17-1044207311426560">
<title>Shared Characteristics of Cases With Low Cost/High Yield</title>
<p>In general terms, class actions and consent decrees that appear to be most effective in terms of cost and effect on students are those that are reasonable in scope. They are usually focused on a few changes and those changes are usually attainable with relatively small investments of resources to yield moderate progress. Such a conclusion might appear self-evident. However, it is clearly not self-evident to those who craft large-scale lawsuit aimed at sweeping changes for relatively few students. Such cases most typically yield virtually no significant change or outcome after years and millions of dollars.</p>
<p>If we could simply say that such cases take longer or eventually they come to fruition, it would be more difficult to conclude that they are ineffective. But they do not just take longer. They seemingly take forever, and few get resolved absent drastic pullbacks from the original scope of the effort. In addition to taking extraordinary amounts of time, two of the high-cost/low-yield cases affected relatively few students. Emma and Angel G. represent a combined student population of about 2000 students. The remaining three cases represent larger populations of students but yielded negligible changes in the intended outcomes of the lawsuits. Of the five, all have ongoing consent decrees and remain unresolved.</p>
<p>Despite the very pointed criticism directed at many of the class action lawsuits discussed, this article is not intended to suggest in any way that many such efforts have not made a significant difference for schools and students with disabilities. Our hope is that making recommendations for positive outcomes of consent decrees will lead to more effective and efficient litigation when necessary to improve services for students.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section18-1044207311426560" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Three factors that may affect the development of class actions include their “last resort” nature, the complexity of students’ needs, and the schism between the demands and timelines of the courts on school districts with perhaps a limited capacity to effect those required changes on a narrow timeline. However, class action lawsuits can be successful in supporting students with disabilities, as seen in the two cases with relatively low cost and relatively high yield. The successful cases share several characteristics. Both were directed at oversight agencies; the state, again in both cases. The area where improvement was necessary was very specific and recognizable. The outcomes could be easily measured. And, the necessary internal management and leadership changes were minimal. Based on our experience with these cases, here is a summary of recommendations:</p>
<list id="list2-1044207311426560" list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Limit the scope of the case. Be careful to limit the scope of the consent decree to existing law in general and special education. For example, there is a current emphasis on learning outcomes that permeates special education. This focus is clearly needed. However, requiring increased learning outcomes of students with disability labels is a high-yield demand. This high-yield demand would require control over the instructional environments in general and special education. This is so because controlling learning outcomes required control over the content of instruction in these environments. However, these environments are influenced by state education agencies and controlled by laws outside of special education. Existing law does not require specific proficiencies in reading or math to attain a FAPE. A consent decree that requires a school district to specifically increase academic proficiency measured by standardized assessments is an example of an attempt to require individual performance and systems that are beyond the control of special education. Rather than requiring specific increases in academic performance, any consent decree should focus on outcomes directly required by special education law. Examples include percentages of students in specific environments, participation in testing, or timely evaluations.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Only seek, or agree to, attainable outcomes. Failing to comply with a consent decree can result in severe consequences, including contempt findings, sanctions, fines, or loss of control of the school district. This recommendation is difficult to implement. Plaintiffs are legitimately seeking changes in school district performance that are currently not being attained. The tendency becomes agreeing to what is desirable rather than what is attainable. For example, a school district may want to increase the percentage of students in regular education environments by 50% in a 2-year period. Given the constraints of IEPs and the sheer volume of necessary staff development to implement such a change, this may not be attainable. This mistake happens in virtually every consent decree, and both parties need to resist the temptation to mandate what is ideal, rather than what is possible.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Do not seek, or agree to, a consent decree if it is oriented toward process or qualitative changes. Focus only on outcomes for students. Consent decree requirements must be operational and measurable. This means they must have a beginning and an end, and progress toward that end must be measurable. Simple percentage outcomes are the most preferable way to measure attainment. For example, the school district will reduce the number of students in separate schools by 10% in one academic year.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Keep measurements of progress to the smallest possible units. For example, systemwide measurements are very difficult to attain and demonstrate. Measure classroom or school change. That is where students are and that is where the effect should occur.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Never rely solely on large automated databases to measure success. They do not work. Errors in data entry or calculations become the substance of the dispute instead of services to students. It is a very dangerous method of measuring compliance. Use raw data; this can be done if the units of measurement are small and discrete. For example, be certain that the units of measurement are schools. In most instances where noncompliance is the focal point of a consent decree, the majority of noncompliance is attributable to relatively small percentages of schools. In special education, the most frequently noncompliant are secondary schools. Therefore, any consent decree must focus on specific problem areas and specific schools, rather than districtwide measures. Districtwide databases should be used to pinpoint problem areas so that progress can be demonstrated specific to high-need areas.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Keep the tasks finite and do not appoint monitors, masters, or consultants unless departure dates are prescribed. Cases take on lives of their own and the economic possibilities of continuing these cases for the wrong reasons are always a problem.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Describe roles and responsibilities precisely and build in specific dates for court oversight.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The recommendations above and the analysis of a decade of class actions and resulting consent decrees are provided to yield more effective outcomes as a result of such litigation. While such cases are brought with the best of intentions, the processes, limitations in capacity and resources, and the circumscribed authority of the courts and the parties involved often yield outcomes that do not further the realization of those good intentions. This review will hopefully result in better outcomes for students in special education as the process is improved and made more effective.</p>
