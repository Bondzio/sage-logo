<p>Many labour historians writing today would have been schooled in theoretical traditions that saw the modern capitalistic employment relations to be volitional and contractual in character, the only example of truly ‘free’ labour in world history, whereas the pre-modern and pre-capitalist ones involved coercion, trad-itionalism, and lack of choice. Since the 1970s, these formulas came under attack from a variety of positions. The world systems school, and the historiography of colonial labour, are two examples. The two books being reviewed are products of this critical tradition. Both try to build something new on the ashes of the discarded ideas, and call it ‘global’ history. Marcel van der Linden’s <italic>Workers of the World</italic> does it convincingly, if in a stylised neo-Marxist way that may not appeal to all brands of historians seeking a global labour history. The edited collection <italic>Labour Matters</italic>, which contains many fine essays, does so with less effect.</p>
<p><italic>Workers of the World</italic> is an attempt to write labour history on a global scale. Its goal is a conceptual one. The book asks how ‘a globalized history of work’ (p. 366) can be written. The conceptual tools one would need for such an enterprise, according to the book, should serve the historian, especially the historian of capitalism, a system of production that has ‘uprooted, regrouped, and reorgan-ized’ subaltern workers (p. 367) on a scale the world had not known before. The choice of tools is inspired by Karl Marx rather than Gary Becker (who does not get a citation in the book), in that the book places work in the backdrop of the particular economic and social system in place, rather than seeing work as a manifestation of universal patterns of rational economical choices made by individ-uals and families. The influence of Immanuel Wallerstein on the project is also evident, insofar as both eschew the possibility of national histories. The task is an ambitious one: the text and footnotes move back and forth between theory and illustrations, and between illustrations taken from a bewildering range of contexts. The resultant text does not always make for easy reading. The frequent use of bullets to cut up large points into many fragments adds to the difficulty. Overall, however, van der Linden meets the challenge by producing a synthesis that is quite a tour de force. The 75-page bibliography bears witness to the immense ground the author had to cover in writing a global history of labour.</p>
<p>Three large sections of the book address theoretical concerns, such as, free versus unfree labour, mutuality and cooperation, and resistance and mobilisation. Twelve of the 15 chapters are preoccupied with these issues. The remaining three, grouped under a section titled ‘Insights from adjacent disciplines’, comment on the use of ‘labour control’ by the world systems school, on incorporation of subsistence as a labour strategy in the work of a post-war German scholarship, and on the use of ethnographic study for labour historians, illustrated with an example from Papua New Guinea. The initial chapters build a series of arguments on the basis of the critiques of modernisation theory, showing especially how freedom and unfreedom could result from a conjunction of structural and normative conditions, and showing that these conditions did not necessarily correlate with capitalism or its absence. The chapters on ‘mutuality’ turn to the subjects of insurance, consumer cooperatives and producer cooperatives, and describe how patterns of cooperation among workers are shaped by employment relations. Parts of the discussion on insurance have some significance for current discourses on mutuality as an empowering developmental strategy. The final major section on collective bargaining and resistance explore the origins of organised trade unionism and strikes as a method of resistance, and speculates on the future of labour internationalism.</p>
<p>It would be easy, but perhaps not fair, to fault a book like this one for the themes that it leaves out. Colonialism and gender, not totally ignored, are not theorised enough; demography is as good as missing; and differences between cultures, especially craft cultures, are pushed aside. For example, the nature of industrial apprenticeship differed greatly between early modern England, with its extensive use of indenture contract, and early modern India, with its extensive use of family-bound learning. These differences carried over into modern systems of work, and shaped both learning and cultures of ‘mutuality’. The book is not very helpful in understanding these contrasts. A more serious omission is the role of rational choice, which gets short shrift here. In some views at least, the omission has serious consequences. Consider one example. Migrant factory workers in India in the nineteenth century were almost all males, whereas their counterparts in Japan were often females. How we account for this difference by using the constructs offered in the book, it is not clear to me. We need to factor in women’s age at marriage and model migration as a family decision. Marx is not helpful here. Chicago is more insightful.</p>
<p>If colonialism is only implicitly present in van der Linden, it takes the central place in <italic>Labour matters</italic>. The collection consists of 15 essays by as many contributors, and a short editorial introduction. The essays were presented in a conference held in Delhi to honour Sabyasachi Bhattacharya. The largest coherent set deals with labour history in colonial India. The history is studied with reference to enterprise, administration, and the ideology of governance. The particular themes include convict labour employment in public works (Chitra Joshi), convict labour system in the Andaman Islands (Aparna Vaidik), health and medical concerns aboard ships carrying migrant indentured workers (Anil Persaud), family and work in the Jharia coalfields (Dhiraj Kumar Nite), employers’ response to Bombay’s labour shortage around World War I (Prashant Kidambi), perception of women’s and children’s labour (Emma Alexander-Mudaliar), dalits and the ideology of work (Shashibhushan Upadhyay), comparison of Indian and European notions of slavery and servitude (Claudio Costa Pinheiro), mobility among the musahars (Rafiul Ahmed), response to early factory legislation in western India (Aditya Sarkar), Jamshedpur strikes in the interwar period (Nitin Sinha), and drinks problem in Assam estates (Nitin Varma). Three other essays, while individually well-researched and well-conceived, sit uneasily with the rest. These discuss peasant labour in Russia (Gijs Kessler), Chinese migrant workers in Israel (Li Minghuan), and drink problem among Chilean workers (Marcos Fernández-Labbé).</p>
<p>Although there is little coherence among the contributions on choice of theme, there is the hint of a shared conceptual foundation. Within the essays studying colonial India, quite a few define their goal with reference to what is seen as a paradigm shift, the march of labour history beyond a modernisation approach, one that would see colonialism and westernisation to have made labour free and enabled the scope for rational choice, as well as a Marxist approach, one that would see industrialisation to have made workers unfree while carrying the promise of class solidarity. The paradigm shift owed a great deal to a 1990s discourse on class and colonialism, in which Rajnarayan Chandavarkar made significant intervention. Many of the essays represent a post-Chandavarkar assessment of the field.</p>
<p>If the book is any evidence, this enterprise of rethinking labour history risks losing its way in banality. Most contributors, it would seem, favour a third model and one alternative to both modernisation and Marxism. It is a model in which colonial rulers devised systems of coercive labour employment in order to help the expatriate capitalists. As one author puts it, ‘tentacles of the state closed in’ on labour (p. 131) in nineteenth century India. Labour law and the ubiquitous discourse on the unreliability of the Indian worker seem to point in one way, towards a state-sponsored system of controlling human bodies and the work that it is capable of doing. This common emphasis upon an omnipotent state coming down heavily upon the labourers in the new economic world exists as an unquestioned certainty and treated as a universal condition. In these ways, the belief resembles a religion more than a theory.</p>
<p>The tentacles paradigm, if I may coin a new phrase, is a simplification at many levels. It overlooks the diversity among capitalists and labourers in colonial India, simplifies the origin and design of labour law, underestimates problems of contract enforcement, ignores indigenous forms of violence and coercion except to the extent these were made to serve colonialism, shuts out the possibilities of choice that economists are particularly interested in, and equates serious economic history of labour with a caricature called the ‘teleological logic’ of ‘modernization’ theory. Choice is a taboo word in this framework, as it is in van der Linden’s book. There is an implicit assumption that the existence of coercion denied the workers any choice. But this is a wrong assumption. In the late nineteenth century, even the unskilled manual workers were not ignorant about the implications of joining the indenture as opposed to staying home as agricultural labourers. In both situations, the technology of contract enforcement might involve the threat of violence. A worker could still choose between disciplinary mechanisms depending on what one would earn in each site, what prospects of mobility there were in each case, and how intrusive the discipline was upon the social lives of workers. By discarding choice altogether, the framework remains incapable of discussing how workers compared and perceived these alternatives, and therefore, produces an incomplete history of migration.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the essays are not overburdened by the tired critique of mod-ernisation. And a notable few are free from the urge to describe the discovery of the tentacles paradigm all over again. In most cases, things improve once we go beyond the introduction. The quality of the narratives is rich, backed up by impressive archival research, and justifies the authors’ already established reputation in the field. Some of the essays deal with important yet less researched contexts, and will be an aid to future research and teaching. I would like to make special mention of Vaidik’s Andaman essay, Persaud on health on board ships, though too reliant on one source, Nite on Jharia and Joshi on convict workers.</p>
<p>The editors, by comparison, needed to do more to engage with the essays as a body. The introduction makes no serious attempt to draw connections, or to place India in a comparative framework. Despite the subtitle ‘towards global histories’, the book cannot be said to be doing global history in any precise sense.</p>
