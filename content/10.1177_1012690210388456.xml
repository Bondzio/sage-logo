<abstract>
<p>Sports have often been neglected in the research on taste and cultural consumption. This article investigates lifestyle choices in the area of sports, with particular focus on the differences that can be drawn from occupational class and other background variables. Based on nationally representative survey data from Finland, participation in sports and sports spectatorship are examined. The main findings suggest that there are divisions between the occupational classes in the involvement in sports, but also in the involvement in individual sporting activities. However, the differences are less clear in sports spectatorship. The findings are somewhat at odds with recent research from different countries suggesting that education and income are important in explaining the differences, although occupational class also counts.</p>

<body>
<p>Promoting health through the encouragement of sporting activities has long been a nationwide project in Finland. Hence, in the special eurobarometer The Citizens of the European Union and Sport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1012690210388456">European Commission, 2004</xref>), it was stated that in 2004 Scandinavians were the most sporting people in the EU. However, it has been shown in recent health research that a low social class of the childhood family is associated with physical inactivity in adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1012690210388456">Tammelin et al., 2003</xref>). Even if the results on the international level suggest that Finns are among the most sporting people in Europe, there has been very little research into the class differences in sports on a national level from a cultural viewpoint.</p>
<p>Class differences in the area of culture have been the object of lively discussion in Finland since the 1980s – ever since Bourdieu’s Distinction and his ideas about habitus, capitals, taste, and categories of taste were introduced into Finnish sociology. Thus, in this discussion the area of physical exercise has barely been touched with the exception of an article by Antti <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1012690210388456">Karisto (1988)</xref>. At that time Karisto saw that the old social divisions had evened out, so that the differences in lifestyles and stylization had become more important in indicating social position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1012690210388456">Karisto, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Studying the Finnish way of practicing sports from a class perspective brings one up against a critical challenge that has to be considered from the outset. In recent years the degree of class differences in culture and taste has been considered minimal in Finland (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1012690210388456">Alapuro, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1012690210388456">Karisto, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1012690210388456">Liikkanen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1012690210388456">Mäkelä, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1012690210388456">Purhonen et al., 2010</xref>). It has been considered a fact that Finland embraces a uniform culture, which brings the applicability of class theories into question.</p>
<p>I will first take a look at the research on class, educational and income differences in the field of sport. Practicing sports in Finland will be analysed as a whole before proceeding to the specific sports, but no attempt to follow Bourdieusian theory to the letter is made. Thus, mapping out the differences in choice of sports is especially interesting, since Bourdieu clearly argues that class attitudes affect what sports are taken up and the cultural status of a specific sport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1012690210388456">Grant and Maguire, 1994</xref>). The results concerning the connection between occupational class, education, income and sports suggest that occupational and educational differences can be detected in the field of sports. Thus, the differences in sports spectatorship are less clear.</p>
<sec id="section1-1012690210388456">
<title>Sports in a Bourdieusian framework</title>
<p>Sports and physical exercise are usually seen lying on the margins of cultural consumption and rarely taken into account in studies of lifestyles or taste. Instead, the interest has focused on other fields of culture such as music and literature, where high culture − classical music, opera, and museums − can easily be identified.</p>
<p>According to Bourdieu, differences between social classes can be seen in the way people treat their bodies in the care, feeding and maintaining of them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1012690210388456">Bourdieu, 1984</xref>). Physical strength was something pursued by working-class males. Meanwhile, working-class women spent much less time, effort, sacrifice and money in cultivating their bodies than did the members of the dominant class. Striving for different (class) bodies was closely linked to pursuits in the areas of physical exercise, eating, and clothing.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1012690210388456">Bourdieu (1984)</xref> came to the conclusion that participation in regular sporting activity varied, so that the higher the class or educational level, the more frequently the individual participated in sports. In his article ‘Sport and social class’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1012690210388456">Bourdieu (1978)</xref> examined both the demand for different sports and the differences between groups of people in acquiring a taste for sport. Sports choices resulted from a system of class-based tastes and preferences were determined by capitals such as economic capital and spare time, which can be seen as a transformation of economic capital, and cultural capital.</p>
<p>Bourdieu also detected class differences in the appreciation of different sports. The privileged classes preferred the most distinctive individual sports such as golf, horseback riding, skiing, and tennis, along with gymnastics and mountaineering. The middle classes had adapted a similar health culture, but in a rather rationalized and ascetic way; performing health-oriented sports such as walking and jogging. The middle classes also appreciated team sports such as basketball, handball, and football. Sports served a different purpose for the working class: their ideal was a strong body, which manifested in appreciation of individual sports such as bodybuilding, weightlifting, and violent sports such as boxing or wrestling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1012690210388456">Bourdieu, 1978</xref>).</p>
<p>In Distinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1012690210388456">1984</xref>), Bourdieu noted that the competence required by team sports was fairly equally distributed among the classes, which made these sports equally accessible. Thus, the frequency of practicing team sports as well as individual sports was expected to rise as a person moved through the social hierarchy, although the variations between the classes were more marked in the case of individual sports.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Bourdieu noted that there was a popularization process of different sports under way. This process resulted in some sports being played across a range of social classes, while elite sports were transformed into mass sports. In spite of this, Bourdieu suggested that classes would still differ in their bodily dispositions and in their expectations of different sports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1012690210388456">Grant and Maguire, 1994</xref>).</p>

<title>Sports and class differences</title>
<p>I will first take a look at some recent and international research on sports and occupational, educational, and income differences. Thereafter the divisions in the area of sports in Finland will be examined. The adaptation of the Bourdieusian frame in the recent empirical studies on sports has been quite loose in terms of the formulation of research questions, operationalizing of different capitals, and the methodological solutions.</p>
<p>In Canada, Philip White and Brian Wilson’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1012690210388456">1999</xref>) findings on the attendance in sporting events supported the Bourdieusian idea of the correlation between socioeconomic status and sports spectatorship. Using Multiple Classification Analysis and identifying economic capital with income and cultural capital with education and controlling background variables such as gender, age, language, and region, they found evidence that the level of income was a stronger predictor for the frequency of attending sports events than education, region, age, or mother tongue. Thus, women with higher education would watch more sports, whereas this educational difference could not be found among men.</p>
<p>Christer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1012690210388456">Thrane (2001)</xref> later did a comparative study on sports spectatorship in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, achieving similar results. He considered the identification of cultural capital with education to be unsatisfactory and ended up including variables such as participation in high culture and in sports as explanatory variables that could be identified with cultural capital. Using Multivariate Logistic Regression analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1012690210388456">Thrane (2001)</xref> ended up suggesting that attendance at high-level cultural activities and sports explained attendance in sporting events. Like White and Wilson, Thrane suggested that household income was the most important factor in explaining differences in sports spectatorship, while education was less important. He also emphasized the importance of age and gender, stating that men were more likely to watch sports than women and younger respondents more so than older respondents. Unlike White and Wilson, Thrane found no systematic relationship between education and sports spectatorship.</p>
<p>Also leaving from a cultural standpoint in explaining the differences in the choice of sport, Thomas C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1012690210388456">Wilson (2002)</xref> used the concept of proletarian sports, meaning the sports associated with the lower classes from which the well-off groups want to distance themselves, in his study on sports involvement in America. Wilson tested both the effect of cultural capital (education) and economic capital (household income) on sports involvement. On the basis of Multiple Classification Analysis, Wilson came to the conclusion that income and education explained attendance in sporting events among both genders but also participation in sports. Thus, he found no evidence that economic capital would have any influence on the involvement in ‘prole’ sport, of which he saw car and motorcycle races being as examples.</p>
<p>The concept of proletarian sports has also been used by Ingar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1012690210388456">Mehus (2005)</xref> in his study on the spectatorship of football (soccer), basketball, and ski-jumping. Mehus used Logistic Regression Analysis and found that sports participation was linked to watching sports in Norway. He also found some evidence of the effect of education on sports consumption, which he identified with cultural capital. Respondents in the highest education group attended fewer sporting events than those with lower education. Those with higher education also watched sports less often on television. However, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1012690210388456">Mehus (2005)</xref>, this result pertained only when it was question of ‘mass sports’; otherwise, those with more education participated in a wider range of everything than those with lower education. Thus, some differences could be explained by gender and age.</p>
<p>In his research on adult participation in sports, Carl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1012690210388456">Stempel (2005)</xref> studied the frequency and intensity of participation in different sports in America. He operationalized cultural capital as formal education and economic capital as family income. Through looking at the different possible combinations of different amounts of capitals he found that many sports were highly exclusive and that the principles of exclusion fit closely with Bourdieusian theory. Stempel showed that fitness sports were used by the dominant class to draw boundaries to the middle and lower classes. Thus, the culturally dominant class fraction was more likely to participate in fitness sports than the economically dominant fraction. Stempel stated that sports could operate as cultural capital or as a means of maintaining class and status distinctions. He also pointed out that the dominant class adults participate in a wider range of sports than the lower classes.</p>
<p>In his more recent work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1012690210388456">Stempel (2006)</xref> examined the relationship between sport as cultural capital and its relation to economic capital and the way that sporting capital pays off economically. He found that successful participation in varsity sports explained economical success in later life, although he also found that these patterns were gender-differentiated.</p>
<p>In the UK, Alan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1012690210388456">Warde (2006)</xref> studied sport and social class stating that in addition to education, occupational class was of significance in explaining the differences in the field of sport. Based on Logistic Regression he ended up stating that educational qualification is of particular importance in predicting participation in exercise, whereas occupational class makes more difference in the choice of sport. The educated middle class in the UK proved to be the group most concerned about health and the most actively engaged in physical exercise while also demonstrating a distinctive attitude towards taking care of the body. Thus, gender also proved important in explaining the differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1012690210388456">Warde, 2006</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-1012690210388456">
<title>Research questions</title>
<p>The overall result in recent studies seems to be that the differences in practicing sports relate in a complex manner to background factors such as gender and age. Thus, in most research a connection between sports, education and income can be empirically established. Whereas cultural capital is most often identified with formal education, it is less often identified with participation in other areas of (high) culture. Occupational status has often been left outside the studies although education may not always be in concordance with occupational position especially in older age groups. Economic capital instead is most often identified with income. Other measures such as amount of spare time are less often used.</p>
<p>The most important goal in this article is to investigate the relationship between the socioeconomic status and sports in Finland. Although the standpoint cannot be described as religiously Bourdieusian, occupational group and formal education can be loosely interpreted as indicators of cultural capital and the level of income as economic capital.</p>
<p>The first research question is whether occupational class has an impact on doing sports altogether? The question is especially interesting, since in previous analyses on the connection between class and cultural divisions British researchers have found that the most important division in the area of culture is the degree of cultural engagement, those with higher occupational position and higher level of education being the groups that do everything more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1012690210388456">Gayo-Cal et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1012690210388456">Le Roux et al., 2008</xref>). Similar results have been gained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1012690210388456">Kahma and Toikka, forthcoming</xref>) also in previous research concerning Finland. Adopting a similar approach as Alan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1012690210388456">Warde (2006)</xref> in his article, occupational class is scrutinized simultaneously with other background variables – gender, age, education, and income, in order to find out whether occupational class has explaining power of its own that does not disappear when other factors are being controlled. The second question concerns the association between choice of sport and occupational status. The explanatory factors in addressing the question are the same as the ones in explaining sporting activity. The third question concerns the choice of spectator sports preferred by the respondents either in situ or on television.</p>

<title>Data, methods and variables used in the analysis</title>
<sec id="section5-1012690210388456">
<title>Data</title>
<p>The analysis presented here is based on the survey data from the project Cultural Capital and Social Differentiation in Contemporary Finland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1012690210388456">Rahkonen et al., 2006</xref>). The data were collected in the year 2007 by Statistics Finland. The random sample included 3000 persons, and the survey had a final response rate of 46.3 percent, with a final sample size of 1388 respondents from the Finnish population ages 18 to 74. The final response rate is on the same level with recent mail surveys in Finland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1012690210388456">Melkas, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1012690210388456">Purhonen et al., 2010</xref>). A non-response analysis showed that women, older men and the highly educated were slightly overrepresented in the data. The data were weighted by an index to correct the biases.</p>
<p>The survey covered areas of cultural activity, including watching television, reading, enjoying visual arts and music, eating out, participating in sports and leisure activities. The questionnaire was constructed following the example of the British survey (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1012690210388456">Bennett et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1012690210388456">Thomson, 2004</xref>), although a number of national and cultural modifications were made to include relevant cultural categories.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1012690210388456">
<title>Methods and variables</title>
<p>Most sports questions concerned participation in different forms of physical exercise, while cultural taste was measured by questions about the individual’s likes and dislikes in spectator sports. The dependent variables include the probability of not doing sports, participation in different sports and also preferences in spectator sports. The choice of the dependent variables is explained in detail later.</p>
<p>The relationship between the dependent variables and the independent variables is examined using Logistic Regression Analysis. Therefore all the dependent variables have been coded into dichotomies. The odds ratios provide an economical and clear way to present how each background variable contributes to the probability of doing sports, explains the different sports choices, and also accounts for different preferences in sports spectatorship.</p>
<p>The independent variables in the analysis are occupational class, gender, age, level of education, and the level of income.1 The first independent variable, respondents’ occupational class, is the clearest indicator of a respondent’s place in working life. The variable is based on the occupational classification used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1012690210388456">Statistics Finland (2008)</xref>, which in turn is based on the ISCO-88 standard. The existing categories were collapsed into three categories (professional executives, intermediate class and working class).2 The three-fold division of occupations was originally adopted from the British research project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1012690210388456">Bennett et al., 2009</xref>). The aim of the use of this classification was to avoid the division of the data into too small and uneven groups for the analysis, but also to maintain the comparability to some earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1012690210388456">Kahma, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1012690210388456">Kahma and Toikka, forthcoming</xref>).</p>
<p>The importance of gender and age in explaining differences in the field of sports has been emphasized in recent studies. It has been shown that men tend to be more active in the field of sports than women, and also that the involvement in sports declines with age (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1012690210388456">European Commission, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1012690210388456">Thrane, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1012690210388456">Warde, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1012690210388456">Wilson, 2002</xref>). Age is used in the analyses as a categorical variable divided into six 10-year-long age groups (with the exception of the youngest group covering respondents 18 to 24 years of age). Using age as a categorical variable makes it possible to detect the non-linear connections to the dependent variable.</p>
<p>Other factors that relate to a person’s social status are education and the income, which are taken into account to find out if the impact of occupational class changes or disappears when these factors are controlled. Education can be seen as an indicator of cultural capital and level of income as an indicator of economic capital. Education was categorized following the basic classification of education used by Statistics Finland. The four educational classes are: 1) those with no or only basic education (including those who have not given their educational level); 2) those with vocational schooling; 3) those with a college education (bachelor’s degree); and 4) those with a university degree (master’s or higher). Income here refers to respondents’ personal disposable monthly income. For the analysis the variable was divided into three groups; those earning less than EUR 1000 per month, those earning EUR 1000 to 2000 per month, and those earning more. The distribution of all the independent variables is presented in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1012690210388456">Appendix</xref> table.</p>

<title>Doing physical exercise</title>
<p>The survey respondents were asked ‘Do you ever play any sports or do any physical exercise?’ The majority, 78.6 percent of the respondents claimed to practice some sport, whereas only 18.4 percent reported not engaging in sports. In addition, 3 percent of all respondents did not answer the question. The result is in accordance with the results of Statistics Finland’s Leisure Survey in 2002, which found that some 87–88 percent of Finns engage in physical exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1012690210388456">Berg, 2006</xref>). The proportion of those with no involvement in sports is markedly smaller than, for example, in Britain, where in similar research it was found that 44 percent of respondents had no involvement in sports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1012690210388456">Warde, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to explore the relative importance of different factors in predicting the likelihood of involvement in sports, a Logistic Regression Analysis was conducted. As the proportion of the respondents not doing any sports was the smaller portion, it was chosen as the dependent variable.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1012690210388456">Table 1</xref> the likelihood of not practicing physical exercise is examined first in relation to occupational class. Four other independent background variables are each taken into account in the following models.</p>

<p>Looking at the main effect of occupational class, the likelihood of not being involved in sports decreases by 67 percent as one moves from working-class occupations to intermediate occupations. The difference is similar in comparison to professional executives. The difference between the occupational classes is statistically very significant.</p>
<p>The difference between occupational classes remains when we control for the effect of gender. However, the difference between intermediate class and professional executives becomes a little smaller. Men are 50 percent more likely to report not being involved in sports. Taking age into the analysis does not change the differences between the occupational groups. Involvement in sports changes with age so that the older age group in question, the greater is the likelihood of not being involved in sports. However, most differences between the groups are not significant. Incorporating educational level into the analysis makes the difference between the working class and professional executives smaller and also statistically insignificant. The likelihood of not engaging in any form of physical exercise decreases as one moves from less educated groups to groups with a higher level of education. Taking income into account provides similar results, so that the respondents with higher incomes are less likely to be inactive in the field of sports.</p>
<p>Additional tests were made using the intermediate group as a reference group in order to find out whether sports participation differs between intermediate and professional classes. The results showed no statistically significant differences between the two groups. Thus, the most persistent difference seems to be the one between the working class and the other classes, so that the respondents in working-class occupations are less often involved in sports. Taking other background variables into account does not make the difference disappear; it seems that the higher the educational or income level, the more likely one is to be engaged in sports.</p>

<p>The most popular sports in Finland are walking, cycling, swimming, Nordic walking, and cross-country skiing. The choices were much the same 20 years ago (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1012690210388456">Karisto, 1988</xref>). The result also supports the findings of Statistics Finland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1012690210388456">2006</xref>). However, in recent years Nordic walking and instructor-led gymnastics have become more popular, thus, the popularity of these sports varies among genders and age groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1012690210388456">Berg, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1012690210388456">Table 2</xref> reports the proportion of respondents involved in different sports according to occupational class. The four most common forms of physical exercise are more popular in the class of intermediates than in other classes, whereas members of working class report doing these sports less often. The sports in the middle of the table are more favored by members of the professional executives and are the least popular among working-class respondents. The working class seems more passive in comparison to other classes, with ‘some other team sport’ and ice hockey being the only two sports that are more popular among the working class than in other occupational groups.</p>
<p>Individual sports were chosen for further analysis on the basis of a minimum participation of 10 percent. However, walking was left out of the analysis, since it seems to be too popular to convey social differences. In addition, ‘some other form of physical exercise’ was left out, because the category can include any kind of physical exercise. Therefore, the selection of different sports for further analysis included cycling, swimming, Nordic walking, cross-country skiing, gym training, and jogging or running. The results of the logistic regression analysis are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1012690210388456">Table 3</xref>.</p>

<p>Cycling is clearly the sport of the intermediate class. Intermediates are almost 80 percent more likely to cycle than the working class, but also the group of professional executives, thus the difference is not statistically significant. Main effects, in which statistically significant differences can be seen, concern gender and income. Cycling is somewhat more favored by women than men and the respondents belonging to the middle income group than other income groups. However, the differences between age groups, educational groups and income groups are small and insignificant. The effect of occupational class stays the same when other independent variables are controlled. Thus, the final model also shows a statistically significant difference between those with only basic schooling and those with vocational schooling, the latter group being less often involved in cycling.</p>
<p>Additional tests were made using the intermediate class as a reference group. It was found that the difference between the intermediate class and professional executive class was similar to the difference between the intermediate and the working-class intermediate class being the most active in cycling.3</p>
<p>The intermediates and professional executives are almost twice as likely to engage in swimming as the working-class respondents. Women are more likely to go swimming than men, and the oldest age group is more likely to swim than their younger counterparts. Other statistically significant main effects were not found. In the final model, the difference between the occupational classes was narrower. Thus, swimming still seems more popular among respondents in the intermediate class. In additional tests it was found that the professional executive class did not differ from the intermediate class.</p>
<p>Nordic walking also seems to be the sport of the intermediate class and less favored by those in working-class occupations. Unsurprisingly, it is a feminine sport and more favored by older respondents. Differences between the educational groups did not prove statistically significant. However, income proved significant so that the higher earning income groups are more likely to be involved in the sport than the lowest income group. The differences between occupational classes are narrowed when gender and age are controlled, with age conveying the biggest differences. Also, when other factors are being controlled, Nordic walking appears to be more favored by the intermediate group. Testing for the difference between the intermediate and the professional executive class proved that the professional executive class resembles the working class in that they are less likely to do Nordic walking than the intermediate class.4</p>
<p>Cross-country skiing is more often practiced by the professional executives than by the working class. There is no gender bias in the sport, and the popularity of cross-country skiing rises along with age. The two more educated groups are more likely to engage in skiing than those with no educational qualifications. The group with the biggest income is almost twice as likely to be involved in cross-country skiing as the lowest income group. The difference between occupational classes disappears when the effect of age and level of education are controlled. This also happens when the intermediate class is used as a reference group in the analysis. The differences between occupational classes seem therefore to be caused by education instead.</p>
<p>The classes with higher occupational status are more likely to engage in gym training. No gender difference could be found. As for age, younger groups are more likely to engage in gym training. The likelihood of gym training also rises with education. The highest income group is more likely to engage in gym training than the lowest income group. However, the differences between occupational groups become smaller when educational level and income level are controlled. In the final model the intermediate group still seems to differentiate significantly from the working-class group. Additional tests revealed no statistically significant difference between the intermediate class and the professional executive class.</p>
<p>Running or jogging is twice as popular among professionals and executives by comparison to the working class. There is also a gender bias, so that men run more often than women. Running is also more popular with the youngest age group. The greatest differences can be seen between educational groups so that the likelihood of being involved in jogging is many times greater in groups with higher education. In the additional tests, it was found out that although the professional executives are more likely to engage in running than the intermediates, the difference became insignificant when other independent factors were controlled.5</p>

<title>Sports spectatorship</title>
<p>According to Alan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1012690210388456">Warde (2006)</xref>, people often tend to watch more sports than they practice. Spectator sports may therefore represent lifestyle choices more genuinely, since they allow people to enjoy sports without restrictions of physical condition. Thus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1012690210388456">White and Wilson (1999)</xref> point out that people who are active in the field of sports are also the most active sports spectators.</p>
<p>The respondents were asked to pick from a list of different sports their first and second favorite sports, which they follow either by attending sporting events or by watching television. Responses were combined into dichotomies for each sport, separating those who had opted for the sport and those who had not.6</p>
<p>Even if the spectator sports listed are not all the same as the options in the question concerning the respondents’ personal pursuits, the respondents prefer spectator sports similar to the sports they practice. Ice hockey, soccer, tennis, and golf are more popular among those who play these games themselves than among those who do not. Finnish baseball is more popular among those who report practicing ‘some other type of team sport’ than among those who do not. Golf makes an interesting case in that it is more popular among the respondents who actually play golf, but also respondents practicing other activities that Bourdieu considered high end such as tennis, horseback riding, and downhill skiing. Spectator sports that include some choreography and music such as figure skating and gymnastics were more often favored by the respondents who report practicing aerobics, other gymnastics, or dancing. Skiing was also more popular among those who ski themselves, and alpine sports among those who either go downhill skiing or snowboarding. Congruencies were less obvious in the case of spectator sports that did not have a direct or close counterpart on the list.</p>
<p>The respondents were asked to name their first and second favorite spectator sports from a list of 14 sports plus the option ‘none of the above’. The most popular sports are located at the top of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1012690210388456">Table 4</xref>. It turned out that athletics (track and field sports) was the most favored sport. Ice hockey was the next most popular sport. Motor racing came in third, but figure skating was almost as popular.</p>

<p>Professional executives chose soccer, alpine sports, gymnastics, tennis, golf, or sailing as their favorite sports more often than did other occupational groups. The intermediates named figure skating, cross-country skiing, or harness racing more often than other groups. The spectator sports more often opted for by the respondents in working-class occupations were boxing, athletics, motor racing, and Finnish baseball. Thus, the differences between occupational classes were rather small. In order to see how these differences can be explained by other independent variables, the six most popular sports were chosen for closer analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1012690210388456">Table 5</xref>).</p>

<p>Using occupational class as an explanatory variable yields statistically significant differences only in following motor racing, figure skating, and soccer. However, these differences are small, and therefore a conclusion of clear class differences in spectator sport preferences cannot be drawn. Instead, more obvious differences can be seen in relation to other background variables; in almost every sport, gender creates differences that remain when other independent factors are controlled. There is also an age group bias: the popularity of athletics and cross-country skiing increases with age, while the popularity of ice hockey, motor racing, and soccer decreases.</p>
<p>The differences can be seen in relation to educational level and income, both of which are related to respondents’ social status. Athletics and cross-country skiing appear to be favored more by the less educated groups, whereas the likelihood of opting for other sports is greater in the higher educated groups.</p>

<title>Summary and discussion</title>
<p>In Finland sports is something almost everyone engages in, but participation varies according to occupational class. The main divisive line goes between the working class and the other groups, which are more often engaged in sports. Sports relates similarly to occupational measures as other cultural areas in recent research higher status groups being more engaged than those in working class occupations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1012690210388456">Bennett et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1012690210388456">Kahma and Toikka, forthcoming</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1012690210388456">Le Roux et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, education and the level of income, which are linked to class position, conveyed some important differences. College or university degree explained the difference in engagement in sports, and taking income into account revealed that those with higher income were more likely to participate in sports.</p>
<p>The most interesting finding regarding the choice of sport is that for some sports the primary line of class difference appears between the intermediate and the working class, while other sports also differ between the professional executives and the intermediates. Cycling and Nordic walking but also gym training can be counted for intermediate sports, as they are less favored by other groups. Swimming, instead, is more favored both by the intermediates and the professional executives than the working class. Cross-country skiing and running seemed at first to be the sports of the professional executives, but the differences could be accounted for by education.</p>
<p>Although spectator sports escape the limitations imposed by physical and economic incapacities, the sports a person practices closely resemble the choices made in spectator sports. Thus, the logic of occupational and educational differences is less clear, when spectator sports are concerned. Factors such as age and gender explain the differences, which have been seen as important in recent research.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the results give reason to discuss the relation between different capitals and background variables such as occupational class, education, and the level of income. It is easy to identify income with economic capital, and education with cultural capital. However, there were differences between the occupational groups, which did not disappear, when education and income were controlled. This result is not to be expected based on Bourdieu, but may be expected based on some recent research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1012690210388456">Bennett et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1012690210388456">Warde, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>It is possible that education is not sufficient to pass as the sole measurement of cultural capital and that occupational class indicates other type of cultural capital conveying differences that cannot be explained by education. As shown in previous analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1012690210388456">Kahma, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1012690210388456">Kahma and Toikka, forthcoming</xref>), measurements of occupational class account for differences in other cultural areas, and it seems necessary to consider the way we operationalize cultural capital. Bourdieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1012690210388456">1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1012690210388456">1984</xref>) stated that all cultural consumption including sports consumption requires the appropriate preferences and tastes as well as skills and knowledge, which he terms cultural capital, which is gained from one’s upbringing and education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1012690210388456">Bourdieu, 1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1012690210388456">1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1012690210388456">Wilson, 2002</xref>). Thus, it seems well grounded to believe that cultural capital can be gained and formed later on in working life.</p>
<p>The logic behind the divisions within the field of sports seems to vary according to different times and national contexts. The recent research on sports in other Nordic countries seems to suggest that there is a strong positive connection between household income and education, cultural capital being positively connected to participation in sports but also sports spectatorship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1012690210388456">Mehus, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1012690210388456">Thrane, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent studies in Canada and the US similarly show a top-heavy pattern meaning that the dominant classes practice sports more actively and are also selective in their sports choices. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1012690210388456">White and Wilson (1999)</xref> found that income is a stronger predictor of sports practices than education. Conversely, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1012690210388456">Wilson (2002)</xref> emphasized that cultural capital is better in explaining the differences, those richest in cultural capital being more likely to be involved in sports. The same goes for those richest in economic capital. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1012690210388456">Stempel (2005)</xref> also found the dominant classes to be more active in strenuous sports.</p>
<p>It may be suggested that Finland differs from these examples. Although those with more cultural and economic capital practice sports more often, the activity seems to concentrate heavily in the middle, so that the intermediates are slightly more active than the professional executives and much more active than the working class. The intermediates and the professional executives also favor almost every sport more often, and no such thing as a working-class sport could be detected in the analysis.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some reservations on the results must be accounted for. The first reservation concerns the uniformity within occupational classes. As the size of the data did not permit using a more refined classification of occupations, differences within different occupational classes could not be studied.</p>
<p>The second reservation concerns the use of quantitative data. In the survey we only asked questions on whether sport is being practiced and which sport. Questions, such as how often or how intensely the Finns engage in sports, remain unanswered. The same goes for the meaning of different sports. I agree with Carl Stempel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1012690210388456">2005</xref>, 2006) in that the question of meaning should be addressed. Thus, survey data are inevitably limited in their ability to explain personal reasons behind different sports choices or the meanings attached to different sports for that matter. Elaborate qualitative data are needed in order to study the distinctions and the meanings of different choices in the field of sports in detail.</p>
<p>Different sports should be looked at in more detail in future research – not only class differences and the meanings attached to singular sports, but also the combinations of different sports. Also the place of sport in the field of culture is an important question, and it seems that if we want to see sport as a part of culture, we should treat it as one and address the question of differences in sport aside with other realms of culture.</p>
