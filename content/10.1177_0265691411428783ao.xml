<p>In his compelling new book, J. R. McNeill asserts that over the course of two centuries historical events in the Americas shifted on tides of fevered sweat and black vomit. As disease-carrying mosquitoes colonized the Americas along with their human counterparts, they introduced malaria and yellow fever to their new environs, with dire consequences for humans and their affairs. In McNeill’s analysis, these bloodthirsty small critters, potent vectors of contagion, emerge as important historical actors, playing key roles at pivotal junctures in the history of the Greater Caribbean in which disease proved a decisive factor – and, in some cases, arguably <italic>the</italic> decisive factor – in the success or failure of colonizing ventures, imperial contests and revolutions.</p>
<p>From Suriname and French Guyana to Jamaica, Havana, and the American South, the collision of African and European microbes with the New World environment resulted in what McNeill aptly characterizes as a new ‘creole ecology’. But as these regions’ cocktail mix of contagions varied over time, the epidemiological landscapes of human populations also changed, at times giving a decided edge to one party over another based on accrued immunities and disease resistance. McNeill convincingly argues that by charting such shifts in the disease environment and the resultant differential immunities among populations, we can see more clearly how disease factored into American history.</p>
<p>Scholars have long argued that the European conquest of the Americas was unwittingly facilitated by the invisible weapon of novel diseases that devastated indigenous populations. As this severe asymmetry of immunities eventually equalized, however, Europeans lost their epidemiological dominance. Rather ironically, as McNeill points out, their wholesale transformation of the West Indian landscape speeded this process since sugar plantations and urban seaports favoured the necessary preconditions for epidemics, namely high concentrations of infected mosquitoes and vulnerable non-immune hosts. By the 1690s, yellow fever and malaria had become endemic throughout the Caribbean and the early colonial period was characterized by intense, sporadic epidemics with extremely high death rates. In the face of this scourge, concerns over disease entered into the geopolitical realm, although its causes, modes of transmission and treatments were not well understood. As local populations slowly gained a buffer of herd-immunity, epidemics settled into predictable, less virulent seasonal patterns, while still ruthlessly felling newcomers. Thereafter, however, every large European expeditionary force of non-seasoned troops dispatched to the American colonies suffered hideous mortality, as practically whole armies were scythed down in their camps.</p>
<p>In his last chapter, McNeill investigates how mosquitoes aided creole insurgents to oust imperial rule, often against seemingly insurmountable odds. During the American Revolution, for example, American regiments confronted superior British forces in the Deep South. McNeill makes the case that, but for the disabling effects of yellow fever, the British might well have tightened their hold in the South, rallied Loyalists to their side, and retained the lower colonies as a southern version of Canada. Instead, illness swept through the British army, killing many more than American bullets ever did. Fearing a calamitous erosion of his army, Cornwallis withdrew to Yorktown where he was forced to surrender. McNeill notes that since French and American troops were also falling ill, if the British had held out a little longer they might well have triumphed. In pondering this fascinating counterfactual, McNeill shows how disease played an important, if accidental, role in the American Revolution, largely overlooked by other historians. He facetiously concludes that, in fairness, Americans must count female mosquitoes among their Founding Mothers.</p>
<p>Still more compelling is the role of disease in the Haitian Revolution where throngs of ill-equipped ex-slaves faced down imperial armies. Counting on his mostly African and creole soldiers’ greater disease resistance, Touissant L’Ouverture resorted to guerrilla warfare, strategically timing his offensives to coincide with seasonal epidemics, laying low during the dry season and attacking when the rains brought him reinforcements, armies of mosquitoes who ruthlessly felled his enemies. His brilliant strategy ultimately helped secure Haitian independence. While this facet of the Haitian story is fairly well known, it has added significance when we consider it within the larger context that McNeill offers. Enslaved Africans, brought to the Caribbean precisely because of their superior immunities as compared with indigenous workers or indentured European servants, eventually parlayed their knowledge of differential immunities to achieve their freedom.</p>
<p>One of the more disconcerting questions that McNeill raises is why, knowing the risks and high costs of disease, imperial powers nevertheless insistently, pointlessly sent their armies into harm’s way. Again and again, and again, European armies were dispatched to the Caribbean where thousands of men died miserably, often within days of arriving, of fevers, agues and bloody flux. In the service of misguided imperial ambitions, McNeill concludes, they ended their days as ‘luckless virus fodder’ in a hopeless bid against the buzzing tyranny of mosquitoes.</p>
