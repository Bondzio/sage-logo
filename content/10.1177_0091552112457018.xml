<p>With the current financial crisis facing American public higher education, one is always anxious to see an analysis of what is going on and suggestions on how the crisis might be resolved. This is especially true when we realize that the four respected authors of this new volume have spent most of their professional lives thinking and reflecting on these issues. When you add to this the fact that the research underlying the volume was supported by the Lumina and Gates Foundations (it advances their access and completion agendas) and that it carries the imprint of the Harvard Education Press, we are put on notice that we should all pay attention to what these pages hold.</p>
<p>This volume contains a good summary of our current state of knowledge about financing, not just of public higher education, but of all higher education, including the private nonprofit and for-profit colleges and universities. Much of this analysis has been presented in previous writings, but it is brought together here in a concise, readable book that could serve as a supplemental text for a course in higher education finance. Books of this nature often leave out community colleges but this one does not.</p>
<p>The first two chapters are rich with data and go over some familiar ground. In them we see the standard arguments that global competition and changes in technology require a better-educated population. And, while the United States was a world leader in the past, it has fallen behind in recent years. Moreover, ethnic groups with historically low attainment rates will need to be significantly raised up if the United States is to regain its competitive edge. Clearly, the postsecondary sector faces significant challenges in meeting these needs. In all of this, the community colleges and less-selective 4-year colleges are expected to shoulder the burden of meeting the increased demand for higher education and training but are disadvantaged because they are more constrained in their ability to raise tuition and pursue external sources of revenue.</p>
<p>Chapter Three presents a historical perspective on the financing of higher education, concentrating on the period from 1945 to1980, whereas Chapter Four brings that analysis up to the present. The authors show that over this 60-year period, the dominant philosophy of finance shifted from a “no or low” tuition policy to one promoting a greater share being borne by students or their parents and direct aid in the form of grants and loans based on the grounds of both efficiency and equity . Students of higher education finance will find that the global movement toward increased cost sharing is addressed in greater detail in Johnstone and Marcucci’s, <italic>Financing Higher Education Worldwide</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091552112457018">2010</xref>), whereas the struggle to find the right balance between revenue-generating activities and academic missions (a topic not covered in the book under review here) has been skillfully explicated in Weisbrod, Ballou, and Asch’s, <italic>Mission and Money</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091552112457018">2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The first four chapters of Zumeta et al. set the stage for a more detailed discussion of policy issues surrounding the physical, fiscal, political, and motivational challenges confronting the financial future of higher education in the United States. Throughout, the emphasis is on broad recommendations directed at creating incentives to achieve specific goals.</p>
<p>Chapter Five, written with the assistance of William Doyle, highlights the diversity in states systems and financing policies and identifies the key levers available to improve performance. A useful typology for grouping states with common problems is presented. Chapter Six focuses on the educational capacity of the U.S. system of higher education to deal with the challenges ahead. The authors find that the present system of financing creates perverse incentives and is not up to dealing with these challenges. This leads to the final chapter, which highlights the changes in federal and state policies that the authors feel are necessary to increase the percentage of the population with a college degree and achieve greater equity. Here are some of the key recommendations with respect to undergraduate education:</p>
<list id="list1-0091552112457018" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>“Convene a presidential commission along the lines of the Truman Commission” to increase public awareness of the problem and to involve policy makers in its solutions (p.164).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Link Pell grants to the Consumer Price Index and promote legislation to provide modest increases in the borrowing limits for student loans linked to reasonable targets for annual tuition increases.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Provide an incentive for increases in state need-based aid by reestablishing a program (along the lines of the Department of Education’s Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership program) that provides federal matching funds.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Link student loan repayments to graduates’ incomes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Provide greater oversight of the for-profit sector and expanded state aid for the private nonprofit sector where it is cost effective.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Establish state-wide goals for degree attainment, assess them annually, and link them to the state budget process.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Provide an early guarantee for financial aid as an incentive for needy students to prepare for college.</p></list-item> <list-item><p>Increase tuition at a gradual, moderate, and predictable rate, but require that state need-based financial aid expand as well. Increase aid for part-time students.</p></list-item> <list-item><p>Provide bonuses to colleges for enrolling and graduating low-income students and improving transfer rates.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Promote ideas and incentives to increase productivity, resist mission creep (the community college baccalaureate is mentioned), and hold down college costs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Promote better systems for tracking students and for measuring program quality and learning outcomes.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>My abbreviated list does not capture the rich policy discussion in the book. With respect to financing at the community college level, however, the volume is still a bit disappointing. At one point the authors question the ability of the community college to increase its degree productivity with the current level of funding, but they offer no special solutions to remedy this problem. The book avoids bold statements about lowering the cost and price of a college education and seems to accept the fact that costs and tuition will increase overtime. At the same time Zumeta et al. argue that an increasing proportion of public subsidies should be directed to the student rather than the institution.</p>
<p>Although the authors must feel that the policies outlined will benefit community college students, one gets the feeling that most of the arguments are directed at the 4-year sector. The high tuition-high aid policy seems to apply to the community college (California’s low tuition is mentioned) but one wonders if Breneman has changed his mind about the mix of revenues and missions suggested in his seminal work on community college finance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091552112457018">Breneman &amp; Nelson, 1981</xref>). If the community college has such a strong role to play in meeting national access and completion goals, it may require a financing model that differs substantially from that of the 4-year sector. But that will have to wait for another volume. Until that time, readers of this journal will not be disappointed with this excellent work on American higher education finance.</p>
