<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The purpose of this study is to investigate the association of impaired sleep quality and daytime sleepiness on self-reported diabetes control and psychological and social factors that affect diabetes self-management.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0145721712467683">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Participants were 107 adults with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) with self-reported daytime sleepiness. Subjective sleepiness was assessed using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS); sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) Global score and its 3 factors of Perceived Sleep Quality, Sleep Efficiency, and Daily Disturbances. The Diabetes Care Profile (DCP) scales (Control Problems, Social and Personal Factors, Positive Attitude, Negative Attitude, Self-Care Adherence, and Diet Adherence) were used to measure difficulty in maintaining glycemic control and factors important for diabetes control.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0145721712467683">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Poor sleep quality was associated with significantly worse scores on the DCP scales, with lower diabetes control, negative attitude, decreased positive attitude, lower self-care adherence, and decreased adherence to dietary adherence. Hierarchal linear regression modeling revealed no significant associations between diabetes control problems and age, education, gender, and daytime sleepiness. Being married or partnered significantly decreased glycemic control problems, whereas poor sleep quality increased diabetes control problems. Further examination of PSQI factors (perceived sleep quality, sleep efficiency, and daily disturbances) found that being married or partnered significantly decreased diabetes control problems, whereas of the 3 factors of the PSQI, only the Daily Disturbances factor was significantly associated with increased diabetes control problems.</p>

<body>
<p>An estimated 25.8 million people in the United States have diabetes, with approximately 90% to 95% of the diagnosed cases being type 2 diabetes (T2DM).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721712467683">1</xref></sup> Partially driven by the increased prevalence of obesity and sedentary lifestyle, T2DM has reached epidemic proportions in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721712467683">2</xref></sup> There has been an increased awareness that sleep disorders frequently coexist with diabetes; a report from the International Diabetes Federation Taskforce on Epidemiology and Prevention suggests that all patients with diabetes be evaluated for sleep apnea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721712467683">3</xref></sup> Although the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in middle-aged men and women without diabetes is approximately 4% and 2%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721712467683">4</xref></sup> respectively, the prevalence of OSA among adults with T2DM is estimated to range from 40% to 86%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721712467683">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712467683"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721712467683">7</xref></sup> The risk of comorbid insomnia and restless leg syndrome is also increased in individuals with T2DM,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721712467683">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721712467683"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712467683">10</xref></sup> and previous studies have provided evidence that sleep disorders such as OSA and short sleep duration have a negative effect on glycemic control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721712467683">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721712467683"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721712467683"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721712467683">14</xref></sup> Punjabi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721712467683">12</xref></sup> conducted a systematic review of 24 studies that examined sleep apnea syndrome and impaired glycemic control (insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, diabetes, or metabolic diseases). The conclusion from the collective outcomes was that disrupted nighttime sleep is associated with worse glycemic control.</p>
<p>Although medical management of diabetes is crucial for glucose control, the majority of the management is performed by the individual in their homes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721712467683">15</xref></sup> Diabetes education and behavioral interventions are effective in improving outcomes. Results of a meta-analysis of 18 randomized controlled trials (N = 2720, mean age = 57) that used education and counseling interventions aimed at improving diabetes self-management found that glycosylated hemoglobin was reduced by a mean of 0.43% in the intervention groups (95% confidence interval, −0.71 to −0.15).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721712467683">16</xref></sup> However, there is a lack of information on the effect of impaired sleep quality and daytime sleepiness on compliance with activities required for optimal self-management of T2DM.</p>
<p>The goal of diabetes self-management, as recommended by the American Association of Diabetes Educators, is to empower individuals with the knowledge, skills, and attitude required to effectively problem solve and be successful in their self-management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721712467683">15</xref></sup> Results of a qualitative study found that excessive daytime sleepiness was identified as problematic by respondents with T2DM because it affected their energy and motivation to effectively manage their chronic condition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721712467683">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>It remains unclear whether it is impaired sleep quality or daytime sleepiness that acts as a barrier to effective diabetes self-management. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between perceived sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness on self-reported diabetes control as well as psychological and social factors that affect diabetes self-management in adults with T2DM.</p>
<sec id="section5-0145721712467683" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This descriptive correlation study is a secondary analysis; it used existing, previously unanalyzed data from participants who were evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study (Obstructive Sleep Apnea, Sleepiness, and Activity in Diabetes Management [OSAD]). The OSAD study examined whether participants with T2DM and OSA, treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), had increased physical activity and improved glycemic control compared with the participants with type 2 and OSA subjects who were on a placebo device (sham-CPAP). Description of the CPAP and sham-CPAP devices used in the OSAD study and evaluation of success of the study in blinding participants’ to group assignment are presented elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721712467683">18</xref></sup> The data presented here are from the sample (N = 107) that was evaluated at baseline for potential participation in the randomized trial.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section7-0145721712467683">
<title>Demographic and clinical variables</title>
<p>Sociodemographic information (gender, race, marital status, education) was obtained from participants with an instrument developed at the University of Pittsburgh School of Nursing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721712467683">19</xref></sup> During a clinical evaluation at the Neuroscience Clinical and Translational Research, subjects’ standing height without shoes and weight in light street clothes were measured in order to calculate body mass index (BMI, kg/m<sup>2</sup>). An A1C measure was obtained to determine global glucose control over the last 3 months.</p>

<sec id="section8-0145721712467683">
<title>Sleep quality</title>
<p>Good sleep quality is conceptualized as falling asleep quickly, having adequate sleep duration without disruptions, feeling refreshed on awaking, and being alert during the daytime. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721712467683">20</xref></sup> is a 19-item validated questionnaire that differentiates between “good” and “poor” sleepers. The Global PSQI score is obtained from component scores on subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. Answers are scored on a 0 to 3 scale, with 3 representing the negative extreme on the Likert scale. Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality; a PSQI Global score of greater than 5 indicates a poor sleeper. The PSQI has a reported Cronbach’s α of .83<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721712467683">20</xref></sup>; the Cronbach’s α for the current sample is .69. A 3-factor scoring model for the PSQI (Sleep Efficiency, Perceived Sleep Quality, and Daily Disturbances) was described by Cole et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721712467683">21</xref></sup> and tested in samples of young adults,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721712467683">22</xref></sup> older adults,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721712467683">21</xref></sup> renal transplant patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721712467683">23</xref></sup> and patients with chronic fatigue syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145721712467683">24</xref></sup> The 3-factor PSQI showed a better fit to data than the original single-factor model; norms have not yet been suggested for the factors. Sleep Efficiency is calculated from PSQI questions on sleep duration and sleep efficiency; Perceived Sleep Quality is calculated from the PSQI questions on subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, and use of sleeping medications. The factor Daily Disturbances is calculated from the PSQI questions concerning the frequency of sleep disturbances and daytime dysfunction (trouble staying awake and problems maintaining enthusiasm).</p>

<sec id="section9-0145721712467683">
<title>Daytime sleepiness</title>
<p>Subjective daytime sleepiness is conceptualized as the self-reported tendency to fall asleep unintentionally or increased difficulty in staying awake. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145721712467683">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145721712467683">26</xref></sup> is an 8-item scale that asks respondents to rate their likelihood of falling asleep in 8 situations. The ESS uses a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 <italic>would never doze</italic> to 3 <italic>high chance of dozing</italic>; it is a validated single-factor research tool with test–retest reliability (<italic>r</italic> = 0.82) and internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = .88).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145721712467683">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0145721712467683"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0145721712467683"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0145721712467683">29</xref></sup> The ESS had a Cronbach’s α = .76 in the sample. The ESS is sensitive (93.5%) and specific (100%) at a cut point of greater than 10 for distinguishing normal from pathological sleepiness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145721712467683">30</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section10-0145721712467683">
<title>Factors associated with diabetes management</title>
<p>The Diabetes Care Profile (DCP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145721712467683">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0145721712467683">32</xref></sup> is a validated instrument that asks whether the individual had previous diabetes education, and it contains individual scales that measure self-reported diabetes control and the psychological and social factors associated with management of diabetes (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145721712467683">Table 1</xref> for descriptions and Cronbach’s α of DCP scales). The DCP scales use a 1 to 5 Likert-type scale to evaluate the frequency of symptoms. The DCP scales that measure Control Problems, Social and Personal Factors, and Negative Attitude are scored with 1 = <italic>good</italic> and 5 = <italic>poor</italic>; the DCP scales that measure Positive Attitude, Self-Care Adherence, and Diet Adherence are scored with 5 = <italic>good</italic> and 1 = <italic>poor</italic>. The DCP was evaluated among patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and is a valid instrument to use in both white and African-American patients with diabetes. DCP scales are calculated by summing the scale questions and dividing by the number of nonmissing items. Missing items and “don’t know” are not used in the calculations. If 50% of the items of a scale were missing, the scale was considered as missing. The question concerning the frequency of ketones in the urine was not included in the Control Problems scale because 72% (n = 67) of participant reported they “don’t test.” Internal validity was demonstrated in the DCP scales with Cronbach’s α ranging from .70 (Self-Care Adherence) to .87 (Diet Adherence).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0145721712467683">32</xref></sup> In the sample, Cronbach’s α for the scales ranged from .68 (Self-Care Adherence) to .89 (Control Problems).</p>

<title>Study Sample and Setting</title>
<p>A sample of community-dwelling persons with T2DM and daytime sleepiness were recruited for the study. Methods used for recruitment included posting fliers on hospital bulletin boards and in the community (bus stops and restaurants) and placing advertisements in community newspapers. Because the racial and ethnic demographic of Pittsburgh is primarily Caucasian, a special effort was made to advertise in the neighborhoods with a high prevalence of minority residents.</p>
<p>Inclusion criteria for participants were self-identified T2DM, age 30 years or older, subjectively sleepy (ESS ≥10 on telephone screening), ambulatory, and able to read and speak English. Exclusion criteria included type 1 or gestational diabetes, prescribed insulin, use of hypnotic or alerting medications, prior treatment for OSA with CPAP or surgery, history of a near-miss or automobile accident or employed in a safety sensitive occupation, currently working night or rotating shifts, routine consumption of excessive alcohol, recent medical and psychiatric hospitalization, and pregnancy. Type 2 diabetic status was confirmed either by a note from the participant’s primary care provider or by the participant showing a bottle of his or her diabetes medication. The study was approved by the institutional review board at the University of Pittsburgh. Informed consent was obtained prior to any data collection. All evaluations were conducted at the Neuroscience Clinical and Translational Research Center at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0145721712467683">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Questionnaires were checked for missing values and outliers; data were scanned into the Oracle database (Oracle Inc, Redwood Shores, California). Analysis was performed with IBM SPSS version 19 software (Armonk, New York). Descriptive statistics, including frequencies and percentages for categorical variables and means and standard deviations for interval and ratio level data, were computed. Inferential statistics performed included Student’s <italic>t</italic> test for continuous variables, chi-square test of independence for categorical variables, and Spearman’s rank-order correlations (<italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub>) for associations.</p>
<p>Hierarchal linear regression modeling was used to determine the contribution of sleep quality (PSQI Global score) and daytime sleepiness (ESS) on the dependent variable, DCP Control Problems, while simultaneously controlling for gender, education level (more than or less than high school education), and being married or partnered. A second hierarchal linear regression model was estimated that substituted the 3 factors of PSQI for the Global PSQI score to determine the contribution of factors that comprise sleep quality (Sleep Efficiency, Perceived Sleep Quality, and Daily Disturbances) and daytime sleepiness (ESS) on the dependent variable, DCP Control Problems, while simultaneously controlling for gender, education level (more than or less than high school education), and being married or partnered. All statistical tests were 2-sided with the level of statistical significance set at .05.</p>

Participants ranged in age from 31 to 82 years; 80% of the sample were at least 45 years of age (median age = 52 years). Women and minorities were well represented in the sample: 58% were female with a diverse range of racial composition (47% Caucasian; 53% minority [41% African-American; 2% Asian; and 10% biracial African American/Native American]). Although the BMI ranged from 23 to 51 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (mean 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), the majority were overweight (20%; BMI 25-29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) or obese (75%; ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Fifty percent of the sample had suboptimal (A1C ≥ 7.0%) glucose control (mean A1C = 7.33 SD = 1.5, range, 5.1-12.8), and 12.5% (n = 13) had A1C levels 9.0% or greater. Less than half (42%) of the sample were in a married or partnered relationship; the majority (59%) had some post–high school education, and almost 20% had a bachelor’s degree or higher. Most of the participants (69%) indicated that they had previously received diabetes education. There was, however, no information on the format of the education or how long ago it occurred.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, because of the inclusion criteria, almost all the participants had poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness. Almost 75% (n = 78) of the participants had ESS 10 or greater (range, 4-22) and few subjects (n = 15, 14.3%) had good sleep quality (PSQI <underline>&lt;</underline> 5). Although the mean time in bed was almost 7½ hours, the average time awake after sleep onset was approximately 45 minutes. Although the mean sleep efficiency was 89% (range, 22%-100%), approximately one-fourth of the sample had less than 85% sleep efficiency.</p>

<title>Impaired Sleep Quality, Excessive Sleepiness, and Diabetes Control</title>
<p>In this sample, ESS scores were not significantly associated with PSQI Global scores or with PSQI Perceived Sleep Quality or Sleep Efficiency. ESS scores were significantly associated with Daily Disturbances (<italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.272, <italic>P</italic> = .005). Diabetes self-management was negatively affected by poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0145721712467683">Table 3</xref>). Control Problems were correlated with increased sleepiness (ESS: <italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.239, <italic>P</italic> = .026), poor sleep quality (PSQI: <italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.325, <italic>P</italic> = .004), and younger age (<italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = −0.325, <italic>P</italic> = .002). ESS scores were not significantly associated with any other DCP scores. Global PSQI scores were significantly (all <italic>P</italic> values &lt; .05) associated with lower Self-Care Adherence scores (<italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = −0.214), Positive Attitude scores (<italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = −0.291), and Diet Adherence scores (<italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = −0.209); Global PSQI scores were positively associated with Negative Attitude scores (<italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.193) and Control Problems (<italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.339). In addition, the PSQI Sleep Efficiency factor was significantly associated with the Control Problems scale but none of the other DCP scales. Perceived Sleep Quality and Daily Disturbances had stronger associations on more of the DCP scales than the Global PSQI score. This suggests that examining sleep quality using the PSQI 3-factor model improves our understanding of the relationship between impaired sleep quality and psychological and social factors required for optimal diabetes self-management.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study explored the association between social and psychological factors related to diabetes self-management, sleep quality, and daytime sleepiness among participants with T2DM. Although previous studies have evaluated the association of sleep disorders directly on glucose control, this study is, to the authors’ knowledge, the first that has examined the association of impaired sleep on diabetes self-management. The results suggest that impaired nighttime sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness are associated with multiple aspects of reduced self-management in adults with T2DM. Although associations cannot demonstrate causality, the low to moderate strength of the correlations suggests that improving sleep hygiene is an intervention component that may lead to improved outcomes for assisting patients with diabetes to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>Results of the PSQI 3-factor model suggest that certain aspects of the global concept “sleep quality” may affect self-management of diabetes more than other factors; it may be more useful in understanding the effect of impaired sleep on management of chronic illness. For example, the PSQI factor Sleep Efficiency had little association with the DCP scales, whereas the PSQI factors Sleep Quality and Daily Disturbances had stronger associations with DCP scales than the Global PSQI score. In addition, the PSQI Daily Disturbances factor was the best predictor of impaired sleep quality on diabetes control. These results, along with the results of previous studies of the 3-factor model of the PSQI,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721712467683">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721712467683"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721712467683"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145721712467683">24</xref></sup> suggest that the 3-factor model is appropriate when used in addition to the original validated one-factor model of the PSQI.</p>
<p>Previous studies have examined quality of life in persons with diabetes. Results of a study of older adults with diabetes found that increased sleep problems contributed significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) to lower health-related quality of life when subjects were compared with healthy controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0145721712467683">33</xref></sup> These findings are similar to a previous study in which Luyster and Dunbar-Jacob<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0145721712467683">34</xref></sup> found sleep quality to be significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .008) in predicting diabetes-related quality of life when controlling for age, number of comorbidities, number of diabetic complications, and depression. Type 2 diabetes is a chronic illness that requires daily management that is the responsibility of the patient. The results of the study suggest that poor sleep quality and daytime sleepiness negatively affect multiple psychological and social factors required for optimal diabetes self-management.</p>
<sec id="section17-0145721712467683">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The study had limitations that should be noted. First, the cross-sectional design of this secondary analysis precludes us from attributing causality in the associations evaluated. Because this was an analysis from a pilot study, the sample size of 107 was not determined a priori for the correlational and regression analyses reported here. The sample was not fully representative of individuals with T2DM. The results of this study are limited because of the exclusion of persons with T2DM who were not sleepy, were not prescribed insulin, were nonambulatory, or otherwise did not meet the inclusion criteria. Finally, there was no objective assessment of sleep. Because of this, the prevalence of OSA, insomnia, and other sleep disorders could not be determined. However, this study is significant in its finding that impaired sleep quality is associated with factors important for successful diabetes self-management. Use of the 3-factor model suggests that future study on the effect of specific aspects of impaired sleep on daytime outcomes may add to the understanding of this relationship.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In summary, poor sleep quality and daytime sleepiness are symptoms that accompany many sleep disorders that are often prevalent among persons with T2DM. Poor sleep quality and daytime sleepiness were associated with difficulty with multiple aspects of self-care such as decreased mood, not feeling competent in managing their diabetes, increased control problems, decreased confidence in self-care efficacy, and reduced adherence to self-management behaviors. In the future, diabetes educators may need to consider validated instruments such as the PSQI screen for poor sleep quality and the ESS to screen for excessive daytime sleepiness, particularly in patients who are having difficulty with self-management. An implication of this research is that an active approach to evaluation and referral for treatment of possible sleep disorders is appropriate in patients with T2DM. Further research is warranted as to whether treatment of specific sleep disorders improves daytime function and the ability to integrate self-management in patients with T2DM.</p>
