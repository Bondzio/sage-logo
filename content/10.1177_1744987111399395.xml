<p>This very useful paper adds helpful insights to the agenda that surrounds clinical academic career development for nurses and allied health professionals. I welcome its publication as it offers some good descriptions of the systemic challenges facing non-medical health professionals who wish to advance research-based practice and competence.</p>
<p>It can be argued, as this paper indeed does, that the necessary architecture is now in place to support career pathways for clinician researchers but the subtle difficulties experienced by those wishing to support the next generation of researchers are multiple and they are well described here. There are also telling and original insights offered from this work into the differences within and between the academic institutions.</p>
<p>The study strongly echoes background consultation work that informed the UKCRC document ‘Developing the best research professionals’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987111399395">United Kingdom Clinical Research Collaboration, 2007</xref>). During 2006–2007 I had the privilege of providing research support to the consultation that shaped and informed the final document and during that consultation period, while my research team and I were analysing the views of the professions, people who provide services and service leaders, the themes described here were beginning to emerge from those consultations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987111399395">Jackson and Butterworth, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>This study offers a further, and more detailed description of the landscape into which research policy has to be translated into practice, which is always challenging to clinicians and educators. What is clear from this work is that it is likely that significant numbers of educators who will become the culture carriers for the next generation recognise and have suffered from competing (and often confusing) demands on their time, and they know only too well the barriers that the new generation of clinician researchers face. To carry forward the possibilities offered by a new research career landscape will require some dogged determination for the respondents to this study.</p>
<p>There are lessons from history. This paper is presented during the Centenary celebration year of Florence Nightingale. Often in the face of opposition, the determination she demonstrated in providing data that attested to poor health was critical to changes in care for army personnel. Succeeding generations of health professionals have worked to introduce significant changes to the delivery of services, the education of the professions and now the implementation of a research-based culture in clinical work. While the barriers that are highlighted in this study are significant they are not insurmountable.</p>
<p>The next generation of clinician researchers will look on us kindly if we can take advantage of the possible, they will be disappointed if we succumb to the pressures to sustain the status quo. This work will help us to take some next small steps on a long journey.</p>
