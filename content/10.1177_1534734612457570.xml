<abstract>
<p>Dermatological problems in diabetes might play an important role in the spontaneous ulcers and impaired wound healing that are seen in diabetic patients. Investigation of the cause of diabetic skin disorders is critical for identifying effective treatment. The abdominal full-thickness skin tissues of 33 patients (14 nondiabetic and 19 diabetic) were analyzed. The cell viability and malondialdehyde (MDA) production of fibroblasts were measured after advanced glycosylation end product (AGE)–bovine serum albumin (BSA) exposure. Cutaneous histological observation showed reduced thickness of the diabetic abdominal dermis with morphological characteristics of obscured multilayer epithelium and shortened, thinned, and disorganized collagen fibrils with focal chronic inflammatory cell infiltration when compared with controls of the same age. Accumulation of AGEs in diabetic skin was prominent. Less hydroxyproline, higher myeloperoxidase activity, and increased MDA content were detected in diabetic skin. In vitro, the time- and dose-dependent inhibitory effects of AGE-BSA on fibroblast viability as well as the fact that AGE-BSA could promote MDA production of fibroblasts were shown. It is shown that the accumulation of AGEs in diabetic skin tissue induces an oxidative damage of fibroblasts and acts as an important contributor to the thinner diabetic abdominal dermis. The authors believe that diabetic cutaneous properties at baseline may increase the susceptibility to injury, and diabetic wounds possess atypical origin in the repair process.</p>

<body>
<p>Diabetes mellitus is a highly prevalent disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734612457570">1</xref></sup> Those with diabetes often develop foot ulceration and experience a delayed wound healing process. These pathologies are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and health expenditure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734612457570">2</xref></sup> Many studies have focused on diabetic angiopathy, neuropathy, and immunodeficiency, but the problem of impaired healing in diabetes is still not fully understood.</p>
<p>In this study, we focused on 1 potential contributor toward the diabetic wound. Skin acts as the ﬁrst line of biological barrier in protecting the body from external mechanical trauma. A common clinical observation in diabetic patients is that the skin becomes thinner. Diabetic skin complications are common in diabetes, and approximately 30% of patients will develop skin disorders during their lifetime.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734612457570">3</xref></sup> This altered skin morphology might play an important role in the spontaneous ulcers and impaired wound healing that develop in diabetic patients. Thus, investigation of the cause of diabetic skin disorders is critical for identifying effective treatment.</p>
<p>Persistent hyperglycemia contributes to the progression of diabetic pathological complications. These include direct effects of elevated glucose on cells, hyperosmolality, oxidant stress, and nonenzymatic glycosylation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734612457570">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534734612457570">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534734612457570">5</xref></sup> Advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs) are formed by the nonenzymatic reaction of reducing sugars with amino groups of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. AGE generation is accelerated in pathological conditions characterized by hyperglycemia and/or oxidative stress and is known to contribute to pathologies associated with long-term complications of diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734612457570">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612457570">6</xref></sup> The slow turnover rate of macromolecular collagen in Extracellular Matrix (ECM), which are found richly in the skin, is particularly susceptible to AGE accumulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734612457570">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534734612457570">8</xref></sup> And the extent of glycation of skin collagen is correlated with the severity of diabetic complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534734612457570">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this study, the accumulation of AGEs in the diabetic skin and its possible role in diabetic skin disorders was investigated. Our results may contribute to an understanding of the molecular basis of dermatological problems in diabetes</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Skin biopsies were performed on residual full-thickness skin grafts from the abdominal skin of 19 patients with type 2 diabetes (mean age 59.0 ± 8.2 years, mean HbA1c, 8.4% ± 0.6%, and duration of diabetes 2-15 years) and 14 nondiabetic patients (mean age 56.6 ± 11.0 years) who were admitted to the Department of Burns and Plastic Surgery of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University in China for plastic and reconstructive operations. Diabetes was deﬁned according to World Health Organization criteria, This study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki Principles. Informed consent was obtained directly from each patient. Each skin sample was divided into 2 parts. One was immediately frozen and stored at −80°C. Another part was fixed in buffered paraformaldehyde (4%) for 16 hours, followed by paraffin embedding and generation of 5-µm thick sections using a microtome (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1534734612457570">
<title>Histomorphological Observations</title>
<p>Certain sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for cutaneous histomorphological observation and thickness calculation. The epidermal thickness was measured using a micrometer under a microscope(Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany) at 40× objective magnification, and the dermal thickness was measured at 25× objective magnification. Each sample was measured at 4 points with 40-µm intervals. The mean value of 4 measurements was recorded as the epidermal/dermal thickness of the sample.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534734612457570">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534734612457570">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Sirius red staining was used for the histological visualization of collagen in skin. Slides were stained with celestine blue B for nuclear staining and treated with 0.1% sirius red F3BA (Sigma-Aldrich-Fluka Chemicals, St Louis) in a saturated solution of picric acid. The sections were examined by polarization microscopy (Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany).</p>
<sec id="section4-1534734612457570">
<title>Measurement of AGEs in skin tissue</title>
<p>The accumulation of AGEs in the local skin tissue was observed using the immunohistochemistry method with anti-AGE monoclonal antibody (1:100, Trans Genic Inc, Kumamoto, Japan) and UltraSensitive TM SP-Kit (Maxin Bio Co, Fuzhou, China). Observation of the slides was performed by a blinded observer and imaged using a Zeiss microscope (Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany) and an attached Sony video camera (Sony Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).</p>
<p>The content of AGEs was determined by the autofluoroimmunoassay method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534734612457570">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534734612457570">13</xref></sup> Briefly, each frozen skin sample from the abdominal skin in both the control and diabetic groups was weighed, finely minced in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and centrifuged at 1500<italic>g</italic> for 10 minutes. The pellet was washed with distilled water, and the lipids were extracted with chloroform methanol overnight. After rehydration by methanol, the pellet was washed twice with methanol, 3 times with distilled water, and twice with 0.02 M HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> (buffer H) and stored overnight at 4°C in buffer H. Then the buffer was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 3.5 mL of buffer H containing 1200 units of collagenase. Digestion was carried out for 48 h at 37°C. A blank containing collagenase in buffer H was included. The digest was centrifuged at 1500<italic>g</italic> for 30 minutes, and the clear supernatant containing digested collagen was used for assays of fluorescence and hydroxyproline content. Fluorescence was measured against distilled water at 440 nm on excitation at 370 nm and was corrected for collagenase blank. The hydroxyproline content was analyzed using the hydroxyproline detecting kit (Jian-Cheng Biological Engineering Institute, Nan Jing, China). The results of AGE content were expressed as units per milligram hydroxyproline.</p>

<sec id="section6-1534734612457570">
<title>Measurement of myeloperoxidase (MPO) in skin tissue</title>
<p>Samples of skin tissue weighing from 0.2 to 0.5 g were homogenized in 10 volumes of potassium phosphate buffer (20 mM K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, pH 6.0) using a homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments, Inc, Westbury, NY). The homogenate was centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was then rehomogenized with an equivalent volume of 50 mM K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> containing 0.5% (wt/vol) hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO). One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of MPO that causes a change in absorbance of 1.0/minute at 460 nm and 37°C. Results were expressed as unit per gram tissue.</p>

<title>Preparation of AGE-Modified Proteins In Vitro</title>
<p>AGEs in vitro were prepared and assessed according to the methods previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534734612457570">14</xref></sup> Bovine serum albumin (BSA; 1 mM, Sigma Chemical Co, St. Louis, MO) was preincubated with 1 M glucose under aerobic conditions at 37°C for 10 weeks in sterile PBS containing 0.1 mg/mL pepstatin, 0.5 mg/mL leupeptin, 2 mg/mL aprotinin, 1.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM NaN<sub>3</sub>. The unincorporated glucose was removed by dialysis against PBS (24 h, twice). Control BSA for comparison with AGE-BSA treatments was prepared with simultaneous incubations under the same conditions without the addition of sugar. The extent of advanced glycation was assessed by fluorescence (excitation 370, emission 440 nm). AGE-BSA showed an approximately 8-fold increase in fluorescence compared with controls.</p>

<title>Cell Culture and Treatment</title>
<p>Fibroblasts were isolated and cultured as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534734612457570">15</xref></sup> and used up to the tenth passage. Fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (DMEM, Grand Island, NY) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Grand Island, NY), devoid of any antibiotic or antimycotic agents.</p>
<p>Fibroblasts were trypsinized and seeded in 96-well plates (approximately 5 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells/well) for cell viability assay and in 6-well plates (1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/well) for MDA assay at 37°C with 50 mL/L CO<sub>2</sub>. Then, 24 hours later, cells in 96-well plates were treated with AGE-BSA or control BSA at concentrations of 0, 50, 100, 200, and 300 µg/mL for periods of 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours. Fibroblasts in 6-well plates were treated with AGE-BSA or control BSA at concentrations of 0, 100, 200, and 300 µg/mL for periods of 24 and 48 hours, and the culture supernatants were collected for MDA assay. MDA content was determined as mentioned above.</p>
<p>The cell viability was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethyiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The MTT solution (0.5 mg/mL, final concentration; Sigma Chemical Co, St. Louis, MO) was added to each well at a certain time point; the cells were further incubated at 37°C for 4 hours. After the supernatant was discarded, dimethylsulfoxide was added to dissolve the blue insoluble MTT formazan produced by mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase. The plates were shaken until the crystals dissolved. Reduced MTT was measured spectrophotometrically at 570 nm. The percentage of viable cells was calculated as the relative ratio of their absorbances to the control. All determinations were performed in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated at least 3 times.</p>

<title>Skin Histomorphological Characteristics</title>
<p>Examination of hematoxylin and eosin–stained sections between control and diabetic groups revealed that the thicknesses of the dermal layers in the diabetic abdominal skin were significantly decreased (1.667 ± 0.201 vs 1.844 ± 0.274 mm, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). The thicknesses of the epidermis in those with diabetes were less than those in the controls (0.130 ± 0.026 vs 0.151 ± 0.034 mm, <italic>P</italic> = .06), but the difference was not statistically significant at the 95% level. The morphological characteristics of nondiabetic skin showed an intact multilayer epithelium and dermis with plentiful collagens in a woven pattern. Conversely, the epithelium of diabetic skin consisted of a disordered or deficient multilayer with fewer spinous cells. The diabetic collagen fibrils were shortened, thinned, and disorganized, with focal chronic inflammatory cell infiltration, compared with controls of the same age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534734612457570">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Sirius red staining of the skin tissue provides further information about the dermal collagen.

The control fibers showed mainly yellowish-orange to red polarization colors. The darker area related to the interstitial space and noncollagen elements of the diabetic dermal part was much more obvious when compared with the controls.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A number of factors have been regarded as indicators of predisposition to diabetic nonhealing, such as peripheral neuropathy, altered red blood cell rheology, impaired innate host response and immune mechanisms, and peripheral microvascular disease. In this study, we focused on the possible contribution of histological and pathophysiological factors in diabetic skin to the development of the nonhealing process in diabetes.</p>
<p>The main findings of this study were that the thickness of the dermal layers in the diabetic abdominal skin was reduced compared with that of controls and presented an abnormal histomorphological structure. The diabetic abdominal collagen fibrils were shortened, thinned, and disorganized compared with those of controls of the same age. Sirius red staining of the skin tissue showed that the majority of fiber in the diabetic dermis stained greenish-yellow to yellow, whereas it stained yellowish-orange to red polarization colors in controls. It indicated that the fibers in the diabetic abdominal dermis were thin and not tightly packed and well aligned. Also, the hydroxyline in diabetic abdominal skin was lower. All these results were consistent with past observations that the diabetic skin had inferior biomechanical properties at baseline.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534734612457570">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534734612457570"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534734612457570">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The increased level of MPO activity in diabetic abdominal skin tissue indicates a significantly increased number of polymorphonuclear neutrophil leukocytes in accordance with the morphological characteristics in diabetic patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534734612457570">21</xref></sup> In diabetic patients, glycation of extracellular matrix collagens may account for polymorphonuclear neutrophil leukocyte migration and production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534734612457570">22</xref></sup> MPO-mediated protein oxidation may account for selective inactivation of several enzymes, carrier proteins, and peptide mediators. The increased level of MDA, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, in diabetic skin tissues provided evidence of increased oxidative damage in diabetes. This promotes proteolytic degradation of damaged tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534734612457570">23</xref></sup> It was consistent with the collagen feature in the diabetic dermis, which manifested as shortened, thinned, and disorganized fibers with focal chronic inflammatory cell infiltration.</p>
<p>To investigate the cause of diabetic skin disorders, we detected the accumulation of AGEs in skin tissue simultaneously. The study results demonstrated that the content of AGE protein in diabetic skin tissue was significantly higher than in nondiabetic skin tissue. The pathogenic effects of AGEs include oxidant stress and tissue-specific inflammation, growth, or apoptosis. AGEs have the ability to covalently cross-link and biochemically modify protein structure and affect protein function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534734612457570">24</xref></sup> The presence of AGEs in the skin has been reported to contribute to the stiffness of the collagen fiber, loss of skin elasticity, and skin aging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534734612457570">25</xref></sup> In vitro, we showed the time- and dose-dependent inhibitory effects of AGE-BSA on fibroblast viability. Also, AGE-BSA could promote MDA production of fibroblasts. MDA is produced during the attack of free radicals on membrane lipoproteins and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Because MDA was reported to be a potent protein cross-linking agent, the role of MDA in diabetic skin was complicated, beyond an indicator of lipid peroxidation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534734612457570">26</xref></sup> Because the AGE interaction with receptor for AGEs is a potent source of superoxidative products and the latter is present on different cell types,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534734612457570">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534734612457570"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534734612457570"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534734612457570">30</xref></sup> it is reasonable to conclude that AGEs exert oxidative damage on fibroblasts. Fibroblasts are the primary sources of collagen in skin tissue and play a key role in the continued health of skin. Fibroblast senescence and apoptosis as a result of exposure to AGEs could partly explain the phenomenon of fewer cells in aged skin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534734612457570">25</xref></sup> Glycosylated modification of the matrix contributes to the imbalance of fibroblast proliferation and apoptosis in diabetic skin tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534734612457570">27</xref></sup> In this study, it is implicitly seen that the accumulation of AGEs in diabetic skin tissue induces an oxidative damage of fibroblasts and acts as an important contributor to the disorganized collagen fibers in the thinner diabetic abdominal dermis.</p>
<p>Here we showed that the thickness of the diabetic abdominal epidermis was less than that of the controls, although without statistical significance. Also, the epithelium of diabetic abdominal skin consisted of a disordered or deficient multilayer with fewer spinous cells. More sample analysis would be helpful in estimating the diabetic epidermal thickness. Previous reports have demonstrated the correlation between the diabetic epithelium thinning and diabetic peripheral neuropathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534734612457570">31</xref></sup> But our study cannot provide relevant evidence because of its limited scope.</p>
<p>The results of this study suggest that despite an intact skin condition, the unusual histological structures (thinner dermis and disorganized collagen fibers), elevated MPO activity, increased MDA content, and cutaneous environmental alteration (AGE accumulation) had already been in existence in the diabetic skin. In vitro observation indicated the possible relationship between diabetic skin disorders and the accumulation of AGEs in diabetic skin. Having identified the compromised diabetic cutaneous properties at baseline, we believe that these underlying disorders may play an important role in the increased susceptibility to injury, and diabetic wounds possess atypical origin in the repair process. Improving skin properties at baseline for diabetics has the potential to lead to a reduction in the morbidity and economic costs related to diabetes. Of course, additional investigations into and detailed analysis of diabetic skin properties and the role played by skin properties in diabetic wound healing are warranted.</p>
