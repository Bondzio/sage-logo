<abstract>
<p>In this article, the authors critically examine themes that have become associated with work and retirement in the context of demographic change. Two discourses are looked at in detail, those of ‘active’ and ‘productive’ ageing, with a focus upon International and European social policy. Drawing on the work of Foucault and others, the emergence of a dominant discourse and its effects on policy-based understandings of ageing are examined. A new orthodoxy of ageing subjectivity is identified, restricting the social contribution of older adults to work and work-like activities. A subtext refers to the co-option of liberal gerontological priorities into new and socially rigid forms of identity that legitimize particular ways of growing old. The authors conclude that a radical re-positioning, inspired by mature identity, is required to rely less upon economically determined roles and more upon alternative grounding in existential life tasks and experience to give space for a ‘mature subjectivity’ and a desirable ‘mature subject’.</p>

<title>Introduction: How work comes to rescue us from old age</title>
<p>It is often taken as a commonplace in policy circles that as an increasing number of adults live longer, the relationship between work and retirement will have to be re-engineered. The specific direction of this re-engineering hints at a deeper debate on the purpose of later life and the contribution of older citizens, and it has significant implications for the legitimacy of certain practices concerning identity and retirement. A series of academics, writing on the cusp of the 21st century, have suggested that these roles and identities had become more fluid. Formulating later life as a period of active ageing, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0018726711435180">Laslett (1989)</xref>, for example, described an emerging ‘third age’ freed from work discipline and holding the promise of enhanced personal development. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726711435180">Featherstone and Hepworth (1990)</xref> spoke of a ‘blurring’ of traditional life stages based on a historically novel access to consumer lifestyles, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018726711435180">Gilleard and Higgs (2000)</xref> expanded to address the emergence of consumer driven ‘cultures of ageing’. These observations were buoyed up by medical and social claims that: a) a ‘compression of morbidity’ was occurring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726711435180">Fries, 1980</xref>) whereby physical decline was being pushed to the final years of life; b) many problems associated with bodily ageing could be delayed or in some cases reversed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0018726711435180">Rowe and Kahn, 1987</xref>); c) the growth of occupational pensions had increased the disposable income of retired adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0018726711435180">Phillipson, 1998</xref>). The current generation of adults reaching traditional retirement age has therefore been characterized as living ‘Older, Richer, Fitter’ lives than had previously been the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0018726711435180">Metz and Underwood, 2005</xref>). However, a growing number of older adults and a ‘shrinking middle’ of the lifecourse spent in work, was slowly pushing the question of retirement to the forefront of public policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0018726711435180">Phillipson, 2002</xref>). In the USA a debate associated with the ageing of the ‘baby boomer’ cohort portrayed retirement as an increasingly problematic social phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0018726711435180">Moody, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0018726711435180">2008</xref>). The issue looked simple: there will be too few workers leading to workforce shortages, and too many older adults claiming benefits. The solution: that people should work longer into old age. Yet this change in policy from earlier to later retirement was arriving in a historical period when older adults were increasingly likely to believe that there is ‘more to life than work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018726711435180">Dowling, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018726711435180">Harkin and Huber, 2004</xref>) and to hold an expectation of an active and leisured phase of the lifecourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726711435180">Gilleard and Higgs, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The need for a critical understanding of these phenomena becomes more pressing with the emergence of an increasingly combative social commentary. Francophone writers such as Ricard (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0018726711435180">Olazabal, 2005</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018726711435180">Chauvel (2006)</xref> have criticized the current retiring generation for disproportionate cultural and economic arrogance to the disadvantage of succeeding generational groups. Kohli, the Swiss gerontologist, has argued that ‘in the 21st century, the class conflict seems to be defunct and its place taken over by the generational conflict’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0018726711435180">2005</xref>: 518). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0018726711435180">Moody (2008)</xref> has charted what he calls the ‘boomer wars’ as a recurrent polarization of discourse in North American popular literature, which is also evident in UK politics by the publishing of <italic>The Pinch: How the Baby-Boomers Took Their Children’s Future and Why They Should Give it Back</italic> by a now Government Minister (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0018726711435180">Willetts, 2010</xref>). These social discourses suggest a renewed aggression in intergenerational public relations, directed primarily against the cohort now in late-midlife.</p>
<p>Taken together, these trends evidence a tension that, as the 21st century progresses, is exercising the minds of policy-makers: how to reconcile the relationship between a cultural expectation of a more flexible and self-actualizing later life and a political and economic priority to extend working life for as long as possible. It is in this context that we approach international and European level policy formulation and see what is held in store for a reinvented retirement.</p>
<p>In order to undertake this task we draw on a number of conceptual tools arising from the work of Michel Foucault. First, we track the genealogy of a historically novel narrative on the mature lifecourse. International and European policy discourses on population ageing are used as the cues from which the evolution of a dominant interpretation of adult ageing can be traced. The second section uses governmentality and ‘the conduct of conducts’ to analyse the relationship between policy and the legitimation of restricted forms of adult identity. Finally, the concept of ‘counter-conduct’ will be used to explore forms of ‘resistance’ by individuals within the new orthodoxy and to suggest alternative possibilities for age and identity development. The resulting analysis examines the development of ‘active ageing’ as a concept and its increasing relationship with productive/work-based solutions. A subtext concerns the degree to which seemingly radical alternatives to reinvented retirement and later life have themselves become mainstreamed and lost their critical power.</p>

<title>Ageing and retirement: A genealogy of competing definitions in trans-national policy</title>
<p>While the work of Michel Foucault has exerted considerable influence over contemporary understanding of the construction and performance of identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018726711435180">Butler, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018726711435180">Gutting, 1994</xref>), the number of critical gerontologists using a Foucauldian approach is relatively limited. Katz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726711435180">1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0018726711435180">2003</xref>) has written on the formation of gerontology as a discipline, on the relationship between power and knowledge in making ageing bodies visible to the ‘medical gaze’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018726711435180">Foucault, 1973</xref>) and on the role of political and social sciences in differentiating a specifically older population with negative characteristics. Using a Foucauldian framework, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018726711435180">Biggs and Powell (2001)</xref> critiqued the legitimization of ageing identities in UK discourses on social welfare, followed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0018726711435180">Powell and Wahidin’s (2006)</xref> edited volume, attempting to bring together a variety of thinkers to consider old age from a Foucaldian perspective. Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0018726711435180">Holstein and Gubrium (2000)</xref> have drawn on Foucauldian methods to examine narrative identity in later life. Referring to governmentality, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0018726711435180">Laliberte Rudman (2006)</xref> examined ‘ideal subjectivities’ aimed at retired people in line with ‘neo-liberal political rationality’. Both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0018726711435180">Laliberte Rudman and Molke (2009)</xref> in Canada, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0018726711435180">Rozanava (2010)</xref> in the USA, have examined the role of newspaper coverage to position images of ‘successful’ and ‘productive’ ageing within neo-liberal discourse by ‘maximizing individual effort and responsibility for managing risks of disease and decline in later life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0018726711435180">Rozanova, 2010</xref>: 213). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0018726711435180">Moulaert (2010)</xref> has considered Belgian policy in this light, as an attempt to form a new ‘government of the end of the career’, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0018726711435180">Thomas (2009)</xref> analysed the professional treatment of older people in France as a form of control of the aged subject. With these notable exceptions in mind, attempts to use genealogy and governmentality to examine the role of policy in shaping the performance of adult ageing have been surprisingly rare, given the contested definition of the relationship between retirement and socio-politically acceptable ways of growing old.</p>
<p>This is not to say that key Foucauldian themes, such as power-knowledge, the creation of legitimizing discourses and governmentality have little to offer an understanding of ageing societies and the relationship between work and non-work activity in later life. Such possibilities guide us to critically discuss the new international discourse on active ageing. We further examine associated ‘mentalities of government’ that are frequently taken for granted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018726711435180">Dean, 1999</xref>); with respect to adult ageing, they reflect a change from ‘responses to isolated problems … to attempts to proscribe what it is to age well and responsibly’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018726711435180">Estes et al., 2003</xref>: 4). These authors argue that both policy makers and gerontologists themselves have largely supported this change, which suggests, from a Foucaldian perspective, an intimate relationship between the crystallization of power within policy institutions and of knowledge production within the discipline. Drawing upon Foucault makes the writer aware of her or his own immersion in a web of power-knowledge and of the creation of legitimizing meanings, which the current authors address through a conceptual dialogue between Francophone and Anglophone discourse on age.</p>
<p>‘Genealogy’ analyses how power relations exist as structured forms of knowledge and of subjectivity and serves to present techniques of discipline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018726711435180">Foucault, 1977</xref>) that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018726711435180">Foucault (1976)</xref> applied to discourses on sexuality. By tracing the emergence of a discourse over time, patterns of dominance and submersion that ultimately shape everyday experience become apparent. Foucault considered that genealogy explains subjectivity as a positive production of power (the patient for the hospital, the student for education, the worker for capitalism, the desired person in sexuality discourse) based on specific sources of truth (such as the medical and human sciences). The next section uses a genealogical approach to explore how adult ageing has been re-visioned by emerging international policies on ageing and retirement, to reflect a certain set of power relations and to legitimize a particular ageing subject. While lack of space denies a full description of the choice of citations, the authors draw upon a detailed analysis undertaken by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0018726711435180">Viriot Durandal and Moulaert (in press)</xref> that covered 23 documents within a 16-year timeframe (1994–2010). We have selected texts that explicitly mentioned ‘active ageing’ (15 out of 23) with a particular interest in those that appear to drive the debate forward. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0018726711435180">OECD, 2006</xref>) text, if not using the exact expression ‘active ageing’, is also taken into consideration, for reasons that will become clear as the analysis explains the submersion of certain discourses by others. In a subsequent section, the later Foucauldian concepts, concerning governmentality and conduct, will be used to examine critically some of the processes at play.</p>
<sec id="section3-0018726711435180">
<title>The emergence of ‘active ageing’ in international policy</title>
<p>The phrase ‘active ageing’ first arose in international policy discourse during G7/8 Summits at the very end of the 20th century, although it had had an enduring presence in the social science of gerontology since the 1920s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018726711435180">Estes et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726711435180">Katz, 1996</xref>). International discussions about population ageing occurred after a report of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0018726711435180">World Bank (1994)</xref>, <italic>Averting the Old Age Crisis</italic>, which crystallized positions of the main international players (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0018726711435180">Hicks, 2003</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0018726711435180">Walker (2009)</xref>, this report arose as part of a neo-liberal agenda introduced by two earlier reports from the OECD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0018726711435180">1988a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0018726711435180">1988b</xref>), and at that time reflected a negative vision of ageing based on the ‘burden of pensions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0018726711435180">Walker, 2009</xref>) and the need to move from public to private retirement provision.</p>
<p>In 1996, the conclusions of the Chair of the G7 Ministerial Conference on Jobs stated that:<disp-quote>
<p>We should do our best to end this waste of human resources at the very time when our societies are aging. More generally, we seek to identify policies that promote the security of ‘employability’ over individuals’ working lifetimes and facilitate job transitions. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0018726711435180">G7, 1996</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>‘Job transitions’ and ‘employability’ are identified as a means of articulating a relatively novel and unformed response to what was seen as a novel social issue. By June 1997, active ageing appears for the first time at the international level, in a background paper of the Summit, written by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0018726711435180">US Department of Health and Human Services (1997)</xref>. The paper, entitled ‘Active aging: a shift in the paradigm’, suggested a change of vision, away from seeing ageing as a time of dependency and decline. The 1997 Denver Summit, followed suit arguing for a change in approach toward adult ageing:<disp-quote>
<p>We discussed the idea of ‘active aging’ – the desire and ability of many older people to continue work or other socially productive activities well into their later years, and agreed that old stereotypes of seniors as dependent should be abandoned. We considered new evidence suggesting that disability rates among seniors have declined in some countries while recognizing the wide variation in the health of older people. We discussed how our nations can promote active aging of our older citizens with due regard to their individual choices and circumstances, including removing disincentives to labor force participation and lowering barriers to flexible and part- time employment that exist in some countries. In addition, we discussed the transition from work to retirement, life-long learning and ways to encourage volunteerism and to support family care-giving. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018726711435180">G8, 1997</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At the beginning of its international journey, active ageing is thus driven by international organizations and states, especially the OECD and the USA (expressing power through policy discourse), while according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018726711435180">Estes et al. (2003)</xref>, gerontologists (representing the production of knowledge), broadly supported that proposed direction.</p>
<p>Responding to the Summit, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0018726711435180">OECD (1998)</xref> produced a further report, defining active ageing as:<disp-quote>
<p>The capacity of people, as they grow older, to lead productive lives in the society and economy. Active ageing implies a high degree of flexibility in how individuals and families choose to spend their time over life in work, in learning, in leisure and in care-giving. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0018726711435180">OECD, 1998</xref>: 14)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Later in the report active ageing was further defined as:<disp-quote>
<p>The capacity of people to make flexible choices in the way they spend time over life – in learning, in work, in leisure and in care-giving. Active ageing reforms are those that remove undesirable constraints on lifecourse flexibility and that strengthen support to citizens. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0018726711435180">OECD, 1998</xref>: 125)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>OECD policy in the late 1990s, then, marks a shift toward a more holistic vision of participation in society. Here, active ageing has two dimensions: to be able to lead a productive life and to be free to make personal choices. According to a neo-liberal framework, choices are limited by a desire to ‘phas[e] out preferential treatment for older people in disability, unemployment insurance and other social programmes, i.e. ending their role as quasi early-retirement programmes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0018726711435180">OECD, 1998</xref>: 20), in order to make retirement actuarially neutral and more flexible, and to ensure ‘jobs for older workers’; this last point mainly focused on lifelong learning and reserved little place for stereotypes against older workers. In line with the ‘three pillar model’ of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0018726711435180">World Bank (1994)</xref> (state, occupational and private pensions), the OECD suggested a move in responsibility toward the individual.</p>
<p>The holism tacit in the notion of activity had been picked up by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the United Nations (UN). In 1995, WHO replaced its programme of ‘Health for the Elderly’ by the one on ‘Ageing and Health’ and, in 2000, this name became ‘Ageing and Life Course’. Behind these transformations, WHO wanted to promote a preventive approach throughout the lifespan aiming at ‘the highest possible quality of life for as long as possible, for the largest number of older people’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0018726711435180">WHO, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>In 1999, the United Nations’ International Year of Older Persons, WHO introduced a programme on active ageing with the motto ‘Active ageing makes the difference’. It ended with the 2002 <italic>Policy Framework</italic> that proposed a comprehensive definition of active ageing:<disp-quote>
<p>Active ageing is the process of optimizing opportunities for health, participation and security in order to enhance quality of life as people age.</p>
<p>Active ageing applies to both individuals and population groups. It allows people to realize their potential for physical, social, and mental well being throughout the life course and to participate in society according to their needs, desires and capacities, while providing them with adequate protection, security and care when they require assistance.</p>
<p>The word ‘active’ refers to continuing participation in social, economic, cultural, spiritual and civic affairs, not just the ability to be physically active or to participate in the labour force. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0018726711435180">WHO, 2002</xref>: 12)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This theme, in part reflecting a fluidity of lifestyle identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726711435180">Featherstone and Hepworth (1990)</xref>, also appears in the interdisciplinary and interagency consensus document arising from the United Nations Madrid Summit’s ‘Report of the Second World Assembly on Ageing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0018726711435180">2002</xref>):<disp-quote>
<p>The potential of older persons is a powerful basis for future development. This enables society to rely increasingly on the skills, experience and wisdom of older persons, not only to take the lead in their own betterment but also to participate actively in that of society as a whole. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0018726711435180">UN, 2002</xref>: Article 10)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It appeared that, under the rubric of ‘active ageing’ a new identity for later life had emerged and had been recognized at the highest of international levels. This new settlement held the promise of continued fluidity of lifestyle choice and a multiplicity of social contributions that could be made. Dependency and disengagement, as the defining characteristics of ageing and retirement had been excised, in line with contemporary gerontological thinking.</p>
<p>After its 1998 report, the OECD continued its mission of promoting pension and active ageing reforms by editing a thematic analysis of 21 countries. However, by 2000 the same organization concludes that active ageing ‘is far too inclusive to be a manageable theme for international monitoring and sharing of experiences’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0018726711435180">OECD, 2000</xref>: 126). The title of the synthesis report boils the argument down succinctly: <italic>Ageing and Employment Policies. Live Longer, Work Longer</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0018726711435180">OECD, 2006</xref>): because if we live longer, we should work longer than before. The WHO interpretation had been banished to areas that were marginal in terms of an international grand narrative (e.g. age-friendly urban planning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0018726711435180">WHO, 2007</xref>] or human and natural disasters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0018726711435180">WHO, 2008</xref>].</p>
<p>Thus, the period between 1994 and 2006 proved a key period in shaping the relationship between work, retirement and ageing. While 1998 marked a broader approach of active ageing for the OECD, its final document does not even use the phrase and focuses entirely on employment and what could be called a productivist version of legitimate ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018726711435180">Biggs, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018726711435180">Estes et al., 2003</xref>). Some critical gerontologists have considered this move to be a neo-liberal ‘rolling back of the state’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726711435180">Estes and Phillipson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0018726711435180">Walker and Deacon, 2003</xref>); however, we would emphasize that it does not represent an ‘absence of government’ so much as a change to the idea of ‘governing less’ and in different ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726711435180">Foucault, 2008</xref>). This point will be followed up in a later section of this article.</p>
<p>If, as has been argued elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726711435180">Biggs, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018726711435180">2004</xref>), contemporary ageing has been dominated by two central narratives, one to do with health and well-being and the other concerning productivity, then in the genealogy of international policy, it is possible to see the competitive engagement of these themes. They also mark a distinction between holistic self-development and economic instrumentalism that reflect tensions within the supposed culture of the ‘boomer cohort’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018726711435180">Harkin and Huber, 2004</xref>) to whom much of the concern is addressed. These two ideas of what ‘active ageing’ means suggest a potential conflict between a vision of the ageing subject as a retired person in his/her community, sharing a good quality of life, versus a person free to take part in the economy, which comes into sharper focus when considering national and regional policy, such as at the European level. Indeed, the European example is interesting because it exemplifies an emerging tension between competing narratives of adult ageing and various attempts at resolution.</p>

<title>European Commission’s definition: Between dreams of autonomy and policy pragmatism</title>
<p>At the European level, a general discourse framework for active ageing has been in process since at least 1999. However, as policies have been formulated, only the more restrictive productive dimension has remained.</p>
<p>We will present two quotations to explore European evolution that, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0018726711435180">Walker (1999)</xref> has pointed out, marks the attempt to transform an idea of active ageing into a working policy concept. It is perhaps unsurprising, given an interdependent relationship between research and policy development within the European Union, to see how closely the policy of European institutions (power), exemplified in the first quotation, and gerontology (knowledge) in the second, have coalesced to form a combined matrix of power-knowledge:<disp-quote>
<p>Preparing for longer, more active and better lives, working longer, retiring more gradually and seizing opportunities for active contributions after retirement are the best ways to secure the maximum degree of self-reliance and self-determination throughout old age. This is true even in the face of fading faculties and growing dependency. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018726711435180">European Commission, 1999</xref>: 22)</p>
<p>The beauty of this strategy is that it is good for everyone: from citizens of all ages as ageing individuals, in terms of maximising their potential and quality of life, through to society as a whole, by getting the best from human capital, extending community participation and solidarity, avoiding intergenerational conflicts and creating a fairer more inclusive society. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0018726711435180">Walker, 1999</xref>: 41)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>According to these citations, autonomy is a key goal of the active ageing reform. However, for the European Commission (EC), it rapidly comes in line with an economic version of active ageing, adding that its aim is to ‘modernise and improve social protection’:<disp-quote>
<p>Particular attention should be paid to the development of policies to reverse the trend towards early retirement; to explore new forms of gradual retirement; and to make pension schemes more sustainable and flexible. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018726711435180">European Commission, 1999</xref>: 17)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>According to this agenda, ‘one must then adapt social protection systems to a supply side policy, and no longer to a demand side one’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0018726711435180">Palier and Surel, 2005</xref>: 26). A focus on changing patterns of retirement brought ageing policy into the penumbra of European Employment Strategy (EES) launched in Luxembourg in 1997 and followed by the Lisbon Summit in 2000 positioning Europe ‘to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion’.</p>
<p>This shift to employment happened quickly. However, one should be conscious that other directions, more complex ones, were also in circulation. For example, the European Commission received, at an early stage, suggestions that developed a broader meaning of active ageing. Walker elaborated ‘7 keys dimensions’ for active ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0018726711435180">Walker, 1999</xref>) and later, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018726711435180">Guillemard (2005)</xref> promoted paid employment as a part of a broader cultural revolution for older workers. ‘Active ageing’ also had a family resemblance to a similar and contemporary academic debate on ‘active citizenship’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726711435180">Goul Andersen et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In 2001, Lisbon targets were consolidated at the Stockholm Council as a 50 percent employment rate by 2010 for ‘older workers’ (54–65 years), and ‘active ageing’ appeared in the ‘Employment guidelines’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0018726711435180">Jolivet, 2002</xref>). In 2002, the Barcelona Council proposed to increase the effective exit age of work to retirement by five years by 2010. In 2003, the European Commission reorganized eleven priorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018726711435180">2003a</xref>) with a deep emphasis on ‘active measures towards jobseekers and the non-active’ (first priority). In the fifth rank, we find the promotion of active ageing. However, the final version retained only ten guidelines, conflating aims to ‘increase labour supply and promote active ageing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018726711435180">European Commission, 2003b</xref>). At the moment of writing, it is still unclear whether the new strategy ‘Europe 2020’, the creation of a ‘Pilot European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018726711435180">European Commission, 2011a</xref>) and the announcement of a 2012 European Year of Active Ageing, will reopen the door for a more holistic understanding of active ageing. The following statement from the EC newsletter ‘Social Agenda’ of March 2011 indicates that a change of direction is unlikely, and still gives importance to self-responsibility:<disp-quote>
<p>We need to enable older people to make their contribution to society, to rely more on themselves and to depend less on others and for this we need to create conditions that allow people to stay active as they grow older. ‘Active Ageing’ promises to be such an approach because it seeks to help older people to: remain longer in the labour market; contribute to society as volunteers and carers; remain as autonomous as possible for longer. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018726711435180">European Commission, 2011b</xref>: 14)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In retrospect, the late 1990s and early 2000s can be seen as a time of potential invention, with the influence of leading gerontologists such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0018726711435180">Alan Walker (2009)</xref> and sociologists such as Anne-Marie Guillemard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018726711435180">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726711435180">Goul Andersen et al., 2005</xref>). It would appear from the genealogy outlined above, that European interpretations, travelling parallel to the wider international discourse, may still be in the process of playing out. However, criticism arises: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0018726711435180">Ney (2005)</xref> has argued that active ageing has been shunted into a ‘political backwater’; Walker responds with disappointment that ‘nowhere do we find the comprehensive strategy set out in the 1999 EC policy and hinted at in the 2006 one’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0018726711435180">Walker, 2009</xref>: 84); and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0018726711435180">Hamblin (2010)</xref> warns of insecurity and even poverty within older generations as flexibility turns into economic uncertainty. What a genealogical approach has demonstrated is that powerful institutional players such as the OECD, World Bank and EC have increasingly come to see active ageing as a discourse supporting economic productivity with longer working lives increasing labour force supply. A ‘holistic’ approach is accepted so far as it does not reject employment and proposes a ‘cultural revolution’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018726711435180">Guillemard, 2005</xref>) that supports this core objective. The ‘health and well-being’ narrative retreats to become the preserve of a ‘fourth age’ marked by biological decline and the consumption of aged-care. By using a genealogical approach, active ageing, as it evolved in policy terms, may be seen as the continuation of debates on population productivity rather than a specific concern about the social contribution of older citizens. What may have been considered as something new initially: the rhetorical version of active ageing, recognizing agency and autonomy in later life (as opposed to disengagement and decline), has been ‘swallowed up’ by multiple ‘cultures of ageing’ and wider interpretations of social engagement through consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018726711435180">Gilleard and Higgs, 2005</xref>); this broader view has become a means of making people more responsible for facing risks and the welfare state less so. Thus:<disp-quote>
<p>[t]he older worker needs to be ‘activated’ for the purpose of economic growth and to avoid a waste of human resources while an individualization of the responsibilities of the activated older worker is discursively promoted. S/he is expected to be employed for longer in an increasingly insecure labour market and to save for retirement in a rather insecure financial investment market, where s/he will bear the risk of any investment. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018726711435180">Carmel et al., 2007</xref>: 397)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A consequence of any move toward a more independent and active citizen would, according to this reading, also be that active ageing approaches interpret a responsibilization of risk – that is, the assumption that the individual must acknowledge and share the consequences of a longer life and the positive or negative experiences of ageing that may result – as a form of choice. In other words, as a specific subject which:<disp-quote>
<p>is not merely enabled to choose, but obliged to construe a life in terms of its choices, its powers, and its values. Individuals are expected to construe the course of their life as the outcome of such choices, and to account for their lives in terms of the reasons for those choices. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0018726711435180">Rose, 1999</xref>: 231)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In order to follow the logic of this track, we will now leave the genealogy of international narratives of active ageing and examine its effects on the emerging governmentality of retirement and later life.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section5-0018726711435180">
<title>Governmentality in the conduct of conducts and of the subject</title>
<p>Governmentality is another concept from Foucault that has been developed further in the Anglo-Saxon world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018726711435180">Burchell et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018726711435180">Donzelot, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Using governmentality implies a specific vision of power relations: ‘In effect, what defines a relationship of power is that it is a mode of action that does not act directly and immediately on others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726711435180">Foucault, 1982</xref>: 220). In order to define what government tends to do, Foucault used the term ‘conduct’ because of its equivoque, its double meaning in French, to lead and to self-regulate:<disp-quote>
<p>For to ‘conduct’ is at the same time to ‘lead’ others (according to mechanisms of coercion that are, to varying degrees, strict) and a way of behaving within a more or less open field of possibilities. The exercise of power is a ‘conduct of conducts’ and a management of possibilities. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726711435180">Foucault, 1982</xref>: 220–1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>By transferring responsibility for conduct onto the individual, states ‘govern less’ while continuing to dominate the horizons of personal development.</p>
<p>Inspired by this definition, Dean proposed a specific conception of governmentality and government: ‘Government encompasses not only how we exercise authority over others, or how we govern abstract entities such as state and populations, but how we govern ourselves’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018726711435180">Dean, 1999</xref>: 12). According to this view, we consider two levels of government: the conduct of the conducts and the conduct of the self. According to Dean, focus must be placed on how <italic>thought</italic> acts in what we are doing, on ‘mentalities of government [that] emphasize the way in which the thought involved in practices of government is collective and relatively taken for granted, i.e. not usually open to questioning by its practitioners’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018726711435180">1999</xref>: 16). In our case, these mentalities refer to the international discourses on active ageing as they engage in processes of stabilization of a dominant commonsense meaning around productivity.</p>
<p>We use this framework in two directions. First, in order to clarify the relationship between active ageing and a neoliberal approach to identity, we refer to a process of ‘responsabilization’, meaning the transfer of responsibilities from a group or society to an individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0018726711435180">Moulaert, 2010</xref>). As Lemke puts it:<disp-quote>
<p>The strategy of rendering individual subjects ‘responsible’ (and also collectives, such as families, associations, etc.) [that] entails shifting the responsibility for social risks such as illness, unemployment, poverty, and so forth, and for life in society, into the domain for which the individual is responsible and transforming it into a problem of ‘self-care.’ One key feature of the neoliberal rationality is the congruence it endeavors to achieve between a responsible and moral individual and an economic-rational individual. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0018726711435180">2002</xref>: 59)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Second, we explain how ‘conduct’ introduces ‘counter-conduct’, i.e. alternative ways of acting that are in opposition to the dominant discourse or, more precisely, the path along which subjects are conducted. In Foucault’s words, the term reflects a ‘struggle against the processes implemented for conducting others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018726711435180">2007</xref>: 201). Taking the example of counter-conducts to early forms of pastoral power, Foucault explained how the exertion of power did not use completely different strategies to what already existed, but ‘border-elements’ at the margins of church at that time (asceticism, mysticism, micro communities, return to Scripture and eschatological beliefs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018726711435180">2007</xref>: 204–15). Counter-conduct is thus a possible consequence of freedom incorporated in governmentality, just as active ageing incorporates, yet re-shapes, the new freedoms associated with a re-invented retirement.</p>
<p>Governmentality is a useful tool for analysing active ageing discourses: active ageing aims to conduct the conducts by insisting on productive lives as we age; at the same time, its discourse also impacts on the conduct of the self when it supports ‘responsibilization’ of the individuals as they are encouraged to internalize wider social risks. Further, possibilities of ‘counter-conducts’ or the existence of other ‘possibilities of organizing a consciousness of self’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726711435180">Foucault, 1989</xref>: 330), drive us beyond the critique of active ageing to suggest other dimensions than work-identity for life in old age.</p>

<title>Active ageing reborn: From a new flexibility to neo-liberal anti-ageism</title>
<p>Governmentality analysis has been particularly appreciated in the Anglo-Saxon world because of its association with Foucault’s lecture sequence critiquing neo-liberalism. In neo-liberalism, he argues, the main target of government is to ‘govern less’ (‘moindre gouvernement’). Contrary to certain gerontologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726711435180">Estes and Phillipson, 2002</xref>), he states that this principle does not lead to an absence of State (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726711435180">Foucault, 2008</xref>). On the contrary, the market is reinterpreted as a continuation, with some changes, of politics. The question is thus not simply about ‘retrenchment’ policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0018726711435180">Pierson, 2001</xref>), neither about coming back to older liberal theories encouraging ‘laissez-faire’ by limiting the State intervention. Rather, the subject is re-engineered, considered as an ‘entrepreneur, an entrepreneur of himself’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726711435180">Foucault, 2008</xref>) with a private responsibility to preserve health (à la WHO) and improve employability (à la OECD). Personal conduct thereby becomes the final location for governmental power to be exercised (as both discourses are reflected, in their different ways, in EC policy). This pragmatic project is the ‘intelligence of liberalism’ according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018726711435180">Donzelot (2005)</xref>, and is a useful way to analyse the policy turn toward active ageing.</p>
<p>Here we consider the degree to which active ageing may be read as a neoliberal solution to employment problems. Ironically, the form that this rhetoric has taken involves two major themes that have also been described in many liberal and left criticisms of old age as dependency: ageism and the culture of forced exit from the job market. Since the 1960s the unfairness of an age criterion, that excludes older workers, has been placed in the context of age discrimination and the fight for wider civil rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018726711435180">Butler, 1969</xref>); solutions have ranged from an ‘age-irrelevant society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0018726711435180">Neugarten, 1982</xref>) to job markets based on competence or motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0018726711435180">Raoult and Huyez-Levrat, 2009</xref>). Ideas of ‘age management’ or ‘age diversity management’ in employment policies and managerial practices have become a new motto (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018726711435180">Guillemard, 2007</xref>), driven in the European context by the promotion of best practices against age barriers in employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0018726711435180">Walker, 1997</xref>) and by ‘the freedom of choice as a democratic expectation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0018726711435180">Raoult and Huyez-Levrat, 2009</xref>: 48).</p>
<p>By giving priority to autonomy in the service of competition and self regulation, in the same vein as the search for an ‘active citizenship’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726711435180">Goul Andersen et al., 2005</xref>), active ageing is also considered as a particular form of conduct of conducts. This includes discussion of ‘rights and duties’, ‘obligations’ for the individual, a preference for ‘active’ rather than ‘passive’ policies in the shaping of age-identity; and economically active ageing described as autonomy, self-determination and empowerment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0018726711435180">Walker, 2009</xref>: 88).</p>
<p>No-one is supposed to escape from this holistic and comprehensive project and no aspect of life should be excluded, excepting perhaps the encroachment of physical and mental incapacity where the consumption of age-care takes over. In a sense, organizations like ‘Friends at the End’ that fight for ‘dignified death’ and support euthanasia may express the final stage of active ageing, people wishing to take control of their fate actively for themselves. Only one model is defended, the one that includes investment in human capital, the maximization of potential and active participation to legitimize social participation, which seems far from the lived experience of ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0018726711435180">Katz, 2000</xref>) or significant activities identified by older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726711435180">Clarke and Warren, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>We propose to understand the ‘beauty of this theory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0018726711435180">Walker, 1999</xref>), or the ‘intelligence of active ageing’ to paraphrase Donzelot, as colonizing all parts of life, as age itself recedes as a distinctive category and as individuals of all ages compete together for work. Shaping the field of possible actions down to employment constitutes a form of ‘blurring’ of age differences, not as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726711435180">Featherstone and Hepworth (1990)</xref> originally suggested via consumerism, but as a re-discovery of productivism. As part of this process, a liberal/left critique of the social exclusion of older men and women appears to have been transformed into neo-liberal economic conformity and becomes the mainstream commonsense of the policy world.</p>
<p>A succession of gerontologists, active in policy formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018726711435180">Estes and associates, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018726711435180">Guillemard and Jolivet, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0018726711435180">Phillipson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0018726711435180">Walker and Naegele, 1999</xref>) have looked to exclusion from work as a mechanism that disempowers older adults. This assumption, that work is somehow the solution to the problem of powerlessness in later life, arises from neo-marxist influences within critical political economy. The argument suggests that power in society is based on work, because work is the principal way that ordinary people have for interacting with the processes of production. To be engaged in work is to have some influence, however marginal, on the creation of profit. The social construction of old age, as argued since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0018726711435180">Townsend (1986)</xref>, excludes older people through compulsory retirement and thereby condemns them to poverty and institutionalization. According to this logic, continuing to work is, by contrast, anti-ageist. It re-integrates older adults into society, returning to them some social status and potential power.</p>
<p>Walker intimates as much in the following passage, which is worth quoting at length:<disp-quote>
<p>This generally negative social construction of old age and older people was reinforced by their exclusion from the political and policy-making systems of most European countries. The key development here was superannuation: the expectation that older people would leave the labor force at fixed (arbitrary) ages, exchange wages for pensions, and disengage themselves from formal economic activity. Retirement also operated as a process of social and political exclusion: older people were simultaneously detached from paid work together with the main sources of political consciousness and channels of representation. This exclusion contributed to the popular perception of older people as being politically, as well as economically, inactive. This then fed into age discriminatory stereotypes that portrayed older people as passive, acquiescent, family-oriented, and disinterested in social and political participation. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0018726711435180">Walker, 2009</xref>: 78)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Guillemard has built another, broader, argument. Using international comparison as a research tool, she analysed employment policies toward older workers and showed how countries like France, Belgium and Germany developed an institutionalized ‘early exit culture’ from work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726711435180">2003</xref>). In her early, seminal, work, Guillemard considered retirement as a ‘social death’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018726711435180">1972</xref>) and therefore concluded 30 years later that early retirement is a source of disempowerment for mature adults.</p>
<p>The problem with this view is that it has become part of a now dominant and equally restrictive discourse, equating active ageing with work itself. Work thereby becomes the technique by which individuals succumb to the conduct of conducts, and govern themselves through a tacit discourse arising, paradoxically, from neo-liberal economics. Governmentality, through ‘conduct of conducts’, becomes focused on a struggle against age-barriers to work, devaluing early exit culture and solving the problem of legitimate ‘conduct of the self’ as social engagement through the job market. The result is perhaps a new form of ageism, which requires an almost indefinite continuation of work and work-like activity as the new legitimacy for a mature identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018726711435180">Biggs, 2004</xref>). The problems with this are at least three-fold. First, the ‘third age’ of self actualization beyond work loses its own legitimacy; second, the lifecourse-specific characteristic of a long life becomes eclipsed as later life comes to consist of ‘more of the same’; and finally, age-prejudice, as traditionally conceived, loses its radical force and new forms of ageism have yet to be recognized.</p>

<title>From ‘more of the same’ to mature identity: The search for a ‘mature subject’</title>
<p>So what then of counter-conduct in later life? From a Foucauldian point of view, we have seen that governmentality acts on the ‘open field of possibilities’ through channelling the freedom of individuals. If we examine its genealogy, we should consider that ‘active ageing’ produces a specific form of subject, but that this ‘constitution of a subject … is obviously only one of the given possibilities of organizing a consciousness of self’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726711435180">Foucault, 1989</xref>: 330).</p>
<p>If Foucault is to be believed, this very act of self governance gives rise to the crystallization of ‘counter-conducts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018726711435180">Foucault, 2007</xref>), creating subjects able to be reflexive and to take distance from the conduct that government would like them to follow. Here, anti-ageism does not simply concern a public criticism of discrimination in employment and/or in everyday life. On the contrary, it operates at an individual level as a form of resistance to dominating and restricting discourses of legitimation, which nevertheless subsist against a background of dominating assumptions. Scholars, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0018726711435180">Katz (2000)</xref>, invite us to consider ‘anti-activity activity’ like sex, drinking or gambling as a way of ‘undisciplining old age’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726711435180">Katz, 1996</xref>); these areas are open spaces for exploring new avenues for the older self. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0018726711435180">Sadler and Biggs (2006)</xref> suggested that spirituality may also be another dimension for alternative self explorations. Finally, we should not forget the possibilities opened by political activism as mentioned by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0018726711435180">Vincent (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0018726711435180">Viriot Durandal (2003)</xref>.</p>
<p>While we recognize these instances of counter-conduct to ‘active ageing’ in its productive aspect, the dominance achieved by productivist discourse in international and European policy on later life, and the seeming impasse of a radical alternative, imply the need to re-think gerontological critique itself as a form of intellectual counter-conduct. The old critiques have been overtaken by a new orthodoxy, which has rendered them harmless to a newly dominant and international discourse. As such, novel positions may need to emerge from which to rediscover flexibility and critique this new rigidity that now legitimizes mature identity. If in current historical circumstances legitimate ageing centres on economic instrumentalism, then an exploration of what ageing means as an end, with its own dynamics, existential priorities and potential for social contribution, contributes to that counter-conduct. The logic here runs toward a re-discovery of age-identities and the mature subject, based on the special contradictions that emerge as existential properties, themselves rooted in lifecourse development and change, encounter active ageing as it has been narrowed down to productivism.</p>
<p>The original flexibility of mature identity, based on an active retirement, promised not just a ‘well deserved rest’ but also a new period of the lifecourse that allowed space for alternative identities to emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726711435180">Biggs, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726711435180">Gilleard and Higgs, 2007</xref>). That this may not simply be a socio-historical phenomenon, but a historical opportunity that resonated with existential issues concerning growth and development, promises an alternative to economics as the source of meaning and social location. It is not that these counter-discourses fail to exist, but rather that they arise in areas very different from the economics of demographic change, such as psychoanalysis and analytic psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726711435180">Biggs, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0018726711435180">Vickers-Willis, 2004</xref>) that in their own way place mature identity within a holistic context. Here, we would consider this general approach to the ‘mature identity’ as way of experiencing alternative constitutions of being older.</p>
<p>While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0018726711435180">Walker’s (2006)</xref> attempt at holism focuses on social justice and the business case for active ageing, his position does not engage with the question of lifecourse induced change. This leads him ultimately to concede that work and work related activities are universally valid across the lifecourse and ultimately leave little space for dissent. An implication would be that the ‘old’ (people, worker, etc.) is or should be essentially the same as the not ‘old’ (i.e. the adult working citizen). For Walker, empowerment is largely a socio-political construct, which unfortunately leaves it, in the current policy climate, reduced to economic relations. An alternative pole of attraction, identified through psychodynamic critique, would emphasize a change in the personal perception of identity. This would occur as adults re-orient away from escaping the influence of childhood and finding an adult role, toward what to do with the time they have in maturity, given the finite nature of the human lifespan. While some authors regard lifecourse change as a social construct, with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726711435180">Guillemard (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726711435180">Cavalli (2007)</xref> calling for reshaping it in line with economic trends, a counter narrative also exists. Paying greater attention to the dynamic experience of ageing and maturity, if clearly distinguished from forms of reductionism and determinism, has the power to connect empowerment with self-development in ways beyond simple economic necessity. A search for meaning in ageing inspired French social gerontologists to create the notion of ‘déprise’, which highlights an active desire to let go of existing social expectations. Contrary to disengagement theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018726711435180">Cumming and Henry, 1961</xref>), ‘déprise’ does not concern a withdrawal from all spheres of life, but inaugurates a redistribution of priorities according to an interaction between bodily, psychological and social forms of ageing. A ‘principle of economy of the strengths’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726711435180">Clément and Membrado, 2010</xref>: 118) reorganizes mature identity and adults re-balance their priorities between a letting go of certain dimensions of life and investing in others. Originally built by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018726711435180">Barthe et al. (1988)</xref>, ‘déprise’ has been discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018726711435180">Caradec (2007)</xref> who regrets its negative connotation that the French prefix ‘dé’ indicates. However, and with some links and inspiration from empowerment, he suggests thinking about ageing in terms of a ‘keeping in touch with the world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726711435180">Caradec, 2008</xref>), thanks to the help of different ‘supports’ that can include significant others and social relations, new meanings given to life, or even technologies. By giving more space to the personal process of ageing, ‘déprise’ opens the possibility for ‘counter-conducts’ <italic>within</italic> active ageing because it simultaneously denies associations with decline while challenging the meaning of activity. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018726711435180">Caradec (2007)</xref>, ‘déprise’ is significant as a view on ageing: ageing, studied from the inside, not the outside.</p>
<p>As such Caradec’s formulation has commonalities with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0018726711435180">Tornstam’s (2005)</xref> gerotranscendence and Biggs et al.’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726711435180">2011</xref>) generational intelligence; both suggest an age-specific series of personal priorities, as part of a mature identity that emerges in later life and increased diversity of experience as a part of adult ageing. Such ideas also resonate with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018726711435180">Gaullier’s (2002)</xref> proposition for new forms of work organization that support ‘plural identities’ in later life and reject the centrality of work values.</p>
<p>The point here is not to simply replace one form of reductionism, the bio-lifecourse, for that of the economic. We rather point out that, just as work provides a material base for identity and recasts the ‘old’ into a form of mature subject, so does a recognition of finitude and the existential questions generated by a long life. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726711435180">Biggs et al. (2011)</xref> specifically reject forms of lifecourse reduction in favour of a phenomenological understanding of how specific age-based identities emerge and are maintained. The French inspiration around ‘déprise’ also gives importance to the experimental side of ageing. But, in each case, these explorations of ‘mature identity’ give birth to the existence of other ways of governing the self in which the notion of activity loses its centrality for self-expression. Here would appear a possible ‘mature subject’.</p>

<title>Toward a new foundation for building later life</title>
<p>It would appear from the argument outlined above that a revitalized and radical response to the question of a mature identity should look beyond the restricted domain of work-related activity. The re-invention of retirement might usefully embrace wider forms of personal development (often interpreted by productivist thinking, mistakenly in our opinion, as a form of disengagement) and embrace lifecourse specific forms of change. If political economy has associated work with power, liberal civil rights with anti-ageist social inclusion and neo-liberalism with promotion of the ‘entrepreneur of oneself’, then each in its own way has contributed to an end-game that reduces the diversity of late life identity, discouraging counter-conducts that challenge work activity and alternative voices that emphasize lifecourse development.</p>
<p>If international narratives on ‘active ageing’ suggest that retirement should be filled by work or work-like activity, then mature identity comes to consist of ‘more of the same’ in lifecourse terms, and diversity of identity with all its promise of alternative forms of social engagement enabled by a long life, will be lost.</p>
<p>If the current reading is correct, then international discourses on ‘active ageing’ may be considered as the meeting point of ‘productive ageing’ centred on economic priority and personal responsibilization analysed as a normalizing discourse for neoliberal subjects.</p>
<p>An alternative, counter-conduct, might avoid the colonization of ageing by activity and productivism and would rather explore other dimensions for governing oneself. In addition to simply observing counter-conducts, this alternative discourse might draw on two directions: 1) a re-discovery of existential challenges arising from a finite lifecourse and multiple personal potentials that arise from a ‘déprise’ and persist in spite of the dominance of economic discourses; 2) a critical awareness of the policies that have so effectively co-opted existing forms of dissent and the mediating processes that contribute to forms of flexibility and fixity within mature identities. The absence of such an alternative pole of attraction and an accompanying conceptual foundation has led to the collapse of attempts to re-invent adult ageing that has again become fixed into a discourse of work or non-work. We would also argue that the impacts of intermediate processes, such as intergenerational relationships, life tasks that arise from the experience of adult ageing, the relationship between ageing and social inequality, should act as a counter weight to the universalizing tendency of current policy. We are not suggesting here a form of biological reductionism that equates adult ageing with bodily decline, but rather one that is not afraid to recognize the distinctiveness of maturity and its impact on the changing priorities of a long life. Such a new foundation would have the advantage that existential life-tasks, mature lifecourse development and social contribution are provided with an opportunity to work in harmony with each other. This is not to reduce later life to biological essentialism, but to act as an antidote to a dominating discourse that has denied elements of the everyday experience and desire. These elements would include the impacts of bodily change, an increased awareness that we do not live forever and that we have a limited time in which to do the things open to us. The ‘more of the same’ offered by productivist solutions cannot answer these desires; rather it seeks to suppress them. The problem, then, is less about work continuation versus re-invented retirement, but rather about allowing mature subjects to develop multiple aspects of their experience that permit the emergence of lifecourse-specific contributions to the wider social good. In short, economics should be the servant and not the master of our destinies during a long life, while gerontology could think about ‘desired’ in place of ‘active’ ageing.</p>
