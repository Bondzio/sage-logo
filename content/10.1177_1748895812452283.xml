<body>
<p>The purpose of this special issue is to introduce ‘negotiated orders’ as a provocative vocabulary for revisiting and revitalizing important debates in criminology and the social sciences on the interconnectedness of structure and agency. For us, the term was initially a reminder of the possibilities and the constraints that are identified in structuration theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748895812452283">Giddens, 1976</xref>), but we will go on to argue how it also became suggestive of something more, what we will characterize here as the importance of the social encounter and ‘performance’ within the negotiation of order. ‘Negotiation’ implies active, motivated participation with the world, through which mutual compromise and transformation are possible. ‘Order’ on the other hand brings to mind the constraints of political and/or classification systems, perhaps even ones that are imposed, as well as a sense of continuity and stability. ‘Negotiated orders’ indicates that dialogue and concession will have been a necessary part of the social production of orders, even where they are now characterized by seeming permanence and inertia, but it makes no a priori judgement as to their present capacity to shape or be shaped by motivated action. It thus gives emphasis to the <italic>possibility</italic> that social and political actions and interventions can plausibly challenge the ways that things are, and can resist or re-imagine the ways that they are becoming.</p>
<p>Two particular features of this special issue distinguish it from other collections with similar preoccupations, and are suggestive of a number of lines of research that might develop in furtherance of it.</p>
<list id="list1-1748895812452283" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Multiple loci of negotiated order: Each contribution to this special issue explores the negotiation of order in quite different yet specific locations in the social fabric: through peer groups and family relations; within formal and informal community networks, associations and institutions; in the context of professions; and within and through the fabric of local, national and international policy regimes and apparatus. Although methodologically eclectic (a point to which we return), the articles demonstrate the potential utility of ‘negotiated orders’ to these different levels of analysis within criminology, but perhaps more importantly they also suggest that negotiated orders act as a means of linking them, highlighting the essential interconnectedness of individuals, communities, institutions, regimes and polities. Particularly striking are the similarities in the dynamics of order negotiation found across all of the locations. All of the articles attest to the ways in which particular ideas and/or visions of policy/practice are forged, and can gain purchase (or not), through the building of alliances, and through co-operation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The moment of negotiated order: All of the contributions take seriously the moment of negotiated order, giving attention to the factors and processes that animate reflexivity, creativity and autonomy, as well as those that underpin powerlessness, passivity and inertia. These include the social, political and economic capacities of actors; the role of identities, and the relative value or status associated with them, in enabling or constraining action; the importance of institutional frameworks in providing opportunities and resources for interaction; and the ways in which power and individual and collective efficacy run through all of the above. Such analyses are exciting because they demonstrate that a wide range of possibilities continue to exist in the face of global, universalizing, grand narrative trends and trajectories. They also draw us towards thinking about the negotiation of orders as the negotiation of practice in its different forms: practice as peer group engagement and management; practice as community activism; practice as professional work; practice as politics; practice as policy implementation. The articles suggest that the nature and function of variant orders can only be understood in terms of the temporal and spatial dynamics of these modes of practice: that is, in the context of ‘performance’. For us, performance implicates both subject and object, it is the moment of encounter, of rule application or sublimation and response, it is a phenomenal instantiation of order construction and reproduction. Performance contains evocations of the past and intimations of the future: it is both backward and forward looking.</p></list-item>

<title>The Individual Contributions to the Special Issue</title>
<p>Some of the contributions to this special issue were initially presented at the European Society of Criminology’s annual conference in Liege in 2010, as part of a themed panel session on negotiated orders. The experience of the conference encouraged us to reflect on the wider applicability of the concept to different levels of analysis not covered in the original session.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1748895812452283">1</xref></sup> Although we would not suggest that the special issue is exhaustive in its coverage, we would argue that the contributions, taken together, do provide a useful starting point for developing thinking about how orders are negotiated and renegotiated throughout multiple, overlapping individual and institutional levels.</p>
<p>McAra and McVie explore negotiated orders at the individual level, drawing on extensive quantitative and qualitative longitudinal data on the lives and experiences of young people in Edinburgh. In particular, they examine the complex processes through which young people negotiate their social identities in relation to both formal (schools and public policing) and informal (peer group associations) regulatory orders, all of which are operating with an inclusionary–exclusionary logic through which ‘appropriate’ behaviour is policed. For some young people negative identities as ‘troublemakers’ are largely assigned to them within formal orders on the basis of family reputation and prior conduct, quickly becoming difficult to shift even when they are no longer accurate descriptors of actual conduct. Within their own informal peer groups such identities need to be handled and negotiated with care. Deviant identities and reputations may confer status up to a point, but those who take it too far – who transgress the boundaries of the acceptable to the peer group (even one that does subscribe to the use of violence to a significant degree) – risk compounding their formal exclusion through informal peer exclusion, making it much more difficult for them to resist or challenge the deviant label. Carr shifts the level of analysis to look at how the configuration of local civic institutions influences the potential for citizen input into the local negotiation of public safety arrangements. He contrasts community policing structures in the US cities of Chicago and Philadelphia, exploring their potential to act as a fulcrum around which community interests were able to coalesce in response to tragic local events of public concern (gang-related shootings). Carr argues that the institutional framework for community participation in Chicago’s well-developed community policing programme facilitated and provided resources around which community activism was able to take hold in a manner that was not true in Philadelphia where policing had remained more responsive and law-enforcement orientated.</p>
<p>Henry continues with the institutional theme developed in Carr, but shifts the focus somewhat onto institutions as organizational spaces within which people negotiate their professional identities and practices. He uses a relational social learning perspective – communities of practice – to explore how the emergence and development of multi-agency partnership structures amounts to an important recasting of the institutional spaces within which community safety work is increasingly done, and how this has ramifications for the mentalities and technologies that will be negotiated around its practice. The local infrastructure of community safety partnerships also animates Edwards and Hughes’ contribution which introduces the concept of regime theory as a means of reinvigorating critical analyses of the local negotiation of public safety. In particular, they argue that a regime theory approach better captures the fluid and negotiated nature of power (as encompassing both ground up ‘power to’ govern as well as top–down ‘power over’ populations) in contrast to liberal and Marxist criminological theorizing, as well as more recent perspectives on governmental criminology or governance studies. Their analysis thus gives emphasis to the inherently <italic>political</italic> struggles over policy, practice and resources that characterize the situated negotiation of public safety. The potential for local variability of practice that connects the contributions of Carr, Henry and Edwards and Hughes is also a core theme in Stummvoll’s contribution. Stummvoll presents a series of case studies to demonstrate how European standards around Crime Prevention by Urban Planning and Building Design have been recast in different national contexts. Far from resulting in a clear harmonization of standards and practice, Stummvoll argues that the implementation of these international standards has been locally negotiated to a substantial degree, resulting in diverse sets of national standards bearing quite distinctive characteristics. Again, it is precisely this <italic>possibility</italic> of difference, albeit one that is often highly constrained, that lies at the heart of this collection.</p>

<title>Implications for Theory and Practice in Criminology</title>
<p>The articles in this special issue span a wide variety of methodological approaches (including deconstructionist, genealogical, quantitative and qualitative approaches). However, what unites them is a firm belief in ‘middle range theory’ as being core to knowledge production. As an ethic of study, middle range theory encourages theoretical and methodological reflexivity through: its explicit focus on the interplay between (indeed duality of) theory and method; the manner in which it subjects theories (and specifically hypotheses generated from them) to empirical testing; and the way in which it feeds the results of such empirical testing back into a reconfiguration of theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1748895812452283">Merton, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1748895812452283">Zetterberg, 1965</xref>). Middle range theory, places faith in the construction of networks of theories rather than in the development of a unified theory which attempts to explain all forms of social organization and change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1748895812452283">Hedstrom and Udehen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1748895812452283">Merton, 1968</xref>). The concept of negotiated order was initially understood by us as a tool through which to interrogate social practice – it shaped what we collectively deemed to be the appropriate object of research; but in operationalizing the term, the articles have together highlighted its transformative capacity – indeed the theme of negotiated order reinstalls and re-engages with normative debates about the legitimacy of contemporary orders and the political role of the criminologist.</p>
<p>Each of the contributions subscribes to a view of the social world as always being in a process of becoming. While some explore a darker, more dystopic potential within social practice – compounded by institutional inertia (Henry, this issue), and ways in which the performance of orders can function to impose identities and limit capacity for autonomy or for self-determination (McAra and McVie, this issue) – <italic>all</italic> ultimately conclude that social practice can be productive, and that it contains the possibility of resistance to, and reinterpretation and re-imagining of, extant orders.</p>
<p>Understanding orders (at individual, community, professional, institutional, regional and national levels) as having been negotiated is to give due recognition to the role that social actors have played in their constitution, and the ways in which alliance building and co-operative action underpin the legitimacy and longevity of variant forms of social organization. Importantly, it reminds us of our own contribution to the construction, reproduction and performance of orders, and ultimately of our responsibility, as academic criminologists, to challenge and intervene in them.</p>
