<abstract>
<p>An overview is provided of five recent legal developments that merit special attention of special educators: (a) the amended Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEIA) regulations concerning parental consent, including subsequent agency interpretations concerning their practical application; (b) the IDEIA provisions and resulting state laws and implementation issues for response to intervention; (c) the IDEIA provision for basing the individualized education program statement of special education on peer-reviewed research to the extent practicable and subsequent case law applying this provision; (d) the case law on behalf of students with autism spectrum disorder, including the issues of eligibility and free appropriate public education or least restrictive environment; and (e) the IDEIA revisions concerning discipline, with special attention to suspensions/expulsions, disproportionality, and the corresponding Section 504 requirements.</p>

<p>This column provides an update to readers on recent legal developments that warrant the attention of special educators. The selection is limited to five such developments, with particular emphasis on school district special education personnel. Thus, the primary focus is on the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053451212472234">IDEIA, 2004</xref>), with only secondary attention to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1053451212472234">Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (1973)</xref>. Moreover, the selection is based on legal developments that are more nuanced than those that are more obvious in the professional literature. The summary for each of these five developments includes one or more unsettled issues that are subject to future litigation or legislation. The sequence of discussion does not suggest any priority or level of importance.</p>
<sec id="section1-1053451212472234">
<title>Parental Consent</title>
<p>Various legal developments in recent years have significantly altered the consent provisions under the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053451212472234">IDEA (2004)</xref>. First, effective on December 31, 2008, the revised regulations require written notice and cessation of IDEA services on the parents’ revocation, in writing, of their consent for special education services (§§ 300.300[b][4] and 300.9[c][3]). This amendment extended the parents’ unilateral authority beyond consent for initial services by excluding these matters from the broad jurisdiction of due process hearings and, thus, precluding the previous option of district-initiated hearing officer overrides. The commentary accompanying these IDEA regulatory amendments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053451212472234">2008</xref>, p. 73,011) provides the position of the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) that, for parents who seek revocation of a particular service, the application depends on whether the service is essential in meeting the criteria of a free appropriate public education (FAPE). More recently, for cases where both parents have legal authority for educational decisions, OSEP interpreted the regulation as requiring districts to accept either parent’s revocation of consent regardless of which parent consented to the services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1053451212472234">Letter to Cox, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1053451212472234">Letter to Ward, 2010</xref>). Moreover, in the same policy letters, OSEP opined that if a parent, after revocation, requests services, the district must treat the matter as a request for an initial evaluation, not a reevaluation.</p>
<p>For resulting questions, one might consider whether a district is required to acquiesce to a parent’s insistence on a 504 plan on written revocation of an individualized education program (IEP). An early Office for Civil Rights (OCR) interpretation seemed to suggest that the answer is no (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1053451212472234">Letter to McKethan, 1996</xref>). Although not clearly settled, this interpretation recently gained more legal weight upon its adoption in an unpublished federal court decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1053451212472234"><italic>Lamkin v. Lone Jack C-6 School District</italic>, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, special educators need to be attentive as to not only whether parents grant, but also whether they revoke, consent for services. Given the absolute legal effect of these parental decisions, the care that special educators traditionally put on establishing communications and trust is all the more important.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1053451212472234">
<title>Response to Intervention</title>
<p>Similarly, a sequence of legal developments in recent years has introduced response to intervention (RTI) to the legal landscape under the IDEA and corollary state laws. As a result of the 2004 amendments to the IDEA legislation, the 2006 regulations required each state to choose among these options for identification of students with specific learning disabilities (SLD): (a) requiring or permitting RTI, (b) permitting or prohibiting the severe discrepancy approach, and (c) permitting an alternate research-based procedure (§ 300.307[a]). As the result, approximately 12 states opted to require RTI at least for certain grade levels and/or enumerated area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1053451212472234">Zirkel &amp; Thomas, 2010</xref>). The case law has been slow to develop, with considerable confusion between general education interventions and RTI (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1053451212472234">Zirkel, 2011b</xref>). At the same time, a few state laws have extended RTI beyond SLD identification or provided other implementation features, such as coordination between RTI and previous general education interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1053451212472234">Zirkel, 2011c</xref>). In states that require or permit RTI, the thorny challenges for districts that adopt this approach—which have only partially been addressed in various OSEP letters—include fulfilling their obligations under IDEA child find (a) during the first two tiers of RTI with or without parental request, (b) for children in private schools or home education programs, and (c) for children coming from other, non-RTI districts.</p>
<p>Special educators need to be active in helping districts implement RTI in states that mandate this approach and in helping them decide whether to adopt this approach in states with permissive state laws. Some of the keys are to avoid confusion between RTI and general education interventions, to avoid confusion between SLD identification and other purposes for RTI, and conducting evaluation for children reasonably suspected of being eligible under the IDEA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1053451212472234">
<title>Peer-Reviewed Research</title>
<p>As another result of the 2004 amendments to the IDEA, the 2006 IDEA regulations set forth, for the first time, the qualified requirement for the child’s IEP that the statement of specially designed instruction and related services be “based on PRR [peer-reviewed research] to the extent practicable” (§ 300.320[a][4]). PRR is not synonymous with scientific-based research, being limited to the overlapping criterion of research—regardless of whether experimental, quasi-experimental, or any other quantitative or qualitative approach—that has been subjected to a selection process by expert reviewers. In any event, the case law thus far is split. The minority view, represented largely by an occasional hearing officer or court decision (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1053451212472234"><italic>Waukee Community School District v. Douglas L.</italic>, 2008</xref>), has rigorously applied this provision, thus raising the substantive standard for FAPE in favor of the plaintiff–parents. However, arguably contrary to the intent of the law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1053451212472234">Etscheidt &amp; Curran, 2010</xref>), the predominant weight of the case law to date has interpreted this provision in a rather relaxed, district-deferential direction (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451212472234"><italic>B.H. v. West Clermont Board of Education</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1053451212472234"><italic>Doe v. Hampden-Wilbraham Regional School District</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1053451212472234"><italic>Joshua A. v. Rocklin Unified School District</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, the key question is whether the professional orientation for best practice will reinvigorate the PRR provision via further federal or state legislation, case law, or local policies. Special educators can play a significant role in extending the foundation for and elevating the legal status of PRR so that the substantive standard for FAPE reflects the cumulative contribution of this professional field. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1053451212472234">Etscheidt and Curran (2010)</xref> proposed, PRR provides special education with the opportunity and obligation to incorporate research-based practices with “fidelity and integrity” (p. 147).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1053451212472234">
<title>Autism Spectrum Disorders</title>
<p>Overlapping with the PRR provision, autism spectrum disorders (ASD) account for a substantial segment of the FAPE litigation. Indeed, a recent systematic analysis of the published case law concerning FAPE and the overlapping IDEA provision for the least restrictive environment between 1993 and 2006 revealed that parents of children with ASD accounted for a much higher proportion of these cases than the proportion of these children in the special education population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1053451212472234">Zirkel, 2011a</xref>). Many of these cases concerned the high-stakes issues of tuition reimbursement, including the cost of home 1:1 applied behavior analysis programs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1053451212472234"><italic>Bucks County Department of MH/MR v. De Mora</italic>, 2004</xref>) and the meaning of the FAPE requirement for meaningful parental participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053451212472234"><italic>Fort Osage R-1 School District v. Sims</italic>, 2011</xref>). Similarly, another systematic analysis revealed that ASD was the leading classification of children in the burgeoning liability litigation in response to the use of physical and other restraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1053451212472234">Zirkel &amp; Lyons, 2011</xref>). Finally, recent court decisions concerning eligibility of so-called high-performing children with Asperger syndrome under the IDEA have revealed a split concerning the meaning of the criterion “adversely affects . . . educational performance,” which is an express requirement for eligibility under both “autism” (§ 300.8[c][1][i]) and, alternatively, “other health impairment” (§ 300.8[c][9][ii]). More specifically, the First Circuit has interpreted this “educational performance” broadly to include social skills, thus ruling in favor of the child’s eligibility under the IDEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1053451212472234"><italic>Mr. I. v. Maine School Administrative District No. 55</italic>, 2007</xref>). In contrast, the courts in the Second Circuit have interpreted “educational performance” to refer only to academic achievement, thus narrowing the scope of eligibility for such children (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053451212472234"><italic>A.J. v. Board of Education</italic>, 2010</xref>). Other jurisdictions have not squarely addressed this issue.</p>
<p>Litigation concerning students with ASD continues to be on the rise, with the key questions including the scope of educational performance for eligibility and the standard for FAPE in terms of not only ASD methodology controversies but also meaningful parental participation. Special educators are the key to improved identification and effective interventions for children with ASD, thereby holding the potential for more parental participation for collaboration rather than litigation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1053451212472234">
<title>Discipline</title>
<p>The relatively subtle but cumulatively significant changes in the IDEA regulations continue the focus on one form of discipline—removals, suspensions, and expulsions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1053451212472234">Office of Special Education and Rehabilitation Services, 2009</xref>). The net effect is to provide less protection for students with disabilities, such as the revised procedures and criteria for manifestation determinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1053451212472234">Zirkel, 2010</xref>). An overlapping issue, which has become a priority compliance issue for OSEP and, thus, state education agencies is enforcing the IDEA prohibition of “significant disproportionality based on race and ethnicity” in not only identification and placement but also “the incidence, duration, and type of disciplinary actions, including suspensions and expulsions” (§ 300.646[a]). More specifically, if a school district has significant disproportionality in identification or placement, states must require the district to (a) review policies, practices, and procedures, (b) reserve 15% of its Part B allocation to provide “early intervening services” to serve children in the local education agency, “particularly children in those groups that were significantly overidentified,” and (3) publicly report on any revisions of policies, practices, and procedures (§ 300.646[b]). Another area that merits attention is addressing the question of what the comparable legal requirements are for expulsions of students with Section 504 plans. For example, a relatively recent federal district court decision in Pennsylvania seemed to suggest—contrary to longstanding OCR policy—that such students are not entitled to manifestation determinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1053451212472234"><italic>Centennial School District v. Phil L</italic>., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Special educators need to keep current in informing as well as being informed by policy makers and courts as to the appropriate legal rules for discipline, starting with but extending well beyond removals. As with other legal issues, the areas for active attention are at not only the federal but also the state and local levels.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1053451212472234">
<title>Honorable Mention</title>
<p>Various other recent legal developments also warrant special attention. Because of space limitations, three examples are provided: (a) the effect of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1053451212472234">Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (2008)</xref>, which went into effect on January 1, 2009, on school district obligations for not only eligibility but also—indirectly but importantly—FAPE under Section 504 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1053451212472234">Zirtel, 2012</xref>); (b) the recently issued IDEA Part C regulations, which went into effect on October 28, 2011, and which apply to children ages 0 to 3; and (c) the newly proposed regulations, issued on September 28, 2011, and also available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/osep/new.html">http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/osep/new.html</ext-link>, regarding public insurance (e.g., Medicaid), which provides strengthened notification for consent and revocation of consent while removing the “each time” requirement.</p>
