<body>
<p>In the course of their history, historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) have had a tumultuous relationship with accreditation agencies. In many southern states, for example, HBCUs were segregated into review processes at “Black” accrediting organizations, and even when they were allowed to join mainstream organizations, they were evaluated using a separate scale up until 1961 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021934712453467">Gasman, 2007a</xref>). And because of their mission to educate the whole community, many HBCUs were denied accreditation because they had large secondary education departments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021934712453467">Allen &amp; Jewell, 2002</xref>). In this article, we examine the literature on accreditation in postsecondary education in the United States and, in particular, on accreditation as it influences HBCUs. First, we discuss some of the challenges of preparing a literature review on this topic. Second, we explain what accreditation entails in the United States, including a description of accrediting agencies and the accreditation review process. Third, we review both the academic and the more general literature on accreditation in general. Fourth, we review both the academic and the general literature on accreditation as it shapes HBCUs. Finally, we discuss lessons learned from the literature, including both gaps and areas for improvement.</p>

<title>The Challenge of the Topic</title>
<p>A review of the literature on postsecondary education suggests that there is a small body of research on the history and evolution of accreditation and limited research that focuses on accreditation in the present. There are several challenges to reviewing the literature on accreditation. First, scholarly research on accreditation is a proportionally small segment of what is published on accreditation, being far outweighed by practitioner-oriented publications, which largely are manuals on how to engage in the process, and policy reports, which are often descriptive overviews of the process. As noted by one study of the literature on national education evaluation systems since 1985,
<disp-quote>
<p>it is probably fair to state that this literature is overwhelmingly descriptive; largely story-telling by those whose hard work and/or political interest are deeply intertwined with the messages which are delivered about the system which the writers helped to develop. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021934712453467">Kells, 1999</xref>, p. 213)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Second, often the literature on accreditation is closely linked with the literature on accountability in education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021934712453467">Brittingham, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021934712453467">McGuire, 2009</xref>) as well as the literature on assessment of education outcomes, especially as an indicator of institutional quality. This makes it challenging to understand what the literature says about accreditation as a process, separate and distinct from its possible goals of accountability and assessment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0021934712453467">
<title>Accreditation as a Process</title>
<p>Regulation of postsecondary education in the United States is done through a voluntary method of institutional peer review called accreditation rather than by a single, centralized authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021934712453467">U.S. Department of Education, 2009</xref>). Accreditation agencies are
<disp-quote>
<p>private educational associations of regional or national scope [which] develop evaluation criteria and conduct peer evaluations to assess whether or not those criteria are met. Institutions and/or programs that request an agency’s evaluation and that meet an agency’s criteria are then “accredited” by that agency. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021934712453467">U.S. Department of Education, 2009</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The work of accreditation agencies is funded largely by annual dues from institutions that are accredited or by fees from those undergoing accreditation review processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021934712453467">Eaton, 2009</xref>). There are four types of accreditation within the U.S. system of postsecondary education, including regional, programmatic, faith-based, and private career accreditation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021934712453467">Eaton, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The regional accreditation agencies are responsible for institutionwide accreditation at most public and private not-for-profit (and some for-profit) 2- and 4-year colleges and universities in the United States. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021934712453467">Eaton, 2006</xref>). The first such association was the New England Association of Schools and Colleges, established in 1885 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021934712453467">Commission on Institutions of Higher Education [CIHE], 2009</xref>), which today includes the CIHE and the Commission on Technical and Career Institutions. Subsequently, additional regional accreditation agencies formed, including the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools (including its Commission on Higher Education), established in 1887; the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges, established in 1895; the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (including its Higher Learning Commission), established in 1895; the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities, established in 1917; and the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (including the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges and the Accrediting Commission for Senior Colleges and Universities), established in 1924 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021934712453467">Brittingham, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021934712453467">Council for Higher Education Accreditation, 2009</xref>). Most accreditation standards as we know them today were established initially by these organizations between 1950 and 1965 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021934712453467">Brittingham, 2009</xref>). The six regional accreditation agencies that exist today in the United States vary widely in terms of their size and influence; although there are similarities in the goals and objectives of these agencies, there are “large differences in methods, strategies, support, and organizational style” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021934712453467">Alstete, 2004</xref>, pp. 9-10).</p>
<p>Program accreditation is applied to specific academic programs within colleges and universities. Programs leading to professional training often have program-level accreditation, which is accreditation granted in addition to the institutionwide regional accreditation often sought by most colleges and universities. For example, education programs meant to train teachers can be accredited by either the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021934712453467">National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (2009)</xref> or the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0021934712453467">Teacher Education Accreditation Council (2009)</xref>. Certain disciplines also have their own accreditation agencies. Engineering programs, for example, are accredited by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021934712453467">ABET (2009)</xref>, and doctoral programs in clinical, counseling, or school psychology are accredited by the American Psychological Association’s Office of Program Consultation and Accreditation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021934712453467">American Psychological Association, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The role of the federal government in postsecondary education oversight was developed in the Veterans Readjustment Act of 1952 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021934712453467">Finkin, 2009</xref>) and later reinforced by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021934712453467">Higher Education Act of 1965</xref>. These acts granted the federal government the right to authorize states to recognize educational programs in institutions that had been accredited and granted the federal government the right to officially recognize accreditation agencies in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021934712453467">Finkin, 2009</xref>). Today, both federal and state governments rely on the accreditation process to assure institutional quality, and both link accreditation status to the disbursement of their funds to postsecondary institutions and students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021934712453467">Eaton, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Accreditation relies primarily on the volunteer services of peer reviewers who form the accreditation team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021934712453467">Brittingham, 2009</xref>). An accreditation team is organized by the accrediting organization and is custom tailored for each institution undergoing a review process, making the accreditation team an “ephemeral . . . social structure” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021934712453467">McGuire, 2009</xref>, p. 30). Although institutions must provide their self-study report to the team well in advance of the campus visit, the bulk of the accreditation team’s work is conducted in a period of a few days. During an accreditation visit, the team is engaged in interviewing campus constituents and reviewing documents while reconciling its impressions with the material presented in the self-study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021934712453467">McGuire, 2009</xref>). After an institution or program is initially accredited, it is then subject to periodic evaluation as well as a full reaccreditation review on a set schedule that can range from once every few years to once every 10 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021934712453467">Eaton, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Accreditation in the Academic Literature</title>
<p>Descriptive overviews of the accreditation process are more commonly found than is primary research on accreditation, even in the academic literature. The bulk of the recent ASHE-ERIC Higher Education Report on accreditation provides a thorough overview of the history of accreditation in the United States and discusses practical matters regarding how to successfully engage in an accreditation review but does not provide information on any existing literature pertaining to accreditation as a predictor of outcomes of interest to postsecondary education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021934712453467">Alstete, 2004</xref>). A recent issue of <italic>New Directions for Higher Education</italic>, a peer-reviewed journal geared toward senior-level university administrators and other practitioners, focuses on accreditation but includes no empirical research on accreditation per se. The articles in the special issue on accreditation cover the “history, values, advantages, benefits, and challenges” of accreditation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021934712453467">O’Brien, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0021934712453467">
<title>Accreditation in Nonacademic Literature</title>
<p>The policy literature on accreditation is sparse. In 2006, then–secretary of education Margaret Spellings convened the Secretary of Education’s Commission on the Future of Higher Education (known as the Spellings Commission), which solicited papers from experts in the field on challenges facing postsecondary education. One of these papers notes a list of problems with accreditation, including the fact that accreditation is not enhancing educational quality, with the United States slipping in international assessments of educational achievement and literacy, and that accreditation is doing nothing to assure that students and parents have access to accurate and clear information regarding returns on their investment in postsecondary education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021934712453467">Dickeson, 2006</xref>). A second paper solicited by the committee calls for greater public-private involvement in accreditation, including representation from employers and federal and state governments, as well as a greater emphasis on student learning outcomes and the development of national standards for student learning performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021934712453467">Schray, 2006</xref>). Neither of these papers drew from quantitative or qualitative studies of accreditation, but both drew from anecdotal evidence from the world of practitioners.</p>
<p>Policy reports from nongovernmental sources provide additional opinions on accreditation but similarly do not present results of empirical research on the accreditation. A report published by the American Council of Trustees and Alumni (ACTA), an organization that refers to itself as “an independent, non-profit organization committed to academic freedom, excellence, and accountability at America’s colleges and universities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021934712453467">ACTA, 2009</xref>) but has been referred to in the <italic>Chronicle of Higher Education</italic> as “a conservative-leaning lobbying association” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021934712453467">Basken, 2007</xref>, p. 20), concluded that
<disp-quote>
<p>accreditation has not served to ensure quality, has not protected the curriculum from serious degradation, and gives students, parents, and public decision-makers almost no useful information about institutions of higher education. Accreditation has, however, imposed significant monetary and non-monetary costs. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021934712453467">Leef &amp; Burris, 2002</xref>, Foreword)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although this report was referred to as a “study,” it was not based on any sort of research design and did not provide information on the methodology used to arrive at its stated findings; the report appears to be a combination of unsupported assertions and occasional references to articles in the popular media. This report was, however, referenced before the U.S. Congress when it was debating the future of accreditation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021934712453467">Morgan, 2002</xref>). A more recent report by ACTA, meant to serve as an update to the 2002 report, suggests that “accreditation only shows that the school is following what the accreditors think is the proper formula for a successful educational institution, not whether an institution is in fact successful at teaching students” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021934712453467">ACTA, 2007</xref>, p. 6). This more recent report similarly did not provide results of any primary research, nor did it reference existing research, which may be a reason it was referred to as “a hodgepodge of half-baked ideas and anecdotes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021934712453467">Basken, 2007</xref>, p. 20) by a senior administrator of the American Council on Education. Although these two reports do not present research findings, they do point to issues that raise concern about accreditation, including the fact that accrediting agencies do not publish their evaluations of colleges and universities and that accrediting agencies largely allow institutions themselves to define the outcomes by which their quality is evaluated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021934712453467">ACTA, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021934712453467">Leef &amp; Burris, 2002</xref>). In a May/June 2005 article in <italic>Change</italic>, five contributors—who are heads of a national, regional, or specialized accrediting organization—argue that full disclosure to the public would do more harm than good because “schools withholding information, conversations monitored, and site visitors writing defensively will change accreditation—should it survive. The validity and reliability of its judgments will be degraded” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021934712453467">Eaton, Fryshman, Hope, Scanlon, &amp; Crow, 2005</xref>, p. 45). Unfortunately, such arguments have yet to be tested empirically.</p>

<title>Accreditation and HBCUs in the Academic Literature</title>
<p>Although there is very limited scholarly research on accreditation in general, there is also very sparse research on the current impact of accreditation on HBCUs in particular. There are numerous articles that discuss historical trends in accreditation vis-à-vis HBCUs. The available literature can be categorized as academic research, policy documents, and descriptive overviews. Academic research published in peer-reviewed journals on what leads to, or results from, securing accreditation is limited. A very early study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021934712453467">Asgill, 1976</xref>) examined the perception of presidents of traditionally White and traditionally Black colleges in the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools region on the benefits, if any, of accreditation, as gauged by a survey returned to the researcher by 103 institutions. Results suggested that accreditation was viewed in a positive light by most college presidents, with heads of HBCUs viewing accreditation more favorably than heads of traditionally White institutions. Accreditation was deemed as most important to the image of the institution, the ability to receive federal and other grants as a result of being accredited, and recruitment of faculty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021934712453467">Asgill, 1976</xref>). Although this study examined perceptions of accreditation, by 1984, one study noted that to that point, “no significant studies have been done on the accreditation process” of HBCUs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0021934712453467">Simmons, 1984</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0021934712453467">Simmons’ (1984)</xref> study examined 12 HBCUs in the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools accreditation region and queried administrators at those institutions via a survey about the role of the accreditation review process in institutional improvement. The study design also included content analysis of correspondence, meeting minutes, and accreditation review evaluations and reports. Results of the study suggested that the accreditation process was deemed to be helpful in conjunction with institution-initiated efforts at quality improvement, whereas the process did not improve funding levels from sponsors, board functioning, or institutional morale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0021934712453467">Simmons, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>Subsequent to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0021934712453467">Simmons’ (1984)</xref> study, studies of accreditation and HBCUs do not appear in the peer-reviewed academic literature. There is remarkable silence in this literature on accreditation and its relationship to HBCUs. One of the very few current studies published in the academic literature on accreditation specifically relating to HBCUs was conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021934712453467">Donahoo and Lee (2008)</xref> and was a review of 126 articles written about 284 regional accreditation decisions and changes, having an impact on 143 institutions, between 1996 and 2005 in the <italic>Chronicle of Higher Education</italic>. Because of their geographic distribution in the United States, more than 80% of HBCUs are under the jurisdiction of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021934712453467">Donahoo &amp; Lee, 2008</xref>). This study noted that more than three fourths of all reported accreditation decisions published in the <italic>Chronicle</italic> were those issued by the Southern Association; 25% of the total number of decisions generated in this time frame were toward HBCUs, which is disproportionate to the number of HBCUs in the U.S. system of higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021934712453467">Donahoo &amp; Lee, 2008</xref>). The study concludes that accreditation decisions are “neither consistent nor impartial” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021934712453467">Donahoo &amp; Lee, 2008</xref>, p. 304) and that minority-serving institutions receive harsher sanctions from regional accreditors than do other institutions. In a different study, a content analysis of media coverage of the accreditation issues facing Morris Brown College noted that common themes in media coverage included the decline of Black colleges, student allegiance to or desertion from the institution, institutional and leadership failure, and religious devotion as key to institutional culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021934712453467">Gasman, 2007b</xref>). Both of these studies suggest that the accreditation process may pose a unique challenge to HBCUs that is not experienced by predominantly White institutions. These articles underscore the need for methodologically rigorous scholarly research on the topic of accreditation and HBCU institutional success.</p>

<title>Accreditation and HBCUs in the Nonacademic Literature</title>
<p>A very limited number of studies on accreditation at HBCUs exist but are not published in academic, peer-reviewed journals. A dissertation whose research sample was three 4-year institutions in North Carolina examined factors contributing to successful completion of accreditation review for HBCUs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0021934712453467">White-Cooke, 2008</xref>). This study suggested that colleges with adequate data and record keeping, financial stability, and accreditation-experienced leadership had a positive experience with the accreditation review process. Another dissertation examining two private HBCUs in Texas that lost and then had reinstated their accreditation status noted that reasons for losing reaccreditation status were campus turmoil, failure to provide appropriate responses and support in follow-up and progress reports, noncompliance with federal programs, and lack of financial stability, whereas successful reinstatement of accreditation was the result of resolution of audit findings, improved financial stability, demonstrated use of administrative and academic program evaluation results, and new leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021934712453467">Jones, 2005</xref>). These results make sense in light of the fact that
<disp-quote>
<p>although most HBCUs are small, have a relatively high percentage of disadvantaged students, and lack many of the resources available at mainstream institutions, even among HBCUs there are differences in financial endowment, tuition costs, fields of study offered, and academic selectivity. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0021934712453467">Wilson, 2007</xref>, p. 11)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One case study of a single institution’s attempt to achieve accreditation for its business administration program, which was published in a practitioner-oriented journal with an editorial review process rather than a peer-review process, noted that the expense of accreditation may be the biggest hurdle for minority-serving institutions, especially for HBCUs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021934712453467">Quddus, 2007</xref>). This same study noted that the most important factors in the successful accreditation process were commitment on the part of the central administration and support for the process from school leadership and faculty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021934712453467">Quddus, 2007</xref>). Moreover, in another dissertation that examined the challenges of accreditation for journalism and communication departments at HBCUs, the researcher found institutions to be faulted for a lack of faculty with earned doctorates, little record of scholarship, and too frail of an infrastructure to implement and support a culture of measurement and assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021934712453467">Crawford, 2008</xref>). A panel discussion held at the 2008 annual meeting of the American Educational Research Association noted in its presentation that although HBCUs make up 13% of the membership of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, they represent 50% of the institutions that have lost accreditation status since 1989 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021934712453467">Lee, 2008</xref>). An overview of recent trends facing HBCUs published in <italic>Academe</italic>, the magazine of the American Association of University Professors, noted that 11 HBCUs faced loss of accreditation, or serious challenges to maintenance of accreditation status, in the past decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021934712453467">Gasman et al., 2007</xref>). Partially in response to this heightened scrutiny in the popular media, the Southern Education Foundation published a series of guidance manuals on accreditation targeted at presidents and boards of HBCUs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021934712453467">Davis, 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021934712453467">2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021934712453467">Hopps, 2006</xref>). The guides are meant to clarify the process of accreditation for those in positions of leadership at HBCUs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021934712453467">Wershbale (2010)</xref> argues that amendments be made to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021934712453467">Higher Education Act of 1965</xref>, which requires accreditation to qualify for federal and state funding, to accommodate the unique history of HBCUs and the structural challenges they continue to encounter. She further posits that partnerships be created through collaborative accreditation between HBCUs and the accrediting organization to create a system that would create a safe harbor period for successful structural and financial growth, expansion of educational resources, and building of endowments. Rather than a one-size-fits-all model, collaborative institution-specific accreditation standards, aligned with federal funding, would best serve legislative goals and use accrediting agencies to their fullest potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021934712453467">Wershbale, 2010</xref>, p. 92). Acknowledgement of the differences between HBCUs and predominantly White institutions are common; however, such cognizance is not carried through into policy and legislation that govern these institutions.</p>
<p>The policy literature on HBCUs does not focus on or even necessarily discuss accreditation issues. A U.S. Department of Education statistical overview of HBCUs covering the years 1976 through 2001 makes note of the institutions that lost their accreditation but does not provide further information on accreditation issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021934712453467">Provasnik &amp; Shafer, 2004</xref>). Another report commissioned by the U.S. Department of Education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021934712453467">Humphreys &amp; U.S. Department of Education, 2006</xref>) explores the short-term economic impact of HBCUs on their regional economies but makes no mention of accreditation. These federally commissioned reports on HBCUs provide descriptive overviews of HBCUs and their presence in the U.S. system of higher education without extending use of federally collected data.</p>

<title>Lessons Learned From the Literature</title>
<p>First and foremost, this review clarifies the fact that accreditation is rarely the focus of scholarly research published in peer-reviewed journals. As a result, accreditation vis-à-vis HBCUs is similarly underresearched. This conclusion underscores the need for methodologically rigorous primary research on accreditation. Second, it is important to distinguish between historical overviews of changes in postsecondary education and opinion pieces that discuss those changes. Arguments regarding the role of accreditation, or the need to change accreditation policies and practices, would be strengthened by use of either quantitative or qualitative methods to illuminate some of the challenges posed both in general and to HBCUs in particular by the current accreditation system. Finally, one must acknowledge the challenge posed to research on accreditation that results from the lack of transparency about the process, as both institutional self-study reports and accreditation team evaluations are often not publicly available documents. Similarly, the fact that each accreditation review is conducted by a completely unique evaluation team makes the accredited status of a college or university a less stable unit of comparison and therefore perhaps not preferred by quantitative researchers interested in comparing outcomes of accredited versus unaccredited institutions or programs or in comparing how other factors result in the award or loss of accreditation status. Nonetheless, given the importance of accountability in postsecondary education and the primary role that accreditation plays in access to federal and other funding as well as in the credibility of the postsecondary enterprise, it is important to encourage the development of rigorous historical, quantitative, and qualitative studies on accreditation in general and on the role of accreditation in the success of HBCUs.</p>
<p>Understanding more about the accreditation process and how institutions pursue it within the HBCU context is essential to the future of these institutions. Accrediting bodies need to do all they can to level the playing field for HBCUs, making sure that they have the knowledge and tools to play the game. For years, HBCUs have been unfairly compared to their better-resourced White counterparts. Moreover, they have been judged by all-White accrediting teams from better-resourced institutions. To understand the unique situation that many HBCUs are in, being underresourced because of immense discrimination for years, accrediting bodies and their faculty evaluating teams need to be educated on the history of HBCUs as well as the issues that they face. This kind of education will come about only if there is an increase in rigorous research, policy papers based on this research, and practitioner-based work that is developed by HBCUs themselves.</p>
<p>Although this review of the literature is grounded within the HBCU context, the relationship between HBCUs and the accreditation process can be very telling for all minority-serving institution counterparts. Similar to HBCUs, tribal colleges and universities and Hispanic-serving institutions have special missions to serve their local and ethnic communities, and their funding is also tied to successful navigation of the accreditation process. Unfortunately, many minority-serving institutions are crippled with a lack of financial resources and weak administrative infrastructures and are inundated with students requiring remedial education. In other words, minority-serving institutions are tasked with educating the most underserved students and are required to produce better results with less resources, and still they are evaluated using the same accreditation standards as prestigious public flagship and private institutions. Future research must consider the following questions: Despite the plethora of research on minority-serving institutions distinguishing them from traditional predominantly White institutions, why do accrediting agencies continue to homogenize institutions of higher education? What do we not know about the accreditation process for HBCUs and its minority-serving institution counterparts? How do the values of accreditation agencies and HBCUs differ, and do these differences matter? How can accrediting agencies be helpful in the success of HBCUs?</p>
