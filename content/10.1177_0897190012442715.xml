<italic>Objective:</italic> To provide a summary of published survey articles regarding the provision of medication therapy management (MTM) services in the United States. <italic>Methods<bold>:</bold>
</italic> A literature search was conducted to identify original articles on MTM-related surveys conducted in the United States, involving community and outpatient pharmacists, physicians, patients, or pharmacy students and published by the primary researchers who conducted the study. Search engines used included PubMed, Medline, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (IPA). If MTM was in the keyword list, mesh heading, title, or abstract, the article was reviewed. References from these articles were searched to determine whether other relevant articles were available. <italic>Results:</italic> A total of 405 articles were initially reviewed; however, only 32 articles met the study requirements. Of the 32 articles, 17 surveyed community/outpatient pharmacists, 3 surveyed pharmacy students, 4 surveyed physicians, and 8 surveyed patients. The survey periods varied across the different studies, with the earliest survey conducted in 2004 and the most recent survey conducted in 2009. The surveys were conducted via the telephone, US mail, interoffice mail, e-mails, Internet/Web sites, hand-delivered questionnaires, and focus groups. <italic>Conclusion:</italic> Despite the identified barriers to the provision of MTM services, pharmacists reportedly found it professionally rewarding to provide these services. Pharmacists claimed to have adequate clinical knowledge, experience, and access to information required to provide MTM services. Pharmacy students were of the opinion that the provision of MTM services was important to the advancement of the pharmacy profession and in providing patients with a higher level of care. Physicians supported having pharmacists adjust patients’ drug therapy and educate patients on general drug information but not in selecting patients’ drug therapy. Finally, patients suggested that alternative ways need to be explored in describing and marketing MTM services for it to be appealing to them.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The 2006 implementation of the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit (in accordance with the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act [MMA] of 2003) required the provision of medication therapy management (MTM) services to high-risk patients through the Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug (MA-PD) plan, stand-alone prescription drug plan (PDP), and special needs plan (SNP). These high-risk patients are Medicare Part D beneficiaries with multiple chronic illnesses, who are on multiple covered Part D medications and whose medication costs could likely exceed a predetermined threshold level. The cost threshold was reduced from $4000 per year in 2006 to $3000 in 2010.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012442715">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012442715">2</xref>
</sup> According to a 2010 report by the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), about 59% of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in the Medicare Part D program<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190012442715">3</xref>
</sup> and about 25% of this  eligible Medicare Part D population were  estimated to meet the criteria required to receive MTM services.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012442715">2</xref>
</sup> In addition, the MTM services were also provided to non-Part D patients and were also included in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) which was signed into law in 2010.</p>
<p>Both Pellegrino<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012442715">4</xref>
</sup> and McGivney<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190012442715">5</xref>
</sup> compared and contrasted definitions associated with pharmacy services to the definition of MTM. For example, “disease state management” may involve pharmacy services but does not focus on medications nor include multiple disease conditions. MTM differs from patient counseling because it is delivered independent of dispensing and involves collaboration with patients and providers.</p>
<p>According to a consensus definition supported by 11 national professional pharmacy organizations, MTM is “a distinct service or group of services that optimizes therapeutic outcomes for individual patients.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012442715">6</xref>
</sup> MTM services are targeted at improving patient’s drug use, clinical outcomes, and quality of life, while reducing the risk for adverse events and the overall health care costs. MTM services include conducting an assessment of the patient’s health status, developing an appropriate drug treatment plan, monitoring and evaluating the patient’s response to therapy, reviewing the patient’s medication profile to detect and prevent drug related problems, providing adequate patient education, promoting patient’s medication adherence, promoting disease prevention and wellness programs, and collaborating with other health care providers to improve care and health outcomes for the individual patient.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012442715">6</xref>
</sup> In 2005, the American Pharmacists Association (APhA) and the National Association of Chain Drug Stores Foundation identified 5 core elements required of any MTM program. These include medication therapy review, a personal medication record, a medication action plan, intervention and referral, and documentation and follow-up.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012442715">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>While the need to provide MTM services cannot be overemphasized, the lack of standardization in the design and delivery of these services has the potential to affect the quality and possibly reduce the intended effect of implementing the provision of these services.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190012442715">8</xref>
</sup> Many insurance plans have been reported to provide MTM services via mailings and in-house call centers rather than employing the services of community pharmacists to provide direct (face-to-face) care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190012442715">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190012442715">10</xref>
</sup> Pharmacist providers are also faced with a number of challenges which include reimbursement issues (ie, low and/or delayed payments), variability of program content due to different health plans, administrative burdens from third-party payers, and poor interprofessional collaboration due to unfavorable physician perception regarding the ability of pharmacists to provide these services.<sup>

</sup> have been surveyed on issues centered around implementation, enrollment, delivery, compensation, attitudes, perception, satisfaction, willingness to pay, training needs, skills, and knowledge as these relate to the provision of MTM services. While each study reveals findings that may have the potential to provide insight on how to restructure the design and delivery of MTM services, there is not one document that summarizes these findings into a single report in order to provide comprehensive information for future research purposes. In addition, this may be useful to inform future MTM delivery and implementation. The objective of this study is to provide a summary of published survey articles regarding the provision  of MTM services in the United States.</p>

<p>While the provision of MTM services is professionally rewarding for most pharmacists, surveys also identified barriers to the successful provision of these services. These barriers include lack of time, high workload, shortage of staff, reimbursement issues, lack of access to patients’ records, patients’ lack of interest, lack of collaborative practice agreement with physicians and the non-uniformity in program specification (ie, in design and delivery) by the different health plans.<sup>

</sup> Among the previously reported barriers, the most frequently occurring barrier across the majority of the pharmacist surveys are the issues surrounding reimbursement or compensation (eg, no payments, low and/or delayed payments, and profitability) for MTM services. Based on a study by Law et al, pharmacists would either want to be paid per minute (range $1-$10/min; mode $2) or per patient visit (range $10-$100/visit; mode $60).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0897190012442715">20</xref>
</sup> Wang et al reported that pharmacists, on average, would be willing to accept $1.44/min or $86.4/hr for MTM services provided.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0897190012442715">26</xref>
</sup> The need for compensation has also been shown to vary positively with the pharmacist’s years of practice as well as previous provision of MTM services. As regarding the profitability of the provision of MTM services, Schommer et al reported that almost an equal number of respondents who claimed they had a positive (35%) return on investment (ROI) reportedly had a negative (31%) ROI.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0897190012442715">15</xref>
</sup> Pharmacists have also expressed interest in receiving additional training, especially in areas pertaining to billing and documentation.<sup>

<title>Pharmacy Students</title>
<p>Similar to pharmacists, the majority (73%-94%) of the pharmacy students surveyed  was familiar with basic Medicare Part D drug benefit information and agreed to have the knowledge and skills to provide  MTM services.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Due to the benefits associated with the provision of MTM services (eg, improvement in health outcomes, increase in quality of health care, and reduction in the overall cost of care), the importance of developing strategies to address the barriers/challenges highlighted in the surveys cannot be overemphasized.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0897190012442715">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0897190012442715">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0897190012442715">27</xref>
</sup> Pharmacists’ training needs have to be adequately addressed to improve their competencies as providers of MTM services. Courses on MTM services/patient care need to be fully integrated into the PharmD curriculum and residency programs as core courses in schools where they are currently offered as electives. A recent report by the APhA and the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP) which summarized submissions received from 18 pharmacy schools and colleges on “successful practices to incorporate MTM into the curriculum” also emphasized the importance for early introduction and continuous reinforcement of the concept of MTM throughout the PharmD curriculum.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0897190012442715">44</xref>
</sup> This report is a recommended resource for pharmacy schools.</p>
<p>Practicing pharmacists need to be able to access training materials or take classes on providing MTM services since the ability to deliver these services is crucial to the future of pharmacy. Issues surrounding compensation need to be adequately addressed such that pharmacists are paid based on the time and complexity of services provided. There is also the dire need to develop standardized interoperable billing and documentation systems that create a comprehensive and unified approach for integrating MTM services in electronic health records.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0897190012442715">45</xref>
</sup> The roles of pharmacy technicians may have to be expanded to handle all nonclinically related activities (including paper work) to allow pharmacists to be better focused on patients’ needs. The importance of developing collaborative working relationships (CWRs) with other members of the health care team, especially physicians, needs to be emphasized beginning in pharmacy school. This will help pharmacists to effectively transition from being a product provider to eventually become involved in a patient-centered model of practice or team based-care with physicians and other health care personnel. This model of care has the potential to reduce the cost of care, improve the quality of care and efficiency of treatment of patients. Efforts should also be geared at educating physicians and other health care personnel on the value of MTM and the role of pharmacists as complementary (and not competitive) in improving patients’ health outcome and quality of care. Studies on pharmacist–physician CWR have shown the importance of a face-to-face communication with the physician, with the pharmacist being the relationship initiator.<sup>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0897190012442715"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0897190012442715">48</xref>
</sup> Other factors also considered to be important in establishing a pharmacist–physician CWR include trust, having high-quality pharmacist contributions, and role specification.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0897190012442715">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0897190012442715">48</xref>
</sup> The potential benefits of a pharmacist–physician CWR on patient’s health outcome have also been documented.<sup>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0897190012442715"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0897190012442715">51</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Furthermore, patients, health policy makers, and employers need to be adequately educated about the value of MTM services. An increased publicity on how pharmacists can help improve patients’ health outcomes (through education, proactive outreach/marketing, and/or employer incentive programs by waiving co-pays) will increase patients’ awareness and encourage them to participate in MTM services.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0897190012442715">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0897190012442715">52</xref>
</sup> Finally, since few studies have been conducted to determine the ROI of providing MTM services, future MTM studies can also focus on this as positive ROIs would encourage more pharmacists to provide these services as well as provide payers with evidence of potential compensation for services.</p>
<sec id="section10-0897190012442715">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>While the study sought to provide a summary of currently available published survey articles regarding MTM services in the United States, there is a possibility that some were not found by the literature search. It is also possible that other surveys regarding MTM may have been conducted but were not published (eg, used for plan decision making but not reported outside of the organization). In addition, the survey articles included in this study differ in research designs, different populations, and different research questions. Survey research has inherent limitations (eg, selection bias, responder’s bias, and/or low responder rates) which collectively limit the validity or generalizability of this summary and as such caution needs to be exercised in the use of the information presented.</p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services (CMS) have recently mandated changes to MTM-related activities (eg, refine target criteria, target and enroll beneficiaries, perform ongoing monitoring of the beneficiaries medications).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0897190012442715">53</xref>
</sup> However, there has been limited published studies investigating and documenting the results of these mandated changes and as such this summary can provide a reference for future research work that seeks to measure improvements in MTM services provided.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In conclusion, despite the identified barriers to the provision of MTM services, pharmacists reportedly found it professionally rewarding to provide these services. Pharmacists claimed to have adequate clinical knowledge, experience, and access to information required to provide MTM services. Pharmacy students were of the opinion that the provision of MTM services was important to the advancement of the pharmacy profession and in providing patients with a higher level of care. Physicians supported having pharmacists adjust patients’ drug therapy and educate patients on general drug information but not in selecting patients’ drug therapy. Finally, patients suggested that alternative ways need to be explored in describing and marketing MTM services for it to be appealing to them.</p>
