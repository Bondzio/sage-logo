<sec id="section1-0363546512472044">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely used as a preoperative tool to estimate the size of articular cartilage defects to optimize treatment selection. However, the reliability of MRI sizing of cartilage defects is not well understood.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546512472044">
<title>Hypothesis/Purpose:</title>
<p>The purpose of this investigation was to compare the size of knee articular cartilage defects on MRI to arthroscopic visualization after debridement. It was hypothesized that MRI sizing would produce measurements that were no different than those made during arthroscopic knee surgery.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512472044">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546512472044">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Seventy-seven patients (age [mean ± SD], 38 ± 10.7 years) who met inclusion criteria underwent preoperative knee MRI of at least 1.5 T within 1 year of arthroscopic knee surgery for a high-grade cartilage defect. Postdebridement defect sizes were obtained from intraoperative surgery notes and compared with retrospective MRI estimates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546512472044">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Ninety-two total cartilage defects were analyzed with an average of 1.2 high-grade defects per knee and average postdebridement defect area of 2.99 cm<sup>2</sup> per lesion (95% CI, 1.63-2.26 cm<sup>2</sup>). Preoperative MRI analysis estimated a lesion area that was an average of 1.04 cm<sup>2</sup> smaller (95% CI, 0.70-1.39 cm<sup>2</sup>; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). In 74% of the lesions analyzed, defect size was larger on arthroscopic visualization than was estimated by MRI sizing. On average, MRI underestimated the defect area by 70% compared with arthroscopic visualization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546512472044">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Magnetic resonance imaging underestimates the size of articular cartilage defects compared with final postdebridement size as measured during arthroscopic knee surgery. Thus, before arthroscopic surgery, orthopaedic surgeons should consider treatment strategies that are appropriate for a larger defect than predicted by preoperative MRI.</p>

<p>Articular cartilage defects are limited in their inherent capacity for regeneration or repair, increasing the likelihood that direct chondral injury will prompt the development of early-onset osteoarthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512472044">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512472044">11</xref></sup> Progressive articular degeneration may be prevented or slowed, however, if chondral damage is detected early enough for adequate intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512472044">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512472044">22</xref></sup> The clinical work-up and treatment for articular cartilage defects involve the consideration of multiple patient- and lesion-specific variables (eg, defect location, activity level, and prior treatment), but lesion size is considered especially crucial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512472044">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512472044">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512472044">20</xref></sup> Accurate estimation of defect size is essential to the selection of an optimal treatment strategy, preoperative plan, and postoperative management protocol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512472044">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512472044">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512472044">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512472044">9</xref></sup> Cartilage defect size is also an important prognostic factor in the progression to osteoarthritis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512472044">14</xref></sup> as well as the prediction of therapeutic success with intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512472044">21</xref></sup> Furthermore, the clinical implementation of novel cartilage restoration techniques and modified treatment algorithms will depend on outcomes studies that utilize an accurate, clinically relevant metric.</p>
<p>Arthroscopic surgery is widely used in the diagnosis, assessment, and treatment of chondral damage because it is the only minimally invasive technique that allows direct visualization of articular cartilage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512472044">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512472044">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512472044">24</xref></sup> However, limitations to the use of diagnostic arthroscopic surgery alone (eg, cost, associated complications) have led to the widespread use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a noninvasive technique to diagnose and assess cartilage damage and guide treatment selection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512472044">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512472044">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512472044">26</xref></sup> While some authors have questioned the accuracy of MRI sizing of articular cartilage defects,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512472044">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512472044">15</xref></sup> to date, there is minimal literature discussing the clinical reliability of MRI for the preoperative estimation of articular cartilage defect size compared with arthroscopic knee surgery. Despite the prevalence of MRI in the clinical assessment of knee cartilage degeneration today,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512472044">26</xref></sup> the reliability of MRI sizing of cartilage defects is still not well understood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512472044">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512472044">19</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In theory, it should be possible to derive the dimensions of a discrete, sharply margined cartilage defect within a voxel of error.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512472044">17</xref></sup> In clinical practice, however, current MRI techniques are limited in their ability to delineate irregularly shaped lesions and surrounding degeneration, fissuring, erratic margins, and unstable cartilage fragments that remain attached.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512472044">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512472044">7</xref></sup> Once fully visualized arthroscopically, cartilage abnormalities that evade detection or accurate characterization on MRI frequently require surgical debridement, prompting a potential discrepancy between MRI estimates of lesion size and arthroscopic measurements, which are the final data used to select a treatment strategy. Without a thorough investigation into the ability of MRI to accurately assess lesion size, its reliability as a clinical tool to guide the management of articular cartilage damage remains unclear.</p>
<p>The purpose of this investigation was to compare the size of knee articular cartilage defects on preoperative MRI to arthroscopic visualization after debridement. It was hypothesized that MRI sizing would produce measurements that were no different from those made during arthroscopic knee surgery.</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>After institutional review board approval, a retrospective evaluation of MRI and arthroscopic surgery results was performed. No informed consent was required as retrospective review of patients’ surgical records and images constituted minimal risk. Patients were included in this retrospective study if they underwent clinical knee MRI (at least 1.5 T) within 1 year before arthroscopic knee surgery over the 31-month duration of the investigation (January 2009 to September 2011). Patients registered with current procedural terminology (CPT) code 29877 (chondroplasty), 27412 (autologous chondrocyte implantation [ACI]), 29879 (abrasion arthroplasty, multiple drilling, microfracture), 29866 (osteochondral autograft), or 29867 (osteochondral allograft) who were diagnosed with a high-grade (Outerbridge 3 or 4) articular cartilage defect that was sized and documented during arthroscopic surgery were included.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512472044">25</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Our initial CPT code search yielded 236 entries for patients who were treated arthroscopically for cartilage injury. However, 61 entries were excluded for the following reasons: duplicates (eg, patients who underwent ACI several months after diagnostic arthroscopic surgery), no focal area of cartilage damage described in the notes (eg, cases when chondroplasty was used for minor fibrillation), preoperative MRI took place at an outside institution, MRI occurred more than 1 year before arthroscopic surgery, or MRI acquisition quality was too poor for analysis (eg, when metal artifacts distorted image quality to the point that measurements could not be reliably made). Of the 175 patients who met inclusion criteria, 75 were excluded because they had low-grade (Outerbridge 1 or 2) lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512472044">25</xref></sup> An additional 23 patients with high-grade lesions were excluded because no dimensions were reported in the surgery notes. Thus, the study population included 77 patients: 50 men and 27 women aged 38 ± 10.7 years (range, 20-63 years). There was a total of 92 high-grade cartilage defects, with the majority in the right knee (53%) and on the medial femoral condyle (37%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512472044">Table 1</xref>). There was an average of 1.2 high-grade defects per knee: 34 in the medial femoral condyle, 20 in the lateral femoral condyle, 29 in the trochlea, and 9 in the patella (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512472044">Table 1</xref>). The average interval between preoperative MRI and arthroscopic surgery was approximately 2.5 months (range, 1 week to 9 months), minimizing the potential for further articular degeneration before surgery. Indications for surgery in these patients included, but were not limited to, cartilaginous defects, meniscal lesions, cruciate ligament tears, loose bodies, internal derangement, patellar dislocation, chondromalacia patella, and osteochondritis dissecans.</p>

<title>MRI and Arthroscopic Measurements</title>
<p>Preoperative images were acquired in axial, coronal, and sagittal planes with either a 1.5-T MRI unit (Avanto or Espree, Siemens, Malvern, Pennsylvania; Excite or HDxt, GE Healthcare, Andover, Massachusetts) or a 3.0-T MRI unit (Achieva, Philips, Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Verio, Siemens) using an 8-channel SENSE knee coil. Standard clinical knee imaging protocols were utilized, including fat-suppressed, proton density–weighted, turbo spin-echo (PD-TSE-FS) sequences. The in-plane resolution ranged from 0.3516 × 0.3516 to 0.625 × 0.625 mm (matrix, 256 × 256 to 512 × 512), repetition time from 1470 to 4372 milliseconds, echo time from 16 to 51 milliseconds, with a slice thickness of 2 mm for axial sequences and 3 mm for coronal and sagittal sequences.</p>
<p>The MRI scans for cases meeting the selection criteria underwent a secondary evaluation to assess cartilage defect size, blinded to surgical measurements. Cartilage defect dimensions were obtained from MRI scans utilizing the Medical Imaging Processing Analysis and Visualization (MIPAV) software package (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland). Defect area was calculated by multiplying the maximal lesion diameter in 2 imaging planes (coronal and sagittal diameters for lesions in the femoral condyles, and axial and sagittal diameters for lesions in the patellofemoral compartment) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512472044">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Arthroscopically, cartilage defects were measured after achieving stable margins with the debridement of loose, fissured cartilage fragments around the lesion’s edge. Measurements were made with a calibrated probe (Smith &amp; Nephew, Memphis, Tennessee) or retractable measuring device (Arthrex, Naples, Florida) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512472044">Figure 2</xref>) at the base of the defect in 2 dimensions: the maximal diameter, and the diameter perpendicular to the maximal diameter. For all patients, arthroscopic debridement, subsequent intraoperative measurement, and postoperative documentation of cartilage lesion dimensions were conducted by the same fellowship-trained orthopaedic surgeon. To compare lesion size to MRI estimates, arthroscopic defect area was estimated by calculating the product of the 2 lesion dimensions documented in postoperative notes. Lesion size estimates derived from MRI were considered equivalent to measurements made during arthroscopic surgery if MRI estimation was within 10% of the final postdebridement area.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512472044">15</xref></sup>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The outcomes of interest calculated cartilage defect area obtained by MRI and arthroscopic visualization. Before performing any analysis, we considered the assumption of normal distribution for all of the variables using the likelihood ratio test. Each variable satisfied the assumption of normality, and thus, only parametric analysis was used. Paired <italic>t</italic> test analysis was used to compare the differences of mean defect areas between MRI and arthroscopic measurements. Correlation coefficients for MRI and arthroscopic estimation of defect area were also calculated for each knee compartment. The significance level used was α = .05, and this analysis was performed using STATA 10.0 statistical software (StataCorp, College Station, Texas).</p>

<p>Sixty-five of the 77 patients (75 lesions) were scanned preoperatively with a 1.5-T MRI unit, while the other 12 patients (17 lesions) were imaged with a 3.0-T scanner. On average, articular cartilage defects assessed by a 1.5-T scanner were underestimated by 75.2% (95% CI, 47.0%-103%). Cartilage lesions assessed by a 3.0-T scanner were underestimated by an average of 54.6% (95% CI, 24.3%-85.0%). This difference was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = .499), indicating that 3.0-T MRI did not provide more accurate measurements of cartilage defects than 1.5-T MRI.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Magnetic resonance imaging is used widely as a diagnostic tool to identify and characterize articular cartilage degeneration,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512472044">26</xref></sup> but to our knowledge, this is the first investigation into the clinical utility of MRI for the preoperative estimation of articular cartilage defect size compared with arthroscopic knee surgery. Despite the extensive use of MRI as a noninvasive tool to characterize chondral defects, we found that 74% of chondral defect areas were underestimated on preoperative MRI compared with arthroscopic measurements, and the final postdebridement area was on average 70% larger at arthroscopic surgery. Arthroscopic visualization of articular lesions typically reveals surrounding areas of loose, fragmented, and delaminated cartilage that is not appreciated on MRI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512472044">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512472044">7</xref></sup> Thus, surgical debridement of diseased cartilage that is not well visualized with preoperative imaging has a significant role in the size discrepancy between MRI and arthroscopic surgery.</p>
<p>By knee compartment, arthroscopic measurements of cartilage defects were larger than preoperative MRI estimates by 92% (1.45 cm<sup>2</sup>), 43% (0.74 cm<sup>2</sup>), and 83% (1.08 cm<sup>2</sup>) for articular lesions of the medial femoral condyle, lateral femoral condyle, and trochlea, respectively. The MRI size estimates for patellar defects, however, were similar to measurements made during arthroscopic surgery (average difference, 0.15 cm<sup>2</sup> or 6%). Lesions of the patellar cartilage tended to be smaller than defects in other knee compartments (range, 0.50-4.0 cm<sup>2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546512472044">Table 2</xref>), likely requiring less cartilage debridement than defects located elsewhere in the knee. Thus, as defect circumference increases, the discrepancy between MRI and arthroscopic sizing grows because debridement increases the size of a large lesion more than a small lesion.</p>
<p>Additionally, defects in the patellofemoral compartment were better visualized relative to lesions of the femoral condyles, in part, because of the thinner slice thickness associated with axial MRI sequences (2 mm) compared with sequences in the sagittal and coronal planes (3 mm). While also visualized well in the axial plane, lesions of the trochlea may not be as well visualized in sagittal images because of the position of the defect in the femoral notch. Furthermore, as the population included only 9 patellar defects with a difference ranging from −1.26 to 0.74 cm<sup>2</sup> (−46% to 38%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0363546512472044">Table 4</xref>), further investigation is necessary to characterize MRI sizing of patellar defects. A recent study compared the accuracy of MRI estimation of chondral defect area in 38 patients to measurements made during open arthrotomy (eg, during ACI procedures).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512472044">15</xref></sup> Gomoll et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512472044">15</xref></sup> reported that postdebridement size was larger than MRI estimation in each of the 4 compartments (medial and femoral condyles, trochlea, and patella; average, 65%). While open arthrotomy allows clear visualization of articular cartilage, it is also important to understand how MRI sizing of cartilage damage compares with arthroscopic surgery, which is a less invasive, widely used diagnostic technique that is often considered the clinical gold standard for cartilage assessment. These data, taken together with our findings, warrant further investigation into how new MRI techniques can improve the preoperative detection and assessment of diseased cartilage.</p>
<p>Before this investigation, there was minimal literature comparing the clinical utility of MRI for the preoperative estimation of articular cartilage defect size with arthroscopic knee surgery. Although arthroscopic surgery is widely considered the gold standard for the diagnosis and assessment of chondral damage and for clinical decision making, a recent study by Siston et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512472044">27</xref></sup> emphasized the variability of arthroscopic measurement techniques and the tendency to underestimate articular cartilage lesion size. As such, the main limitation of this study is the absence of a more reliable, clinically relevant gold standard for the assessment of articular cartilage lesion size. Second, MRI and arthroscopic measurements of lesion size are inherently subjective. Arthroscopically, variability in lesion sizing was minimized by the use of a single, experienced orthopaedic surgeon for the intraoperative measurement of each defect. For MRI, this was addressed by limiting our retrospective review to cartilage defects that were assigned a high operative grade (Outerbridge grade 3 and 4), eliminating the potential ambiguity associated with delineating the partial-thickness fibrillation and softening characteristic of low-grade cartilage lesions. While excluding low-grade lesions from this study reduced our sample size, high-grade defects are more likely to require intervention that would be guided by lesion sizing. Third, while this study considered consecutive patients with high-grade defects over a 31-month interval, another limitation was that some patients with a high-grade defect had to be excluded because the lesion dimensions were not reported in surgery notes. It is also possible that cartilage degeneration could have progressed between MRI sizing and arthroscopic surgery. However, studies reporting that cartilage volume loss occurs at a rate of less than 5% per year,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512472044">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512472044">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512472044">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512472044">16</xref></sup> combined with the short, average MRI to arthroscopic surgery interval in this study (mean, 2.5 months; range, 1 week to 9 months), make it unlikely that progression of cartilage damage confounded the results of this study.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, this study includes a larger number of cases than any other investigation comparing clinical MRI to final postdebridement measurements. Nevertheless, another potential limitation lies in the variety of MRI scanners, both 1.5 T and 3.0 T, used to obtain preoperative scans in this study. However, similar sequencing protocols (mainly, PD-TSE-FS sequences in axial, coronal, and sagittal views) were utilized to assess lesion area regardless of the scanner used to obtain images. We found that 3.0-T MRI underestimated cartilage defect size to a lesser degree than 1.5-T MRI (54.7% for the former and 75.2% for the latter); however, our sample size was not large enough to demonstrate statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> = .449). Furthermore, the main purpose of this study was to provide a clinically relevant snapshot of how preoperative MRI compares with arthroscopic knee surgery in sizing cartilage defects. Despite this study’s limitations, our investigation yielded novel data, demonstrating a significant gap between the ability of MRI to size articular cartilage lesions compared with the clinical gold standard of arthroscopic knee surgery. These findings will serve to provide a crucial, preliminary framework for further investigation into the reliability of MRI to guide articular cartilage management. Without a comprehensive understanding of the ability of MRI to accurately assess lesion size, its utility as a tool to help guide therapeutic management and assess clinical outcomes remains limited.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Magnetic resonance imaging tends to underestimate the size of articular cartilage defects compared with arthroscopic knee surgery. Orthopaedic surgeons should anticipate that cartilage defects will be larger than estimated by preoperative MRI after arthroscopic debridement of surrounding, degenerated tissue that is poorly visualized on MRI. As lesion size is a crucial factor in the selection of an optimal repair strategy, patients should receive appropriate preoperative counseling about the importance of lesion size that includes a discussion about the multiple options available depending on intraoperative findings. Finally, new imaging approaches are necessary to improve the accuracy and reliability of MRI as a preoperative tool for the clinical assessment of articular cartilage damage.</p>
