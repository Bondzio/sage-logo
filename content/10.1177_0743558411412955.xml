<abstract>
<p>Positive intercultural attitudes and civic action are increasingly important for youth around the world given the economic, social justice, and environmental challenges they face. Among U.S. youth and emerging adults, ethnic identity and self-efficacy are related to positive intercultural attitudes and may prompt civic engagement. Youth’s efficacy and civic involvement are critically important in sub-Saharan Africa, where rates of civil conflict are among the highest in the world. However, little research has been conducted with East African youth. In this paper, we discuss contextual challenges facing East African youth and the potential role of ethnic identity and self-efficacy in promoting peaceful and sustainable societies. We report qualitative results and scores on standard measures of self -efficacy, ethnic identity, and intercultural attitudes for 554 youth members of environmental clubs in Tanzania, Uganda, and the United States. Ethnic identity was associated with enhanced self-efficacy in East African, but not U.S. participants. East Africans scored higher on ethnic identity compared to U.S. youth and were more likely to reference intercultural attitudes in open-ended responses. Results provide some support for construct relevance in East Africa, however psychometric results, including internal consistency, validity, and factor structure, were mixed. Our results provide a cautionary tale about the import of measures across cultures and contexts. There is a need for international research, measurement development, and further explication of the meaning and function of ethnic identity across cultures.</p>

<p>Rapidly occurring changes in the contexts of youth development call attention to young people’s capacity to address challenges such as interethnic conflict and climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0743558411412955">American Psychological Association [APA], 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0743558411412955">Limber &amp; Kaufman, 2002</xref>). Today’s youth are coming of age in a society that is more multicultural, globally connected, and interdependent than ever. Increasing population rates and mobility combined with diminishing resources create new contexts, demands, and opportunities for youth civic participation. Although society stands to benefit from increased diversity, cultural differences can easily give rise to ethnocentrism, racism, interethnic conflict, and at worse, genocide. Dwindling natural resources and the climate crisis present formidable environmental challenges to interethnic relations as cultural ideology based on ethnicity, race, or religion is often used to frame debates over resources or supply a justification for violence. Struggles over land rights, mineral use, and water access are drawn along ethnic lines and manipulated by those in power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0743558411412955">Fairhead, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0743558411412955">Kibanja, Kajumba, &amp; Johnson, in press</xref>).</p>
<p>The potential for interethnic conflict related to resource and power inequities is particularly high in economically developing countries which also suffer the gravest and most immediate effects of climate change (Maathai, 1995, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0743558411412955">2008</xref>). In sub-Saharan Africa, poverty and war have exacerbated the situation, making the cradle of humankind one of the least hospitable places for youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0743558411412955">Johnson, Kibanja, &amp; Abdelali, in press</xref>). African countries lag behind in meeting basic human development indicators outlined in the United Nations Millennium Developmental Goals (MDGs), including school attendance, literacy, and most health-related targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0743558411412955">United Nations, 2010</xref>). According to the Global Peace Index (GPI), Africa is the least peaceful region in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0743558411412955">Visions of Humanity, 2010</xref>), and 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa have experienced at least one civil war since their independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0743558411412955">Yartey, 2004</xref>). Although tribalism was once implicated in the high rates of violence, contemporary views identify poverty, dependence on natural resources, and ineffective governments as the main roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0743558411412955">Elbadawi &amp; Sambanis, 2000</xref>). In fact, ethnic diversity can contribute to the stability of nations, providing a means of resource exchange that results in multiple sources of knowledge, perspectives, and skills.</p>
<p>Models of youth development indicate that healthy attitudes towards diverse cultures and identification with one’s ethnic heritage can build cognitive and behavioral flexibility, promote mental health and well-being, protect against behavioral problems, and prompt civic engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0743558411412955">Flanagan &amp; Faison, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0743558411412955">Scales, Benson, &amp; Leffert, 2000</xref>). Civic engagement may be especially critical for youth living in poverty and whose daily lives are threatened by environmental degradation or civil unrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0743558411412955">Limber &amp; Kaufman, 2002</xref>). Moreover, “youth bulges” in communities influence nations, moving them either toward social cohesion or toward ethnic divisions, extremism, and violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0743558411412955">Fuller, 1995</xref>). With a high percentage of young people in Tanzania and Uganda (45% under 15 years of age, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0743558411412955">Central Intelligence Agency, 2009</xref>), there is great potential for youth to work for equitable development and harmonious social relations. Scholars and activists, such as Nobel Peace Prize winner Wangari Maathai of Kenya, advocate for increased participation by youth to advance social cohesion with a culture of peace based on shared identities that transcend ethnic affiliations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0743558411412955">Maathai, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0743558411412955">Naker, Mann, &amp; Rajani, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0743558411412955">Torney-Purta, Schwille, &amp; Amadeo, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Essential assets and skills are needed for youth to contribute to intercultural harmony and community viability. However, a lack of international research on youth assets, including self-efficacy and ethnic identity, leaves researchers and policy makers questioning the meaning and value of these assets as they relate to youth development and intercultural relations across cultures. In this article, we explore the concepts of ethnic identity and self-efficacy in relation to intercultural attitudes among youth and emerging adults in Uganda, Tanzania, and the United States. We report psychometric results from standard measures and qualitative data to explore the viability of the constructs and measures in an East African context.</p>
<sec id="section1-0743558411412955">
<title>Diversity Attitudes and Ethnic Identity</title>
<p>Youth activism for intercultural harmony will be affected by attitudes about one’s own cultural group and other groups. In the United States, respect for cultural differences and the ability to take others’ perspectives into account are key aspects of personal and social adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0743558411412955">Ripke, Huston, Eccles, &amp; Templeton, 2008</xref>). Valuing diversity is one of the seven indicators of healthy youth development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0743558411412955">Scales, Benson, &amp; Leffert, 2000</xref>) and may motivate activism to address interethnic conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0743558411412955">Moely, Mercer, Ilustre, Miron, &amp; McFarland, 2002</xref>b). Research on the development of ethnic identity in U.S. youth has demonstrated that adolescents with more established ethnic identity have higher awareness of diversity issues and positive regard toward members of different ethnic groups compared to those with a less developed ethnic identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0743558411412955">Phinney, Jacoby, &amp; Silva, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Though ethnic identity is considered a developmental strength in the United States and touted in models of youth development, it is premature and perhaps controversial to make this claim for youth in other nations. Although some assert benefits, others argue that a strong ethnic identity may highlight interethnic tensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0743558411412955">Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979</xref>). In Rwanda, for example, 10 years after the genocide, the concept of ethnicity was outlawed for fear it would cause intergroup tensions to resurface between the Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0743558411412955">Hilker, 2009</xref>). Similarly, President Museveni of Uganda has indicated that Uganda will be “fully evolved” when tribal, clan, and religious identities are inconsequential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0743558411412955">Museveni, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The relevance and meaning of ethnic identity will differ based on cultural, contextual and individual differences that include histories, values, and experiences of oppression and discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0743558411412955">Aponte &amp; Johnson, 2000</xref>). For example, ethnic identity is highly salient for U.S. ethnic minorities, where race remains a powerful force in allocating goods and services, and where racism is a daily and chronic stressor for individuals of color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0743558411412955">Helms, 1995</xref>). In comparison, ethnic identity may be less salient to majority groups. Studies with Whites in the United States indicate reduced relevance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0743558411412955">Roberts et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0743558411412955">Yancey, Aneshensel, &amp; Driscoll, 2001</xref>). In one of the few studies using a standard measure of ethnic identity outside of the United States, Worrell and colleagues concluded that ethnic identity may not be important among the Shona majority in Zimbabwe, who comprise 82% of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0743558411412955">Worrell, Conyers, Mpofu, &amp; Vandiver, 2006</xref>). With world-wide intercultural contact increasing, identities are evolving as individuals and societies undergo processes of acculturation and experience the changing dynamics of majority-minority group relations. For example, in the United States we may see that demographic shifts resulting in a White minority by 2050 might increase the salience of ethnicity among White youth in the near future. Ongoing studies of ethnic identity are necessary among U.S. youth and should be expanded to include youth residing in other nations.</p>

<title>Ethnicity and Intercultural Relations in Tanzania and Uganda</title>
<p>Like other African nations, Uganda and Tanzania have suffered from poverty, wars, and conflict over natural resources since their independence. The two neighboring countries have different histories and sociopolitical situations impacting ethnic identity and intercultural relations.</p>
<p>The Uganda population is made up of four main ethnolinguistic groups (Bantu, Nilotic, Nilo-Hamitic, and Sudanites) and about 44 different tribes, with the Buganda accounting for 17% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0743558411412955">Fearon, 2003</xref>). Although Uganda did not experience the same degree of colonization as other African countries, territories (hence resources) were developed along ethnic lines laying the foundation for current tensions and conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0743558411412955">Kibanja et al., in press</xref>). In the past decades, Uganda has been fighting in the Congo and, in northern Uganda, with the Lords Resistance Army (LRA), which has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced close to two million, and led to more than 60,000 children conscripted as soldiers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0743558411412955">Horowitz, 2000</xref>). Although the fighting is related to resources (e.g., minerals in the Congo and water in the North; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0743558411412955">Fairhead, 2000</xref>) interethnic conflicts fuel the struggles. Government involvement in the Hema-Lendu conflict on the Congolese border has resulted in accusations of Uganda’s involvement in ethnic cleansing. In the Kibale region, ethnic fighting between the Bakiga and Banyoro has been on the rise since the 1990s, and in 2003 resulted in two Banyoro children being beheaded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0743558411412955">Green, 2007</xref>). More recently, fighting between the Buganda and the central government has been on the rise. President Museveni has advocated for a strong national identity, yet attempts to reduce ethnic tensions have been unsuccessful and are predicted to increase, as Museveni continues differential recognition of tribes.</p>
<p>Unlike Uganda, Tanzania is known for its “remarkably harmonious society and its success at forging tolerance and unity out of diversity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0743558411412955">Fitzpatrick, 2007</xref>, p. 36). Tanzania is comprised of 130 tribes, largely Bantu in origin, with the Maasai and a few smaller tribes in the north of Nilotic or Nilo-Hamitic origin. The two largest ethnic groups are the Sukuma and Nyamwezi, accounting for about 13% and 8% of the population. In addition to indigenous groups, Tanzania takes in more refugees than any other country in Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0743558411412955">Central Intelligence Agency, 2009</xref>). Historically, tribes were pressured to collapse under former President Julius Nyerere’s “ujamaa” policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0743558411412955">Owens, 2005</xref>). Translated as <italic>collective work and responsibility</italic>, the policy emphasized national unity through the creation of a family-like system of collective farms, increased literacy, and promotion of intergroup communication by supporting Kiswahili as the national language. In the 1980s, the socialist government relocated over 80% of Tanzania’s rural populations into planned agricultural communities. Individuals learned the cultural customs and languages of other groups and intermarriage became frequent. Positive attitudes toward diverse groups are normative and intercultural conflict is rare.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0743558411412955">
<title>Self-Efficacy and Civic Participation</title>
<p>Positive attitudes towards diverse cultures and a firm ethnic identity will not guarantee youth engagement. According to U.S. models, self-efficacy is among the core competencies needed for sustained and effective civic engagement (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0743558411412955">Eccles &amp; Gootman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0743558411412955">Roth-Herbst, Borberly, &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0743558411412955">Scales et al., 2000</xref>). Belief in one’s power to accomplish goals and capacity for success will influence whether or not youth champion intercultural harmony, the amount of time and effort they are willing to devote to social justice concerns, and their resolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0743558411412955">Lerner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0743558411412955">Lerner, Fisher &amp; Weinberg, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Is self-efficacy important for East African youth? Cultural variables contribute to the concept of the self and self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0743558411412955">Oettingen, 1995</xref>). The individualistic nature of U.S. culture emphasizes personal achievement and individual mastery; whereas cultures with a more collectivist or group-oriented sense of self, such as African cultures, may not separate an individual’s aspirations or accomplishments from those of the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0743558411412955">Triandis, 1995</xref>). Collectivist cultures could temper the importance of self-efficacy, bringing into question the cross-cultural validity of this construct, which has been strongly associated with positive youth outcomes in the United States (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0743558411412955">Catalano, Berglund, Ryan, Lonczak, &amp; Hawkins, 2004</xref>). However, self-related constructs, such as self-efficacy, likely <italic>exist along with</italic> group-related aspects. This is supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0743558411412955">Gyekye (1988)</xref> who states, “it would be more correct to describe that order as amphibious, for it manifests features of both communality and individuality. . . . African social thought seeks to avoid the excesses of the two exaggerated systems” (pp. 31-32).</p>
<p>Cultural differences in self-efficacy may also result from power differentials and role expectations related to age, birth order, or gender. Cultural values that view youth as equal, deserving of voice, as agentive or ‘originators’ result in youth’s efforts being reinforced thereby contributing to greater self-efficacy in youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0743558411412955">Oettingen, 1995</xref>). In East Africa, youth are valued by their communities and they are afforded responsibilities that could facilitate the development of confidence and mastery, such a herding goats or taking care of siblings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0743558411412955">Grigorenko &amp; O’Keefe, 2004</xref>). However, published research on self-efficacy in African youth is sorely lacking. A few studies have demonstrated its important role in health and health behaviors in emerging adults (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0743558411412955">Beaudoin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0743558411412955">Fortenberry, Brizendine, Katz, &amp; Orr, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0743558411412955">Vaughan, Rogers, Singhal, &amp; Swalehe, 2000</xref>). In accord with the UNMDGs, young girls and youth in sub-Saharan Africa are important targets for intervention and education. Self-efficacy is increasingly included as an outcome of such interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0743558411412955">Health Communication Partnership, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0743558411412955">United Nations, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0743558411412955">United Nations Children’s Fund, 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0743558411412955">
<title>The Current Study</title>
<p>In this study, we aimed to (a) explore concepts of self-efficacy and ethnic identity and their relation to intercultural attitudes in East African and U.S. youth members of an environmental club; (b) examine properties of standard psychometric measures of these constructs; and (c) identify potential similarities and differences among Ugandan, Tanzanian, and U.S. youth as a means of exploring the cross-cultural utility of constructs and the potential for larger scale studies using standard measures. We used mixed methods to explore ethnic identity, self-efficacy, and diversity attitudes among youth and emerging adults from Tanzania, Uganda, and the United States.</p>
<p>Our approach emphasizes youths’ developmental strengths and potential for social contribution (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0743558411412955">Lerner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0743558411412955">Limber &amp; Kaufman, 2002</xref>); highlights a neglected and marginalized population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0743558411412955">Arnett, 2008</xref>), Tanzanian and Ugandan youth; and examines the use of standard quantitative measures to advance research with East African youth. Although the focus of our study is on East African youth, ongoing studies of ethnic identity are important in the United States due to the changing ethnic make-up of the United States and also the global context in which U.S. youth are developing their ethnic identity. The inclusion of the U.S. group is informative given the exploratory nature of the study and lack of comparative data, norms, and research studies with East African youth. Moreover, previous studies using standard measures of ethnic identity and self-efficacy in the U.S. have not been conducted with environmental club members who may be different than other youth on these constructs.</p>

<p>Participants were 554 school students from Tanzania (231), Uganda (242), and the United States (81) who were members of an environmental club, either Roots &amp; Shoots (R&amp;S), a program of the Jane Goodall Institute (JGI), or Wildlife Clubs of Uganda (WCU), a Ugandan government program. R&amp;S and WCU have similar missions to educate youth about the environment, animals and their communities, and prompt them to take action. The programs are based on service-learning models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0743558411412955">Eyler &amp; Giles, 1999</xref>) that promote involvement in hands-on activities to improve the environment, connect with communities, and foster personal development. Both programs promote cross-cultural respect and create opportunities for diverse youth to work together on common goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0743558411412955">Johnson-Pynn &amp; Johnson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0743558411412955">2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Clubs were school-based and participants reflected a wide age range (11-27). This is common in Africa due to differential entry points and access to school, pervasive disruptions due to staff shortages, infrastructure problems, lack of money for school fees, high rates of illness, environmental conditions such as floods and droughts, civil conflict/war, and competing needs of families to have youth help with daily tasks at home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0743558411412955">Chigunta, 2002</xref>). As school students, participants were presumed unmarried and although the age range includes emerging adults, they fall into the category of youth in an African context, the United Nations includes youth up to 24, while the African Union uses a more expansive definition that extends to 35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0743558411412955">African Union, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0743558411412955">United Nations, 2009b</xref>). Participants were recruited through their clubs in a variety of locales within each country. Just over half the East African participants attended schools in rural areas that rely on subsistence farming. Fifty youth were from two refugee camps in Lugufu, Tanzania, home to some 80,000 refugees. Others attended urban schools in the coastal city of Dar es Salaam and the Ugandan capital, Kampala, or Jinja, an industrial city at the source of the Nile. U.S. youth represented a range of regions including the Northeast, California, the Four Corners region, and the Southeast. Demographic data are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0743558411412955">Table 1</xref>. Groups differed significantly in demographic features, most notably economic situation, with 43% of Tanzanians and 39% of Ugandans indicating their families did not have enough money for basic living needs. East Africans spoke more languages than the U.S. group. Tanzanians were about 1 year older on average than the others, while Ugandans had about 1 year more of school. Because data were collected from school students, we did not ask about martial status or children, as these questions would have been stigmatizing. Moreover, African youth who were married or with children would likely be working if male, or if female, would be working or raising the child at home, rather than in school. Additionally male school students would be unlikely to have attained bride wealth commonly needed for securing a marriage proposal.</p>

<title>Procedures</title>
<p>Members of R&amp;S or WCU were invited to participate by their club coordinator at a meeting. Researchers introduced themselves, the purpose of the research, and the questionnaire. Assent forms were reviewed. Clarification of items was provided by Tanzanian, Ugandan and U.S. colleagues. African participants kept the pencils provided as an incentive and all clubs were entered into a raffle to win US$50 to support a project.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p>Measures were administered in the national language of each country (English in Uganda and the United States, Kiswahili in Tanzania). For Tanzanians, the measures were initially translated from English into Kiswahili and then blind back translated by two anthropologists fluent in Kiswahili (a Tanzanian national and U.S. American with a long history of work in the region). The two versions were evaluated for equivalence and cultural appropriateness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0743558411412955">Brislin, 1970</xref>).</p>

<title>Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (MEIM)</title>
<p>The MEIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0743558411412955">Phinney, 1992</xref>) is a measure of ethnic identity used in numerous studies. Scores are reliable, with alphas of .80 across different ethnic groups and ages. Based on a multiethnic sample the 12-item MEIM yielded a Cronbach’s alpha of .85 for the total score, and .84 and .70 for factors one and two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0743558411412955">Roberts et al., 1999</xref>). A factor analysis of a large sample produced two factors: (a) ethnic identity search/exploration, and (b) affirmation, belonging, and commitment. Participants respond to statements regarding their ethnicity (e.g., “I have a clear sense of my ethnic background and what it means for me”) by indicating agreement with each statement on a 1-4 Likert-type scale. Scores are averaged to compute a mean for the total score and the two subscales. Studies with the MEIM have demonstrated ethnic identity’s positive relationship with self-esteem (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0743558411412955">Phinney, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0743558411412955">Roberts et al., 1999</xref>, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0743558411412955">Smith, Walker, Fields, Brookins, &amp; Seay, 1999</xref>).</p>

We used the DA Scale, which asks respondents to describe their attitudes about relating to culturally different people, for example, “I enjoy meeting people from different cultures.” Five items are presented and respondents choose their level of agreement, from 1 (<italic>completely disagree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>completely agree</italic>). A mean is calculated; three items on the DA Scale are reverse coded to control for face validity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0743558411412955">Moely et al.

<p>The GSES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0743558411412955">Schwarzer &amp; Jerusalem, 1995</xref>) was first published in German and has been translated into 26 languages. Its purpose is to assess self-efficacy with questions such as, “I can always manage to solve difficult problems if I try hard enough” and “I can remain calm when facing difficulties because I can rely on my coping abilities.” It contains 10 items, each with a 4-point Likert-type response (1 = <italic>not at all true</italic>, to 4 = <italic>exactly true</italic>). The majority of Cronbach’s alphas in 23 nations were in the upper .80s with none falling below .76 (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0743558411412955">Schwarzer &amp; Jerusalem, 1995</xref>).</p>

<p>The SES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0743558411412955">Eyler &amp; Giles, 1999</xref>) assesses young people’s experiences in service learning programs. Participants indicate the extent to which they <italic>engaged</italic> in experiences rated on a 1-4 scale and what they <italic>learned</italic> from their service rated on a 1-5 scale. In this study, we selected two items related to diversity (e.g., “I interacted with diverse others” and “I learned to appreciate diverse cultures”) to examine in relation to the MEIM and DA Scale and two items related to self-efficacy (“I had important responsibilities” and “I felt I made a real contribution”) to examine in relation to the GSES.</p>

<title>Design and Analyses</title>
<p>Given the dearth of research on East African youth, we chose a mixed-methods approach, combining standard quantitative measures with open-ended questions. Mixed methods are helpful when conducting research in a new culture and also for illuminating aspects of human development that are contextually and culturally situated, such as self-efficacy and identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0743558411412955">Yoshikawa, Wesiner, Kalili, &amp; Way, 2008</xref>). The study was discovery-oriented due to the lack of international and comparative research. Nonetheless, we had some predictions, such as that ethnic identity would be related to positive diversity attitudes and to self-efficacy within and across groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0743558411412955">Blash &amp; Unger, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0743558411412955">Phinney et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0743558411412955">Roberts et al., 1999</xref>). Regarding national differences, we expected that Ugandan and Tanzanian youth would define their ethnicity by tribe and U.S. youth by their ethnic or racial group (e.g., White/Caucasian, African American/Black, Latino/a). In light of differing sociopolitical contexts, we expected Tanzanians to define ethnicity in terms of nationhood compared to Ugandans, whom we thought would hold greater tribal-based loyalties. We expected ethnic identity would be higher among Ugandan youth, while Tanzanian youth would have more positive diversity attitudes. In terms of United States and East African differences, we surmised that U.S. participants could have less developed ethnic identification due to the majority (i.e., White) make-up of the sample. We had no basis for expecting national differences in self-efficacy.</p>
<p>For the entire sample and each country we report psychometric properties for the MEIM, GSES, and DA measures with Cronbach’s alphas, bivariate correlations, and confirmatory factor analyses (CFA). The goal of CFA was to examine whether the data fit the purported structure of the measures, and for the MEIM, to examine the one and two factor structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0743558411412955">Roberts et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0743558411412955">Worrell et al., 2006</xref>). We examined bivariate correlations to determine the relationships between self-efficacy, diversity attitudes, and ethnic identity. To examine group differences we performed a Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) on the MEIM, DA, and GSES, followed by Tukey’s Post Hoc Tests for significant group differences.</p>
<p>To examine our hypotheses about national differences in how ethnicity is conceptualized. We categorized answers to the question, “what is your ethnicity?” by the general concept provided (e.g., nationality, tribe, racial/ethnic group) and by specific categories within each theme (e.g., Ugandan, Buganda; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0743558411412955">Ratner, 2006</xref>). Frequency counts and percentages are provided. To look for evidence of contextual relevance, the first and second authors examined qualitative data from open-ended questions for references to self-efficacy or diversity. Sentences or phrases reflecting relevant content were highlighted and then further reviewed and organized to illustrate participants’ views on diversity or self-efficacy in relation to their program involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0743558411412955">Ratner, 2006</xref>).

<sec id="section16-0743558411412955">
<title>What is Your Ethnicity?</title>
<p>We assessed whether participants used national origin, linguistic group, tribe, clan, race, or other term to describe their ethnicity. In support of our hypothesis, East African participants primarily defined their ethnicity by tribe compared to U.S. youth who used ethnoracial categories. In our Ugandan sample, 176 participants answered this question, listing 40 different ethnicities. The most common were tribal categories accounting for 53% and representing 29 of the 44 different ethnic groups in Uganda. This was followed by ethnolinguistic group (37%), national identity (5%) and finally, pan-national (3%). The most frequent ethnicity was Bantu (58), a language group, while Mutoro (35), Muganda (24), and Musoga (35) reflected dominant tribes in the data collection sites. Nine youth described their ethnicity as nation-based (e.g., Ugandan), while five used the pan-African identity (African), and three used a racial designation (Black or Black African). Seven others, in addition to those listing Bantu, used ethnolinguistic designations (e.g., Nilotic).</p>
<p>Among Tanzanian participants, 61 ethnic designations based on tribes were mentioned. Muha (47) was the largest group represented, followed by Mbembe (24), Muhasa (14), Mugoni (11), and Mpare and Sukuma. Two youth described themselves as Arab, while four were KiKongo (i.e., Congolese). Given the historical political importance of collective identity under Nyerere, we were surprised to find that no Tanzanians described themselves as Tanzanian.</p>
<p>The U.S. sample was primarily composed of Whites (78%), followed by two participants each identifying as Asian American, African American, and Latino. One participant indicated American Indian, six reported being from a multicultural/mixed background, and two noted “other.” When asked to state their ethnicities, the majority reported Caucasian or White. A few White youth noted countries of origin of parents or ancestors (e.g., Irish/Hungarian/Scottish, Irish/Italian/British), while those indicating a bicultural or mixed ethnicity indicated combinations of ethnicities (e.g., Irish/English/Native American) or multicultural or slang terms, such as <italic>Hapa</italic> (i.e., part Asian).</p>

<p>The data on the MEIM were mixed, whether viewed by total sample or by national group. For example, with respect to the MEIM one-factor model, Normed Fit Index (NFI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0743558411412955">Bentler &amp; Bonett, 1980</xref>), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0743558411412955">Bentler &amp; Bonett, 1980</xref>) and the Comparative Fit Index (CFI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0743558411412955">Bentler, 1990</xref>), tended to be low, while the RMSEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0743558411412955">Steiger, 1990</xref>) tended to be slightly high. Fit tended to be better for the Tanzanian and Ugandan participants as compared to the U.S. group, see for instance, Goodness of Fit Index (GFI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0743558411412955">Jöreskog, &amp; Sörbom, 1981</xref>), Adjusted Goodness of Fit Index (AGFI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0743558411412955">Jöreskog, &amp; Sörbom, 1989</xref>) and the RMSEA. As for the MEIM two-factor model, with subscales of affirmation and exploration, a similar trend was noted among the fit indices, with a few exceptions (e.g., RMSEA in the Ugandan sample was consistent with the recommended cutoff). Neither model appeared to fit the overall sample reasonably well.</p>
<p>Because some data were suggestive of reasonable fit while others were not, additional analyses were performed to examine the MEIM subscales. As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0743558411412955">Table 4</xref>, the MEIM affirmation subscale fit the data in terms of the total sample and the Tanzanian sample. Data were mixed for the Ugandan sample and were not supportive of model fit in the U.S. sample. With respect to the MEIM exploration factor, data were mixed in the Tanzanian and Ugandan samples (more support was found with Tanzanians), as well as the total sample; however the model fit the U.S. data well. These data speak to the structural validity of the scales when used with these respective samples.</p>
<p>As for the GSES (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0743558411412955">Table 4</xref>), data were supportive of the measure with the Tanzanian and Ugandan samples, as well as the overall sample. However, with regard for the U.S. sample, fit indices were not suggestive of reasonable model fit. This finding is unusual and stands in contrast to the psychometric literature on the GSES. It is possible that the small sample size and more variable nature of the U.S. group contributed to these results.</p>

<title>Relationships Between Ethnic Identity, Self-efficacy, and Diversity Attitudes</title>
<p>We expected that ethnic identity would correlate positively with self-efficacy and diversity attitudes in the overall sample and in each group. The MEIM total score was positively correlated with the GSES (<italic>r</italic> = .14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) in the overall sample. In partial support of our hypotheses, significant correlations were found for Tanzanian (<italic>r</italic> = .13, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and Ugandan (<italic>r</italic> = .19, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) participants, but not for the U.S. group. Given the ethnic make-up of the U.S. participants (78% White), our results are consistent with the notion that majority groups may not base feelings of self-worth on ethnic identity achievement (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0743558411412955">Phinney, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0743558411412955">Phinney &amp; Alipuria, 1990</xref>). We hypothesized that ethnic identity would correlate positively with the DA Scale in all groups. The affirmation subscale was positively correlated with DA (<italic>r</italic> = .11, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) in the overall sample, however, contrary to our predictions, no significant correlations were found between DA and the total MEIM or the exploration subscale. This may be associated with the low reliability of the DA Scale in the African samples.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0743558411412955">
<title>Exploration of National Differences</title>
<p>National differences were explored on measures. We report our analyses on measures with adequate internal consistency, including the MEIM total, MEIM affirmation, and GSES, but not the MEIM exploration or DA Scale. Still, results must be considered in light of the psychometric properties that vary in acceptability. We hypothesized that the Ugandans would present significantly higher ethnic identity compared to Tanzanians and that the U.S. sample would be lowest. As expected, East African youth scored higher on the MEIM compared to U.S. youth, however they did not differ from one another. A MANOVA revealed group differences for the total MEIM score, <italic>F</italic>(2, 545) = 16.85, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, <italic>n</italic><sup>2</sup> = .06, although the effect was small (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0743558411412955">Table 2</xref>). Tukey’s post hoc tests revealed lower ethnic identity scores in the U.S. sample (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). In addition, the U.S. participants scored lower on the affirmation subscale compared to Tanzanian and Ugandan participants (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001), while the latter two groups did not differ. We surmised that lower salience of ethnic identity among our U.S. participants could be accounted for by the majority percentage of Whites. We compared the scores for our ethnic minority and majority participants. Independent <italic>t</italic>-tests revealed no significant differences in the MEIM or GSES for ethnic minority versus White U.S. participants. Although research would suggest that ethnic minorities typically score higher on measures of ethnic identity (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0743558411412955">Avery, Tonidandel, Thomas, Johnson, &amp; Mack, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0743558411412955">Phinney &amp; Alipuria, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0743558411412955">Roberts et al., 1999</xref>), this was not the case for our sample.</p>
<p>Although we had no hypotheses about national differences in self-efficacy, moderate group differences were found on the GSES, <italic>F</italic>(2, 545) = 55.87, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>n</italic><sup>2</sup> <italic>=</italic>.17. U.S. participants scored lower on the GSES compared to the Tanzanian sample, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; however, the U.S. sample scored higher than the Ugandan sample, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001. Differences were also found between Tanzanian and Ugandan youth with Tanzanians scoring higher, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001. The lower results in the Uganda group may be an artifact of sampling. Though students in both R&amp;S and WCU have opportunities for community service and active learning, the R&amp;S model particularly stresses youth leadership and voice and it is possible that this translates into more opportunities for growing self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0743558411412955">Johnson-Pynn &amp; Johnson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0743558411412955">2010</xref>). We had predicted that Tanzanian youth would have higher scores on diversity attitudes than Ugandans and that both would score higher than the U.S. sample. Although the scores appear consistent with our results, we do not include this analysis due to low internal consistency and lack of other psychometric support for the DA Scale.</p>
<p>In this study, we included participants attending environmental clubs in secondary school settings which constituted a wide age range. Bivariate correlations revealed that age was significantly correlated with the GSES (r = 0.21, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) but not with the MEIM. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0743558411412955">Phinney (1992)</xref> found that high school students had higher scores on ethnic identity achievement compared to middle school students, other studies did not find such a developmental trend (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0743558411412955">Branch, 2001</xref>; Branch, Tayal, &amp; Triplett, 2000). Years in school was not significantly correlated with the MEIM or GSES. Given that the Tanzanians were older, on average by 1 year, and Ugandans had one more year of school, we examined national differences controlling for age and school. With a Multivariate Analysis of Covariance (MANCOVA), national group differences remained, <italic>F</italic>(2, 532) = 19.52, p &lt; .01, <italic>n</italic><sup>2</sup> <italic>=</italic> .16. Significant differences were found between groups on the MEIM total score and <italic>F</italic>(2, 532) = 17.60, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, n<sup>2</sup> = .06 and GSES, <italic>F</italic>(2, 532) = 43.27, p &lt; .05, n<sup>2</sup> = .14.</p>

<title>Qualitative Responses</title>
<p>In open-ended questions about experiences in their clubs, Tanzanian and Ugandan participants indicated gains in diversity attitudes and self-efficacy, but not explicitly in their ethnic identity. U.S. participants mentioned efficacy and confidence but did not refer to diversity, ethnicity, cultural or racial awareness or skills (Although four mentioned a better realization of the global nature of environmental issues, and three stated that they had grown in awareness of struggles faced by people living in poverty). However, East African youth explicitly stated they had gained positive attitudes and skills for interacting with diverse groups (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0743558411412955">Table 5</xref>). Some youth reflected on gains in self-competence and leadership skills that would be important for working with others in a multicultural environment (e.g., “This change is attributed to the fact that I have been a leader and in leadership one learns many things; how to deal with others, self control, being transparent, tolerating others and interpersonal relationships”).</p>

<p>Participant statements reflected changes in diversity attitudes and in self-efficacy. For example, “WCU has changed my life because I have got to learn new things, visit many places concerning wildlife and have also learned to associate with many different backgrounds.” The benefits of socialization in the group were further evidenced in statements of increased self-confidence and commitment to action, for example, “I feel I need to attain my goals, care about my community and also to solve my problems and also to face my challenges. I have learned to work with a group of people of different ethnic groups in my community. It has greatly made me more social to people.” We should note that the British-influenced pedagogical style in most East African schools encourages rote memorization and dictation, and does not readily reinforce student voice or leadership in the classroom. As such, participation in groups, such as WCU and R&amp;S, affords a rare opportunity for the development of youths’ social skills and confidence in a less structured format in which learning is experiential and youth ownership of ideas and projects is encouraged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0743558411412955">Johnson-Pynn &amp; Johnson, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Although East Africans referenced other tribes and cultural groups, no explicit statements were made referring to participant’s own ethnic identity development, such as connection or belonging to one’s tribe or nation. However, youth’s knowledge about community concerns and expressions of commitment to community may be seen as an expression of connection, pride, and belonging to a particular group (affirmation), suggesting identity development. For example, one youth expressed, “I have got a feeling that I should help my fellow students, community, culture, country and my home and people outside.” Moreover, youth’s many remarks about other groups suggest increased awareness and knowledge with regards to other cultural groups and new levels of openness toward them; both important aspects in the development of ethnic identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0743558411412955">Ripke et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our results show support for the applicability of the interrelated constructs of ethnic identity, self-efficacy, and intercultural attitudes in different contexts and some promise for existing measures. East African participants stated that getting along with other tribes and enhanced efficacy were positive benefits of club involvement, revealing the universal importance of cross-cultural interactions in young people’s lives. Still, there is a need to proceed with caution when transferring specific concepts and measures across settings and populations. Below we discuss the relevance of the constructs, the reliability and validity of the measures, implications, and limitations.</p>
<sec id="section25-0743558411412955">
<title>Self-Efficacy</title>
<p>The GSES, showed respectable psychometric properties, including internal consistency reliability, correlations with other indices, and underlying factor structure in Tanzanian and Ugandan participants. Unlike other cross-national studies and the general conceptualization of self-efficacy as a rather stable construct (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0743558411412955">Scholz et al., 2002</xref>), we found a positive correlation with age and self-efficacy. This may be related to the African context, where learning is more experiential and that, as one grows older, they are given increasing opportunities and responsibilities that build self-efficacy. Moreover, in their environmental programs, older students in all countries are given more chances to develop confidence and skills through hands-on planning and program implementation which bolster self-efficacy over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0743558411412955">Johnson-Pynn &amp; Johnson, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0743558411412955">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0743558411412955">Johnson &amp; Johnson-Pynn, 2007</xref>). Open-ended remarks supported the relevance of self-efficacy in East Africa and indicated an increase in confidence as a result of club involvement. Because our sample consisted of youth and young adult members of environmental programs it is possible that their self-efficacy is higher than youth who do not have such opportunities. Given the apparent viability of the GSES measure in both East African settings, including the Kiswahili version, we suggest that future studies be conducted with the GSES and expanded to a wider range of participants, including vulnerable populations such as internally displaced youth in conflict ridden environments (street children, AIDS orphans, former child soldiers). Given the collectivist orientations of most African societies, we suggest that social or collective efficacy (i.e., a belief in the group’s ability to approach shared problems and accomplish shared goals) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0743558411412955">Bandura, 2001</xref>) may be equally or even more relevant for East Africans and should be included in future studies.</p>

<p>Overall, some qualitative support was shown for the importance of positive intergroup attitudes and the relationship of ethnic identity to those attitudes in our East African sample. The MEIM had mixed psychometric results and fit indices that were about the same for the one and two factor models. The DA Scale had questionable internal consistency reliability. Findings associated with the MEIM exploration subscale and the diversity (DA) scale raise questions about their current utility and limitations in an East African context. More research is needed in the adequate conceptualization of ethnic identity and intercultural attitudes and their reliable measurement.</p>
<p>Although the psychometric properties of measures were variable, we can offer some explanations. <italic>Affirmation</italic> had stronger psychometric support than the <italic>Exploration</italic> factor, and may be more contextually relevant. In East Africa, one’s culture or ethnicity may be particularly salient for youth, as it is evident in daily life, expressed through dress, music, craft, languages, religions, and relational styles. This idea is supported by the fact that the affirmation factor was higher in East African youth compared to U.S. youth and particularly high in Tanzania (e.g., in items such as “I feel good about my cultural or ethnic background”). Thus, Tanzanians have not abandoned their tribal identities in favor of national identity, but instead appear to be holding both in tandem. This is consistent with a bicultural/multicultural approach to identity which is considered psychologically and behaviorally adaptive for U.S. youth and others living in multicultural societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0743558411412955">Johnson &amp; Tucker, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Exploration, however, showed weaker psychometric support and might be less relevant in East Africa, where, unlike the United States, there is no hugely dominant majority ethnic group. Both Tanzanian and Ugandan participants indicated their lowest scores on the same two items of the exploration subscale that asked about their ethnic history and being active in organizations that include mostly members of their ethnic group. These actions may be necessary in the United States, where there is a need to explore ethnicity, especially for minorities in the context of a dominant (White) majority culture. Perhaps in East Africa, in the midst of a more obvious and mutual cultural diversity, where multiple languages are spoken, varieties of traditional dress are donned, and different religious customs are practiced, tribal and clan identities are simply a fact of life (i.e., affirmed) that need not be searched for or explored.</p>

<title>Changing Contexts, Changing Identities</title>
<p>Around the world, youths contexts are changing. Despite the developmental benefits of youth-community connections, the idea of community has become more fragile in the United States in the last half of the 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0743558411412955">Benson, Scales, &amp; Mannes, 2003</xref>). Survey-based studies of hundreds of U.S. youth in suburban, rural, and urban communities found that reports of community support are relatively uncommon regardless of gender, grade, parental education, or race and ethnicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0743558411412955">Benson et al., 2003</xref>). The full impact, positive and/or negative, of the rise in social networking and “virtual communities” on youth’s identities and sense of community have yet to be discovered. On-line networking, for example, may offer youth the chance to connect with others in meaningful ways, such as around a common cause, and also offer empowerment tools, attributes that could cultivate shared identity, efficacy, and provide a platform for civic engagement. Increased multiculturalism in the United States and an emerging White minority, combined with the current economic downfall, have implications for youth’s identities and intercultural interactions, for better or worse. Opportunities for U.S. youth to interact with and work alongside diverse others should be encouraged, as should an educational curriculum that is not only relevant and inclusive of multicultural groups in the United States, but is internationalized for relevance in a global context.</p>
<p>In sub-Saharan Africa, one of the most profound changes impacting youth is a loss of cultural customs and local community support as a consequence of industrialization, technological advances, and rural to urban migration. Economic strains have forced parents to leave their families to find work, while children attend boarding schools far from their villages. Displacement and/or loss of families and communities due to poverty, war and pandemics, such as AIDS, have weakened social supports for youth. Reduced contact with village elders, customs, and values may leave gaps in youth’s cultural knowledge and values resulting in community disconnect and disengagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0743558411412955">Maathai, 2008</xref>). Indeed, among U.S. youth, it is this loss of community that is implicated in the decline in civic engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0743558411412955">Benson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0743558411412955">Limber &amp; Kaufman, 2002</xref>). Supporting youth development in contexts besides villages, such as at schools, is needed to enhance traditional cultural education and to cultivate engagement.</p>
<p>Another major sociocultural shift in East Africa is a changing notion of youth” which today, can extend from childhood into the 30s and beyond. This was seen in the age range of our East African participants. Although the United Nations defines youth by age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0743558411412955">United Nations, 2009b</xref>), African concepts tend to rely on sociodevelopmental status and cultural milestones, rather than age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0743558411412955">African Union, 2006</xref>). Youth traditionally became young adults when they were marriageable, which meant economical viability to support a family and pay for bride wealth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0743558411412955">Cheney, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0743558411412955">Chigunta, 2002</xref>). In countries with rampant poverty and pervasive school disruptions, this transition has become increasingly difficult extending the “youth class” in sub-Saharan Africa well into young adulthood. However, child soldiers and street children have forced policy makers to include younger children in that definition in order to deal with the challenges that go with “youth status” (e.g., HIV and other STDs, rape, unwanted pregnancies, substance abuse, violence; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0743558411412955">Cheney, 2007</xref>). In both cases, African children, adolescents, and emerging adults vie for inclusion in NGO and government sponsored programs offering education, resources and opportunities through “youth programs.”</p>
<p>Future studies should pay attention to shifting multicultural dynamics and shifting identities. Some African leaders, including Museveni, have espoused a shift from community (i.e., tribal or clan identities) to national identity and loyalty to the nation state. However, loyalties to the nation state are fragile in East Africa and the governments are not yet stable, transparent, or cohesive enough to promote trust or a sense of security among the citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0743558411412955">Maathai, 2008</xref>). Culturally competent service models in the United States urge against such “color-blind” or “culture-blind” approaches as devaluing the important roles of culture, race, and ethnicity in human development and behavior. In the United States, multicultural education competencies and diversity awareness have made their way into educational systems and most youth-serving programs. It is argued that, for advances to be made, socially constructed and harmful constructs such as “race” must be recognized for the powerful influence they exert through access to goods and services and, in the denial of basic human rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0743558411412955">Helms, 1990</xref>). We agree that acknowledging the complexities of identity and developing an appreciation of various ethnic, tribal, and community identities are crucial processes in the development of just and democratic societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0743558411412955">Johnson et al., in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0743558411412955">Kibanja et al., in press</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section28-0743558411412955">
<title>Implications and Future Directions</title>
<p>Different aspects of ethnic identity were emphasized in each locale (tribe, clan, or linguistic group in East Africa and ethnicity based on skin color in the United States). Although we expected Tanzanians to espouse a shared, national identity, tribal categories dominated. Responses to open-ended questions of ethnicity will be affected by the “context of the asking” (e.g., who is asking, where the asking is taking place). Different concepts of identity have implications for visibility and mutability of chosen and ascribed identities. Visible ethnic groups (e.g., based on phenotypic features) may face oppression or receive power and privilege in different ways and, to a different extent than identity characteristics that can be hidden or changed (e.g., there has been a recent string of attacks on person with Albinism in Tanzania). Previously in Uganda, it was not uncommon for persons to move from one location to another, learn a new language, and take on a new ethnic identity, one that was more tied to place and occupation than phenotype or tribal heritage. Therefore, multiple identities should be explored. Interactions between ethnic and sexual orientation identity present unique challenges for youth and would be important to explore cross-contextually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0743558411412955">Johnson &amp; Tucker, 2008</xref>). This is critical in Uganda, where efforts are underway to punish gay and lesbian persons, and those that do not turn them in, with severe punishments including death (Sharlet, 2009). We argue that the targeting of sexual minorities in Uganda, spurned by United States-based evangelical movements represents a new form of intercultural conflict resulting from identity politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0743558411412955">Johnson et al., in press</xref>). There is an unfulfilled need in the literature to incorporate diverse sociocultural aspects of identity and their interactions in understanding youth development and civic engagement.</p>
<p>In light of youth’s statements related to community and the fact that ethnicity in East Africa has historically been tied to geographic origin, we suggest that ethnic identity may be more inclusive than in the United States. Place identity, for example, or sense of community (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0743558411412955">Newbrough &amp; Lorion, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0743558411412955">Proshansky, Fabian, &amp; Kaminoff, 1983</xref>) may be particularly important aspects of young people’s emerging sense of self. Spiritual or religious identity is also an integral aspect of ethnicity in an East African context. Furthermore, in societies with great reliance on natural resources and subsistence agriculture, environmental identity and connection to nature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0743558411412955">Opotow &amp; Clayton, 2003</xref>) are identity constructs that should be explored due to their growing implications for civic and social engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0743558411412955">APA, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>To advance identity literature, research should proceed with multiethnic and majority populations across a range of cultural environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0743558411412955">Sneed, Schwartz, &amp; Cross, 2006</xref>). Future research should aim for an understanding of ethnicity that is both locally relevant and, to the extent possible, universally understood or compared. A better understanding of the meaning of ethnic identity should include top-down and bottom-up inquiry to ensure cross-cultural and contextual accountability. Ethnographic, focus group, or key informant interviews with village elders, parents, teachers, and youth could elucidate the constructs, their value, and relationship to other youth outcomes. Qualitative approaches to data analysis, such as grounded theory, may further our understanding of the meaning of ethnicity, identity, and intergroup attitudes and how they contribute to the concept of what it means to emerge as a healthy and productive young adult. Tribal, religious, and other cultural traditions could be explored for values, lessons, songs, or other content that has been used to reinforce positive intercultural attitudes, social justice attitudes, or sustainable choices regarding natural resources. For example, among the Chaaga and Mpare tribes, traditional rivals in the Mt. Kilimanjaro region of Tanzania, Mpare were traditionally responsible for assistance with funerary tasks upon the death of a Chaaga, which helped to reinforce intercultural bonds and resource sharing (V. Temu, personal communication, July 27, 2009).</p>
<p>In order to promote harmonious relations between cultures, positive diversity attitudes must be encouraged. Youth programs can provide a nurturing context for the exploration and formation of ethnic identity. In so doing, they can facilitate contact and group interaction among youth from different tribes, increase youth’s knowledge of environments and cultures, and enhance appreciation and respect for diverse tribes, language groups, and regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0743558411412955">Ripke et al., 2008</xref>). Our results indicate that youth programs, such as R&amp;S and WCU, offer opportunities for connecting across cultures, developing confidence, and engaging young people in their communities. Although we did not conduct a program evaluation, youth’s statements are consistent with research on youth development and service learning in the United States, indicating that programs can enhance self-efficacy and positive attitudes towards diverse groups in society (Catalano, et al., 2002; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0743558411412955">Myers-Lipton, 1996</xref>). Youth programs are growing in East Africa, however, membership is not the norm, nor is it available to most. With so many African families living in poverty, many cannot secure adequate resources such as school fees or uniforms, let alone time or fees for extracurricular activities that might preclude youth’s contribution to their families’ subsistence.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study had a number of limitations. The analysis was based on data collected as part of a larger study on youth civic engagement, so more in-depth qualitative accounts of ethnicity are not available. Selection bias could have resulted in higher scores from our participants (who were given opportunities to participate in environmental programs) compared to youth not involved in such programs. Data were collected from youth attending school which presents limits related to selection bias and external validity, especially in East Africa where we would expect drastic differences in the situations and resources of those attending and not attending school (e.g., degree of poverty, marital status, employment). Compared to nonmembers, youth who are involved in such programs may present characteristics (e.g., higher socioeconomic status, ambition, openness to experience) that may not be the norm. Moreover, R&amp;S and WCU are designed to enhance personal and social development so scores could be inflated due to program effects and thus, not applicable to those who have less access to resources and opportunities. However, this common feature (environmental club members) aids in our cross-national comparisons. Another limitation is the smaller U.S. sample. Although the U.S. group’s responses to measures yielded adequate internal consistency reliabilities, Levene’s tests for equality of variance were significant. However, our results should be robust to the differences in variability. Although studies of the GSES have been conducted in a range of countries, research with the MEIM has been largely limited to samples within the United States. Given the suspect psychometric properties of these standard measures, findings based on them should be interpreted with caution.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our results lend support to the notion that ethnic identity and self-efficacy are relevant concepts among East African youth. East African participants considered attitudes towards different tribes to be a positive aspect of their personal and social development. Participants expressed behaviors and feelings, such as interacting with other tribes, being more comfortable with other cultures, and an increased valuing of what other groups had to offer as club benefits. This reveals the universal importance of intercultural attitudes and cross-cultural interactions to young people’s abilities and lives. Despite the potential relevance of these constructs, there is a need to proceed with caution. The exploration scale of the MEIM and the diversity attitudes scales had unacceptable internal consistency and factor structures. Researchers need to be aware of the limits of these measures and the diversity with which identity may be viewed across cultural and sociopolitical landscapes. An international research agenda based on multiple paths of inquiry is essential to understand youth ethnic identity and interactions in a global, multicultural society.</p>
