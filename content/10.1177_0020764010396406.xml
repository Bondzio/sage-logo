<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Socioeconomically disadvantaged adults experience greater healthcare disparities and increased risk of depression compared to higher-income groups.</p>
<p><bold>Aim:</bold> To create a depression care model for disadvantaged adults utilizing service agencies, through a community–academic partnership.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Using participatory research methods, an organizational needs assessment was performed to ascertain depression care needs, identify barriers to clients receiving treatment, and marshal resources. Interviews and surveys were conducted with community organizational leaders. Focus groups were conducted with clients who used the service agencies.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Interviews and surveys identified barriers including discontinuity of care and unmet basic needs for food, housing, health insurance and transportation. Focus groups enriched the understanding of barriers including lack of motivation to seek depression care, lack of social support and needed resources for the uninsured, underinsured and homeless. The findings were used to develop a depression care model combining depression management with motivational interviewing to evaluate and meet needs, and peer education to motivate and provide support.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This partnership facilitated the development of a community-driven intervention that academic researchers acting alone could not realize. To provide depression care to socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals, the intervention must include mitigating solutions to barriers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Social factors are among the most powerful determinants of poor health and related inequalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020764010396406">Marmot and Bell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020764010396406">Raphael, 2006</xref>) because people of low socioeconomic status (SES) have limited access to the social resources that determine good health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020764010396406">Commission on Social Determinants of Health, 2008</xref>). Disadvantaged individuals also experience higher degrees of stress and increased risk of depressive symptoms compared with higher-income groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020764010396406">Aneshensel, 2009</xref>). Approximately 31% of people in the US are affected by mental disorders with major depression estimated to affect nearly 7% of all Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020764010396406">Kessler et al., 2005</xref>). Although research in the past decade demonstrates increasing trends in acceptability of mental health treatment seeking, barriers for receiving appropriate and acceptable care persist for disadvantaged populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020764010396406">Mojtabai, 2007</xref>), particularly minorities, low-income individuals, and elderly persons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020764010396406">Dobalian and Rivers, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020764010396406">Neighbors et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0020764010396406">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). The poor are especially at risk for having mental health problems and depression is the primary health issue. Only half of <italic>all</italic> US adults with diagnosable mental disorders receive care, while the proportion of disadvantaged persons referred to or treated for mental disorders is even lower because of economic and systemic barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0020764010396406">Wang et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Research offers several explanations for barriers to seeking mental healthcare: (1) beliefs that mental disorders are not serious enough for treatment or would resolve without treatment, (2) beliefs that treatment is ineffective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020764010396406">Kessler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020764010396406">Mechanic, 2002</xref>), (3) limited insurance coverage, (4) the fact that help seeking is time consuming and inconvenient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020764010396406">Kessler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020764010396406">Mechanic, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0020764010396406">Wells et al., 2002</xref>) and (5) a lack of transportation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0020764010396406">Wells et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Elders, especially African Americans with mental illness, are more likely to be misdiagnosed, lack resources and lack access to a regular source of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020764010396406">Neighbors et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0020764010396406">Snowden, 2001</xref>). Other barriers to treatment seeking by disadvantaged and minority populations include stigma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020764010396406">Brown et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020764010396406">Corrigan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020764010396406">Cruz et al., 2008</xref>) and negative attitudes towards treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020764010396406">Barney et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020764010396406">Brown et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020764010396406">Kessler et al., 1994</xref>), lack of social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020764010396406">Kawachi and Berkman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020764010396406">Latkin and Curry, 2003</xref>) and mistrust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020764010396406">US Department of Health and Human Services (US DHHS), 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0020764010396406">Whaley, 2001</xref>). These barriers challenge healthcare systems to offer depression care services to disadvantaged populations that are accessible, acceptable and applicable to those receiving care.</p>
<p>For the poor in the US, social service agencies and volunteer support networks are the primary or sole source of mental healthcare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0020764010396406">US DHHS, 1999</xref>). Social service agencies are particularly adept at recognizing and addressing the social context of illness, such as employment, housing and social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020764010396406">Boyle, 2007</xref>). Therefore, these agencies offer a unique gateway to disadvantaged individuals with mental illness for researchers who are seeking to introduce novel programmes and services. Collaborations among researchers, social service agencies and healthcare centres that develop effective models of depression treatment (e.g. care management) can help to close gaps in knowledge about the course and outcomes of depression in the context of disparate access to mental healthcare in the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020764010396406">Miranda et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020764010396406">Unutzer et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Participatory research is one approach for communities to join with researchers to shape effective and sustainable mental healthcare models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020764010396406">Cargo and Mercer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020764010396406">Israel et al., 2003</xref>) because it empowers communities from targeted populations by engaging participants in the research process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020764010396406">Metzler et al., 2003</xref>). Community-partnered participatory research has become a successful method in which partnerships focus on building community trust and a commitment to developing projects beneficial to the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020764010396406">Dobransky-Fasiska et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020764010396406">Strand et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0020764010396406">Wells and Jones, 2009</xref>). Participatory research supports mutual ownership and shared decision-making responsibilities, thus providing a means to address the needs of underserved and minority populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020764010396406">Hatch et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020764010396406">Jones and Wells, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020764010396406">Minkler and Wallerstein, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0020764010396406">Schulz et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The purpose of this paper is to describe (1) the results of a needs assessment for mental healthcare developed by a community–academic partnership using a participatory research approach and (2) the application of the results to develop a novel depression care model. The goal was to apply these strategies in the partnerships’ social service agencies so that they derive direct benefit from the participatory process to improve depression care for socioeconomically disadvantaged adults in underserved communities.</p>
<sec id="section2-0020764010396406">
<title>Partnership development</title>
<p>Researchers from Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic at the University of Pittsburgh developed a partnership with the leadership of community organizations that serve the poor and advocate for their health and mental healthcare needs through the creation of a Research Network Development Core (RNDC). The partners include leadership from federally qualified health centres, social service agencies, mental health consumer advocacy agencies and a pharmacy services network for underserved people. The academic investigators consist of psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, a community relations liaison, an outreach coordinator, an ethicist, a researcher who is also a community partner, a NIMH-postdoctoral research fellow, a NIMH Medical Student Research Fellow and a research assistant.</p>
<p>The goal of the partnership was to build research infrastructure and capacity to reduce disparities in the prevention, identification, treatment and outcomes of depression in underserved populations. In the five years since its inception, the RNDC has a sustained membership of 11 community-based social service agencies and healthcare centres and a core of mood disorder researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020764010396406">Dobransky-Fasiska et al., 2009</xref>). The agencies provide a wide range of services and operate in various inner-city neighbourhoods throughout the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0020764010396406">Appendix</xref> for a brief description of the service agencies.)</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0020764010396406" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>For the first collaborative project for the RNDC investigators and community partners, a triangulating qualitative approach was used to identify core resource needs from multiple perspectives. Needs assessments are designed to gather information that would help establish programmes or beneficial changes to those individuals with unmet needs and persons receiving inappropriate or inefficient care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020764010396406">Stevens and Gillam, 1998</xref>). The purpose of this approach was to better understand the mental health needs, concerns and resources of the community partners’ agencies serving disadvantaged persons, and to improve depression recognition and treatment among those individuals receiving services at the partners’ agencies. During discussions, the partnership decided upon (1) the major topics to be assessed, (2) questions that would help identify each agency’s unique services and uncover barriers to mental healthcare treatment in service agencies and (3) the best approach of inquiry for three distinct cohorts within the agencies: leadership, staff and clients. Three different techniques – surveys, interviews and focus groups – were decided upon to enable an enriched collection of data. The assessments were developed by the partnership members. The needs assessment was developed in two phases. The first phase was to use surveys and interviews at the agency level to seek information from the leaders and staff. The second phase was to use focus groups at the client and consumer level. The research conducted at the agencies was approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board in May 2006 and that research conducted with the clients and consumers was approved in April 2008.</p>
<sec id="section4-0020764010396406">
<title>Surveys</title>
<p>Survey methods are a descriptive technique that can be used to uncover an accurate picture of the agencies’ needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020764010396406">Christensen, 1994</xref>). In May 2006, self-administered questionnaires were sent to key agency informants who were selected by the executive directors to provide prespectives on agencies’ needs to serve clients. The survey questions were developed by the partnership members in working meetings. The questions written and agreed upon by the partnership members assessed the following areas: (1) challenges in providing services, (2) challenges in addressing mental health needs, (3) training provided by agency, (4) training needs in recognition of mental health issues, (5) type of staff in need of training, (6) ethical and moral challenges and (7) organizational challenges. Participants rank ordered the items on a five-point Likert scale ranging from ‘very important’ to ‘not important at all’. The respondents were each interviewed and the completed surveys were collected at the time of the interviews.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0020764010396406">
<title>Interviews</title>
<p>Semi-structured interviews with open-ended questions were chosen to allow topic areas to be delved into deeply in a more conversational style. The intention was to acquire a thorough understanding of the agencies’ resources and unmet needs in addressing depression recognition and treatment in disadvantaged communities.</p>
<p>The interviews of approximately one hour were conducted with the same agency leaders who had participated in the surveys at agencies’ sites from May to August 2006. The interview guide included the following topics: (1) employee’s education, professional development and mental health training needs, (2) types of frontline workers, (3) mental healthcare offered, (4) depression screening provided, (5) referral process for depression, (6) role agency wants to play in depression care, (7) barriers for clients to receive depression care, (8) resources or services needed to address barriers to depression care, (9) ethical concerns and (10) researchers addressing mental health needs in a respectful manner. The agency leaders and managers were interviewed (26 of 28 completed interviews) by two investigators (DDF, CB) and a research assistant at community sites.</p>
<sec id="section6-0020764010396406">
<title>Qualitative analysis</title>
<p>Field notes were written and transcribed by the interviewing team. To confirm accuracy of the interpretations, the transcribed interview was sent to the individual participants. Members of the coding team included the team of three interviewers and an NIMH Medical Student Research Fellow (EC). Each coding team member independently conducted line-by-line analysis of the transcripts, which were then sorted into individual themes (e.g. mental health, depression screening) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020764010396406">Hsieh and Shannon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0020764010396406">Wolcott, 2001</xref>). The coding team discussed codes until they reached consensus. Coders used the code book with a qualitative analysis software program (ATLAS.ti) to code the text, support text interpretation, ensure the quality of the coding, and assist with the organization and management of the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020764010396406">Friese, 2004</xref>). The final product was a thematic code book containing a comprehensive set of codes including definitions and subcategories of codes.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section7-0020764010396406">
<title>Focus groups</title>
<p>Focus groups as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020764010396406">Krueger and Casey (2000</xref>: 5) are ‘a carefully planned series of discussions designed to obtain perceptions on a defined area of interest in a permissive, nonthreatening environment.’ One of the distinctive features of focus groups is the group dynamics in which a mix of social characteristics, such as, race, age or socioeconomic status, are considerations in selecting the appropriate mix of individuals in a group. The interactions between ‘group participants provide an audience for each other that encourages a greater variety of communication than is often evident within more traditional methods of data collection’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020764010396406">Kitzinger, 1994</xref>: 108). Focus group interactions reach levels of communication that other methods, such as interviews or questionnaires, cannot.</p>
<p>The purpose of the focus groups was to allow the clients of the community agencies who had experience of depression discuss their concerns and experiences in receiving depression care. This method of data collection is an important and effective process to learning, from the clients’ perspective, about barriers to health and mental healthcare, and the types of care that would be helpful in a community-based environment and underserved population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020764010396406">Krueger and Casey, 2000</xref>). Focus group discussions of approximately one hour were conducted with clients of the agencies to develop a better understanding of their mental health needs and perceived barriers to receiving care.</p>
<p>Client participant inclusion criteria were 18 years of age or older, had a self-reported history of depression, and were willing to discuss their experience with depression. The community partners posted flyers in their agencies and/or referred potential participants to the study. Participants called the research assistant (PP) who conducted a telephone screening to determine eligibility. The focus groups were conducted between July 2008 and April 2009. The focus groups were co-moderated by two of the three investigators (DDF, EC, CB) depending upon their schedules.</p>

<title>Qualitative analysis</title>
<p>The discussions were audio-taped and professionally transcribed for coding. Members of the coding team included two investigators (DDF, MM), a research assistant (PP) and a NIMH Medical Student Research Fellow (EC). Using qualitative content analysis, each coding team member independently conducted line-by-line analysis of the transcripts, which were then sorted into general themes (e.g. barriers to care) to create a code book (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020764010396406">Hsieh and Shannon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0020764010396406">Wolcott, 2001</xref>).

<title>Surveys</title>
<p>Twenty-eight leaders or managers from 10 agencies completed the surveys (one site was unable to participate because of restructuring): executive directors (<italic>n</italic> = 10) and managers or programme directors (<italic>n</italic> = 16).</p>
<sec id="section11-0020764010396406">
<title>Practical barriers</title>
<p>The survey data indicated that when the practical needs of life are not being met, such as access to safe and affordable housing and providing food to one’s family, people have a difficult time dealing with issues such as keeping doctor’s appointments or adhering to medical regimens. Respondents also indicated the importance of providing transportation to mental health services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0020764010396406">
<title>Psychosocial barriers</title>
<p>The psychosocial barriers perceived as the greatest challenges to the agencies included: serving mental health clients with complex needs (e.g. clients with unstable living situations) and clients’ problems with emotional and physical abuse. Other psychosocial challenges that agencies stated as being important included co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders, and the lack of access to mental healthcare for clients with a disability associated with mental illness. Participants indicated equal importance in the ranking of ‘public stigma’ and ‘internalized stigma’ as challenges for clients in receiving mental healthcare.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0020764010396406">
<title>Systems barriers</title>
<p>Agency respondents noted several systems barriers that hindered their clients’ access to healthcare and mental healthcare, such as clients’ mistrust of healthcare systems, dissatisfaction with mental healthcare and difficulty navigating the system. Other important concerns included clients’ lack of access to medications (including psychiatric medications), inadequate services (e.g. clients were frequently tracked to the least expensive services because of inability to pay) and lack of racial and ethnic diversity in mental health professionals.</p>

<sec id="section14-0020764010396406">
<title>Interviews</title>
<sec id="section15-0020764010396406">
<title>Practical barriers</title>
<p>Interview data detected the same fundamental theme found in the survey data: clients’ basic needs must be met before they can engage in healthcare or mental healthcare treatments. Agency respondents reported that the economic and social conditions under which their clients live present many barriers to care. Agency respondents reported that clients with mental health problems have never received treatment or fail to follow up with treatment due to the challenges posed by limited income and unmet basic needs. Clients and consumers have inadequate insurance coverage and ‘patients may not be able to afford the co-pays.’ Transportation is a major barrier since ‘most clients rely on public transportation’ and ‘many don’t have the money for the bus’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0020764010396406">
<title>Psychosocial barriers</title>
<p>Agency respondents discussed the psychosocial barriers that cause clients difficulty in receiving mental healthcare, which included addressing the stigma of mental illness (‘Patients refuse care; the stigma of mental illness is too great.’). Other barriers included the lack of cultural sensitivity in mental health services, being unable to refer clients to appropriate care, and literacy and health literacy issues.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0020764010396406">
<title>Systems barriers</title>
<p>The systems barriers included the need for continuity of care in the recognition and treatment of mental healthcare, similar to a whole-person approach in meeting clients’ needs (medical and social) delivered by the agencies, limited information about available mental health and substance use treatment, and inadequate referral systems. Also, there were long waits for appointments. One agency respondent stated, ‘The services are not available timely enough and people should be seen when they need the care and are ready to accept it.’</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0020764010396406">
<title>Focus groups</title>
<p>Forty participants were screened and eligible for the study. Twenty-nine people participated (eight were no shows and three were not available at the scheduled times) in five discussion groups (consisting of 5, 6, 4, 6, and 8 participants per group). Because of the sensitivity of discussing depression, one of the moderators was a clinician who was prepared to make immediate referral to appropriate facilities for assessment and possible treatment as needed. Participants were compensated $40 for their participation. The majority of the participants were female (69%) and 20 (69%) were African American (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0020764010396406">Table 2</xref>). The average age was 52 years and 62.1% of participants had no more than a high school education. The majority of participants were unemployed (89.7%) and 61.5% (<italic>n</italic> = 16) of the unemployed reported being disabled. A major proportion of participants (76.9%) reported an income under $20,000 (2 people were homeless reporting no income). Most of the participants (83.0%) reported their primary healthcare provider as Medical Assistance (also referred to as Medicaid), which is government paid healthcare services for eligible, low-income or disabled individuals.</p>

<sec id="section19-0020764010396406">
<title>Financial barriers</title>
<p>The clients concurred with many of the survey and interview findings. These are financial and practical barriers. Clients identified minimal financial resources to provide basic needs (e.g. food and housing) as negatively influencing their ability to attend to health and mental healthcare needs. Inadequate health insurance and the inability to pay co-pays for prescriptions was a major concern for clients with minimal means. In addition, clients stressed that not being able to afford transportation (e.g. ‘bus fare is too high nowadays’) affected their ability to find work, stay employed, and to seek therapy and medical visits.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0020764010396406">
<title>Psychosocial barriers</title>
<p>However, clients also reported several psychosocial and systems barriers that provided more insightful information regarding the extent of their unmet needs. Clients discussed the impact of homelessness on their health and mental healthcare needs. Another critical aspect that was not mentioned by the agency leadership was the importance of social support. Clients reported that a lack of social support negatively affects treatment or treatment seeking. ‘A lot of times families don’t want to be bothered or families don’t understand or you’ve changed, you’re no longer a doormat. I mean, just because you’re in therapy doesn’t mean that everybody else is in therapy.’ Clients expressed concerns for the overwhelming stress involved in handling competing demands on their time. In addition, they reported lack of motivation for receiving mental healthcare. Several psychosocial barriers contributed to problems in clients’ seeking treatment, such as addressing the complexity of competing needs and comorbidities (e.g. co-occurring mental illness with substance use), which can influence the low priority that they place on mental healthcare. Poor health literacy contributed to their lack of understanding about the nature of depression. One client explained, ‘I had no idea that I had depression.’</p>
<p>Other barriers included cultural insensitivity (‘I was the only one in the doctor’s office who looked like me and I never felt as I was taken seriously or heard.’) and stigma (internalized and public). One client described stigma: ‘Someone asked her why are you going into that building (Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic), and that was the last time she went into that building.’ In addition, clients reported barriers to treatment and medication issues, including not receiving sufficient medication information from physicians, side effects (e.g. spaced out, mood changes), ineffective medications, problems getting refills, and self-medicating with drugs and alcohol.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0020764010396406">
<title>Systems barriers</title>
<p>Clients reported several systems barriers that impeded treatment seeking. For example, mistrust of the system, access to mental healthcare and lack of continuity of care. Clients noted that in general, there is mistrust of healthcare organizations but that the mistrust is a greater issue when seeking mental healthcare because of previous negative experiences. They stated that access to prescriptions was influenced by their insurance coverage, costs of co-pays and limitations on prescription programmes. The clients perceived that although some of them did have acceptable insurance coverage, there were still limitations on their access to care and ‘that a lot of times you don’t have choice’. Some clients were denied services if they had certain ‘inferior’ insurance coverage. Other barriers noted were the lack of diversity in mental health professionals and appointments not being available when the need presents itself.</p>

<sec id="section22-0020764010396406" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The major finding of this study was that in order to offer depression treatment to disadvantaged individuals in poor communities, the following considerations must be made: (1) establish working relationships with organizations where underserved individuals seek other types of services (e.g. food, shelter), (2) offer education/training and community outreach and (3) include the community participants in programme development to seek input regarding barriers to treatment seeking and preferences for care before implementing depression treatment programmes.</p>
<p>The findings further suggest that providing depression care for socioeconomically disadvantaged adults should include mitigating solutions to barriers. The majority of barriers identified by both the agencies and clients involve difficulties outside the domain of mental health. Similar to clinical case management research, the consumers’ basic needs (i.e. food and access to safe and affordable housing) must be met before depression treatment can be effectively provided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020764010396406">Arean et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020764010396406">Miranda et al., 2003</xref>). Financial disadvantages were noted by the leadership and the clients. The practical barrier findings are consistent with barriers identified in other studies regarding unmet financial needs and inadequate health insurance coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020764010396406">Kessler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020764010396406">Mechanic, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0020764010396406">Wells et al., 2002</xref>). In support of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0020764010396406">Wells et al. (2002)</xref>, transportation is a resource that disadvantaged individuals lack when seeking care. In addition, the present findings show that the dynamic process of interactions among focus group participants indicates that transportation is not only a problem but one that would have to be addressed for clients to be able to seek treatment, no matter how exceptional the care they are offered might be.</p>
<p>Several of the psychosocial barriers are similar to barriers identified in other research, including the negative impact of stigma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020764010396406">Barney et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020764010396406">Brown et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020764010396406">Cruz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020764010396406">Kessler et al., 1994</xref>), lack of motivation to seek treatment, inadequate knowledge about available services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020764010396406">Mechanic, 2002</xref>), and lack of social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020764010396406">Kawachi and Berkman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020764010396406">Latkin and Curry, 2003</xref>). The qualitative approach using triangulation to identify core resources from multiple sources was supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020764010396406">Mechanic (2002)</xref>. Mechanic’s study reviewed national telephone surveys (National Mental Health Association) and interviews with individuals who endorsed symptoms of depression or anxiety. Further, Mechanic suggested that it was difficult to delve into deeper processes without insight or understanding regarding the complexity of issues affecting life decisions as to whether or not to seek treatment. Other barriers that were supported in the literature included medication and treatment issues. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020764010396406">Kessler et al.’s (2001)</xref> National Comorbidity Survey indicated that prevalence for not seeking treatment included not recognizing the need for treatment, lack of medication effectiveness and the preference to solve the problem alone without professional help. Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0020764010396406">Snowden’s (2001)</xref> findings, the focus group participants in the present study noted that they also used the emergency room for food as they ran out of money at the end of the month. Additionally, these findings indicate that homelessness was an obstacle that kept people from seeking treatment. Clients in the focus groups discussed the difficulty of daily existence being further complicated by the perils of homelessness.</p>
<p>Finally, system-wide issues were found that have support in other studies, including that disadvantaged individuals are prevented from seeking mental healthcare by, in part, the complexity of accessing services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0020764010396406">Snowden, 2001</xref>), the inequality of benefits for low-income individuals, and mistrust of the medical and mental health system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020764010396406">US DHHS, 2001</xref>). Other system barriers included findings supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020764010396406">Mechanic (2002)</xref> indicating that those in need did not know where to turn for help and that providers lack cultural sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020764010396406">Cooper-Patrick et al., 1997</xref>). In addition, agency leaders and clients stated that there were long waits for appointments and the care had to be provided when the need was presented. Consequently, there is a need for creative mental health programming that addresses as many of these barriers as possible.</p>
<sec id="section23-0020764010396406">
<title>Promoting action to address needs</title>
<p>In response to the barriers uncovered in both needs assessments, the partnership discerned that two projects were needed: (1) a mental health training programme for frontline staff to provide a foundation of basic understanding of mental illness to those who interacted most frequently with clients but were least well trained to recognize and understand problems and (2) a depression care intervention to offer a responsive model of care in underserved communities. The implementation of the frontline training programme was the first step towards enhancing the capacity for recognition of depression and the foundation to offer a depression care intervention in the agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020764010396406">McMurray et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The second project designed by the partnership to address the assessed needs and eliminate barriers in providing care was a proposed depression care intervention. The process of designing the intervention was an iterative course of action and occurred over a year during monthly community partner meetings, using findings from the needs assessments. The result was a responsive approach to care using a depression care model designed to identify, assess, refer and provide follow-up services on site at the health centres and service agencies, through the use of clinical case management and depression peer education. The intervention included two separate roles working together: a clinical case manager (CCM) and a depression peer educator.</p>
<p>In the proposed model, the CCM would be a master’s level mental health professional (e.g. social worker) who provides clinical and social service expertise on site. During an initial evaluation, the CCM would conduct an engagement session, ‘a single-session pretherapy intervention focused on communicating the therapist’s understanding of patients’ individual and culturally embedded perspectives, helping patients see how the potential benefits of treatment align with their own priorities and concerns, facilitating identification and resolution of ambivalence, and problem-solving barriers to engagement’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0020764010396406">Zuckoff et al., 2008</xref>: 112). Using this approach, the CCM is able to address many of the barriers identified in the needs assessment, including practical barriers (e.g. cost, transportation, lack of health insurance) by eliciting information about obstacles that might interfere with seeking treatment. The CCM would administer relevant testing for the psychosocial and systems barriers (e.g. lack of motivation, low priority given to mental healthcare, low mental health literacy, mistrust of mental healthcare system). In this personal approach, the CCM would discuss the client’s personal story, provide psychoeducation about depression and depression treatment, and facilitate appropriate referral.</p>
<p>The second major role in the model would include a depression peer educator. The key element of peer support that differentiates it from services provided by other providers (e.g. case managers, therapists, social workers) lies in the nature of the relationship between the peer educator and the person receiving their services. The peer educator role would be held by individuals with a history of depression who have received effective treatment. A major aspect of the peer educator role would be to help the consumer by sharing their experiences of depression while reinforcing more effective methods of coping. The peer educator is in a unique position to address the psychosocial barriers of stigma and poor social supports, identified by both clients and agencies as key roadblocks to treatment seeking. The peer educators could serve as role models to others with depression, which helps combat stigmatized beliefs about depression in their communities. Peer educators could also help address practical barriers by providing the social support necessary to encourage clients to seek treatment; this could include assisting them in completing forms to receive services and accompanying them to mental health appointments. Peer educators could also address systems barriers by encouraging clients to advocate for themselves by soliciting information from providers and participating in treatment decisions.</p>
<p>Additionally, as part of developing the depression care model, partners suggested establishing a consortium with greater cross-agency use of services among their members. It was recognized that consumers have substantial needs that are not being met and that partners could pool the resources and services each has to offer, and form more integrated use of these resources. For example, as part of this proposed intervention, a homeless outreach mobile team provided by one of the agencies will work with persons who are homeless and help to engage them to seek treatment. Thus, the CCM, the peer educators and the consortium could provide a unified network that would share services, resources and referrals to better deal with their clients’ barriers to care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0020764010396406">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There are several limitations to this research. The interviews that were conducted with the leadership of the agencies were not audio-taped. Researchers took notes that were transcribed and sent to the participants to ensure accuracy. However, audio-taped discussions would have captured more detail and enhanced the reliability of the findings. Completing the questionnaire beforehand may have prompted the interviewees about what was important to address, which may have limited their responses to the questions asked in the face-to-face interviews. A further limitation is that the clients were not included early in the participatory research process. The process of developing a community partnership and establishing principles of participatory research in disadvantaged communities takes considerable time. Initially, some of the community partners entered this partnership with reluctance due to past experiences of unmet commitments from academic institutions (e.g. promises not met, commitments for funding not kept). Trust had to be gained at the organizational leadership level before access to the agencies’ clients was granted. This issue was addressed thoroughly in a previous paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020764010396406">Dobransky-Fasiska et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The study findings demonstrate the value of participatory research strategies for developing depression care in underserved communities. In working with agencies and the individuals they serve, an innovative model was developed to improve depression care for disadvantaged people by going directly to the organizations where they are most likely to seek help. Becoming familiar with the many dimensions of life experience that affect the most vulnerable people has enriched the knowledge base, enabling the design of models that circumvent the barriers to effective and acceptable care. From this study’s perspective, the participatory aspect is the essential element in this work, unifying the partnership and serving as a catalyst for designing and testing new models.</p>
