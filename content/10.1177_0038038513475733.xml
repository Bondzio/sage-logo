<p>John Scott has written a rich and impressive work of theoretical exegesis and synthesis, drawing upon a compendious knowledge of the development of the social sciences. Its central chapters describe the evolution of eight fundamental concepts (culture, nature, system, space-time, structure, action, mind, development) which he contends comprise the accumulated core of sociological knowledge and reveal ‘fundamental features of social life that are true universals’ (p. 7). The book contains admirably lucid and concise summaries of the establishment and elaboration of those key concepts. One distinctive feature is its emphasis on foundational work in the first half of the 20th century. Continuity, progress and convergence are demonstrated with reference to precursory formulations, often by now largely forgotten authors like Walter Cannon, Ellsworth Huntington and Ralph Linton, of the principles and mechanisms of explanation included in the current synthesis. (The effect is a little Whiggish!) Another valuable aspect is that relevant research in other disciplines, including geography, social psychology, cognitive neuroscience and genetics, rather than being ignored or dismissed out of hand, is reviewed seriously, sometimes with a view to its incorporation and on other occasions to assert the cogency of a sociological critique.</p>
<p>Despite some long sections which might appear in any introduction to sociology, for instance seven pages describing symbolic interactionism (pp. 194–201) or Talcott Parsons on social systems (pp. 96–113), this is no textbook, for its appreciation probably demands professional-level expertise. Nor is it strictly a historical account of the development of sociology; it attends neither to institutional settings and political contexts nor to the role of empirical inquiry. Rather it is a bold, if modestly presented, <italic>apologia</italic> for sociology. Scott argues that there is ‘a common set of <italic>principles</italic> of sociological explanation’ (p. 4), generally accepted across the social sciences, but whose longevity and complementarity is frequently overlooked because of the reprehensible tendency for sociologists to accord exclusive priority to the development of some of those principles at the expense of others. He offers a defence of the discipline against nameless persons, implicitly mostly members internal to the community, who cultivate or condone the theoretical dissention and exclusivity which gives the subject a misleading reputation for irreconcilable disagreement.</p>
<p>In seeking to put the record straight, Scott aims to integrate competing approaches to sociological analysis, demonstrate the cumulative nature of sociological knowledge, and transcend artificial theoretical and disciplinary differences. I would gladly welcome his success. It would be gratifying to believe that sociologists share substantive central principles and that disciplinary fragmentation was an illusion. But, even while recognizing that sociologists collectively have a bad habit of emphasizing and exaggerating their differences to an extent greater than necessary to meet the requirements of scientific inquiry, I remain sceptical. Before reading <italic>Conceptualising the Social World</italic> I was of the opinion that sociology is characterized by disagreements rather than consensus and, as described by Andrew Abbott in <italic>Chaos of Disciplines</italic> (2001), by its perpetual and cyclical revisiting of conceptual and theoretical dilemmas which have proved irresolvable. I am not yet persuaded otherwise. For although all sociological accounts use concepts from Scott’s toolbox, most proficient contemporary sociologists neither do, nor I suspect could, operate consistently with the full set and, moreover, when they use those terms they do not necessarily convey the same preferred meanings.</p>
<p>One disconcerting feature of Scott’s case is that progress seems to halt in the final quarter of the 20th century; while pointing out some loose ends, he offers what sounds like a eulogy, a celebration of the accomplishments of an agent now deceased. Very little of the work of the last 20 years is reviewed and incorporated – unsettling since I would guess that more than half of all the world’s sociological output must have been completed during that period. Moreover, Parsons seems to be the pivotal figure, in the sense that his work receives the most copious citation and explication. Since the repudiation of normative functionalism is widely believed to have produced the unruly theoretical pluralism lamented by Scott, a convincing account is required of why so many of his peers have conspicuously failed to detect the shared common principles lying behind apparently persistent centrifugal disputes. I can conceive of explanations to that effect, including perverse institutional incentives, competition for research reputation, the logic of generational succession within the sociological profession, and distortion of perspective due to insufficient historical distance. Scott at one point does suggest that most scholarly activity is experienced and observed within specialized domains of investigation, which might induce myopia regarding the broader and lasting achievements of the discipline. However, such mechanisms await compelling documentation, and when attempted it is to be hoped that they will not be reducible to pig-headedness, vanity and fashion.</p>
<p>So, while I applaud the ambition of the project in its quest for synthesis, and I have learned a great deal <italic>en passant</italic>, particularly about the ways in which sociology abuts onto and might usefully engage with developments in other social and physical sciences, I fear that the intellectual unification of sociology is being exaggerated. My hunch is that its prolific institutional growth in recent decades is subtended more by a loosely shared sense of what to disagree about than by any concurrence over a set of substantive and positive propositions. However, I look forward to this book stimulating further critical debate to clarify whether, or in what ways, sociology might be cumulative.</p>
