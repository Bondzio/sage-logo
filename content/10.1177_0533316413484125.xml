<abstract>
<p>Based on a talk given in Bozen 2010, the following article was written to give an account of the concepts of free association, group association and group dialogue. According to Foulkes, the advance from psychoanalysis to small group psychotherapy was a step from free association to group association. Pat de Maré conceived the subsequent advance from small group therapy to the group analytic work with median and large groups as a step from group association to group dialogue. The article attempts to elucidate the inherent logic of this development. Special attention is paid to the vicissitudes of interpretation in groups, which are compared to the logic of interpretation as advocated by J. Lacan. The subject of meaning is approached as a crucial issue of group analytic theory and practice. In a final paragraph, the relation between group dialogue and collective consciousness will be explored and the contrasted to Lacan’s notion of the Other.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Viewed in the light of its development, it may be maintained that in group analysis, Patrick de Maré represents the kind of ‘exceptional individual’ Bion referred to as the ‘mystic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0533316413484125">Bion, 1970</xref>: 64). According to Bion, the mystic is someone whose impact on the containing group is always of a ‘disruptive’ character (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0533316413484125">1970</xref>: 64). Whether the creative or the destructive aspects of this disruption will prevail, depends on the quality of the relationship between the container and the contained as Bion said (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0533316413484125">Bion, 1970</xref>: 74). In what follows, I will try to outline some aspects of the impact of Patrick de Maré on group analysis and start from his own claim that what he had done was <italic>‘to apply Foulkesean group analytic concepts to a larger situation’</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 9). In line with this view, de Maré is usually considered to be the ‘acknowledged pioneer’ of large group meetings conducted on group analytic lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0533316413484125">Pines, 2003</xref>: 47). For Rocco Pisani he is the pioneer of working with the so called ‘median group’ which Pisani claims is <italic>‘a development of Foulkes’ group analysis’</italic> located <italic>‘between the small group of Foulkes and the large group’</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0533316413484125">Pisani, 1995</xref>: 61).</p>
<p>For others, like Roberto Schoellberger, de Maré represents the mastermind of a group analytic theory of ‘mind’ (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0533316413484125">de Maré and Schoellberger, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0533316413484125">Schoellberger, 2011</xref>). All these different aspects of de Maré work have been discussed at large and in depth before, mostly with a focus on group size and numbers (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0533316413484125">Waimberg and Schneider, 2003</xref>: 16). However sophisticated they are and whatever conclusions are drawn from them, they all run up to the pertinent question posed by Foulkes: ‘<italic>where does the large group start?</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0533316413484125">Foulkes, 1975 [1990]</xref>: 266). It points to a puzzling problem related not just and not only to group <italic>size</italic>. Putting it forward, Foulkes reminds us that ‘the essential point to remember’ is not the question of size <italic>as such</italic> but the fact that by increasing the number of members <italic>‘quantity becomes quality’</italic> in groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0533316413484125">Foulkes, 1975 [1990]</xref>: 265, italics mine). This resonates well with the statement of de Maré that <italic>‘the increase of size is crucial’</italic> in groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 9):
<disp-quote>
<p>When a group of eight becomes a group of twenty, we begin to have a different level of group activity, representing a different dimension of human experience. We have gone beyond the confines of the familio-centric group; in this larger setting the group acquires another range of meanings, and cultural context becomes the central issue. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 9)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This observation is the empirical basis of group analytic work with larger groups and the subsequent thinking about their dynamics. With regard to the ‘switch-over’ point where exactly a small group turns into a median or a large group we may keep in mind Foulkes’ cautioning that here with regard to this <italic>‘we are moving on a scale where everything is relative’</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0533316413484125">Foulkes, 1975 [1990]</xref>: 265).</p>
<p>In an important way, this statement also relates to the question concerning de Maré’s impact on group analysis. Obviously, it is not enough to assess this only with regard to quantity, group size and not equally in terms of quality too. What then is the particular quality of his thinking and its impact on the development of group analysis? To find this out, we are referred to a close reading of his works, because to understand the originality and the novelty of his thinking, they have to be studied in detail and in context. First of all in relation to the works of Foulkes, an endeavour—which today is not really furthered by their textual basis. Another obstacle is that many statements made by de Maré are being treated as axiomatic by his partisans and those inspired by his work. As a consequence, they are repeated rather than questioned, and cited more often than subjected to critical scrutinizing.</p>
<p>As a starting point, for a study of de Maré and his work we might begin with a quotation from the book on ‘Koinonia’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>) where de Maré writes: <italic>‘A person can be as unaware of his cultural assumptions as of his own unconscious’</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 40). It has not been recognized so far that this statement corresponds almost to the letter and/or to the rhythm of the sentence to a statement of Foulkes, namely his introduction of the social unconscious 40 years earlier.</p>
<p>In 1950, Foulkes had written that <italic>‘the group-analytic situation, while dealing intensively with the unconscious in the Freudian sense, brings into operation and perspective a totally different area of which the individual is equally unaware’</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0533316413484125">Foulkes, 1950 [1984]</xref>: 52). Accordingly, both Foulkes and de Maré shared a common observation, when they pointed out that the individual may be more or less ‘unaware’ of its social context. For me, though, it came as a surprise to discover how close the affinity between their statements. In a playful way, we could be tempted to mix them up, and say that a person ‘can be as unaware of his social unconscious as of his own unconscious’. We might stumble then over the doubling of the unconscious and the irritation associated with the word ‘unaware’ in this Freudian context. In any case, we will have to recognize that there is a connection between the claim of de Maré ‘that the median group enables us to view our macro cultural assumptions more effectively than other settings can do . . .’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 40) and Foulkes’ idea of the social unconscious (making it all the more astonishing to find no reference to this latter term in the book <italic>Koinonia. From Hate, through Dialogue to Culture in the Large Group</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">1991</xref>) (de Maré et al.). Viewed from this perspective, the work on large and median groups appears as an extension as well as an elaboration of Foulkes work on the social unconscious, in fact an off shoot of it as both authors address the impact and importance of unconscious social and/or cultural assumptions. In the light of this I will now review the move from free association in psychoanalysis to group association in group analysis and on to notion of group dialogue as advanced by Pat de Maré.</p>

<sec id="section2-0533316413484125">
<title>I. Median and Large Groups: a Short Description</title>
<p>For de Maré, all groups can be described be in terms of structure, process, content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0533316413484125">de Maré, 1972</xref>) and metastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 23). ‘Structure’ he maintains, refers to the context of the group, i.e. its membership and size while ‘process’ refers to the patterns or styles of communication the group’s context gives rise to: ‘group associations’ in the small group and ‘group dialogue’ in median and large groups. ‘Content’ then refers to the ‘subject matter, themes and topics’ of the group and ‘metastructure’ to its ‘changing cultural patterns’ generated in and by the group process. For de Maré, in the small group, <italic>‘the social context is introduced’</italic> but for the most part ‘taken to mean the family’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 10). Only the larger group, he says <italic>‘presents us with a broader span, a panorama ranging from the inner world at one end to world citizenship at the other’</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 31). Accordingly, there are important differences regarding the dynamics of transference in both:
<disp-quote>
<p>In the small group, it is the conductor who is the main receptacle for projections of parental authority figures, and the individual ego is able to become freer and stronger through identification with the rest of the group. In the larger group, however, the group itself constitutes the canvas onto which the superego is projected, and the conductor, now more appropriately known as the convenor, gives support to the role of individuals at an ego level, encouraging freedom of dialogue and interpreting the nature of the social and cultural pressures. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 35)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>According to de Maré, in larger groups the Super-Ego is no longer located in the figure of conductor but projected on the ‘canvas’ of the group as a whole. As a consequence, the frame of reference for interpretation can no longer be ‘familio-centric’. Instead of uncovering unconscious motives of the group members, the convenor in contrast to the conductor aims at intervening ‘at an ego-level’ by interpreting <italic>‘social and cultural pressures’</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 35).</p>
<p>In Foulkesean terms we might say, in his interventions s/he addresses <italic>unconscious</italic> social and cultural constraints. Therefore, de Maré maintains that because ‘context becomes paramount’ in larger groups, what is to be explored is ‘<italic>the conscious rather than the unconscious</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">1991</xref>: 25, italics mine). This marks an important difference from Foulkes’ view; a difference to be returned to later.</p>
<p>Taking issue with Ezriel’s view of the group situation as a ‘transference situation’ in a group setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0533316413484125">Ezriel, 1950</xref>), and in line with Foulkes’ view put forward in his first book (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0533316413484125">1948</xref>), de Maré also argues that ‘there are significant <italic>non-transference</italic> aspects present in the group, notably a network of human relationships’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 35). In larger groups, he maintains these non-transferential aspects are ‘amplified’ and take on a ‘wider range of changes with distinct qualities as microcultures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">1991</xref>: 35) ranging from a <italic>‘family oedipal or sibling culture, a court of justice, a forum, a primal horde’</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 35). Since the particular <italic>qualities</italic> of these ‘microcultures’ often constitute ‘<italic>impediments to dialogue in the group, it is the primary task of the convenor to attempt to recognize and to communicate them to the group’</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 35).</p>
<p>Regarding the notion of ‘microcultures’, Foulkes himself had distinguished between the group representing a family and the ‘family transference reactions’ it elicited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0533316413484125">Foulkes, 1949 [1984]</xref>: 59) and non-familial transference reactions, like, for instance reactions to the group symbolizing ‘the community as a whole’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0533316413484125">Foulkes, 1948 [1983]</xref>: 168; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0533316413484125">Foulkes and Anthony 1965 [1984]</xref>: 114). De Maré elaborated this distinction when he introduced the distinction between transference, transposition and transformation. <italic>Transference</italic> for him meant a reproduction of past relationships, <italic>‘transferred relationships in psychoanalysis’</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 103), <italic>transposition</italic> as a <italic>‘core concept’</italic> of median group theory and therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 78) <italic>‘consists of the pattern of an individual neurotic response mapped out against its social context’</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 103). And <italic>transformation</italic> for de Maré involves <italic>‘a whole culture being transformed’</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 104), i.e. the re-creation of a whole social context. He wrote:
<disp-quote>
<p>Whilst transference explores the linear causal relatedness of the one-to-one situation, and transposition explores the multi-personal network of the small group matrix, transformation juxtaposes and transforms one subculture, microculture or social culture into another . . .’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 104)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Therefore, larger groups in contrast to small groups are characterized (rather) not by the vicissitudes of (familial) transference(s) but by the dynamics of (non-familial) transpositions and the transformation of <italic>‘one sub-culture, micro-culture or social culture into another’</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 104).</p>

<title>II. Free Association—Group Association</title>
<p>P. de Maré was one of Foulkes’ earliest collaborators. He not only participated in the Northfield experiments but also was a regular member of the discussion group on communication before the First Congress on Mental Health in London in August 1948. His written work sometimes betrays an almost uncanny ability on his part to grasp essential aspects of Foulkes’ group analytic thinking. For instance, in the book written together with Robin Piper and Sheila Thompson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">1991</xref>), with unfailing intuition, he singled out the two most important conceptual pillars of the group analytic edifice, namely localization and free-floating group discussion. He described location (which he mistook for ‘localization’) as ‘the central concept’ of Foulkes, which he claimed had <italic>‘originally</italic> provoked his interest in groups<italic>’</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 149, italics mine). How he could have known this for sure remains a mystery (at least for me). However, his inference was nonetheless absolutely appropriate because as concept ‘location’ indeed captured the gist of Goldstein’s criticism of the notion of ‘localization’ in classical neurology, which Foulkes absorbed in his group analytic thinking (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0533316413484125">Nitzgen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0533316413484125">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0533316413484125">2010</xref>). In this respect, Pisani is certainly right to point out that what de Maré had picked up from Foulkes was first of all his idea of a <italic>‘location of psychic disturbance’</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0533316413484125">Foulkes, 1948</xref>: 21). In the words of Foulkes:
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>We must, however, perceive and evaluate the analytical situation, including all its ‘unconscious’ elements, as determined by the patient’s total life situation, and not, contrariwise, see ‘life’ and ‘reality’ merely as projection, screen and reflector of his ‘unconscious’ fantasies, which they are indeed, at the same time. The truth is, that the two can never been separated.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0533316413484125">Foulkes, 1948 [1983]</xref>: 15, italics mine)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Accordingly, to locate a patient’s psychic disturbance in his ‘total life situation’ became the starting point for de Maré’s group analytic thinking and remained a focus of it throughout. However, as a critical reader of Foulkes, he did not content himself to turn Foulkesean innovations into formulas. Instead, he questioned and scrutinized Foulkes’ work, searching as it were for adequate interpretations of it. This can be seen, for instance in the way he treated one of the most dense phrases of Foulkes’ <italic>Introduction to group analytic psychotherapy</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0533316413484125">1948</xref>). In it, Foulkes claimed that <italic>‘free association is in no way independent of the total situation’</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0533316413484125">1948</xref>: 71), and thus forged a link between Freud’s psychoanalytic method and Goldstein’s concept of the ‘total situation’ (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0533316413484125">Nitzgen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0533316413484125">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0533316413484125">2010</xref>). Provocatively, one could argue that a large part of de Maré’s work has been a patient meditation on the meaning of this statement. Apart from dealing with the concept of location, he also pinpointed that <italic>‘the first and deepest insight, the initial unique and major contribution that Foulkes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0533316413484125">Foulkes and Anthony, 1957 [1965]</xref>) ever made, was that of the simple but quintessential significance of free-floating group discussion’</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 51).</p>
<p>Both of these key aspects of Foulkes inform a crucial statement made by de Maré more than 40 years later when he said ‘in psychoanalysis text takes the form of free association, in group therapy group association and in the larger group dialogue’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré, 1991</xref>: 25). Admittedly, this is a statement no less dense than the Foulkes’ original claim that free association is always linked to the total situation. In the same book, only a couple of pages later, de Maré made the evenly interesting remark ‘that we do not <italic>know</italic> the <italic>value</italic> of interpretation’ which he then ascribed to Foulkes himself who he claimed had written it somewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 51; italics mine). For de Maré, ‘so often interpretations seem to be an endless series of metaphors, some more apt than others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 51). This procedure, he added, ‘<italic>may</italic> aid dialogue but cannot of course <italic>replace</italic> it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 51, italics mine). On close reading, de Maré’s quotation of Foulkes is based on false memory. What Foulkes had in fact written (in the book with James Anthony) was that</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>. . . we no longer take as a basis of operation the conditioning by old experiences based on traces in the brain. Instead we accept that ideas and comments expressed by different members /of the group/ have the value of <italic>unconscious interpretations</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0533316413484125">Foulkes and Anthony, 1965 [1984]</xref>: 29, italics i.orig.)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What he wanted to point out thereby was not an existing ignorance regarding the value of interpretations but to the particular value of group associations as unconscious interpretations of the group members. This, Foulkes acknowledged was an observation which in turn had enabled him to consider ‘all communications, from whatever individual they may come, as meaningful associations in the context of group’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0533316413484125">Foulkes, 1968 [1990]</xref>: 181). As a consequence, group associations became meaningful as mutual unconscious interpretations of the group members including the conductor. To have taken this step, Foulkes acknowledged had been ‘decisive’ ‘regarding method as well as theory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0533316413484125">Foulkes and Anthony, 1965 [1984]</xref>: 29; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0533316413484125">Foulkes, 1968 [1990]</xref>: 181) as it had led to a ‘totally new assumption’ (Foulkes and Anthony, 1957 [1984]: 29). Referring to ‘group associations acting as interpretations’, de Maré did no more than to validate the view originally put forward by Foulkes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 147). Like Foulkes, he recognized the group process as an on going associative process of the group’s conscious and unconscious self-interpretation (a process which Foulkes later came to describe as ‘analysing’ with a small ‘a’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0533316413484125">1975/1986</xref>: 117). What do we make then of his critical view that ‘we’ do not know the value of interpretation and his pertinent observation that ever ‘so often interpretations seem to be an endless series of metaphors, some more apt than others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 51)? Although based on a misrepresentation, it nonetheless pinpoints an important criticism regarding the nature of interpretation in group analysis, which is well worth reconsidering.</p>
<p>For Foulkes, as we have seen, there are two axis of interpretation in a given group. A horizontal one, where group associations act as mutually unconscious interpretations of the group members (including the conductor); and a vertical one where interpretations are being consciously (?) given to the group by the conductor. On a closer look, there is an inherent tension in this view, a tension Foulkes addressed as such but never really resolved. If group associations already have the ‘value’ of unconscious interpretations, is their interpretation by the conductor nothing more but a re-interpretation, a re-interpretation by which they are turned into ‘an endless serious of metaphors’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 51). Foulkes seems to have been conscious of this impasse. He dealt with it when he suggested that in group analysis ‘interpretation comes in, when analysis fails’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0533316413484125">1975 [1986]</xref>: 117) and when he claimed that interpretative action from the conductor’s part is only called for then when the group associative process as such is blocked, i.e. when the continuous process of groups’ conscious and unconscious self-interpretation has come to a deadlock. Regarding the vicissitudes of interpretation, it has to be mentioned that Foulkes and also de Maré were not the only ones who have noticed the impasse of interpretation in analytic theory and also practice. In psychoanalysis it was Jacques Lacan who made this impasse a major concern of his work.</p>

<title>A Lacanian Intervention</title>
<p>Like Foulkes, Lacan struggled with problems of technique in psychoanalysis too, namely with the use of interpretation. This can be demonstrated, for instance, with regard to his re-reading of the Freud’s case history of little Hans in Seminaire IV. As Lacan explained, the child’s horse-phobia was not just a symptom waiting to be interpreted by the analyst. Rather, the phobic symptom was itself an interpretation on the part of little Hans, i.e. it concealed his own unconscious interpretation of the family dynamics. In other words it is not a symptom waiting to be signified but a signifier waiting to be set in motion in the analysis. Accordingly, there is a striking correspondence between Foulkes’ plea that group analytic psychotherapy is ‘not a hunt for unconscious meaning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0533316413484125">1971 [1990]</xref>: 210) and Lacan’s continuous concern not to close the unfolding chain of the analysand’s associations by untimely interpretations of their supposedly ‘unconscious’ meaning. As Freudian analysts of the same generation, both Foulkes and Lacan seem to have shared a common reservation towards a certain use of interpretation in analysis. For them, to interpret is not to impose <italic>meaning</italic> on the patient’s speech by referring to a ‘pre-existing system of equivalents’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0533316413484125">Evans, 1996</xref>: 87).</p>
<p>De Maré’s understanding of group dialogue was informed by a similar concern although for different reasons. Despite their considerable differences, Foulkes, Lacan and de Maré sought and provided unique answers to this pressing problem of analytic practice. Lacan, perhaps most radically, insisted that to interpret in psychoanalysis was not to uncover a hidden meaning of the analysand’s speech at all (‘you tell me this and I tell you what it really meaning’ (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0533316413484125">Dor, 1994</xref>: 63), but a mere quotation of it; a punctuation of the grammatical, logical and/or homophonic ambiguities of her/his strictly verbal utterances. As far as Foulkes was concerned, he recommended that in group analysis ‘interpretation comes in, when analysis fails’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0533316413484125">1975 [1986]</xref>: 117). And de Maré’s approach was to invent the notion of group dialogue.</p>

<sec id="section5-0533316413484125">
<title>III. Group Dialogue</title>
<p>According to de Maré, the median and large group settings have liberated group analysis from ‘the confines of the familio-centric group’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 9). In the larger setting, he said, ‘the group <italic>acquires another range of meanings</italic>, and <italic>cultural context becomes the central issue</italic>’. What is created in, and by this particular setting is a new form of textual process he described as ‘group dialogue’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 25). Conceptually, group dialogue supplements Freud’s concept of free association and Foulkes’ concept of group association which belong to the psychoanalytic situation and the small group setting. We may note here that de Maré again made use of a very Foulkesean idea (originally derived from Kurt Goldstein), which he then expanded. Namely that a particular <italic>social situation</italic> creates a specific dynamic and specific form of text and <italic>meaning</italic>. While the two former aspects were elaborated by Foulkes, the latter was not. It is only apprehended in the conception of group dialogue put forward by de Maré:
<disp-quote>
<p>The phenomenon, of group associations acting as interpretations, already noted by Foulkes, is seen even more closely in larger groups, and permits a process of expansion in which interpretations are arrived at in a rounded fashion by dialogue itself. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 147; cf.: 70)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It evident that the notion of group dialogue builds on Foulkes’ original insight of group associations acting as unconscious interpretations. However, the conclusion that interpretations ‘are arrived at in a rounded fashion by dialogue itself’ clearly differs from Foulkes and belongs to de Maré. How shall we comprehend this? As a concept, dialogue is perhaps best approached by comparing it to language. One refers to structure and the other to process. For de Maré ‘language itself is not dialogue, since language is a structure, and dialogue is a process’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 44). Dialogue as a process in its essence is a ‘<italic>continuous critique of language</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 44, italics mine). Therefore, the conception of dialogue as a critique of language is an answer to the impasse of interpretation in psychoanalysis and group analysis. Unlike interpretation in individual psychoanalysis and in the small group, dialogue in median and large groups ‘<italic>functions without final truths</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 47, italics mine). As a critique of language, it cannot function otherwise. Only by suspending any notion of final truth, dialogue can function as a critique of all conventional meanings imposed on the subject by a given society. Functioning this way, it becomes a continuous questioning of authority: a questioning not only of the authority of persons but of words and speech too. For de Maré, it thereby becomes ‘an exercise in speech’, an exercise which creates ‘generability, shareability’ and thus ‘bears meaning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 54). As such an exercise in speech and speaking, it is more than the search for yet another and ever more ‘correct’ interpretation as in psychoanalysis, because it may eventually teach us that a cigar is not necessarily a cigar; and even the Frankfurt School may turn out to be a washing machine.</p>
<p>A question remains, though. How and why does this exercise bring the cultural context to the fore? In his answer to this question, de Maré made full use of the potential of language in the group. Conceiving language as ‘our archaic heritage’, which he said is ‘spoken through the individual’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 57), he defined language as cultural heritage and thus ‘the primary carrier’ of cumulative memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 57). In this sense, language is ‘the most immediate record of unconscious fantasies, of pre-consciousness and of collective motives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 57). According to de Maré, this record can be tapped by applying the principle of etymology. ‘As a <italic>collective unconscious structure</italic>, etymology offers us a supreme method of exploring personal unconscious fantasies in relation to the culture of the whole community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 57) which is why de Maré considered it as ‘royal a road to the unconscious as dream interpretation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 56). Applying it systematically in groups, brings the cultural context to the fore and make it ‘the central issue’ in group dialogue’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 9)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0533316413484125">1</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Lacanian Intervention Continued</title>
<p>Group analysts in general and those devoted to working with larger groups in particular may be irritated by the reference to Lacan and Lacanian psychoanalysis in a group analytic context. Those who are may refer to de Maré as making good use of Lacanian thinking. Regarding technique, it may have been Lacan who perhaps best formulated a common concern of Foulkes and de Maré too when he called for a ‘renewed technique of intepretation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0533316413484125">Lacan, 1953</xref>: 82). From a group analytic perspective as advocated by Foulkes, group associations encompassed the repressed unconscious and the social unconscious alike. Regarding technique, he therefore never made any difference between the ‘translation’ of both (cf. Foulkes in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0533316413484125">Foulkes and Anthony, 1965 [1984]</xref>: 56). Both the repressed and the social unconscious become accessible by way of ‘reduced censorship’ (Foulkes in Foulkes and Anthony, 1957 [1984]: 56). De Maré nuanced this view in so far he claimed that in median and large groups unconscious social assumptions can only come to the fore by way of group dialogue. We may wonder though, what would have been his comment regarding Foulkes’ intuition that to interpret is ‘to transfer or to translate something from one context to another’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0533316413484125">Foulkes, 1975b [1986]</xref>: 114).</p>
<p>Also, it is very interesting to note that although de Maré emphasized <italic>etymology</italic> as a means to tap collective consciousness and memory, he never ever refers to a crucial concept of Foulkes, which is clearly relevant in the context interpretation. This is the concept of <italic>resonance</italic> (with all its musical analogies which were so dear to Foulkes), which seems to have become more and more important in his work. In fact, so important that he made it the subject of his very last article (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0533316413484125">Foulkes, 1977 [1990]</xref>: 297). Without going into the details, it may say that it is the notion of resonance and resonating which is most apt to denote the vibrant links between individual speech und the cultural networks and their circulating signifiers. This has not escaped Lacan’s attention, who in his <italic>Rome Discourse</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0533316413484125">1953</xref>) said that what is at stake in analysis is ‘to restore the full evocative value of speaking’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0533316413484125">Lacan, 1953</xref>: 109). A value furthered only by ‘the resonance of interpretation’ in psychoanalytic technique.</p>

<title>IV. The Principle of Meaning</title>
<p>It may well be that de Maré’s understanding of the dynamics in median and large has obfuscated other important aspects of his contribution to group analysis, particularly the introduction of the principle of meaning. In his view, median and large groups not only represent a <italic>different level of group activity</italic>, but also <italic>a different dimension of human experience</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 9). He therefore maintained that ‘ . . . the human psyche is governed, not only by the pleasure and reality principles, but by a third principle, that of <italic>meaning</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">1991</xref>: 7, italics mine). To make this contribution, he borrowed from Susan Langer, an American philosopher.</p>
<p>It was Langer who as de Maré wrote had described symbolization as ‘a basic human need’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré, 1991</xref>: 45); actually an ‘imperative’ of human existence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">1991</xref>: 47). What he failed to mention though was that Langer’s imperative only reiterated the philosophical teaching of Langer’s philosophical mentor, Ernst Cassirer. It had been Cassirer who in his anthropological <italic>Essay On Man</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0533316413484125">1944</xref>) had first described man as an ‘Animal symbolicum’, ‘symbolic animal’. And it was Cassirer who in the 1920s in Frankfurt had collaborated with the neurologist Kurt Goldstein who in turn influenced his then assistant S.H. Fuchs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0533316413484125">Nitzgen, 2007</xref>; 2010). Traces of this are visible in Foulkes’ first book (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0533316413484125">1948</xref>); for instance in his statement: ‘The organism acts <italic>as if it knew its aim</italic> and <italic>had a choice</italic> as to achieve this aim’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0533316413484125">Foulkes, 1948 [1983]</xref>: 1, italics mine). Although Foulkes did not spell out all its implications, this suggests a creative intentionality of the organism which for Foulkes was operative even at an ‘organismic level’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0533316413484125">Foulkes, 1948 [1983]</xref>: 1). As a consequence, and in contrast to the psychoanalytic doctrine of his day, Foulkes viewed adaptation not as process taking place only ‘mechanically’ but as a ‘creative activity’ as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0533316413484125">Foulkes, 1948 [1983]</xref>: 1). In this view, which Foulkes had adopted from Goldstein, it can be understood as a form of <italic>symbolic self-realization</italic> on the level of the organism, the individual and the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0533316413484125">Nitzgen, 2007</xref>). On the other hand, self-realization cannot be understood without any reference to (subjective) <italic>meaning.</italic> This is an insight Foulkes himself did not really develop in his work. Implicitly, he made use of it when he came to consider all group communications ‘as <italic>meaningful</italic> associations in the context of the group’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0533316413484125">1968 [1990]</xref>: 181). To have made it a subject, he would have been forced to question the foundations of the mind as laid out by Freud: pleasure and reality, affect and (re-)presentation.</p>
<p>This is exactly what de Maré did when he introduced <italic>meaning</italic> as a principle of group analytic thinking, designating it as ‘<italic>a different dimension of human experience’</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 9). Accordingly, the principle of meaning must re recognized as being operative in <italic>all</italic> human groupings regardless of their size. Of all of de Maré’s contributions to group analysis, this is surely the most qualitative aspect. As de Maré rightly insisted, meaning ‘cannot be cut into pieces, it cannot be measured or quantified’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 55). As Goldstein and Cassirer had shown before, meaning is the hallmark of <italic>symbolic</italic> consciousness. While animals cannot but <italic>react</italic> to <italic>signs</italic>, humans beings already being born into a symbolically structured world cannot do otherwise than to <italic>respond</italic> to <italic>symbols</italic> whose meaning will always be subject to interpretation. It is this perspective which relates de Maré’s approach to large groups not only to the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0533316413484125">Susan Langer (1967)</xref> and to Cassirer’s anthropology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0533316413484125">1944</xref>) and his philosophy of symbolic forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0533316413484125">Cassirer, 1923</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0533316413484125">1925</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0533316413484125">1929</xref>), but also to the psychoanalytic thinking of Lacan (whom he amply quotes) and although he does not mention it to the post-kleinian symbol theory of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0533316413484125">Bion (1970)</xref> and Meltzer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0533316413484125">Meltzer, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0533316413484125">1997</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0533316413484125">Harris-Williams, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Emphasizing meaning as a human <italic>dimension</italic> and symbolization as an <italic>imperative</italic> for human beings, it can be said that de Maré opened up a new vortex of group analytic thinking and thereby expanded group analysis in theory and in practice. Regarded in retrospect, it is no wonder really that this development led him to suggest that ‘the body and mind problem probably only exists “in the mind” and is of linguistic—i.e. <italic>symbolic</italic> origin’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 58; italics mine). This in turn fuelled his quest for ‘a discipline that enables us to examining the mind functioning as a system’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 58). In practice he maintained, this discipline would have to build on group dialogue while in theory it calls for a group analytically informed conception of the mind. Interestingly, such a conception of mind is what he and Foulkes too gravitated towards (cf. Foulkes, 2003; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0533316413484125">de Maré and Schoellberger, 2006</xref>) although not without some considerable differences not in intention but in detail.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0533316413484125">
<title>IV. Group Dialogue and Collective Consciousness</title>
<p>Although he never denied his debt to Foulkes, de Maré seems to have been reluctant to explain where exactly he departed from him. He did though when he made Durkheim’s sociological concept of a <italic>Collective Consciousness</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0533316413484125">Durkheim, 1972</xref>) a reference for group analysis. De Maré leaned on Durkheim in order to be able ‘to relate the social structure to individual human consciousness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 118). Following Durkheim rather than Freud, he maintained that ‘whilst Freud saw the unconscious mind as fulfilling this function, Durkheim went into the opposite direction, maintaining it was the group conscience, l’esprit collectif, that was basic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 118).</p>
<p>Accordingly, de Maré adopted Durkheim’s view that the relationship between the social structure and individual consciousness rests on language whose ‘prime quality’ he characterized as ‘transindividual’ and thus ‘similar’ to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0533316413484125">Durkheim’s (1972)</xref> notion of a ‘collective consciousness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 57). Elsewhere, he even spoke of language <italic>as</italic> ‘trans-individual collective consciousness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 162) which he said ‘is handed down culturally’ and thus ‘the primary carrier of cumulative memory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 162). This view of collective consciousness and memory is reminiscent not only of Durkheim but also of Levi-Strauss’ later structuralist assumption that ‘myths get through in man unbeknownst to him’ (Levi Strauss, 1986 cited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al, 1991</xref>: 67).</p>
<p>In the move towards Durkheim’s sociology, de Maré broke away from Freudian psychoanalysis and also from Foulkes’ Freudian group analytic terminology. As a consequence, he shifted the focus of group analytic theory away from the existing theories of the unconscious (as listed in his ‘levels’ of group communication; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0533316413484125">Foulkes, 1968 [1990]</xref> : 183) towards a theory of collective consciousness. This is in contrast to Foulkes, who whenever he referred to individual and/or group <italic>consciousness</italic>, always did so in terms of Freud’s topographical model of unconscious-preconscious and conscious. For Foulkes, this model remained a lifelong orientation for the understanding of conscious and unconscious processes, even when he later introduced the idea of a ‘social unconscious’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0533316413484125">Foulkes, 1950 [1984]</xref>: 52).</p>
<p>It is doubtful therefore whether Foulkes would have accepted de Maré’s proposition of that in larger groups ‘we explore the <italic>conscious rather than the unconscious</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 25; italics mine). Interestingly, by addressing the group as the locus of collective consciousness, de Maré perhaps unwittingly followed Foulkes’ own intellectual footsteps. In the 1920s and 1930s in Germany, it had been his academic teacher and mentor, the neurologist Kurt Goldstein who together with his cousin, the philosopher Ernst Cassirer had indeed adumbrated such a theory of symbolic consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0533316413484125">Nitzgen, 2010</xref>). Due to the historical cesura of National Socialism and the forced emigration of all participants involved including Foulkes, this challenging project came to an end in 1933. Surprisingly, it was revived in the 1970s when de Maré quite independently and on his own arrived at similar conclusions as Cassirer and Goldstein had arrived some 60 years before.</p>
<p>Due to this development, there were two approaches in group analysis to explain the dynamics of the social and its impact on the conscious and unconscious life in groups. Two approaches however with a surprisingly common aim. According to Foulkes’ this was to uncover the social unconscious, and according to de Maré it was to view our ‘macrocultural assumptions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 40). Methodologically, for Foulkes, this approach was based on the notion of group associations (as ‘equivalent’ to free associations in Freudian psychoanalysis) and thus as an ‘access to <italic>unconscious</italic> processes groups’ (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0533316413484125">Foulkes, 1971</xref>) whereas for de Maré it was to be based on the notion of group dialogue and with a special reference to Durkheim’s idea of a <italic>collective consciousness.</italic></p>
<p>Although different in terms, both approaches can be said to be two routes towards a common aim, namely to uncover unconscious social/cultural assumptions. A major difference between them is de Maré’s emphasis on ‘meaning’, which as a principle supplements the Freudian ‘pleasure and reality principles’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 7). This is an idea Foulkes as a psychoanalyst never really adopted. However, in Foulkes’ view what de Maré saw as a binary opposition between the <italic>familial</italic> and the <italic>cultural</italic> was actually more of a difference in degree than in kind. In his late article on <italic>My philosophy in Psychotherapy</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0533316413484125">1974</xref>) he wrote: ‘In the group-analytic group the original family is <italic>represented</italic> by transference, the cultural group by the matrix in so far it is shared and has to be shared to start with the “Foundation matrix”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0533316413484125">Foulkes, 1974 [1990]</xref>: 277, italics mine).</p>
<p>This statement calls into question the idea that larger groups should be beyond transference, as de Maré seems to suggest. That in median and large groups the super-ego is no longer located in the convenor but projected on the ‘canvas’ of the group as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 35) does not invalidate the assumption that transference as such is operative in these groups. It suggests though that it is being transferred or transposed here from one context to another. That the difference between small group psychotherapy and larger group settings is one in degree rather than in kind is also confirmed by de Maré himself when he wrote that in larger settings ‘the emphasis is <italic>less</italic> upon psychotherapy and <italic>more</italic> upon delicate civilizing processes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0533316413484125">de Maré, 1983</xref>: 231).</p>
<p>Due to this development within group analysis and largely unnoticed by the group analytic community, two different visions of group analysis came to coexist: One based on the existing psychoanalytic theories of the unconscious and thus ‘a straightforward development of Freudian psychoanalysis’ as Foulkes himself had claimed in a letter to J. Durkin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0533316413484125">Foulkes, 1965 [1994]</xref>: 6) and the other, de Maré’s, based on a theory of collective consciousness. Presently both do coexist, of course, but not without some considerable conceptual tension. Regarding its origins, it is stunning to realize to what extent de Maré’s view of the group as the locus of collective consciousness mirrors important aspects of Foulkes’ formative years in Frankfurt where during the 1920s, his first academic teacher, the neurologist Kurt Goldstein together with his cousin, the philosopher Ernst Cassirer had worked together on the neurobiological foundations of a theory of <italic>symbolic consciousness.</italic> With regard to this, we may notice though, that towards the end of his career Foulkes too returned to his scientific beginnings. Referring to the group as the ‘<italic>matrix of the individual’s mental life’</italic> (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0533316413484125">Foulkes, 1973</xref>), he now widened the scope of the group analytic project, pushing it beyond the established understanding of mental life in terms of its unconscious dynamics.</p>
<p>In his article on ‘Mind’ (cf. Foulkes, 2003: 315), which interestingly was not published during his lifetime but only much later, Foulkes outlined a post-Freudian vision of group analysis. By the title alone and although de Maré’s name is not mentioned in it, Foulkes nonetheless acknowledged it seems his quest for a group analytic theory of the mind as a legitimate project for the time to come.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Interestingly, the rift between the repressed and the social unconscious in Foulkes and the dichotomy between the Freudian unconscious and collective consciousness in de Maré seem to be integrated theoretically and clinically in Lacan’s concept of the <italic>Other</italic> with a capital O, le <italic>Grand Autre.</italic> Although he extensively quoted from his works and actually referred to Lacan’s notion of the Other (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 54), de Maré actually did not make full use of this difficult concept. Introducing the notion of the Other with a capital O, Lacan wanted to differentiate this Other from the little other of the imaginary relation of the ego to the mirror image. In contrast to this other, the Other designated the symbolic order in its radical alterity to the individual ego. The big Other, l’Autre he said, ‘must first of all be considered as a locus, a locus in which speech is constituted’ (Lacan, J., S 3, p. 274). As such a <italic>locus</italic> it is equated with the symbolic order, language and the figure of the law. At first sight, Lacan’s conception has a certain affinity to Durkheim’s sociology in so far as it emphasizes the primacy of social forces, their externality and constraints too. Accordingly, Durkheim conceived the collective as transindividual and transhistorical. Thereby, he anticipated what later became known as ‘structuralism’, which is why de Maré rightfully calls him one of the ‘earlier structuralists’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 118).</p>
<p>For Lacan however, it is not collective unconsciousness, which is ‘transindividual’ but the <italic>unconscious</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0533316413484125">Lacan, 1953</xref>: 49). Resting on the autonomy of the symbolic order and the ex-centricity of language by which the subject is determined as it was by the determining character of social facts in Durkheim’s sociology. With the important difference that in his time Durkheim did not dispose of a scientific concept of the unconscious. Due of this conceptual lack, he was neither able to distinguish between conscious and unconscious facts nor to describe the passage from nature to culture, i.e. to elucidate the child’s encounter with the social order. According to Lacan’s structural review of the Oedipus complex, it is through the parental other, the m(Other) and the father that the child encounters the symbolic Other of law, language culture and society. This is why from a Lacanian point of view, it makes little sense really to supplement the repressed unconscious by a ‘social unconscious’ as Foulkes had done, simply because the unconscious is social throughout. For the same reason, it also makes little sense to claim as de Maré had done that: ‘While small groups focus on the psychoanalytic, <italic>biological</italic> unconscious, large groups are tilted towards socio-cultural awareness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 11, italics mine). In this statement, de Maré contradicted his own efforts when he fell back on exactly the same false dichotomy which to undo he had done his very best in his work.</p>

<p>Maybe it was his understanding of language as ‘collective unconscious structure’ and the reference to etymology, he made de Maré renounce on the notion of the (Foulkesean) notion of the ‘social unconscious’ in his later work. Instead, he turned to Durkheim and his sociological concept of a ‘collective consciousness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0533316413484125">Durkheim, 1972</xref>) in order to ‘relate the social structure to individual human consciousness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 118). Following Durkheim rather than Freud, he stated that ‘whilst Freud say the unconscious mind fulfilling this function, Durkheim went into the opposite direction, maintaining it was group conscience, l’esprit colléctiv, that was basic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413484125">de Maré et al., 1991</xref>: 118). So far, the relationship between the social unconscious and the notion of ‘collective consciousness’ has not been clarified in group analysis.</p>
