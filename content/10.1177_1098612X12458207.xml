<p>A recent editorial in <italic>JFMS</italic>, co-written by one of us (LG), focused on how the veterinary sector has been affected by the slowing of the world economy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1098612X12458207">1</xref></sup> Ten months on, and we find ourselves returning to the theme. While doubtful that the economic situation will suddenly improve (and some more pessimistic than us worry that, at least in Europe, we are heading for a double-dip recession), there may be some chinks of light on the horizon for us veterinarians with a special interest in feline medicine and surgery. That is, provided we are prepared to rethink the way we do business, embrace entrepreneurship and grasp new market opportunities!</p>

<p>Opportunities to be grasped: the MANZCVS qualification distinguishes veterinarians with a particular interest in feline clinical practice</p>

<p>And it seems we are. The steady upward trend in cat ownership in many countries, especially in growing cities, has been paralleled by a rise in the number of feline-only first opinion practices. Such facilities were unheard of a few years ago and have emerged in response to the demand of the public for feline-specific care, the passion for feline medicine and surgery of a growing number of veterinarians and, of course, a business opportunity. The new Cat Friendly Clinic scheme, and its counterpart the Cat Friendly Practice program in the States, is a positive move to ensure standards are met and maintained in these practices, and indeed any practice seeing cats. Those that have lept at the opportunity and already gained their gold/silver status, can now proudly display their cat-friendly credentials to current and prospective new clients.</p>
<p>Meantime, a partnership between the ISFM and the Australian and New Zealand College of Veterinary Scientists (ANZCVS) has led, for the first time, to vets in the UK and Europe sitting the membership examination leading to the MANZCVS qualification. As we write, the first cohort are anxiously awaiting their results, while candidates for next year’s exams are invited to enrol by October 31 (for more details, see the accompanying advertisement in this issue). How exciting to now be able to offer clinicians the opportunity to gain an advanced practitioner qualification in feline medicine on an international basis! Cats, we surely all agree, deserve a dedicated approach in terms of patient management and care. Not only will this enhance cat welfare and understanding of feline diseases, but it presents a valuable opportunity for referral practices.</p>
<p>For other prospects, we can look east, in particular to China and South East Asia, where the veterinary sector is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years. Asian colleges of veterinary medicine are emerging and we should embrace their development as not only a positive move for animal welfare but also a business opportunity for young veterinarians worldwide.</p>
