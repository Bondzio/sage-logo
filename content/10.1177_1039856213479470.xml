<p>As my term as President nears its completion it is an apt time to reflect on the events of the last few years since I started my term in August 2010. My years as President have often been a whirlwind of committees, meetings, emails and phone calls, whilst maintaining clinical practice.</p>
<p>The happy coincidence of the end of my term in the year of the College’s 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary offers an opportunity to contemplate the rich history of the College. How much it has changed over the years, and yet how many similarities there are. As psychiatrists we know only too well that without understanding the past, we risk making the same mistakes repeatedly. We have much to learn through exploring our history and I encourage all members to take the time to look through the historic Fellow Profiles in Psych-e bulletin, photos and biographies of past presidents in the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary website, and our College history ‘Menders of the Mind’ now available free as an e-book.</p>
<p>As this is my last column for <italic>Australasian Psychiatry</italic> as President I would like to look back on the efforts and achievements of the last few years.</p>
<p>The role of President is a privilege and comes with many duties and obligations. Involvement in the College also brings many rewards in enabling one to work with colleagues and our management staff, learn new skills and achieve goals that aim to benefit the College, psychiatry, and the mental health of the community.</p>
<p>I firmly believed that the College had an opportunity to better represent members and to express the voice of members about things that matter to psychiatry and the community. During my time as President I have been pleased to be able to contribute to a number of key areas: the consultation and reform of the constitution and College governance structures, developing and enhancing relationships with our Asia-Pacific psychiatric and mental health colleagues, improving the College’s capacity to engage with governments, supporting better training opportunities outside public hospitals and ensuring that the psychiatric workforce was recognised as a key area of need by government. The College has also invested directly in the area of workforce recently, with programs to support the needs of psychiatrists early in their career and programs to attract doctors and medical students who are considering psychiatry as a specialty. I am also pleased by the success of our first Northern Territory Congress in 2011, plans for the Asia-Pacific Mental Health Forum at Congress this year and for policy work undertaken which recognises the complex connections between mental health and intellectual and developmental disability.</p>
<p>I have committed to developing a collaborative relationship with the Australian Indigenous Doctors Association (AIDA) and to the establishment of a scholarship for Indigenous medical students or junior doctors to attend Congress. Now coordinated by the College’s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Mental Health Committee in partnership with AIDA, this will be an ongoing initiative and I hope that this approach will contribute to more Indigenous Psychiatrists joining our ranks and enhance our ongoing relationship with AIDA. Even as my term finishes I will continue to attempt to contribute in this area, having recently taken on the role of CPMC Chair of the Indigenous Health Subcommittee, co-chairing with the President of AIDA Tammy Kimpton, which aims to improve the cultural awareness of all specialists and increase the number of Indigenous specialists in all of the Medical Colleges in Australia.</p>
<p>By the time this article is printed the membership will have elected our first Board under our new constitution, and it will be close to its introduction at the Annual General Meeting at Congress in May 2013. These are exciting times for the College, and will bring about a modernised, streamlined governance structure which will take the College forward into the next 50 years. I am honoured to have led the organisation through this exciting time, and although I am sure there will be bumps in the road ahead as the new structure is bedded down, I am confident the structure will be robust.</p>
<p>This is a transformative year for the College, and I encourage you to contact your local Branch to find out about their anniversary celebrations, and to attend Congress in Sydney from the 26<sup>th</sup> to 30<sup>th</sup> May.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank the many members who volunteer their time on Committees and General Council. Through their work and wisdom the College has survived and progressively strengthened, which has enabled us to take on broader roles and activities and be outward looking in collaboration with organisations, and engage in advocacy, for those people who have mental illness.</p>
