<abstract>
<p>In early August 2011, disturbances broke out in a number of English cities. What happened was broadcast globally, and all of a sudden it seemed as if all of the country was about to burst into flames. This short paper is offered by way of a ‘letter’ from England. It was written in late August 2011 and is an initial attempt to develop an understanding of why the disturbances broke out, what motivated the people who were involved and, indeed, why things were confined to England. Cities elsewhere in Britain experienced nothing. The paper identifies a crisis in the English social imaginary. The disturbances are understood as a conjunctural response to this crisis, a response highlighting the interregnum in the English social imaginary.</p>

<p>On 4 August 2011 police in Tottenham, London, shot and killed alleged drug dealer and gang member Mark Duggan. Two days later, on Saturday 6 August, a protest march to the Tottenham police station became violent, and by Monday 8 August the atmosphere was brittle. The evening was quite warm, and violence broke out in a number of areas of London. These were all areas where the beneficiaries and victims of neo-liberalism live in fairly close proximity. Gentrification can be found just down the road from housing estates with some of the highest levels of deprivation in Europe. The police stood back and mostly watched as groups of hoodie-wearers looted local shops. Electrical stores were a particular target, but pawnbrokers, sports-fashion stores, liquor stores and supermarkets also received more attention than other shops. Fires were started and long burnt uncontrolled. Bricks and sticks were thrown, cars torched. The violence was carried out well away from the city centres. The looted stores were either small shops or the local branches of bigger retail brands. The looted supermarkets were all from the lower end of the very hierarchical British food retail market. Similar events quickly occurred in a few other cities, and on the Tuesday night Birmingham, Salford and Manchester were the focus of attention. Only Manchester and Birmingham witnessed activity in their centres. Despite the impression created by global media, everything was on a very local scale, and most of England remained completely untouched by what happened.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0725513612442353">1</xref></sup> On Wednesday 10 August the police clampdown started, Parliament was recalled for a special yet unsurprisingly facile debate, and events seemed to subside once again as legal proceedings took over.</p>
<p>Court hearings quickly confirmed impressionistic evidence about the demographic of the participants. The<italic> Guardian</italic> newspaper has been keeping a record of relevant prosecutions which have gone before magistrates courts. As of 15 August it had logged details of 257 cases: 52.8 per cent of the people going before the courts were aged between 18 and 24, and a further 22 per cent were under 17. Only 32 cases involved the prosecution of women. Although the statistics had not been collated, it seems most of the defendants were unemployed. There did not appear to be any strong correlation by ethnicity, and so it is possible to see the events as something like a back-handed expression of the cosmopolitanism and multiculturalism of the relevant cities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0725513612442353">2</xref></sup> Put another way, when David Cameron identifies the events as an expression of what he calls ‘broken Britain’, he is quite wrong. The demographic of the prosecuted rather implies a lot of social solidarity and indeed mutual integration, at least at the ethnic level.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0725513612442353">3</xref></sup> It is actually perfectly reasonable to identify what happened as a fine expression of what Paul Gilroy has called <italic>conviviality</italic>: ‘the processes of cohabitation and interaction that have made multiculture an ordinary feature of social life in Britain’s urban areas and in postcolonial cities elsewhere’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0725513612442353">Gilroy 2005</xref>: xv).</p>
<p>Once the events were over the public debate quickly turned to questions of police tactics and the alleged criminality of the participants. The criminalization was commonsensically valid because the media had immediately called the events ‘riots’, and the label stuck. After all, it acted as a rough and ready explanation for what had happened. By this explanation the events had been riots perpetrated by those who have no respect for the rule of law because they lead feckless lives in fetid places populated by failed families. This explanation also has the benefit of making the participants illicit intruders into the places of law and order. They become trespassers from another world, and therefore the answer is to make sure future incursions are made harder and more costly. The label ‘riot’ has to be avoided precisely because it has all of these loadings. Equally it is unhelpful to label what happened as an ‘uprising’ or ‘rebellion’, as the events of 1981 were somewhat romantically often dubbed. The use of these latter labels gives to the events a political purpose which they signally lacked. The events were not an uprising on the part of an urban dispossessed deliberately and consciously breaking into the spheres of neo-liberal success in order to undermine or destroy it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0725513612442353">4</xref></sup> The events had no political loading of this sort. The Arab Spring had not come to Hackney. Consequently let us call what happened in August 2011by the neutral word ‘events’. What the events involved was urban youth taking things for free and frequently destroying what they could not take home. Police were attacked simply because they were in the way or, more analytically, because they are the symbolic gatekeepers keeping urban youth out of the glittering world of electronic goods, fashion and chemical oblivion into which they seek to roam because it has social and cultural status as the seemingly cost-free lifestyle of the rich and famous.</p>
<p>This was no assault on consumerism; it was an act of <italic>hommage</italic>.</p>
<p>But if this <italic>hommage</italic> thesis is valid it needs to be able to resolve an empirical problem. Notwithstanding the disturbances in the Parisian <italic>banlieues</italic> in 2005, the events of 2011 are unusual. There is no direct correlation between consumerism and events of this kind. If there were, such events would be global phenomena, and they are not. Similarly the 2011 events only happened in <italic>some</italic> cities in <italic>England</italic>. Newcastle upon Tyne is perhaps the most crass temple to consumerism in the UK; it is also a city with significant deprivation, yet it had no disturbances. Neither did cities in Wales and Scotland. Consumerism cannot explain what happened even if the focus of the participants’ attention was on consumer products. It is necessary to look beneath the surface. It is necessary to refuse to be seduced by the consumerism which has evidently seduced the participants, and it is better to see the August 2011 events as the condensation of a conjuncture of a range of forces. These forces are distinct and do not necessarily connect or correlate with one another. No single one of these forces provided the causal push for the events. Rather, they came together in lived experience at a discrete moment in specific places.</p>
<p>The next section will quickly outline the conjunctural forces. The final section of the paper will identify the context of the conjuncture as one of <italic>interregnum,</italic> a word used in the Gramscian sense: ‘the great masses have become detached from their traditional ideologies, and no longer believe what they used to believe previously. … The … old is dying and the new cannot be born; in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0725513612442353">Gramsci 1971</xref>: 276).</p>
<sec id="section1-0725513612442353">
<title>The forces</title>
<p>Even as social relationships are lived they are also experienced. The living and the experience come together and are mutually reinforced through what Charles Taylor has called a ‘social imaginary’. It is an imaginary which makes it possible for men and women to ‘imagine their social existence, how they fit together with others, how things go on between them and their fellows, the expectations which are normally met, and the deeper normative notions and images which underlie these expectations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0725513612442353">Taylor 2007</xref>: 171). A few paragraphs later Taylor confirms and extends this concept of the ‘social imaginary’ when he writes: ‘Our social imaginary ... incorporates a sense of the normal expectations that we have of each other; the kind of common understanding which enables us to carry out the collective practices which make up our social life. This incorporates some sense of how we all fit together in carrying out the common practice.’ This ‘sense’ is both descriptive and, Taylor stresses, normative because it is ‘interwoven with an idea of how [collective practices] ought to go, of what mis-steps would invalidate the practice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0725513612442353">Taylor 2007</xref>: 172).</p>
<p>England is presently characterized by breakdown of the social imaginary and, thereby, the absence of any commonly-agreed expectations or practices of how things go on between people. One registration of the sense of breakdown is to be found in Roger Scruton’s book <italic>England: An Elegy</italic>. His book is precisely a sad farewell letter to an imaginary called England which enabled people to fit together within a common ‘home’ (which Scruton does not ethnicize) where ‘things don’t need explanation. They are there because they are there’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0725513612442353">Scruton 2000</xref>: 16). Another expression of the breakdown is Peter Ackroyd’s decision to link England to the ancient word Albion and say that, just like the white horses cut into the chalk hills, ‘Today, like those fading memorials, Albion is not so much a name as the echo of a name’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0725513612442353">Ackroyd 2002</xref>: xix). The same sense yet in a different register runs through Polly Jean Harvey’s album <italic>Let England Shake</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0725513612442353">2010</xref>). She sings about the ‘withered vine’ and the ‘bitter taste’ of England. For Harvey, England is home, although a sad and saddening one. The song ‘The Last Living Rose’ takes a walk through ‘stinking alleys to the sound of drunken beatings’ and leads us past ‘the Thames River, glistening like gold hastily sold for nothing’. Scruton, Ackroyd and Harvey in their different ways are expressing a sense in which it is no longer possible to know what ought to go on because the notions and images underlying collective practices have all been invalidated and deprived of any semblance of taken-for-grantedness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0725513612442353">5</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>What forces have invalidated the collective practices of England? At the risk of being over-schematic it is possible to identify four forces which, for the sake of ease and convenience, can be labelled the moral, the social, the political and the economic.</p>
<p>
<italic>The moral</italic>: One of the less coherent but more significant themes in the English social imaginary revolves around a motif of ‘fairness’. Kate Fox has linked this theme to a value of ‘fair play’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0725513612442353">Fox 2004</xref>: 407). Fairness has a number of aspects. First, it means a proportional connection between effort and reward; second, it expresses a kind of common-sense justice in which an individual ought to be treated according to their actions, not their being; third, it means an acceptance of punishment if it is administered by a legitimate authority in accordance with the principle of fairness as justice. All of these essentially moral expectations have been invalidated in recent experience. First of all, celebrity culture and bankers’ bonuses have been seen to remove proportionality from effort and reward calculations. Second, fairness as treatment according to actions is experientially undermined in many inner city areas. The journalist Tim Adams has interviewed young men on a number of estates and found amongst them a common sensibility: ‘If they left the confines of their impoverished postcode they would, they claimed, be immediately harassed by police, or confronted by young men from neighbouring estates’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0725513612442353">Adams 2011</xref>: 22). Third, fairness has been invalidated by a collapse in the legitimacy of authority. This collapse has long-standing roots in how the police deal with inner city areas (the Scarman Report which was written after the 1981 disturbances remains valid in some regards: see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0725513612442353">Scarman 1982</xref>). However, the collapse of legitimate authority became almost apocalyptic when the extraordinarily close relationships between News International and high-ranking officers in the Metropolitan Police became common knowledge in July 2011. Simply put, England has become experientially <italic>unfair, </italic>a sense which is likely to be exacerbated by the exceptionally hard sentences handed down to those convicted of participating in the events.</p>
<p>
<italic>The social:</italic> When Blair’s New Labour was elected to power in 1997 it used a pop song with the title ‘Things Can Only Get Better’ as its theme music. The song seemed to look backwards, cleansing the public sphere of the sleaze which characterized the end of the Thatcher-Major years, and forwards to aspiration and achievement. Social ills would be made good, the sick society would be made better. And for some the dream came true. For others it didn’t. Social mobility actually declined under New Labour, and the Conservative-led coalition which came to power in 2010 knocked over the few remaining ladders when it withdrew support for children from low income families to stay in education and increased higher education fees. Wealth inequalities are greater in London than ever before and ‘it’s worth remembering that we have created a society in which a very large number of young men see no way out of the life into which they were born’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0725513612442353">Adams 2011</xref>: 22). When these same young men look to the government benches they see men (because for the most part the government is made up of men) who would fear being removed from the privileged lives into which they were born. Social class is increasingly experienced in terms of a fate which can never be overcome. Imaginations of opportunities for social mobility have been drastically invalidated.</p>
<p>
<italic>The political:</italic> Taylor gives the example of political demonstrations to make a point about how a social imaginary underpins a common shared understanding of appropriate collective practices. When we go on a demonstration we participate in a range of ritualized practices and construct ourselves as standing in the same space as our addressees. Through the imaginary we believe we understand one another. As Taylor puts it: ‘The immediate sense of what we’re doing, getting the message to the government and our fellow citizens that the cuts must stop, say, makes sense in a wider context, in which we see ourselves as standing in a continuing relation with others, in which it is appropriate to address them in this manner’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0725513612442353">Taylor 2007</xref>: 174). This sense of common political space has been invalidated. The first sign of the invalidation was the Blair administration’s refusal to take into account the massive popular opposition to the Iraq War in 2003, but more recently it has also run through opposition to the ‘austerity measures’ introduced by the Cameron government. Indeed the very existence of the Cameron administration might itself be seen as a symbol of the invalidation of common political space in as much as it did not win a majority at the 2010 general election and is pursuing policies which have no popular mandate.</p>
<p>
<italic>The economic:</italic> As Taylor points out, in Western modernity the economic came to achieve the status of an ‘objectified reality’, ‘an interlocking set of activities of production, exchange and consumption, which form a system with its own laws and its own dynamic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0725513612442353">Taylor 2007</xref>: 181). One of the signal successes of neo-liberalism was how it became a common-sense about these laws and dynamic which could and need admit of no alternative. The common-sense would likely have held good had neo-liberalism not become one of the best examples of the Marxian dictum about capitalism destroying itself. The neo-liberal commitment to free markets and the distant state was internally invalidated by the bail-out which commenced in 2008 of the feral banking sector. The economic was shown to be amenable to choice and alternative and as nothing like the objective reality it was proclaimed to be. Consequently the <italic>partiality</italic> of the economy was thrown into sharp relief, and the anger and confusion this has caused has been directed at ‘bankers’.</p>

<title>The interregnum</title>
<p>These are the forces which created the field of lived experience in which the events of August 2011 took place. They devolve upon a multifaceted invalidation of the English social imaginary. Specifically, the events took place in a precise moment of interregnum after the death of the old imaginary and before the emergence of another. This is why the events were focused on consumer goods. Consumer goods are tangible – they appear to offer something certain in the circumstances of the interregnum when everything else has been invalidated. Consumer goods are attractive in this sort of conjuncture because they simply <italic>are</italic>. They do not demand to be thought about (they are simply used or displayed), and therefore they can appear to stand as a bulwark against the morbid symptoms of the interregnum. The events in England have revealed in a decisive way the invalidation of the once-but-no-longer taken for granted social imaginary. It has become invalid because of different forces which came together in the conjunctural moment of early August by the addition of the catalysing ingredient of the shooting of Mark Duggan. The result was a moment of crisis in the interregnum, a moment which revealed the extent to which authority now rests simply on coercion and aspiration looks for free consumer goods.</p>
<p>When he wrote about the interregnum in Italy, Gramsci wondered: ‘The problem is the following: can a rift between popular masses and the ruling ideologies ... be “cured” by the simple exercise of force, preventing the new ideologies from imposing themselves? Will the interregnum, the crisis whose historically normal solution is blocked in this way, necessarily be resolved in favour of a restoration of the old?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0725513612442353">Gramsci 1971</xref>: 276). The question remains, but in England, as the August events show, there are no popular masses, no legitimate ruling ideologies, and the old is beyond restoration. Neither is there a political movement to create the new. As England’s August demonstrated, all that remains is, in Gramsci’s words ‘physical depression ... widespread scepticism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0725513612442353">Gramsci 1971</xref>: 276) and, not in Gramsci’s words, the fleeting pleasure of getting something for nothing.</p>
<p>But to paraphrase Peggy Lee: ‘Is that <italic>all</italic> there is?’</p>

<p>This point about solidarity and integration is reinforced in another way. There have been absolutely no reports of the looters fighting amongst themselves for the best spoils. CCTV footage of lootings shows an activity which is fast and furious but, in its own way, completely orderly. The looters, brick-throwers and car-torchers actually worked together to do what they did, and it would not be surprising to find them working according to an informal but nevertheless coherent division of labour.</p>

<p>In his important book <italic>Memories of Class</italic>, Bauman explores how memories of class and the institutionalization of class struggle caused the socialist movement to act according to memories which could distort praxis in contemporary struggles. Yet these memories made the contemporary struggle make sense, and linked it to a tradition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0725513612442353">Bauman 1982</xref>). Memory as distortion characterizes some comments about what happened in August 2011. For example, Jenny Bourne of the Institute of Race Relations draws on memories of romanticized 1970s radicalism and a consequent myopia towards the contemporary conjuncture to see in the events ‘a political rage. ... Theirs was the violence of the violated’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0725513612442353">Bourne 2011</xref>). This interpretation owes everything to institutionalized memory, nothing to analysis.</p>

<p>The situation is quite different in Scotland and Wales. In both those places a social imaginary retains some validity. This is because of the effects of devolution which allow the Scottish and Welsh assemblies to follow their own policies in some areas (such as education), and the consequent consolidation of a sense of distinct and distinctive collective practice. It is noticeable that in international sports events Scottish and Welsh national teams sing their own national anthems whereas the English teams sing the British anthem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0725513612442353">Paxman 1998</xref>: 11). In the case of Wales, and to a lesser extent Scotland, the imagination of a distinctive collectivity is further enhanced by indigenous language education and broadcasting.</p>
