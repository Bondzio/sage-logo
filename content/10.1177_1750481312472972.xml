<p><italic>Dialogue in Intercultural Communities</italic> is a language-use research report in the John Benjamins’ series entitled ‘Dialogue Studies’ (DS) edited by Edda Weigand. It details an empirical study of communication research in CISV (Children’s International Summer Villages). Participants included children, adolescents and adults. The research was conducted under the program ‘Mediation in intercultural practices, in managing conflicts and in social promotion’, funded by the Italian Ministry and supported by CISV (p. 2). This book therefore approaches and promotes the establishment of active interpersonal relationships, which were observed in coordination and management of intercultural conflicts in CISV. The book consists of 10 chapters plus a conclusion. It can be divided into four parts: Chapter 1 offers the theoretical framework from linguistic and sociological perspectives; Chapter 2 presents the research project with its methodological plan; and Chapters 3 to 10 examine the results of the research. The concluding chapter summarizes participants’ interactions and narratives in intercultural settings and presents recommendations for future research.</p>
<p>In Chapter 1, Claudio Baraldi provides a conceptual framework and theoretical foundation for the book, specifically referring to the terms and data used in the linguistic and sociological analysis of communication systems and intercultural presuppositions. This chapter also presents the overall objectives for the study: first to study the participants’ language use in organizational and educational activities, and second to promote peaceful interpersonal and intercultural relations through increasing children’s competence in navigating cultural obstacles.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 deals with the empirical foundations of this study. The research plan presents participants (children from villages, adolescents from summer camps, adult leaders, camp directors and other staff), an overview of the CISV narrative and activities, research questions, research methodology and design.</p>
<p>Chapters 3 to 10 mainly discuss the research results. Gabriella Cortesi in Chapter 3 investigates children’s, adolescents’ and adults’ narratives from their experience in CISV, such as: the narrative of ‘diversity and friendship’, ‘learning, autonomy and active participation’, ‘conflict and conflict management’, ‘adults’ contributions empowering dialogue’ and ‘the experience’. Cortesi finds that ‘the main reason for conflicts among delegates is misunderstanding’ (p. 59) and that ‘these narratives do not seem to confirm that cultural variability is a main issue in the CISV experience’ (p. 72). The narrative results which are not in line with the CISV cultural presuppositions actually reveal the need for considering complex factors in real intercultural interaction.</p>
<p>Chapters 4 and 5 are concerned with organizational meetings (OMs). Chapter 4 points to organizational meetings as the main approach for dealing with everyday educational activities in CISV villages and summer camps. Presentations focus on proposals and problems arising in OMs, and observe the ways in which empowering dialogue is improved and which barriers prevent progress. However, reaction to these proposals and problems requires much coordination and mediation. This chapter also details the differences between the projection of empowering dialogue and the projection of normative expectations. Chapter 5 further examines the analysis of organizational meetings, especially methods of conflict management, which mainly are settled through a list of conflict-avoidance strategies, such as conflict withdrawal and minimization, elusion through diversion, mitigation, postponement, coordination and mediation.</p>
<p>Chapters 6–10 mainly focus on: 1) features of participants’ activities, especially children’s involvement under adults’ education and promotion; 2) conflict management; 3) interaction among adolescents in summer camps; and 4) translation in the development of activities. Chapter 6 explores the interaction between adults and children, and between adults and adolescents, in village and summer camps. This chapter also reveals that adults’ dialogic actions occur less frequently in villages than in summer camps and further shows that it is more difficult to promote children’s participation than that of adolescents. The analysis of debriefing sessions, which Federico Farini undertakes in Chapter 7, points to the fact that children have fewer opportunities to initiate participation under hierarchical and cultural presuppositions.</p>
<p>Chapter 8 shows that the cultural presupposition of placing greater emphasis on the concept of <italic>We-identity</italic> rather than <italic>I-identity</italic> will cause fewer conflicts during activities between children and adults. Moreover, the strategies of dialogic actions and promotion are less frequently applied in conflict management.</p>
<p>Chapter 9 examines adolescents’ participation in activities at summer camp. Claudio Baraldi and Alessandra Braglia argue that adolescents more actively participate in interaction than children. In addition, adolescents’ better competence brings about more active coordination when using the three main strategies of ballots, withdrawal and diversion. Furthermore, these three strategies can also be used effectively for conflict management at the same time.</p>
<p>Chapter 10 explores the importance of translation in activities. Children or adolescents who speak English as a second language may somehow find this ability prevents them from engaging in active participation, coordination and effective conflict management.</p>
<p>The last chapter concludes by stating that empowering dialogues and disempowering monologues in language interaction are important ingredients for analyzing the cultural presuppositions of CISV activities. Moreover, it argues that the involvement of the participants’ coordination and dialogic mediation are more important than insistence on intercultural settings.</p>
<p><italic>Dialogue in Intercultural Communities</italic> has undisputable merits for socio-linguistic research, especially in its various and impressive pragmatic structures used in participation enhancement, conflict avoidance and empowerment stimulation. Another noteworthy merit of this book is that it offers invaluable insight into the community interaction in intercultural settings based on its analysis of vast transcribed videotaped data. The convincing research results and explanations will certainly be valuable to, and provide inspiration for, future study and further investigation.</p>
<p>All in all, this is a clear, accessible and engaging book both in its conceptual framework as well as in its methodological and analytical perspectives. I would highly recommend the book to students or researchers who want to overcome communication problems in diverse cultural interaction.</p>
