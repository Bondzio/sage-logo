<p>This article examines television and housing as sites of struggle over segregation in postwar Philadelphia. WFIL-TV, which was part of Walter Annenberg’s media empire, broadcast to a four state region it called “WFIL-adelphia,” and emphasized the station’s ability to help advertisers reach millions of these regional consumers in parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland. At the same time, however, the racial tensions around WFIL’s West Philadelphia studio threatened to scare off advertisers. Just steps from the station’s front door, for example, black families seeking to move into West Philadelphia faced organized resistance from white homeowners associations. Scared of offending local and regional viewers and advertisers, WFIL implemented racial discriminatory admissions policies in its most popular show, the teenage dance program <italic>Bandstand</italic> (which became <italic>American Bandstand</italic>). I argue that, in working to maintain segregated spaces, both WFIL-TV and white homeowners associations practiced overlapping and reinforcing versions of defensive localism.</p>

</p>
<p>Throughout 1954, white and African American teenagers fought outside of WFIL-TV’s West Philadelphia studio on an almost daily basis. Philadelphia experienced more than its share of racial tension in this era, but these teenager brawls stand out because a television program sparked them. WFIL broadcast the popular, regionally televised teenage dance show <italic>Bandstand</italic> (which became the nationally televised <italic>American Bandstand</italic> in 1957). It broadcast <italic>Bandstand</italic> to parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland, a four-state region it called “WFIL-adelphia.” In its calls for advertisers, WFIL emphasized the station’s ability to help advertisers reach millions of these regional consumers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0096144211420644">3</xref></sup> It was a particularly lucrative advertising venue because it was part of Walter Annenberg’s media empire, which also included WFIL radio, the <italic>Philadelphia Inquirer</italic>, <italic>TV Guide</italic>, and <italic>Seventeen Magazine</italic>, among other properties. At the same time WFIL aimed to capitalize on its regional market, the area around the station’s West Philadelphia studio became a site of intense struggles over racial discrimination in housing. Just blocks from <italic>Bandstand</italic>’s studio doors, white home owners associations and civil rights advocates fought a block-by-block battle over housing. Groups of home owners like the Angora Civic Association sought to prevent black families from moving into West Philadelphia. The racial tensions around <italic>Bandstand</italic>’s West Philadelphia studio threatened to scare off the advertisers who funded the show and forced <italic>Bandstand</italic>’s producers to take a position on integration. Fueled by the show’s commercial ambitions, the producers chose not to allow black teenagers to enter the studio. By blocking black teens from the studio, <italic>Bandstand</italic>, like the white home owners associations, sought to protect homes from the perceived dangers of integration.</p>
<p>The respective efforts of WFIL and the white homeowners associations to maintain segregated spaces constituted overlapping and reinforcing versions of “defensive localism,” a term used by sociologist Margaret Weir and historian Thomas Sugrue to describe the way homeowners associations emphasized their right to protect their property values and the racial identity of their neighborhoods.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0096144211420644">4</xref></sup> As historian David Freund has shown, white home owners in the postwar era expressed a deeply held belief that black people posed a threat to white property values. This way of viewing race was significant, Freund argues, “because it allowed whites to address their racial preoccupations by talking about property instead of people.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0096144211420644">5</xref></sup> In <italic>Forbidden Neighbors</italic>, his 1955 study of racial bias in housing, Charles Abrams notes the pervasiveness of this link between race and property values. “Homeowners, home-builders, and mortgage-lenders seemed convinced that people should live only with their own kind, that the presence of a single minority family destroys property values and undermines social prestige and status. National and local real estate organizations were accepting these assumptions as gospel, as were popular magazines, college texts, and technical journals.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0096144211420644">6</xref></sup> As Abrams notes, the federal government and private mortgage lenders directed housing loans to maintain segregated housing markets. At the neighborhood level, white home owners associations used covenants and violence to protect what they viewed as their right to live in racially homogenous neighborhoods. The term <italic>defensive localism</italic> is useful for understanding white mobilization for segregation because it links the monetization and racialization of space. As in other northern cities, anti-integration forces in Philadelphia seldom used explicitly racist language to defend their position. Rather, racial integration was rejected as a threat to property values. This logic applied not just to home owners but also to the television stations and advertisers that sought to reach them. Figured in this way, the pursuit of profit, in this case through home equity or advertising revenue, could be used as a defense of racial prejudice and de facto segregation. Indeed, while home owners associations fought to protect their home investments by keeping their neighborhoods exclusively white, WFIL fought to protect the commercial prospects of the fledgling <italic>Bandstand</italic> by making the show’s representations of Philadelphia teenagers “safe” for television viewers in “WFIL-adelphia.”</p>
<p>By locating these struggles over housing and television in postwar Philadelphia, this article contributes to the excellent recent histories of the city by Matthew Countryman, Lisa Levenstein, James Wolfinger, and Guian McKee.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0096144211420644">7</xref></sup> Matthew Countryman has shown Philadelphia’s importance to the postwar history of civil rights and to the development of black power politics. Countryman’s work makes it clear that de facto segregation was entrenched in northern cities like Philadelphia, and I build on this work by exploring how white mobilization for segregated housing and the development of television programming that accommodated these sentiments shaped how people saw the city in racialized ways. Lisa Levenstein demonstrates how working-class black women played leading roles in grassroots activism. While different from the public institutions that Levenstein highlights, <italic>Bandstand</italic> was an important part of the everyday youth culture of which young black women were a part. Among the black teenagers who protested their exclusion from <italic>Bandstand</italic>, young working-class women from William Penn High School were the first to ask the city’s Commission on Human Relations to address the show’s discrimination, and after the show debuted nationally as <italic>American Bandstand</italic>, young black women continued to push for equal access to the program. My analysis of white home owners groups builds on James Wolfinger’s detailed study of everyday fights over work and housing and contributes a new perspective on how these efforts to defend white privilege resonated via television across neighborhood, city, and regional levels. Finally, Guian McKee shows that Philadelphia city leaders recognized the problem of deindustrialization earlier than most and developed regional responses to counteract these declines. The “WFIL-adelphia” marketing campaign, developed by Annenberg’s Triangle Publications to appeal to advertisers, shows that media corporations also had a stake in, and profited from, this regional growth.</p>
<p>This article also brings together work by historians of postwar urban culture and television. While historians Thomas Sugrue and Eric Avila have examined the sociospatial transformations of postwar metropolitan areas, media scholars Lynn Spigel and Victoria Johnson have explored the spatial relationships engendered by television in postwar cities, suburbs, and rural areas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0096144211420644">8</xref></sup> This study builds on both lines of analysis by emphasizing that postwar television was both urban and regional, that it was both a physical site of production and a network of viewers and advertisers responding to televisual images. Media studies scholar Anna McCarthy describes this as television’s capacity to be both “site-specific” and “space-binding.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0096144211420644">9</xref></sup> These qualities were in tension for WFIL. The everyday actions in Philadelphia and the images broadcast across “WFIL-adelphia” influenced each other in important ways. The station and its advertisers wanted access to the population, spending power, and creative potential of the nation’s third largest market, without any of the perceived problems of broadcasting from an urban area with a racially diverse population. With <italic>Bandstand</italic>, WFIL resolved this tension by drawing on Philadelphia’s interracial music scene to create an entertaining and profitable television show, while refusing to allow the city’s black teenagers into the studio audience for fear of alienating viewers and advertisers. Like the white home owners associations’ concerns about property values, WFIL’s version of defensive localism built on a belief that integration would hurt the station’s investment in <italic>Bandstand</italic>. When WFIL’s <italic>Bandstand</italic> broadcast images of white teens on a daily basis, it disseminated the anti-integrationist views held by home owners associations across a large regional broadcasting area. This broad view of defensive localism, stretching from the local home owners associations around WFIL’s West Philadelphia studio to the station’s racially exclusive admissions policies on <italic>Bandstand</italic>, illustrates how housing and television formed overlapping and reinforcing sites of struggles over segregation and how the everyday material reality of race in Philadelphia intersected with media representations of race in “WFIL-adelphia.”</p>

<title>Housing Fights in West Philadelphia</title>
<p>WFIL opened its West Philadelphia studio at 46th and Market Streets just before <italic>Bandstand</italic> debuted in 1952. The studio housed all of the station’s radio and television operations and sat next to the Market Street elevated train that connected West Philadelphia with center city to the east and Upper Darby to the west.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0096144211420644">10</xref></sup> While Market Street featured primarily storefronts, the area surrounding <italic>Bandstand</italic>’s West Philadelphia studio included a mix of residential housing types including two- and three-story row homes, three-story Victorian semidetached “twin homes,” low-rise apartment complexes, and a smaller number of detached single-family homes. Although the area was less densely populated than South Philadelphia and North Philadelphia in the early 1900s, West Philadelphia experienced a period of rapid urbanization from 1910 through 1940, and by WWII, the area housed almost 20 percent of the city’s total population.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0096144211420644">11</xref></sup> The racial demographics of the city, and especially the area around its West Philadelphia studio, were changing rapidly when <italic>Bandstand</italic> debuted.</p>
<p>Demographic figures convey the scope of racial change in Philadelphia in this era. From 1930 to 1960, the city’s black population grew by three hundred thousand, increasing from 11.4 percent of the city’s total population to 26.4 percent. The changes were similarly dramatic in West Philadelphia. The black population expanded in West Philadelphia after World War I and settled primarily in the area between 32nd and 40th Streets and from University Avenue to Lancaster. This eastern section of West Philadelphia, then called the “black bottom,” expanded again in the 1940s and 1950s. Working-class blacks were drawn to the area because of strong neighborhood institutions and opportunities to rent apartments and houses denied them in other parts of the city. By the 1950s, the “black bottom” was a vibrant neighborhood of businesses and row homes, 15 to 20 percent of which were owned by black families.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0096144211420644">12</xref></sup> Through the 1940s and 1950s, as many white residents moved to new suburban developments in other areas, West Philadelphia’s black population continued to expand further west and north. The increase first occurred above Market Street, an area with many subdivided housing units and lower rents. Through the 1950s and 1960s, black families expanded to the west of the “black bottom” on the south side of Market Street where home ownership opportunities were greater.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0096144211420644">13</xref></sup> By 1960, the black population in West Philadelphia was the second largest in the city.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0096144211420644">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>These statistics, however, do not adequately convey the block-by-block struggle over housing. Racially discriminatory housing practices fueled the concentration of blacks in West Philadelphia and other neighborhoods. Private housing developers openly discriminated because they believed their white customers wanted segregated neighborhoods. As the former president of the Philadelphia Real Estate Board acknowledged, “[M]ost of the people when purchasing or renting homes place great value upon exclusiveness in terms of religion and ancestry, and particularly to color. These desires are in conflict with the basic concept of the open market.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0096144211420644">15</xref></sup> Fair housing advocate Charles Abrams also noted that builders could accommodate white home buyers racial prejudice without raising the price of the home. “Unlike the tiled bathroom, venetian blinds, and television outlets,” Abrams noted, “the promise of racial exclusiveness cost the builder nothing.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0096144211420644">16</xref></sup> These real estate practices severally limited the housing options for black Philadelphians. A 1953 Commission on Human Relations study of new private housing in the Philadelphia metropolitan area found that only 1,044 of more than 140,000 recently constructed units (less than 1 percent) were available to blacks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0096144211420644">17</xref></sup> From 1946 to 1953, only forty-five new homes were offered for sale to blacks. With their options limited by racially restrictive covenants and mortgage redlining, the other twenty-thousand black families who became home owners in this period bought second-hand houses at higher financing charges.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0096144211420644">18</xref></sup> Historian Beryl Satter has shown how speculators profited by selling houses to African Americans on exploitative terms. “The reason for the decline of so many black urban neighborhoods into slums was not the absence of resources,” Satter argues, “but rather the <italic>riches</italic> that could be drawn from the seemingly poor vein of aged and decrepit housing and hard-pressed but hardworking and ambitious African Americans.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0096144211420644">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>This widespread housing discrimination posed a challenge for the city’s Commission on Human Relations (CHR). The city’s voters passed a city charter in 1951 that established the CHR to administer antidiscrimination provisions in employment and public accommodations. The CHR’s first annual report declared that, with the support from the city’s administration, the CHR’s “substantial powers of investigation,” and “strong community backing mobilized by the Fellowship Commission,” the city had assembled the tools for an “effective attack on racial and religious prejudice and discrimination and for building rich and wholesome relationships among the racial, religious and nationality groups that make up America.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0096144211420644">20</xref></sup> The creation of the CHR encouraged many Philadelphians to see their city as a leader in racial equality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0096144211420644">Figure 1</xref>). At the same time, however, the CHR lacked the power to address housing or educational discrimination, and its case-by-case approach to employment discrimination was overwhelmed by the number of complaints received.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0096144211420644">21</xref></sup> For its part, the Fellowship Commission, the city’s leading civil rights coalition, prioritized fair employment legislation over fair housing legislation, before eventually lobbying the state to enact a narrowly tailored housing bill (excluding private sales of owner occupied houses) in 1961.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0096144211420644">22</xref></sup> Without fair housing legislation, black residents in West Philadelphia and other neighborhoods continued to face a restricted housing market throughout the 1950s.</p>

</fig>
<p>In addition to restrictive housing covenants, white home owners formed associations in neighborhoods across the city to block what they viewed as the encroachment of black families in all-white neighborhoods. In West Philadelphia, the Angora Civic Association (ACA) sought to prevent black families from moving into the Angora-Sherwood sections of West Philadelphia, along Baltimore Avenue from 50th to 60th Streets. The ACA resembled white home owners groups that mobilized to maintain segregated neighborhoods in Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Miami, Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and elsewhere across the country.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0096144211420644">23</xref></sup> These groups used a range of tactics to achieve their aims, including mob violence and physical and mental harassment. While these home owners groups were a nationwide phenomenon, the ACA is noteworthy because of its proximity to the WFIL studio and because the group’s founding coincided with <italic>Bandstand</italic>’s debut.</p>
<p>Starting in 1952, the ACA distributed fliers and held meetings encouraging its neighbors to exercise their rights as home owners. A contemporary study of the racial change in this West Philadelphia neighborhood noted, “The entry of nonwhites appears to have come as a heavy shock to white residents, an a sever panic existed through 1954.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0096144211420644">24</xref></sup> Indeed, the language in the association’s meetings and flyers stressed the white home owners’ anxiety at the prospect of a racially changing neighborhood. One meeting notice invited residents in this section of West Philadelphia:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>To discuss some very serious problems which are confronting your neighborhood NOW. One of these problems may be right in your block, or even as close as next door. At any rate one of them cannot be very far away. One thing we can assure you of is that they are not mythical or imaginary, but very real, and will require very real concentrated and realistic attention if you want your neighborhood to remain as it now is.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0096144211420644">25</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Another flier asked, “Do you like your home and neighborhood? Then why not protect them?” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0096144211420644">Figure 2</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0096144211420644">26</xref></sup> Aware that members of the CHR and Fellowship Commission covertly attended their meetings, the home owner groups avoided racist epithets in favor of thinly veiled references to neighborhood “problems” and “undesirable” neighbors. In the ACA’s view, keeping black families from buying houses in the neighborhood would protect both the racial identity of the neighborhood and the property values of their homes. Since home ownership represented a significant financial investment in this working-class and middle-class area, fears of blockbusting and panic selling fueled the ACA’s economic anxiety. A meeting announcement warned, “If you are ready and willing to throw away thousands of $$$ for what you now have and own, then throw this notice away and don’t read any further.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0096144211420644">27</xref></sup> The ACA regularly drew between fifty and three hundred people to their monthly sessions, and as many as seven hundred attended their most popular meetings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0096144211420644">28</xref></sup> Although the historical evidence does not allow a close analysis of the association’s membership, meeting records include names such as Petrella, DeRosa, Callahan, Vandergrift, Craig, Stahl, and Rabinowitz, suggesting that individuals from several white ethnic groups participated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0096144211420644">29</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>At its most well-attended meetings, the ACA invited leaders of similar white home owner groups from other parts of the city to share tactical ideas and offer support. The leader of the eleven-year-old Overbrook Improvement Co., for example, told the ACA of his group’s success in keeping blacks out of the Overbrook neighborhood in the northwest section of West Philadelphia. The Overbrook group president, Harold Stott, recommended “putting pressure on real estate men, banks and mortgage companies,” and he advised the ACA to raise money to buy houses in the neighborhood so that they could be resold to whites rather than blacks. While these home owner groups did not openly advocate violence, they suggested that white residents should try “psychological methods.” These methods included repeated visits by white neighbors asking the “undesirable” family to move, vandalism of property, and threats of violence to dissuade black families from moving into the neighborhood and to convince those who did manage to buy houses to sell their homes to the corporation and move out.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0096144211420644">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Throughout these meetings, the ACA, the Overbrook association, and other groups stressed both the urgency and the legality of their cause. “Help!! Help!!” proclaimed one meeting notice. “These are words we hear every day from the Property Owners of our Community. Our Association can render you this help <italic>If You Want It</italic>!” This notice ended with an ominous evaluation: “IT’S LATER THAN YOU THINK!”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0096144211420644">31</xref></sup> This language resonated with similar appeals to antiblack prejudice in Philadelphia during and after World War II. Historian James Wolfinger has shown that Republican campaign brochures that circulated in Irish and Italian sections of West Philadelphia during 1944 used similar language to warn residents that “black domination” threatened their city. “Will you stand by and see our homes, schools and our entire neighborhood taken away from you and your children by a race stimulated by RUM—JAZZ—WAR EASY MONEY?” the pamphlet read. “Vote a straight Republican Ballot next Tuesday and save your salvation.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0096144211420644">32</xref></sup> In addition, fliers linked to a resurgent Ku Klux Klan in Philadelphia in the early-1950s urged white men to join forces for “the protection of homes and loved ones.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0096144211420644">33</xref></sup> Despite appealing to racist sentiments, the white home owner’s groups defended their calls to action by asserting what they viewed to be their legal rights as truly American home owners. The Overbrook group president told the 120 residents at the meeting that “[the members of the ACA] are 100% Americans. All they are asking is to keep the high standards of their own neighborhood and to pick their neighbors besides protecting their property. In doing this they are exercising their rights under the Bill of Rights and there certainly is nothing un-American about that.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0096144211420644">34</xref></sup> This rights rhetoric cast the home owners groups as possessing an Americanness—and whiteness—threatened by black interlopers. As David Freund notes in his study of suburban Detroit, this language of property rights enabled whites to mobilize for segregation as “home owners,” “citizens,” “taxpayers,” and “parents” while maintaining that they were not racist.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0096144211420644">35</xref></sup> In his study of California’s ballot initiatives, political scientist Daniel Martinez HoSang describes this rights rhetoric as central to a set of “norms, ‘settled expectations,’ and ‘investments’ [that] shape the interpretation of political interests, the boundaries of political communities, and the sources of power for many political actors who understand themselves as white.” Like the “political whiteness” HoSang identifies in postwar California, white homeowners associations fought to protect “our neighborhoods,” “our kids,” “our property values,” and “our rights,” while claiming to be innocent of racism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0096144211420644">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>These white home owners groups also directed their defensive localism and rights discourse toward the Fellowship Commission. The leaders of the Angora and Overbrook associations accused the commission of forcing its integration agenda on blacks. Reporting on a Fellowship Commission meeting that he attended covertly, the Overbrook association president told the home owners’ groups that the “colored” people at the meeting “did not seem to be at all interested in housing [but] the ‘Fellowship Boys’ got up and agitated these people by saying to them that they had the right to move in to any street or any neighborhood in Philadelphia they wanted to.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0096144211420644">37</xref></sup> The Overbrook president advised the association members, “You see that these Fellowship people are fellowship for them only—no fellowship for everybody.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0096144211420644">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>The home owners’ associations also accused the Fellowship Commission of being involved in a “sinister conspiracy” with real estate agents who had reportedly convinced white home owners to sell their houses to blacks, thereby “blockbusting” all-white neighborhoods. There is no evidence that the Fellowship Commission and real estate agents worked in concert, and, in fact, real estate brokers played a much larger role than the commission in helping black families move into formerly all-white neighborhoods. Real estate agents had complex motives, but, in almost every case, racially changing neighborhoods presented brokers with substantial economic opportunities. Blockbusting real estate brokers looked for, and sometimes fostered, panic in racially changing neighborhoods and bought homes at below-market prices from panicked white sellers. They then placed advertisements in black newspapers touting these new home ownership opportunities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0096144211420644">39</xref></sup> The <italic>Philadelphia Tribune</italic>, the city’s largest black newspaper, ran several such advertisements every week during the early and mid-1950s. A real estate advertisement from 1952, for example, advised readers to “Go West Young Man. Come to West Philadelphia.” Another realty company promised that “we will secure homes for you in any neighborhood desired,” while a company billing itself as “Phila.’s Most Progressive Office” listed different “West Phila. Specials” on a weekly basis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0096144211420644">40</xref></sup> These homes usually sold at a markup to black buyers looking for good quality homes. While these agents helped expand home ownership opportunities for the city’s black residents, they also accelerated the tensions in racially changing neighborhoods like West Philadelphia, and many brokers made a lot of money in the process.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0096144211420644">41</xref></sup> For the white home owner groups, both blockbusting real estate agents and the Fellowship Commission represented outside agitators threatening the racial identity of their neighborhood.</p>
<p>Since the CHR lacked the ability to prosecute cases of housing discrimination, the Fellowship Commission took a different approach. The commission believed that their best options were simultaneously to try both to win the ACA over by persuading it that its actions would only foster panic selling and to isolate the group by planning meetings and events to improve relations in the racially changing neighborhoods of West Philadelphia. The Fellowship Commission and its West Philadelphia chapter worked with the CHR and local Baptist and Catholic clergy to reach out to the home owner groups. A flier for the Fellowship Commission’s first outreach meeting in 1954, under the headline “Let’s All Pull Together,” invited residents to talk “facts about West Philadelphia” concerning “money, people and houses for sale.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0096144211420644">42</xref></sup> Illustrating the strength of the commission’s relationships with the city’s Democratic Party, the city’s district attorney and future mayor, Richardson Dilworth, spoke at the meeting. Fellowship Commission executive director Maurice Fagan also met with the ACA president privately, advising him that the commission was concerned with the rights of religious and nationality groups as well as those of racial groups.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0096144211420644">43</xref></sup> Fagan further told the ACA that the commission would not object to “open and above board” civic associations. These efforts to influence the attitudes of white home owners prefigured the CHR’s 1958 series of “What to Do” kits that were distributed to residents in racially changing communities. Aimed at local leaders in areas like West Philadelphia, these “What to Do” folders included suggestions for local leaders on how to organize and conduct meetings to discuss the importance of communities working together to avoid panic selling and to ensure fair housing practices. While the CHR distributed the kits widely in an attempt to meet the scale of racial change in the neighborhood, they did not lead to a substantial decrease in reports of community tensions over housing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0096144211420644">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition to these outreach efforts, the Fellowship Commission also sponsored neighborhood seminars to encourage community involvement in intergroup relations. Foremost among these efforts, the commission worked with principals, teachers, and home and school associations to plan interplayground fellowship events at the elementary schools in West Philadelphia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0096144211420644">45</xref></sup> These events were well attended and well received by many black and white parents and children in the area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0096144211420644">Figure 3</xref>). The Fellowship Commission’s efforts appear to have limited the growth of the ACA past 1955. Racial tensions in other West Philadelphia neighborhoods and other parts of the city, however, overwhelmed the Fellowship Commission’s resources.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0096144211420644">46</xref></sup> In his evaluation of the commission’s work in 1955, Fagan asserted,</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>New problems are developing faster than old ones are being solved because of the emphasis on cases instead of causes. With only 35 full-time workers in the entire city of Philadelphia, it is not possible . . . to do more than move from crisis to crisis, neighborhood to neighborhood, without staying put long enough to make an enduring difference.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0096144211420644">47</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>

<p>As Fagan noted, the depth of white resistance to racial integration overwhelmed the Fellowship Commission’s educational strategy.</p>
<p>On the legislative front, the Fellowship Commission played an important role in passing the state’s fair housing bill, which was enacted in 1961. The commission, however, lobbied the forty-two member groups of the Pennsylvania Equal Rights Council to advance a narrow bill that covered new housing and housing transactions receiving government assistance, but excluded sales of owner-occupied homes such as those frequently purchased by blacks in racially changing urban neighborhoods.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0096144211420644">48</xref></sup> While the commission’s fair housing bill made political sense in an effort to get legislation through the Republican-controlled state senate, the bill’s exemptions aligned with the view of property rights being advocated by the white home owner groups and weakened the credibility of the commission’s approach to civil rights.</p>
<p>The magnitude of the challenges facing the Fellowship Commission and other fair housing advocates, however, was immense. Discriminatory federal housing policy and the business practices of real estate industry blocked black families from most new suburban construction and managed the racial turnover of urban neighborhoods. Mortgage redlining treated black neighborhoods and black home owners as investment risks, and this lack of access to credit limited the efficacy of open occupancy or fair housing legislation for many African Americans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0096144211420644">49</xref></sup> Combining with these factors, white home owner groups and civic associations policed the boundaries of segregated neighborhoods and demonstrated what James Wolfinger calls “the limits imposed on liberalism from below.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0096144211420644">50</xref></sup> In many cities and states, this resistance to integrated housing coalesced into organized opposition to fair housing legislation. Most notably, in the 1964 election 65 percent of California voters approved Proposition 14, which sought to nullify the Rumford Fair Housing Act (the state Supreme Court declared Proposition 14 unconstitutional in 1966). As with the ACA, supporters of Proposition 14, such as future California governor and U.S. president Ronald Reagan, portrayed fair housing legislation as “forced housing” and as “an infringement of one of our basic individual rights.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0096144211420644">51</xref></sup> As historian Robert Self shows in his study of Oakland, this language of property rights appealed to a large cross section of white voters. “The numbers suggest that the resistance to desegregation in Oakland did not come solely from an antiliberal white working class,” Self argues, “but arose equally among middle- and upper-class whites who understood property rights as sacrosanct expressions of their personal freedom and had little daily contact with African Americans.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0096144211420644">52</xref></sup> Similarly, historian Phil Ethington notes that in Los Angeles, the white neighborhoods most geographically isolated from black communities were more likely to vote to repeal fair housing legislation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0096144211420644">53</xref></sup> While anti-fair-housing legislation did not become a ballot issue in Pennsylvania, a 1965 survey of residents in Philadelphia suburbs found that over 70 percent considered “keeping undesirables out” to be a very important objective for local government, rating it well ahead of “maintaining improved public services,” “providing aesthetic amenities,” or “acquiring business and industry.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0096144211420644">54</xref></sup> Attempts to pass fair housing legislation at the federal level also encountered significant resistance. When President Lyndon Johnson first tried to push a national fair housing bill through Congress in 1966, for example, his aide recalled that the bill “prompted some of the most vicious mail LBJ received on any subject.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0096144211420644">55</xref></sup> When Congress finally passed the 1968 Fair Housing Act in the wake of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the bill’s weak enforcement provisions did little to curb housing discrimination.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0096144211420644">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>Sociologist Jill Quadagno summarizes opposition to fair housing legislation simply, arguing that, “[F]or many white Americans, property rights superseded civil rights.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0096144211420644">57</xref></sup> White mobilization for segregated neighborhoods, in combination with discriminatory federal housing policy, the business practices of the real estate industry, and the shortcomings of local and federal antidiscrimination policies in housing, made residential segregation the norm in cities and suburbs around the nation. This residential segregation emerged from and reinforced a belief that a neighborhood’s racial composition and property values were intertwined and mutually constitutive. This way of viewing space informed everyday encounters across the United States, and in Philadelphia it motivated white home owners groups like the ACA to fight for segregation. This group was part of a larger national story, but it also reflected and influenced racial attitudes locally, in <italic>Bandstand</italic>’s backyard.</p>

<title>Creating “WFIL-adelphia”</title>
<p>Broadcasting from West Philadelphia, WFIL could not ignore the battles over segregation taking place around its studio and across the city. The station, however, had a vested interest in not presenting visual evidence of these local fights to its regional viewers. Like the ACA, WFIL viewed the station’s neighborhood through the lenses of property values and race. Yet while the home owners groups fought over individual houses and blocks, WFIL’s calculations included millions of homes in the Philadelphia region and the advertisers eager to reach this lucrative market. This meant that WFIL courted not only viewers in Philadelphia and the growing suburban counties outside of the city but also those across a four-state broadcast region that included parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland. The station called this area “WFIL-adelphia,” and in the early-1950s the station made this phrase the centerpiece of its marketing campaign. Radio and television broadcast signals, of course, do not conform to the geographic or political boundaries of cities, so WFIL was not unique in having a regional audience. WFIL’s use of “WFIL-adelphia” to bring the station, city, and region together under one brand name, however, illuminates the station’s approach to early television and is essential to understanding how <italic>Bandstand</italic> became segregated.</p>
<p>The “WFIL-adelphia” moniker was part of a larger campaign by Walter Annenberg’s Triangle Publications, Inc. to promote the Delaware Valley as a center for business and industry. In October 1952, the <italic>Philadelphia Inquirer</italic> (owned by Annenberg) featured an eighty-page pullout magazine on the growth and promise of “Delaware Valley, U.S.A.” Aimed at the business community, the magazine’s inside cover thanked over eighty companies for their advertising support. The report, extolling the virtues of the Delaware Valley port and the region’s “steel, oil, textile, auto manufacturing, electronic, and chemical” industries, recalled the nineteenth-century boosterism that helped draw industries to Midwestern hubs like St. Louis and Chicago.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0096144211420644">58</xref></sup> A full-page world map, for example, illustrated how “raw materials from at least 75 foreign countries funneled into Delaware Valley” port facilities, including cocoa beans and iron ore from Nigeria, marble stone from Italy, and lumber from Brazil. All routes on the map lead back to the Delaware Valley, the only site labeled in the United States. A large circle marks the region, covering the entire Eastern Seaboard.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0096144211420644">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>While the Delaware Valley–centric worldview was undoubtedly exaggerated, promoting the Delaware Valley as a place of “amazing, breathless growth” and the “greatest industrial area of the world” also helped to promote the value of Annenberg’s media properties in the region.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0096144211420644">60</xref></sup> Indeed, two full-page advertisements described WFIL as the best way to connect people and potential customer across the Delaware Valley (or “WFIL-adelphia”) region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0096144211420644">Figure 4</xref>). WFIL promised advertisers that the television station would bring them “5,869,284 customers” across a “27-county area.” The ads described these viewers in explicitly monetary terms: “Advertisers . . . there’s $6 Billions waiting for you in WFIL-adelphia. SELL ALL of America’s 3rd market on WFIL-TV. You can really go to town—to hundreds of towns in the rich Philadelphia market—on WFIL-TV. . . . Get the most for your money, the most people for your money. Schedule WFIL-TV.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0096144211420644">61</xref></sup> West Philadelphia may have been the station’s physical home, but this vast regional “WFIL-adelphia” consumer market was what WFIL sold to <italic>Bandstand</italic>’s advertisers.</p>

</fig>
<p>These ads also cast “WFIL-adelphia” as the new “Main Street of Delaware Valley, U.S.A.”:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Turn statistics into people and you’ll find they have a common address: Main Street . . . MAIN STREET is every town’s link to the world. Today, thanks to electronic science, Main Street goes to the people. And from curb to curb of the Philadelphia Retail Trading area, the busiest Main Street is WFIL-adelphia. The population of this trading zone, as well as a vast area beyond, lives, works and shops in WFIL-adelphia. WFIL-adelphia is a market place—where America’s leading advertisers sell their wares, via WFIL-TV.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0096144211420644">62</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In describing “WFIL-adelphia” in this way, the ads re-envisioned the “resonant and symbolic location” of Main Street.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0096144211420644">63</xref></sup> Historian Alison Isenberg has described how “varied downtown investors endeavored to make their own markets and to chart Main Street’s future in order to protect and enhance their stakes.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0096144211420644">64</xref></sup> Isenberg notes how local newspapers and regional news companies, like Annenberg’s <italic>Philadelphia Inquirer</italic> and WFIL radio and television stations, had a vested interested in bolstering Main Street’s advertising value and frequently sponsored the Main Street postcards that were ubiquitous in the early twentieth century.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0096144211420644">65</xref></sup> “The ‘place’ . . . illuminated in the postcards was not a brick-and-mortar location,” Isenberg writes, “but rather a territory within American’s imaginations, a hopeful vision of urban commerce transformed.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0096144211420644">66</xref></sup> WFIL’s ads imagined the place of Main Street in similar ways. The ads did not make reference to a physical Main Street, but rather to the “5,869,284 customers” in homes dispersed across a “27-county area.” With “WFIL-adelphia,” WFIL promised to use broadcast technology to further transform urban and regional commerce. If Philadelphia could no longer connect businesses, advertisers, and customers on Main Street, “WFIL-adelphia” would provide this safe and prosperous commercial space (Disneyworld, of course, also made use of this Main Street ideal to promote a suburban and racially homogenous alternative to urban and multiracial commercial spaces when it opened in 1955).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0096144211420644">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>While not mentioned in the ads, the “WFIL-adelphia” viewers whom WFIL promoted to advertisers lived in states that supported racial segregation by both law and custom. Both Maryland and Delaware maintained de jure segregated school systems until the <italic>Brown</italic> decisions and resisted court ordered desegregation for another decade thereafter.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0096144211420644">68</xref></sup> Interracial marriage was also illegal in both states until <italic>Loving v. Virginia</italic> in 1967.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0096144211420644">69</xref></sup> For a station pitching itself as a regional Main Street, the existence of legal segregation in its broadcasting area offered a significant financial incentive to not upset anti-integration sentiment among viewers and advertisers. At the same time, the segregated housing policies in Pennsylvania suburbs also contributed to WFIL’s understanding of “WFIL-adelphia.” The <italic>Philadelphia Inquirer</italic>’s pullout magazine on the Delaware Valley offered pictures and glowing profiles of housing development under construction in Levittown and Fairness Hills, Pennsylvania, as evidence that the region was “booming.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0096144211420644">70</xref></sup> These neighboring Bucks County developments had policies that prevented blacks from buying homes, making Levittown and Fairness Hills what Charles Abrams termed “closed cities.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0096144211420644">71</xref></sup> While “WFIL-adelphia” attempted to reconstitute Main Street in an era of suburbanization, the decision to profile Levittown and Fairness Hills as exemplars of the Delaware Valley re-emphasized that “WFIL-adelphia” would privilege the desires and attitudes of white suburban consumers.</p>
<p>In this way, “WFIL-adelphia” offers an example of how television helped reorganize urban and suburban spaces. As media studies scholar Lynn Spigel has suggested, many postwar commentators argued that television “would allow people to travel from their homes while remaining untouched by the actual social contexts to which they imaginatively ventured.” Television could act as a space-binding tool to promote public culture among viewers living in detached single-family, suburban homes, while also keeping “undesirable” people and topics out of the home. Spigel calls this a “fantasy of antiseptic electrical space.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0096144211420644">72</xref></sup> “WFIL-adelphia” promised a version of “antiseptic electrical space” to both viewers and advertisers. To viewers, “WFIL-adelphia” offered the ideal of Main Street without upsetting the anti-integrationist attitudes of its viewers. To advertisers, “WFIL-adelphia” offered access to a growing market of suburban consumers with disposable income. All the while, WFIL still needed Philadelphia—the economies of scale it provided, the size of its population, and the creative energies of its people—to promote “WFIL-adelphia.” The best place to see how WFIL navigated the conflicting demands of “WFIL-adelphia” is the show that became the station’s most popular locally produced program, <italic>Bandstand</italic>.</p>

<sec id="section3-0096144211420644">
<title>Broadcasting <italic>Bandstand</italic> to “WFIL-adelphia”</title>
<p><italic>Bandstand</italic> premiered on October 6, 1952, as a daily program broadcast in the Philadelphia region from 3:30 to 4:45 p.m.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0096144211420644">73</xref></sup> Bob Horn, a WFIL radio deejay, became <italic>Bandstand</italic>’s first host (Dick Clark took over from Horn in 1956 after Horn was arrested for drunk driving). Thanks to a three-week promotional campaign, and the proximity of three high schools—West Catholic High for Girls, West Catholic High for Boys, and West Philadelphia High—<italic>Bandstand</italic> had no trouble filling the studio to its two hundred-person capacity. The predominately Irish and Italian teenage girls who attended West Catholic High for Girls, only two blocks from the studio, became the most consistent visitors to <italic>Bandstand</italic>. Teenage boys from West Catholic High for Boys were nearly as close, as were boys and girls from West Philadelphia High School, a public school that enrolled mostly Jewish and black students. Teens from other schools and neighborhoods also visited <italic>Bandstand</italic> shortly after its debut, and teens from South and Southwest Philadelphia became some of the most visible stars of the program.</p>
<p>The format Horn and producer Tony Mammarella established in <italic>Bandstand</italic>’s first days remained largely unchanged during <italic>Bandstand</italic>’s local years. During the broadcasts, Horn introduced records and the cameras focused on the teenagers dancing. At the midway point in the show, Horn yelled, “We’ve got company,” and introduced that day’s musical guest, who would lip-synch his or her latest records.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0096144211420644">74</xref></sup> On its first day, as it would in its first two years, <italic>Bandstand</italic> featured music primarily from white pop singers, such as Joni James, Georgia Gibbs, Frankie Laine, Connie Boswell, and Helen O’Connell. In an era before black rhythm and blues (R&amp;B) crossed over to mainstream white audiences, and rock ‘n’ roll was not yet a household term, this selection of artists reflected what most radio stations played. Jerry Blavat, who became a regular on <italic>Bandstand</italic> and went on to become a R&amp;B deejay in the Philadelphia area, remembers being exposed to both white pop music and black R&amp;B as a teenager in an Italian section of South Philadelphia:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>When I was a kid at 12 or 13 years old, I lived in a neighborhood where there was always music. And I would hear my aunts and my uncles playing the Four Aces, the Four Lads, Frankie Lane, and Rosemary Clooney. And then all of the sudden I turned on a television show in 1952 and I see kids dancing to this music. But I also hear rhythm and blues. “Sh-Boom” by the Chords and “Little Darling” by in those days the Gladiolas, before “Little Darling” was remade by the Crew Cuts. And this music hit my ear even though I was listening to my aunts and uncles play the pop music of the day.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0096144211420644">75</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>While hip teenagers like Blavat were becoming familiar with R&amp;B through juke boxes and records, <italic>Bandstand</italic>’s white pop songs proved popular with many of the city’s young people. By the show’s first anniversary, <italic>Bandstand</italic> fan club membership neared 10,000 local teenagers, and the Philadelphia edition of <italic>TV Guide</italic> praised the show as “the people’s choice” (both <italic>Bandstand</italic> and <italic>TV Guide</italic>, of course, were part of Annenberg’s Triangle Publications).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0096144211420644">76</xref></sup> In outlying neighborhoods where young people could not make it to the show’s studio, <italic>Bandstand</italic> annexes were set up in firehouses and other public buildings where teenagers gathered to watch the show on TV and dance. By the start of 1955, the show was the top-rated local program in its time slot, and thousands of teenagers had attended a <italic>Bandstand</italic> show at WFIL’s studio.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0096144211420644">77</xref></sup></p>
<p>The teenagers who visited <italic>Bandstand</italic> came not only from Philadelphia but also from across the wider “WFIL-adelphia” area. Pennants along the studio wall featuring the names of high schools and towns outside of Philadelphia reminded television viewers (and advertisers) of <italic>Bandstand</italic>’s geographic scope, as did a daily roll call where teens in the studio audience gave their names and high schools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0096144211420644">Figure 5</xref>). The show also featured a character called “Major Max Power” (a man dressed in a dark-colored military-styled uniform with a large “MP” on his chest) who appeared weekly to tell host Bob Horn (and the studio and television audiences) about new viewers seeing the program.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0096144211420644">78</xref></sup> With each of these features, <italic>Bandstand</italic> made reference to the “WFIL-adelphia” market and to the show’s ability to deliver a large regional viewing audience to advertisers.</p>

<p>The decentralization of the recording and radio industries made the show even more valuable as a platform for artists and record labels to reach larger audiences. Through the 1950s, a number of small record labels and local radio stations emerged to challenge the major record firm oligopolies and national radio networks. These changes profoundly affected the range of music available to consumers via records and radio. For example, the four largest record firms—RCA, Columbia (CBS), Capitol, and American Decca (MCA)—held an 81 percent market share of hit records in 1948, but by 1959 this share declined to 34 percent. The four radio networks (CBS, NBC, ABC, and Mutual Broadcasting System) that vied for a share of the total national radio audience in 1948 gave way to over one hundred autonomous local markets by the end of the 1950s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0096144211420644">79</xref></sup> Many of these radio stations followed the network standard and programmed news alongside vocal and orchestral popular music. A smaller number of stations looked for attention-catching records that would attract teenage listeners. These radio stations turned to the recently founded companies that recorded R&amp;B rather than the big band swing and crooners still favored by the major labels. These stations first emerged in cities with sizable black populations, like Philadelphia’s black-oriented WHAT-AM, and there were at least fifty other R&amp;B stations across the country by 1960.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0096144211420644">80</xref></sup></p>
<p>Compared to these radio stations, <italic>Bandstand</italic> was conservative in its musical selection. While <italic>Bandstand</italic> sampled watered-down covers of black R&amp;B records by white artists in the early-1950s, radio shows in other cities introduced teenagers to a variety of original R&amp;B records. While these radio R&amp;B shows caused some controversy, radio continued to have more freedom than television to play new music by black artists because they broadcast later at night and did not feature visual images. Foremost among these radio outlets, Memphis’s WDIA, the first radio station programmed by blacks for a black audience, and Alan Freed’s popular “Moondog” radio show in Cleveland and later New York played original R&amp;B songs produced by small independent record companies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0096144211420644">81</xref></sup> Audiences for these radio shows varied based on the demographics of the areas in which they broadcast, but most attracted young people across racial, class, and spatial lines.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0096144211420644">82</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Bandstand</italic> was among the first television programs to join these radio broadcasters and record producers as an important promotional platform for music. For example, the Three Chuckles, a white Detroit-based group, drove all the way to Philadelphia to perform on <italic>Bandstand</italic> in 1953. They performed “Runaround,” which at the time was a local hit released on Boulevard, a small Detroit label. Fueled by sales of the song in Philadelphia, major label RCA Victor released “Runaround” nationally and it became a hit in 1954.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0096144211420644">83</xref></sup> On television’s power as a promotional tool in this era, jazz trumpeter and trombonist Kirby Stone told <italic>Down Beat</italic> magazine, “We could have knocked around in clubs for 10 years and never have been seen by the number of people who have seen us on television. One night on TV is worth weeks at the Paramount.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0096144211420644">84</xref></sup> Even though <italic>Bandstand</italic> was not yet broadcast nationally, it offered recording artists exposure far beyond the show’s point of origin in West Philadelphia.</p>
<p>With its regional and national influence, <italic>Bandstand</italic> was at the leading edge of the emerging relationship among television, radio, and the music industry. <italic>Bandstand</italic> was not the only local television show to create a niche in this changing media landscape, and by 1956 nearly fifty markets had television dance shows similar to <italic>Bandstand</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0096144211420644">85</xref></sup> However, with a broadcast signal that reached parts of four states, positive publicity from Walter Annenberg’s media properties such as the <italic>Philadelphia Inquirer</italic> and <italic>TV Guide</italic>, and daily musical guests, <italic>Bandstand</italic> was the most influential of these locally televised music shows. Before Alan Freed brought his popular radio shows and concerts to television in 1956, and before Ed Sullivan broadcast Bo Diddley in 1955 and later Elvis Presley in 1956, Bob Horn’s <italic>Bandstand</italic> had grown into a local show with national influence, making it the most important television venue in this era for artists and producers looking to reach a large audience. This success, however, came at a price for the black teenagers in the West Philadelphia neighborhood around <italic>Bandstand</italic>’s studio. While the program started playing black R&amp;B by 1954, the show also implemented admissions policies that had the effect of excluding black teens. While the producers’ racial attitudes may have contributed to these policies, their desire to create a noncontroversial advertiser-friendly show did more to encourage these policies. For <italic>Bandstand</italic>, reaching teenage consumers across “WFIL-adelphia” took priority over providing a space that would be open to all teens in its backyard of West Philadelphia.</p>

<title>“Observers Note a Lack of Negro Participation”</title>
<p>Over the course of <italic>Bandstand</italic>’s local production history (September 1952 to July 1957), teens who visited the studio or watched the show experienced it first briefly as an integrated space and, later, after changes to the admission policy, as a segregated space. When it started in 1952, <italic>Bandstand</italic> admitted teenagers on a first-come first-served basis. Weldon McDougal, who attended West Philadelphia High School, remembered that although <italic>Bandstand</italic> did not yet play the R&amp;B music he liked, he had no trouble getting into the show in 1952 and 1953:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>West Philly [High School was] so close to <italic>Bandstand</italic>. <italic>Bandstand</italic> used to start at 2:45. West Philadelphia at the time, we used to get out at 2:15. When Bob Horn was there, I’d rush over there and it was first come first served. So I’d go in there and dance, until they started playing all of this corny music. Then there weren’t many black guys who would go over there. I was considered corny going over there. I was just seeing what was happening. It wasn’t like I wanted to be on television, because I didn’t care after awhile.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0096144211420644">86</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>As the show’s popularity increased, however, <italic>Bandstand</italic> adopted admission policies that, while not explicitly whites only, had the effect of discriminating against black teenagers. In 1954, <italic>Bandstand</italic> selected a group of twelve white teenagers to serve as the show’s “committee.” Committee members enforced the show’s dress code (a jacket or a sweater and tie for boys, and dresses or skirts for girls) and were tasked with maintaining order among the other teens on the show.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0096144211420644">87</xref></sup> In the <italic>Bandstand</italic> pecking order, the committee members were followed by studio regulars and by periodic visitors to the show. The committee members exercised considerable sway over who would be admitted on a regular basis, and, by 1954, <italic>Bandstand</italic> required everyone but the committee and regulars to send a letter to WFIL in advance to request admission to the show on a specific day.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0096144211420644">88</xref></sup> In practice, this admissions policy resembled the discriminatory membership policy of the skating rinks outlined earlier. Teens who gained admission to <italic>Bandstand</italic> after 1953 did so in one of two ways. Some teens were in the same social peer group as the show’s committee members and the regulars, who by 1953 came mostly from Italian neighborhoods in South Philadelphia or West Catholic High School (which was predominantly Irish and Italian). Other teenagers had to plan their visits weeks or months in advance and request tickets. This became a common practice for teens who lived in Allentown, Reading, and other cities and towns outside of Philadelphia. These teens became familiar with the show from television and from the record hops in the areas around Philadelphia that Bob Horn hosted with the <italic>Bandstand</italic> regulars. These areas included growing suburban counties with small black populations, such as Delaware County (7 percent black population in 1950), Montgomery County (4 percent), and Bucks County (less than 2 percent).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0096144211420644">89</xref></sup> Given that the outlying areas had fewer black residents, the teens who traveled to visit the show were primarily white. For black teens who lived only a few blocks from the studio, the advance notice aspect of the admission policy further marginalized them from the show. As a result of these admissions policies, <italic>Bandstand</italic>’s audience became almost all white by the end of 1954.</p>
<p>The admission policies appealed to the producers’ commercial goals for the program. By encouraging teenagers from outside the city to attend the show, <italic>Bandstand</italic> further established its popularity with “WFIL-adelphia.” Inviting teens from this regional area to watch the show, request tickets, and write fan letters strengthened <italic>Bandstand</italic>’s ability to persuade advertisers to sponsor the show. Here again, <italic>Bandstand</italic>’s producers marketed the program to the largest possible regional audience, appealing to those teens in the four-state broadcast area rather than the local teenagers in <italic>Bandstand</italic>’s West Philadelphia neighborhood.</p>
<p><italic>Bandstand</italic>’s producers also adopted the new admissions policies to minimize the potential for racial tension among teenagers outside the studio. Yet while the producers hoped that distributing admissions passes in advance would make it easier to control the crowd of teenagers, the policy had the opposite effect. It provided black teenagers with an opening to protest their exclusion from the show. West Philadelphia teen Walter Palmer, for example, organized other black teenagers to test the show’s admissions policies. “Bandstand was segregated,” Palmer recalled. “There were white kids from all of the Catholic schools, but no black kids. West Catholic was on 46th, and they were always there; our school [West Philadelphia High School] was on 47th [and we could not go].” After graduating from West Philadelphia High School, Palmer remembered that “I engineered a plan to get membership applications, and gave them Irish, Polish, and Italian last names. They mailed the forms back to our homes and once we had the cards we were able to get in that day.” Palmer’s plan successfully undermined <italic>Bandstand</italic>’s admission policies, but that day, and other times when black teens attempted to gain admission to the studio, they frequently dealt with violence from white teens. While Palmer recalls that he and his peers from the “black bottom” held their own in these fights, he remembered there were “all-out race riots outside the studio.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0096144211420644">90</xref></sup> In their attempts to challenge <italic>Bandstand</italic>’s racially discriminatory admissions policies, black teens faced verbal and physical harassment that further marked <italic>Bandstand</italic> as a site restricted to white teenagers.</p>
<p>Concerned that racial tensions would threaten <italic>Bandstand</italic>’s image as a safe place for teenagers and scare off advertisers, WFIL sought help from the CHR to calm the tensions among teenagers waiting in line. A May 1954 CHR case update, titled “WFIL-TV v. Negro and White Teen Agers,” states, “Plans for admittance for teen agers as guests of the Band Stand program have been ineffective and conflicts have arisen principally on the part of those teen agers who could not gain admittance.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0096144211420644">91</xref></sup> In other words, <italic>Bandstand</italic> implemented a racially discriminatory policy, and then asked the city’s antidiscrimination agency to address the resulting protests. The <italic>Philadelphia Tribune</italic> reported that Horn assured the CHR that “the only preference shown was the case of special out-of-town groups visiting the studio” and that teens “who adhered to the policy of proper dress and conduct were readily admitted, without regard to the race.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0096144211420644">92</xref></sup> Nominally nondiscriminatory, this policy gave <italic>Bandstand</italic> the flexibility to exclude black teenagers. Concerns about the potential for race riots among teens strengthened the producers’ policy of admitting only committee members, regulars, and those who requested cards of admission rather than admitting teens on a first-come first-served basis. A second CHR report on intergroup tensions in recreation facilities in March 1955 makes clear the outcome of this policy:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Police reported that disorderly behavior of teenagers at Bob Horn’s Bandstand program, where the audience participate in the show by social dancing, had resulted in the absence of Negroes from attendance. The management denied having a discriminatory policy, and CHR had little upon which to base a case of discrimination. Observers note a lack of Negro participation.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The report went on to state that young women from the mostly black William Penn High School in North Philadelphia had raised “the question of elimination of Negro youth” from <italic>Bandstand</italic> and that the CHR saw a need for “broad planning to effect integration of this activity for high school youth.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0096144211420644">93</xref></sup> There is no evidence that the CHR ever undertook such efforts to integrate <italic>Bandstand</italic>, and available pictures of the show from 1955 and after reveal that the show remained segregated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0096144211420644">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Interestingly, <italic>Bandstand</italic>’s inclusion of black R&amp;B music increased at the same time that the show limited the admission of black teenagers. The R&amp;B breakthrough on <italic>Bandstand</italic> came in the summer of 1954 with “Sh-Boom” by the Chords, a black vocal harmony group from New York. Following the common practice of radio stations at the time, Horn initially played a copy of the song by the Crew Cuts, a white group that often covered black R&amp;B songs. The show’s regulars complained that the Crew Cuts’ song was not the real version and persuaded Horn to test the Chords’ version on the show’s Rate-A-Record segment. After the Chords’ record received a high rating, Horn agreed to play the original.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-0096144211420644">94</xref></sup> The introduction of R&amp;B and rock ‘n’ roll progressed slowly on <italic>Bandstand</italic>, and R&amp;B artists like the Chords and the Red Tops continued to share airplay with white crooners like Tony Bennett and Vic Damone. By late-1955 and 1956, though, Horn’s playlist influenced, and was influenced by, the rise in prominence of R&amp;B and rock ‘n’ roll, and included not only white singers like Bill Haley and the Comets and Elvis Presley, but also black performers like Little Richard and Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers.</p>
<p>Still, by 1955 teenagers had local knowledge that <italic>Bandstand</italic> was primarily a space for white teenagers. Lee Andrews, a friend of Weldon McDougal’s who attended West Philadelphia’s Bartram High School with his vocal group the Hearts and also lived in one of West Philadelphia’s black neighborhoods, told historian John Jackson in a 1993 interview that there was “‘always some reason black kids couldn’t get into’ the WFIL studio. It may have been because they did not have a membership card, or perhaps they did not meet the dress code, but for whatever reason, ‘everybody began to understand [that] this is a show for white people.’”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-0096144211420644">95</xref></sup> Similarly, when asked if the show was integrated, Jerry Blavat, a South Philadelphia native who was one of the show’s best dancers and became the leader of the show’s committee of regulars from 1954 to 1956, recalled, “Well, there was no integration back then. And I guess sponsor-wise . . . you have to understand it was white television back then in the 1950s, because dollar-wise, advertisers were not beaming into the black community.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-0096144211420644">96</xref></sup> Reporting on the drunk driving arrest that cost Horn his job, the <italic>Philadelphia Tribune</italic> also noted the show’s segregation: “The news of Horn’s arrest came as a distinct shock, both to the hundreds of white parents whose children have appeared on the show and to countless Negro parents, who have sought in vain to have Horn consider their children on his televised ‘Bandstand.’” For Philadelphia teenagers, then, <italic>Bandstand</italic> as both a local dance space and as a regional television show became a site for white youth, and television viewers across “WFIL-adelphia” saw evidence of <italic>Bandstand</italic>’s segregation on a daily basis.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>While other scholars have called attention to the ability of music and dance in the early rock ‘n’ roll era to promote intercultural exchange, the local years of <italic>Bandstand</italic> demonstrate that the show’s potential to serve as a space for changing racial attitudes was circumscribed by its regional commercial goals and discriminatory admissions practices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-0096144211420644">98</xref></sup>
<italic>Bandstand</italic> connected many of the city’s white teenagers with music performed and influenced by black artists, but at the same time the show became almost totally segregated by its third year as a local program. This contradiction highlights the importance of examining media within its local context. Philadelphia teens, like teenagers across the country, found meaning and value in R&amp;B and rock ‘n’ roll music, and in the presentation of music on television. They did so, however, in social spaces that often divided them on the basis of race. While <italic>Bandstand</italic> was not the only youth space that practiced racial discrimination, the impact of its discrimination was unique because the show reached a large television audience in Philadelphia and WFIL’s four-state broadcasting region. Through this “WFIL-adelphia” broadcast platform, <italic>Bandstand</italic> influenced the styles and attitudes of teenagers in ways that strictly neighborhood youth spaces could not, and the decisions made by <italic>Bandstand</italic>’s producers during these local years established the exclusively white image of youth that <italic>American Bandstand</italic> would start broadcasting nationally in 1957. In electing to play black R&amp;B music on television, <italic>Bandstand</italic> took a risk that was repaid handsomely as the show’s regional and national commercial influence expanded. In electing to take the segregationist side of the local fights occurring over housing, schools, and youth spaces, <italic>Bandstand</italic> obfuscated the neighborhood changes taking place outside of its studio doors.</p>
<p>In disseminating this anti-integration vision, <italic>Bandstand</italic> reinforced the defensive localism practiced just blocks from their studio by white home owners. Both WFIL and white home owners associations justified segregation by foregrounding financial interests, and this simultaneous monetization and racialization of space provided a foundation for the maintenance of de facto segregation. <italic>Bandstand</italic>’s version of defensive localism sought to maximize advertiser revenue by shielding regional television viewers from images of young people of different races dancing and socializing. For white home owners associations, and those who sought to protect their racial privilege by moving to suburban developments that excluded blacks, property values trumped black civil rights. The actions of WFIL and the home owners associations did not need to be coordinated to be mutually influential. Groups like the ACA fostered hostile racial attitudes in <italic>Bandstand</italic>’s backyard. These local housing fights, combined with WFIL’s expressed commitment to give advertisers access to regional viewers in segregated suburban developments like Levittown and Fairness Hills, made it profitable for <italic>Bandstand</italic> to adopt racially discriminatory admissions policies. At the same time, <italic>Bandstand</italic>’s policies further entrenched segregation as a custom in the Philadelphia area. De facto segregation in the North was maintained through a series of everyday decisions, rather than strictly through a set of laws. Within this system of de facto segregation, <italic>Bandstand</italic> conveyed an anti-integrationist perspective to a large television audience in a way that local supporters of segregation could not. In making Philadelphia safe for “WFIL-adelphia,” <italic>Bandstand</italic> helped to normalize the racist attitudes and policies that limited black access to housing, education, and public accommodations. The number of teenagers and adults who viewed <italic>Bandstand</italic>’s exclusively white image of youth increased far beyond “WFIL-adelphia” when <italic>American Bandstand</italic> started broadcasting nationally in 1957.</p>
