<p>Welcome to the first 2012 issue of <italic>Science Communication</italic>. We are pleased that our journal is expanding this year to six issues. For authors, the wait for space in the print version of the journal will shrink considerably over the coming year as a result. This expansion is a tribute to the growth and stature of the field, as well as the status of the journal itself, and I thank you all for your ongoing support as readers, authors, reviewers, and board members. Our associate editors Marilee Long and Cynthia Coleman are due special thanks for having helped make it possible for us to manage an increasing volume of submissions.</p>
<p>Our new publication year starts with this theme issue on nanotechnology communication, with five articles drawing from diverse research approaches. First, André Donk and colleagues provide us with a content analysis of German print media coverage, revealing strong attention to medical and economic benefits but little in the way of critical coverage. Blanka Groboljsek and Franc Mali follow with an article on nanotechnology coverage in Slovenian newspapers, demonstrating that in a quite different corner of Europe, the press presents a similarly positive picture.</p>
<p>Valerie Hanson then challenges us to think about the metaphors used to represent the nanoscale itself, from a “subvisible” world parallel to the now-familiar microscopic world to a phenomenon constructed through the interaction of people and computers. Her work stresses that it is not words alone but also these images that communicate the nature of scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>Two final articles seek to understand the significance of the ways scientists and others talk about nanotechnology. Michiel Van Oudheusden and Hannes De Zutter analyze discussions among social scientists, ethicists, and nanotechnologists in a Flemish project designed to integrate societal concerns into an “upstream” process of technology assessment. And Deborah Bassett uses speech code theory to look at how scientists and engineers developing nanotechnologies talk about those technologies. Both articles uncover patterns that suggest that particular ways of talking can be used to navigate (and even to avoid) contested dimensions.</p>
