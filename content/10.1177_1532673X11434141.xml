<abstract>
<p>Many political pundits characterized the 2010 election as a referendum on President Obama’s health care reform law. The political science literature on issue voting, however, does not consistently demonstrate that these types of policy evaluations are central to citizens’ vote choices. Moreover, existing theories suggest different predictions about how the health care reform issue would affect elections across different levels of government. Studying data from the 2010 Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES), the analysis indicates that those opposed to health care reform were less likely to vote for Democratic candidates in the U.S. House, the U.S. Senate, state gubernatorial, and state attorneys general contests, controlling for partisan affiliation, political ideology, perceptions of the economy, and evaluations of other salient policy issues. These findings suggest that, across the board, Democrats were penalized for their support of health care reform, and more generally provide evidence of the role of noneconomic issue voting in U.S. elections.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The 2010 midterm election was described by many as a referendum on President Obama’s health care reform law. Referring to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA), presumptive House Speaker John Boehner on the morning after the election said, “The American people were concerned about the government takeover of health care” and added, “I think it’s important for us to lay the groundwork before we begin to repeal this monstrosity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1532673X11434141">Kaplan &amp; House, 2010</xref>). Republican pollster Whit Ayres claimed that the key to the election was that independents did not care for President Obama’s policies related to the economic stimulus, bailout of automakers, and health care reform and that these “policies drove independents into the waiting arms of Republicans” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1532673X11434141">Weiss, 2010</xref>). Not everyone agreed with this interpretation. Some progressive activists asserted that “the election did not turn on a repudiation of President Barack Obama’s health care plan despite staunch GOP opposition” and rather the Republican gains were due to the poor economy and voter apathy among usual Democratic voters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1532673X11434141">Teixeira &amp; Halpin, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Although midterm elections are often described by political scientists as a referendum on the national economy and the performance of the president (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1532673X11434141">Simon, Ostrom, &amp; Marra, 1991</xref>), the literature on the impact of issue voting in Congressional elections and subnational elections has been more divided. Voter assessments of the economy have been widely seen as a crucial factor in presidential election outcomes, but evidence is mixed on whether noneconomic policy issues have a demonstrable effect on voting decisions. Furthermore, issue voting may be weaker in races for Congress and state-level offices, given the difficulty of attributing overall economic and policy outcomes to specific members of Congress and state-elected officials. This contradiction between the conventional wisdom on the 2010 election and political science findings on issue voting offers an opportunity to test whether issue voting on health care occurred in 2010 and to what extent it affected Congressional and state-level races.</p>
<p>In the next section, we review the literature on issue voting, focusing specifically on competing theoretical frameworks regarding how voters attribute policy outcomes to different levels of government. We then develop and test models of partisan vote choice in 2010 Congressional (House and Senate) and state (gubernatorial and attorney general) elections to determine the extent and the kind of issue voting that occurred. Our study uses data from the 2010 Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) to test models of whether voter assessments’ of health care reform influenced electoral decisions. Our analysis indicates that those in opposition to President Obama’s health care reform were much more likely to vote against Democratic candidates across a range of national and state political offices, suggesting that the health care reform issue permeated across the federal system in the 2010 election.</p>

<title>Issue Voting Across U.S. Elections</title>
<p>A central tenet in the U.S. voting literature is that elections are retrospective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1532673X11434141">Key, 1966</xref>), and there is considerable evidence that voters hold incumbent officeholders accountable for bad outcomes, particularly for poor economic performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1532673X11434141">Alvarez &amp; Nagler, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1532673X11434141">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1532673X11434141">Fair, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1532673X11434141">Fiorina, 1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1532673X11434141">1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1532673X11434141">Hibbing &amp; Alford, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1532673X11434141">Holbrook, Clouse, &amp; Weinschenk, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1532673X11434141">Kiewiet, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1532673X11434141">Kramer, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1532673X11434141">Lewis-Beck &amp; Stegmaier, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1532673X11434141">Tufte, 1975</xref>). Retrospective voting in the United States, however, is complicated by the fact that, in many elections, voters are asked to cast a ballot in multiple contests at different levels of government. As a consequence, citizens wishing to base their votes on the performance of incumbent officeholders must determine who on the ballot to assign responsibility for what outcome. Given the often overlapping policy responsibilities of federal, state, and local officeholders, correctly attributing blame for bad outcomes or credit for positive outcomes may present a significant hurdle for many voters.</p>
<p>One view of retrospective voting is that citizens make meaningful distinctions across levels of government and that they base their votes for candidates for individual offices in terms of those issues for which the candidates are plausibly responsible. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1532673X11434141">Stein (1990</xref>, p. 30) summarizes the argument as follows: “The assignment of functional responsibilities in a federal system determines the subject of voters’ retrospective and prospective candidate and party evaluations and thus differentiates the content of vote decisions at each level of government.” This federalist voting hypothesis has found support in several studies of economic issue voting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1532673X11434141">Atkeson &amp; Partin, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1532673X11434141">Stein, 1990</xref>), with more recent work suggesting that this type of voting is conditional on party filters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1532673X11434141">Brown, 2010</xref>) and issue salience and accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532673X11434141">Arceneaux, 2006</xref>). Implicit in this federalist voting model is an assumption that issues do not transcend elections for different offices, or at least, voters do not base their evaluations of candidates or parties on these issues. That is, citizens hold presidents and members of Congress responsible for issues related to national policies and conditions, but they hold governors and other statewide officials accountable for state-level policies and conditions.</p>
<p>An alternative view of retrospective voting is that some issues can reverberate across contests at different levels (and branches) of government and that voters do not (and perhaps, cannot) clearly assign functional responsibilities to particular offices. Most often, proponents of this view portray subpresidential elections as referenda on the incumbent president (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1532673X11434141">Simon, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1532673X11434141">Simon et al., 1991</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1532673X11434141">Carsey and Wright (1998</xref>, p.1995), for example, argue that “for many citizens, political judgments are general indictments or rewards of the party in power, usually defined as the presidential party.” They find support for this argument by showing that presidential approval is correlated with vote choice in gubernatorial elections. To the extent, thus, that approval of the president is capturing people’s evaluations (economic and otherwise) of how the country is faring, this shows that national-level factors can influence subnational electoral contests.</p>
<p>Several other studies in the economic voting literature have found support for cross-election effects, with most of the research showing that national economic conditions affect elections for Congress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1532673X11434141">Fiorina, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1532673X11434141">Kiewiet, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1532673X11434141">Niemi, Stanley, &amp; Vogel, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1532673X11434141">Simon et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1532673X11434141">Svoboda, 1995</xref>) and state governors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532673X11434141">Chubb, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1532673X11434141">Peltzman, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1532673X11434141">Simon, 1989</xref>). In these cases, national-level issues are spilling over into down-ballot elections. Recent work has shown that issues can permeate up the ballot, as well. In particular, several studies have found that state ballot initiatives can alter an election cycle’s information environment, leading voters to more seriously weigh candidates’ positions on related issues in other elections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532673X11434141">Donovan, Tolbert, &amp; Smith, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1532673X11434141">Nicholson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1532673X11434141">Smith &amp; Tolbert, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Collectively, and counter to the federalist voting model, this work suggests that voters may consider issues from other levels of government when casting their ballots. Why might this happen? Nicholson’s theory of agenda voting suggests several mechanisms. He argues that “agendas prime voters to consider particular issues, while neglecting others, in making candidate judgments” and that these agenda effects can materialize up and down the ballot in a given election cycle because of the indiscriminate nature of priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1532673X11434141">Nicholson, 2005</xref>, p. 19). More specifically, Nicholson argues that spillover effects can occur when issues from a particular election contest (e.g., a presidential contest) affect the criteria by which a voter judges a candidate in another contest (e.g., a gubernatorial contest). In essence, if primed by the media and campaigns, a single issue may influence vote choice in elections across levels of government. When put in the context of retrospective voting, how an individual assigns responsibility (blame or praise) to one incumbent officeholder for an outcome may then influence his or her vote for an incumbent officeholder in a completely different contest.</p>
<p>An important component of Nicholson’s argument is that partisan lenses facilitate voters’ capacity to attribute a position to a candidate on specific issues, an idea that builds on decades of research establishing that partisan stereotypes affect perceptions of candidates’ position on issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532673X11434141">Conover &amp; Feldman, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1532673X11434141">Petrocik, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1532673X11434141">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1532673X11434141">Rahn, 1993</xref>). This idea is consistent with either an across-the-board party responsibility model in which all candidates of the president’s party would be held accountable, or a restricted in-party culpability framework, in which voters hold only the incumbents of the president’s party accountable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1532673X11434141">Hibbing &amp; Alford, 1981</xref>).</p>
<p>These two perspectives on retrospective voting—federalist voting and agenda voting—provide a set of competing expectations for how health care reform influenced voters’ assessment of candidates in the 2010 midterm elections. Consistent with the federalist voting perspective, one might argue that the attitudes about the HCR did not spillover into subnational elections. Members of Congress were responsible for voting for or against the 2010 ACA and would also be involved in decision making about any repeal efforts in the subsequent session. Because Democrats were the party associated with the reform, this perspective suggests that voters unhappy with the reform bill would have punished Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate elections but not in state elections.</p>
<p>In contrast, if agenda voting occurred in the 2010 midterm elections, then Democrats running for office across levels of government may have been punished for the unpopularity of the health care reform. In this case, voters in opposition to the health care reform would have penalized Democrats in elections across levels of government, even those with no direct role in the passage of health care reform, such as governors and state attorneys general. Evidence of this broad form of party punishment would suggest that the 2010 midterm election was in part a national referendum on health policy passed at the federal level.</p>
<p>And, of course, it is possible that there was little or no issue voting beyond more traditional economic voting in the 2010 election. Evidence of noneconomic issue voting has been far more limited than economic issue voting. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1532673X11434141">Kinder’s (1998)</xref> review of multiple studies suggests that issues have rarely been pivotal in presidential elections, but analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532673X11434141">Ansolabehere, Rodden, and Snyder (2008)</xref> shows that a moral issues scale was a significant predictor in presidential elections of 1992 and 1996 even when considering party identification, ideology, and economic issues. Likewise, studies suggest that issue voting is limited in Congressional elections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1532673X11434141">Hurley &amp; Hill, 1980</xref>), but others have found effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1532673X11434141">Abbe, Goodliffe, Herrnson, &amp; Patterson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1532673X11434141">Herrnson &amp; Curry, 2011</xref>). Finally, though somewhat limited in time and by topic, evidence suggests issue voting on abortion was influential in gubernatorial elections in 1989 and 1990 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1532673X11434141">Cook, Jelen, &amp; Wilcox, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1532673X11434141">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1532673X11434141">Howell &amp; Sims, 1993</xref>) and that crime conditions have affected outcomes of gubernatorial elections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1532673X11434141">Cummins, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In the analysis that follows, we seek to identify which of the competing ideas about issue voting is more consistent with observed voting behavior in the 2010 election.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1532673X11434141">1</xref></sup> We believe there is strong reason to expect that the health care reform issue affected candidate evaluations in both national and subnational elections. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1532673X11434141">Nicholson’s (2005)</xref> agenda voting argument is a conditional one. He argues that agenda effects will be most pronounced when issues are highly salient and in contests with visible candidates because people are more apt to make the connections necessary for agenda voting in these situations.</p>
<p>The health care issue would seem to pass a test of high salience, given the extensive media coverage on the issue and the prolonged debate during the preceding session of Congress. This media coverage is likely to have made the issue more accessible to citizens, who rely on this type of information shortcut when making political judgments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1532673X11434141">Popkin, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1532673X11434141">Zaller, 1992</xref>), including when evaluating candidates in elections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1532673X11434141">Iyengar &amp; Kinder, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1532673X11434141">Miller &amp; Krosnick, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1532673X11434141">Valentino, Hutchings, &amp; White, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1532673X11434141">Vavreck, 2009</xref>). The controversy and media attention continued after passage of the ACA, as 31 separate legal challenges to its constitutionality were filed, including a suit initiated in Florida that was ultimately joined by 26 states. Furthermore, a review of polls taken before the election suggests that more than 40% of voters indicated health care was an extremely important issue in the election, and about 70% said that a candidate’s position on health care would influence their vote choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532673X11434141">Blendon &amp; Benson, 2010</xref>). Thus, in our view, the health care reform issue is a good candidate for agenda voting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1532673X11434141" sec-type="methods">
<title>Data and Methods</title>
<p>To examine the role of issue voting in electoral decision making, we study data from the 2010 CCES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532673X11434141">Ansolabehere, 2010</xref>). Each annual survey is composed of two parts: a common section asked of all respondents, and team modules administered to subsamples of 1,000 persons. The survey was administered in two waves, one wave prior to the 2010 election and another wave after the election. In our main analysis, we use responses from the common content, which began with a sample size of 55,400. As we explain in the following, the useable sample is smaller given the specifics of our analysis. In addition, we use a team module to examine whether health care reform issue voting was related to personal or collective evaluations.</p>
<p>YouGov administered the internet survey, and it relies on a matched random sample methodology to generate samples. The firm develops a target population from general population studies and then draws a random set of respondents from this target population to create a “target sample.” Using a matching algorithm, the firm selects potential respondents from its pool of opt-in participants who match the target sample. A recent multimode study comparing results of the 2010 CCES with a random digit dialing telephone survey and a random sample mail survey found that the 2010 CCES produces estimates similar to those for the other modes, particularly on attitudinal measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532673X11434141">Ansolabehere &amp; Schaffner, 2011</xref>). All models estimated in our analysis use the survey weights provided by YouGov.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1532673X11434141">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The central focus of our analysis is on whether voters’ policy attitudes about health care reform influenced their vote choice for candidates running for Congressional and state-level office. In Model 1, we regress Democratic candidate vote choice on policy preferences, an economic assessment, incumbency, and a set of control variables to account for individual-level political and demographic attributes. The specification we estimate is as follows:</p>

<p>where <italic>i</italic> indexes individuals responding to the 2010 CCES survey and <italic>j</italic> indexes one of four elections—U.S. House, U.S. Senate, state gubernatorial, and state attorney general. <italic>Democratic Vote Choice</italic> is coded such that a 1 indicates a vote for the Democratic candidate in the race of interest, and zero otherwise.</p>
<p>To test our main hypotheses, we include a measure of attitudes regarding health care reform. Given the observational, cross-sectional design of the analysis, however, we cannot (and do not) make a causal claim that preferences about health care reform led individuals to vote in a particular way. Our tests, thus, are limited to establishing that vote choice was related to opinions about the ACA, controlling for other policy attitudes and individual-level attributes that likely influenced individuals’ vote decisions. For this reason, we can only present limited tests of the federalist voting and agenda voting theories.</p>
<p><italic>Policy Preferences</italic> includes responses to a set of questions on three different policies: the health care reform law (i.e., the ACA), the economic stimulus legislation (i.e., the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act), and the energy and climate change bill (i.e., the American Clean Energy and Security Act). We include attitudes about the economic stimulus and the climate change bill in the regressions as they too were cited by some after the election as being important in the election outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1532673X11434141">Best, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1532673X11434141">Samuelson &amp; Bravender, 2010</xref>). For each, respondents were asked whether they <italic>opposed</italic> (coded 1) or <italic>supported</italic> (coded 0) the Congressional votes taken on these issues. The respondent’s evaluation of the economy, <italic>Economy Worse</italic>, is measured on a 5-point scale from much better to much worse. We expect that individuals opposing these bills and perceiving the economy to be in decline will be less likely to have voted for Democrats.</p>
<p>The models also include <italic>Incumbent</italic>, which is an indicator variable denoting whether the Democratic candidate currently occupied the office. Given the well-established incumbency advantage in both Congressional and state-level elections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1532673X11434141">Ansolabehere &amp; Snyder, 2002</xref>), we expect that the probability of voting for a Democrat was higher if she or he was the incumbent officeholder, all else equal.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1532673X11434141">3</xref></sup> <italic>Party Identification</italic> reflects two dummy variables, one for self-identifying Democrats and the other for self-identifying Republicans (self-ascribed Independents are the reference group), with the obvious expectation that self-identifying Democrats and self-identifying Republicans were more and less likely to vote for the Democratic candidate, respectively, than Independents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1532673X11434141">4</xref></sup> We also include <italic>Political Ideology</italic>, which is measured on a 5-point scale ranging from <italic>very liberal</italic> to <italic>very conservative</italic>, with the usual expectation that ideological conservatives are less likely to vote for the Democratic candidate. Last, <italic>Demographics</italic> is a vector of individual-level attributes that includes age, gender, minority status, education (measured on a 5-point scale), and income (measured on a 15-point scale), which we include to control for other characteristics commonly related to candidate vote choice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1532673X11434141">5</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1532673X11434141">Table 1</xref> presents descriptive statistics for each of the variables in the model.</p>

<p>The full 2010 CCES sample included 55,400 respondents, but the sample we analyze in the regressions for Model 1 is considerably smaller for several reasons. First, about 15% of the participants in the full sample did not participate in the postelection wave of the survey, and because the focus of this study is on vote choice in the 2010 election, we can only study those who participated in the survey’s postelection wave. Second, many states did not have elections for U.S. Senator, governor, or attorney general on their ballot, and about 5% of respondents lived in a district with a House contest that did not include a challenger from a major party, making a choice for a Democratic candidate (our dependent variable) qualitatively different. Third, about 17% of the respondents indicated that they did not go to the polls for the 2010 election, and still others reported not voting in a particular race or could not recall how they voted.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1532673X11434141">6</xref></sup> Last, not all of the respondents answered every question on the survey. For each of these reasons, the final sample size varies across the models.</p>
<p>In Model 2, we test hypotheses about more specific evaluations of the 2010 health care reform on candidate vote choice, again at both the Congressional and state level. Whereas the model described above relies on a single question about support for the health care reform legislation, a smaller subsample of 2010 CCES respondents were asked questions reflecting personal versus collective evaluations of the reform. The specification is as follows:</p>

<p>where <italic>i</italic> again indexes respondents to the 2010 CCES survey, and <italic>j</italic> indexes the U.S. House, the U.S. Senate, state gubernatorial, and state attorney general elections.</p>
<p>We measure <italic>Personal Health</italic> using a scale based on the respondents’ assessments about how the reform would affect them and their families in the following four ways: overall quality, overall health, future taxes, and overall satisfaction. The <italic>Collective Health</italic> evaluation relies on a scale from a parallel set of questions on how the respondent thought the health care reform would affect the “nation as a whole” on the dimensions of quality, costs, overall health, and taxes. Each one has a range from 0 to 16 and is coded so that a higher value indicates the respondent believes things will get much better with the reform. The rest of the variables included in the model are measured as previously explained for Model 1.</p>
<p>For several reasons, the size of the sample available to estimate Model 2 is quite small. First, the prior models utilized the common content portion of the 2010 CCES, and the questions used to measure individuals’ personal and collective evaluations of the health care reform were asked as part of a team module that began with a sample of 1,000 respondents. Second, the relevant personal and collective evaluation questions were included as part of the postelection wave of the survey, and only about 85% of the preelection team module respondents also answered questions in the postelection wave. Last, many states did not have Senatorial, state gubernatorial, or state attorney general elections in 2010, or a House race with major party challenger, which further reduced the size of the sample. As a result, the useable sample in these analyses ranges from 424 individuals in the attorneys general vote choice model to 579 in the House vote choice model. So, although the samples constructed by YouGov are intended to be as close as possible to be nationally representative, this is unlikely to be the case for the set of respondents reflected in these models.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>All models are estimated with logistic regression, given that vote choice for a Democratic candidate is coded as a dichotomous variable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1532673X11434141">7</xref></sup> Due to some modest concerns about multicollinearity across the policy variables, we estimate three models for each election. First, we estimate a baseline specification with the economic evaluation only (i.e., no policy preferences). A second model adds the health care evaluation variable to the base model, and a third more comprehensive model adds measures of opposition to the economic stimulus and the climate change bills.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1532673X11434141">8</xref></sup> The final models, thus, test the hypothesis that issue voting on health care reform was an important factor in candidate choice in the 2010 election, once we control for economic evaluations and assessments of other salient policy issues.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1532673X11434141">9</xref></sup></p>

<title>Model Estimates of Issue Voting</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1532673X11434141">Table 2</xref> presents the estimates from the Congressional elections models. The results for House Democratic candidate vote choice demonstrate strong evidence of economic and noneconomic issue voting, even after controlling for incumbency, party identification, political ideology, and demographic factors. Issue voting across all three policies is present with those opposed to each of the policies far less likely to vote for a House Democratic candidate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1532673X11434141">10</xref></sup> Likewise, those evaluating the economy as much worse were far less likely to support the Democratic candidate in the House elections. The magnitude of the incumbency effects are also notable—on average, individuals were 2 times more likely to vote for the Democratic candidate when she or he was the incumbent. With respect to the other variables in the model, party identification and political ideology perform as would be expected, and the only demographic attribute that systematically distinguished the population on voting for a Democratic candidate was race and ethnicity; minorities were much more likely than nonminorities to vote for the Democrat on the House ballot.</p>

<p>The model estimates for Senate Democratic vote choice show a similar pattern. Respondents to the 2010 CCES who expressed opposition to the health care reform bill were significantly less likely to vote for a Senate Democratic candidate. This core result holds when controlling for opposition to the economic stimulus and climate change bills. And, as was the case in the models of House candidates, individuals who perceived that the economy was much worse were substantially less likely to vote for a Democratic candidate in the Senate. The larger coefficients for the incumbency variables indicate that Senate candidates were able to insulate themselves from national trends a little more successfully than their Democratic House counterparts.</p>
<p>Although evaluations of the national economy and policies adopted at the federal level clearly had an impact on voting for Congressional Democrats, theories differ on whether voters would hold Democrats at the state level accountable for decisions made in Washington. As the model estimates in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1532673X11434141">Table 3</xref> show, Democratic gubernatorial vote choice was also related to perceptions of national issues as well as evaluations of the national economy. Those opposing the health care reform and perceiving the economy to be worse were substantially less likely to support Democratic gubernatorial candidates. In addition, similar to Congressional candidates, those opposed to the economic stimulus and climate change bills were also less likely to vote for Democratic candidates for governor. Minority and well-educated respondents were, on average, more likely to vote for Democratic gubernatorial candidates. One interesting difference from the Congressional vote choice models is that although Democratic incumbents in Congress enjoyed an advantage in the 2010 election, Democratic gubernatorial incumbents did not.</p>

The results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1532673X11434141">Table 3</xref> show that voters opposed to the health care reform and those seeing the national economy as declining were substantially less likely to vote for Democratic attorney general candidates. These relationships hold even when controlling for opposition to the other salient policies in the 2010 election. Dissimilar to the results for gubernatorial candidates, Democratic incumbents fared somewhat better. And, as was the case for the probability of voting for Democratic gubernatorial candidates, minorities and individuals with higher levels of education were, on average, more likely to vote for the Democrat in the race.</p>
<p>In sum, across elections for both Congressional chambers and two state-level elections, issue voting was an important factor associated with candidate vote choice. Specifically, respondents who opposed President Obama’s health care reform bill were more likely to punish Democratic candidates by not voting for them in the 2010 election. Issue voting on the health care reform law was evident, even when controlling for economic voting and opposition to other contentious policies considered at the federal level during the prior 2-year period. These results are more consistent with an agenda voting perspective than a federalist voting model and suggest that the health care reform issue permeated through electoral contests at multiple levels of government.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1532673X11434141">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>How big were these effects? Using the estimates from the specifications with the complete set of variables, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1532673X11434141">Figure 1</xref> plots the predicted probabilities of voting for the Democratic candidate among the CCES respondents in each of the four elections across the level of opposition to the health care reform, holding the rest of the variables at their mean levels. The slopes of the predicted probabilities plots show the strong negative relationship between opposition to the health care reform bill and the probability of voting for the Democratic candidate. The slope is a little steeper in the case of vote choice for the U.S. House candidates, but across the four elections, opposition to health care reform (compared to support) accounted for about a .30 difference in the predicted probability of voting for the Democrat, even after accounting for party identification, political ideology, perceptions of the economy, and other salient policy issues at the time of the 2010 election.</p>

<title>Personal and Collective Evaluations</title>
<p>To examine the role of personal and collective assessments of health care reform, we turn to estimates from Model 2. These results, presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1532673X11434141">Table 4</xref>, should be interpreted with some caution given that the data limitations previously discussed substantially constrain the available sample. For succinctness, we present only the results of main theoretical interest. The coefficients on the personal and collective assessments of health care reform suggest a mixed picture. Across the Congressional and state-level elections, the coefficients are in the hypothesized positive direction indicating that each type of assessment was positively related to Democratic candidate vote choice. However, not all of the estimates reach conventional levels of statistical significance, even after using a generous standard of <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10, perhaps due to the small sample.</p>

<p>The strongest results suggest a role of collective evaluations of the health care reform in vote choice; respondents who believed that the reform bill would lead to better health care for the country as a whole, including lower taxes and health care costs, were considerably more likely to vote for Democratic House and Senate candidates. Collective evaluations played a similar role in vote choice for state attorneys general, but not in gubernatorial vote choice. There is some evidence that personal evaluations also mattered, but statistically, the findings are much weaker across the four models.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1532673X11434141">12</xref></sup> In the U.S. House and state attorneys general models, individuals believing that the reform bill would make them and their families personally better off were more likely to vote for the Democrat on the ballot, but the estimates are only statistically significant at the .10 level. The rest of the variables in the model perform generally as expected.</p>
<p>In sum, these results provide some insight into why opposition to the health care reform bill influenced Americans’ voting behavior in the 2010 elections. Although any conclusions should be tempered because of the data limitations, the findings suggest that people’s concerns about the effects of the reform on the overall U.S. health care system were as (and perhaps more) important than their concerns about the reform’s effects on the quality and expense of their own future health care.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>The core finding of our analysis is that citizens’ attitudes regarding health care reform were strongly associated with their vote choices in the 2010 midterm election. The enactment of the ACA, and the passions among opponents that it sparked, seems to have had a widespread effect on the 2010 elections. Voters responding to the 2010 CCES who opposed the health care reform bill were much less likely to vote for Democratic candidates in the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate elections as well as in state-level contests for governor and state attorney general. This relationship is robust, controlling for partisan affiliation, political ideology, perceptions of the economy, and evaluations of other salient policy issues.</p>
<p>Retrospective voting models assume that citizens use elections to reward or punish politicians for policy outcomes, yet aggregate and individual-level empirical studies have not always affirmed a strong role of issue voting in the U.S. elections, particularly with regard to noneconomic issues. The findings presented here clearly indicate that attitudes toward the ACA were related to vote choice in the 2010. Moreover, the fact that health care attitudes were associated with vote choice in both national and subnational elections suggests that issues can transcend levels of government in the U.S. political system. In this way, our findings are more consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1532673X11434141">Nicholson’s (2005)</xref> theory of agenda voting and less supportive of a federalist voting perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532673X11434141">Arceneaux, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1532673X11434141">Atkeson &amp; Partin, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1532673X11434141">Stein, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Our research design did not enable us to systematically examine the mechanisms by which the health care reform issue permeated elections across the U.S. political system, and there are many possible ways in which this may have materialized. First, media coverage may have focused disproportionately on the health care issue. This coverage may have elevated the saliency of the issue during the election season and solidified the linkages between the unpopular reform bill and the Democrats who supported it in Congress. Even if Democrats did not vociferously support the ACA in their campaigning, the media may have contributed to their ownership of the policy. Second, Republican candidates may have campaigned heavily on the health care reform issue, affecting the criteria by which voters evaluated candidates across government levels and offices. Evidence on advertising trends from the 2010 election suggests that Republican candidates did, in fact, campaign on the health care issue. According to one study, whereas economic and budgetary issues were mentioned most often, health care was mentioned in about a third of all Republican ads along with another 14% on Medicare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1532673X11434141">Fowler &amp; Ridout, 2011</xref>). The degree of campaigning certainly varied across the country, and an analysis leveraging differences in messaging on the ACA to study the effects of campaigns on shaping attitudes on health care reform would seem a promising direction for future research.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is important to note that health care reform was not the only issue that transcended the 2010 midterm election. Our findings also suggest that votes against Democratic candidates were associated with opposition to other salient policy issues, namely, the economic stimulus package and the energy and climate change legislation as well as perceptions of the economy. Stated simply, voters imposed collective punishment against Democratic candidates on several issues, regardless of whether the candidate on the ballot was personally involved in the policy decision. Whether this type of collective penalty was particular to the 2010 election is a question for future inquiry.</p>

<p>It is important to note at the outset that data constraints limit our ability to fully test the causal mechanisms underpinning these theories, and thus, we are only able to examine whether voting behavior in the 2010 election was more (or less) consistent with these theoretical frameworks.</p></fn>

<p>We also estimated models where we limited the sample to incumbent Democrats, to examine whether the degree of issue voting was more, less, or the same in intensity for current Democratic officeholders. The coefficients on the issue preference variables were little changed in these models from those reported in the text, indicating that the pattern we find held for voting for all Democratic candidates, not just incumbent officeholders.</p></fn>

<label>6.</label>
<p>All respondents had a House election available, but about 5% of the respondents were in a district with only one candidate and no major party competition, so they were dropped from the analysis. Similarly, about 16% had no Senate race, about 13% had no gubernatorial contest, and about 9% reported no election for state attorney general. Less than 2% reported not casting a ballot in a particular available contest, and less than 2% skipped the question, reported being unsure of choice, or gave another reason for not voting in a specific election. The available number of valid responses ranged from about 28,000 for Senate elections up to about 34,000 for House elections.</p></fn>

<p>The health care issue may also have affected state-level elections through turnout, by bringing citizens to the polls who otherwise may have stayed home. These voters, motivated to vote for Republicans in House and Senate elections, may have voted against Democratic candidates in state elections for other reasons. In models not reported, we estimated a series of voter turnout models and found that economic evaluations did not differentially motivate voters to the polls and that opposition to the climate change bill was the only issue preference that was a statistically significant correlate of voter turnout.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn10-1532673X11434141">
<label>10.</label>
<p>We cannot say from this analysis whether the health care reform issue was pivotal in the elections, and our research design makes an implicit assumption that the health care issue was equally salient across elections. Although we do not have the data to measure salience in each contest, we checked whether issue voting was more likely to occur in competitive elections. Specifically, we performed a split sample analysis, in which respondents voting in a contest with a winning percentage of 55% or less for the relevant race were included in a competitive sample, and those voting in contests with a winning percentage above 55% were included in an uncompetitive sample. The results were substantively the same as those reported for the full sample for the issue and economic assessment variables (though not for all of the demographic controls). We also considered alternative thresholds with similar results.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn11-1532673X11434141">
<label>11.</label>
<p>In supplementary analysis (not reported), we estimated each of the models after splitting the sample by respondents who indicated that they had or had not been contacted by a campaign and separately by high and low media consumption (across sources). Recall, agenda voting theory suggests that campaigns and the media play a large role in priming, and thereby increasing, the likelihood of issue spillover effects across election contests. The coefficients of opposition to the health care reform are little changed in these split-sample models from those reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1532673X11434141">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1532673X11434141">3</xref>. Although this would seem to undercut an agenda voting theory explanation, these measures are general and do not capture the content of the information provided by campaigns and/or the media and, specifically, whether they included health care reform messages.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn12-1532673X11434141">
<label>12.</label>
<p>The correlation between the personal health and collective health evaluation scales is about .85, suggesting that multicollinearity may be a problem.</p></fn>
