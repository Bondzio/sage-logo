<title>Objective:</title>
<p>Evaluate the impact of replacing hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 670/0.75 with lower molecular weight HES 130/0.4 on albumin utilization in cardiac surgery, as well as any impact on renal function and bleeding.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Design:</title>
<p>A pre- and postimplementation, retrospective analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Setting:</title>
<p>Community, not-for-profit, tertiary medical center.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Participants:</title>
<p>One hundred forty-six patients undergoing nonemergent cardiac bypass graft and cardiac valve surgeries after exclusion for documented anemia, malignancy, coagulation disorder, end-stage renal disease, or personal objection to receiving blood products.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Intervention:</title>
<p>HES 130/0.4 utilization instead of HES 670/0.75 for volume expansion.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Measurements and Main Results:</title>
<p>Patients were less likely to be administered albumin intraoperatively (odds ratio [OR] 0.16, confidence interval [CI] 0.08-0.35, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). When albumin was utilized, intraoperative amounts were similar (mean ± standard deviation [SD]: 36.1 ± 17.1 g vs 43.8 ± 15.5 g, <italic>P</italic> = .16). Patients were more likely to receive an intraoperative HES product after the formulary change (OR 11.1, CI 4.4-27.6, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) as well as larger volumes (mean ± SD: 743 ± 544 mL vs 500 ± 0 mL, <italic>P</italic> = .01). No differences were detected in mean baseline-to-discharge changes in serum creatinine or in postoperative urine output, nor were there differences in clinically significant bleeding.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>Change to a lower molecular weight HES decreased intraoperative albumin utilization and increased HES utilization with no detected difference in renal function or bleeding complications.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In large, open thoracic surgeries, such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or cardiac valve replacement, consensus is growing that saline-based colloids for volume expansion may improve outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012451931">1</xref></sup> Current colloidal options in the United States are human serum albumin and synthetic colloids. Because albumin is derived from a biologic resource, supply is relatively limited and drug shortages have occurred in the United States. As with other blood products, human serum albumin procurement costs are high and fluctuate considerably during shortages. Although methods to generate recombinant human albumin are available, a recombinant product approved for volume replacement is unlikely for several years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012451931">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190012451931">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Among colloid alternatives to albumin, there are differences in labeled indications, adverse effects, and dose limitations. Colloidal starches have maximum daily dose recommendations to reduce the risk of complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012451931">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190012451931"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012451931">6</xref></sup> Major adverse effects associated with synthetic starches include dose-dependent hemostatic impairment and renal failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012451931">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190012451931">8</xref></sup> Decreased glomerular filtration after exposure to hydroxyethyl starch (HES) has been reported in patients undergoing CABG.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190012451931">9</xref></sup> Renal injury is believed to be caused by accumulation of osmotically active substances causing hyperoncotic acute renal failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190012451931">10</xref></sup> In addition to potential hemodilution of clotting factors associated with all colloid administration, larger molecular weight hetastarches have direct inhibitory effects on factor VIII and decrease von Willebrand factor, further contributing to the disruption of the coagulation cascade.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0897190012451931">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0897190012451931">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Historically, surgeons and perfusionists at our institution used albumin plus acetate buffered, balanced electrolyte water solution (Normosol R<sup>®</sup>: Hospira, Inc, Lake Forest, Illinois) for volume expansion in cardiovascular surgery, with the overall balance favoring crystalloids. Utilization of the other hetastarch, HES 670/0.75 in lactated electrolyte solution (Hextend<sup>®</sup>: Hospira, Inc) was used sparingly due to dose limitations and bleeding concerns. HES 600/0.75 in 0.9% sodium chloride solution (Hespan<sup>®</sup>: B. Braun Medical, Inc, Irvine, California) is not recommended during the perioperative cardiopulmonary bypass period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012451931">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>In December 2007, the Food and Drug Administration approved 6% HES 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride solution (Voluven™: Hospira, Inc),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0897190012451931">13</xref></sup> which is labeled for higher maximum daily doses than other HES formulations marketed in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012451931">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190012451931"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012451931">6</xref></sup> The maximum daily volume of HES 130/0.4 that can be administered to a 70 kg patient is 3500 mL compared to 1400 mL for HES 670/0.75. Larger volumes of starch may also mitigate the administration of crystalloid fluids, avoiding myocardial, periorbital, and bowel edema complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0897190012451931">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0897190012451931">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Any effect of HES 130/0.4 on clotting is believed to be secondary to hemodilution, with minimal inhibition of factor VIII.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012451931">6</xref></sup> Effects on bleeding were not detected in clinical trials at doses of up to 50 mL/kg.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012451931">6</xref></sup> Unlike HES 670/0.75, HES 130/0.4 has not been demonstrated to accumulate in plasma after repetitive administration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0897190012451931">16</xref></sup> and has not been associated with acute kidney injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0897190012451931">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>With an improved safety profile and higher maximal dosing limits compared to other starch products, the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee approved HES 130/0.4 to replace HES 670/0.75 for volume expansion in cardiovascular surgery. This assessment was undertaken to evaluate what impact, if any, the formulary change had on intraoperative colloid utilization, renal function, and bleeding during CABG and valve surgeries.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0897190012451931">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>This retrospective, single-center cohort study was conducted to determine what effect HES 130/0.4 had on intraoperative albumin utilization compared to HES 670/0.75. The first cohort, referred to as the preexchange group, consisted of patients undergoing CABG, cardiac valve surgery, or a combination of CABG with valve surgery from February 1, 2010 through April 30, 2010. This group received volume replacement therapy with crystalloids, blood products, and HES 670/0.75 (Hextend<sup>®</sup>) per provider preference. The second group of patients, the postexchange group, consisted of patients undergoing the same type of surgical procedures from July 1, 2010 through September 30, 2010. The second cohort received volume replacement therapy with crystalloids, blood products, and HES 130/0.4 (Voluven™) per provider preference. Records from the months of May and June were excluded from the study to account for logistical and procedural transition after the formulary change. No other major changes in intraoperative procedures or key personnel occurred during the evaluation period.</p>
<p>Potential patients were identified using the Northern New England Cardiovascular Disease Study Group’s database. The study proposal was reviewed and approved in accordance with Institutional Review Board procedures prior to data collection. A single investigator performed data collection utilizing a standardized data collection tool.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0897190012451931">
<title>Study Population</title>
<p>Eligible patients were 18 years of age or older who underwent CABG, valve, or CABG plus valve surgeries during the aforementioned periods of interest. Records of patients with documented end-stage renal disease (per National Kidney Foundation criteria), malignancy not in remission, or history of coagulation disorders were excluded from the analysis. Patients who underwent emergent surgery, who presented with a hematocrit of less than 30% or a hemoglobin of less than 10 g/dL, or who expressed any ethical objection to receiving blood products at the time of surgery were also excluded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0897190012451931">
<title>Outcome Measures</title>
<p>The primary end point of interest was intraoperative albumin utilization during coronary artery bypass and cardiac valve surgeries before and after approval of the HES product exchange in March 2010. Utilization was evaluated as the percentage of patients who received albumin and the mean grams of albumin administered per patient. Types and volumes of fluid administered during the intraoperative period for each patient were obtained from anesthesiology and perfusion logs, the operative procedure note, and the electronic medication administration record (eMAR).</p>
<p>Safety data were grouped as parameters of renal function and indicators of significant bleeding. Renal parameters included changes in serum creatinine from baseline to discharge, initiation of renal replacement, and daily urine output. Indicators of clinically significant bleeding included the total volume of chest tube drainage at 96 hours, the number of patients requiring blood transfusion, the number of patients returned to the operating room for bleeding, and the number of patients administered additional doses of protamine.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0897190012451931">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The primary hypothesis was that utilization of intraoperative HES 130/0.4 would decrease albumin utilization in cardiac surgical patients more than HES 670/0.75. Descriptive statistics were counts and percentages for categorical variables and means with standard deviations for normally distributed data. Student <italic>t</italic> tests and Fisher’s exact test were utilized for analysis of continuous and categorical data, respectively, unless otherwise noted. Statistical tests are 2-sided, with <italic>P</italic> values of .05 or less indicating statistically significant differences. Significance testing (i.e., <italic>P</italic> values) from contingency tables is reported when at least 80% of the categorical groups contained a minimum of 5 data points. Data analyses were performed with JMP, Version 9.0.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina).</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>A total of 187 patients were assessed for eligibility. Data were collected from 146 patients for analysis: 80 patients in the preexchange and 66 patients in the postexchange group. All patients were Caucasian, with a male majority. Mean body mass index and age were nearly identical for the 2 groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190012451931">Table 1</xref>). Except for percentage of patients with more severe heart failure classification in the postexchange group, medical characteristics and types of cardiovascular surgeries between groups were similar (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0897190012451931">Table 2</xref>).</p>

As with albumin, the percentage of patients administered intraoperative crystalloids also decreased with greater HES utilization (OR 0.48, CI 0.25-0.94, <italic>P</italic> = .04), but the mean volumes administered were not different (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0897190012451931">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Matched pair analysis of serum creatinine for all patients, regardless of group, revealed a mean increase of 0.12 mg/dL (standard error [SE] 0.028) from a mean of 0.90 mg/dL (±0.24) at baseline to 1.02 mg/dL (±0.39) at discharge (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Mean difference and mean values across the 5 fluid classifications assessed by matched pairs were similar (<italic>P</italic> = .08 and .07, respectively). The largest mean difference between serum creatinine at baseline and discharge was an increase of 0.59 mg/dL among 4 patients who received both albumin and HES intraoperatively.</p>
<p>A repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) test was conducted to compare the effect of colloid type received intraoperatively on mean urine output at 24-, 48-, 72- and 96-hour intervals postoperatively. There was no significant effect across the 5 categories of colloids and colloid combinations assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0897190012451931">Figure 1</xref>). Three patients required postsurgical hemodialysis: 2 before the formulary exchange and 1 after the exchange.</p>

<title>Bleeding Indicators</title>
<p>The pre- and postexchange groups each had 2 patients return to surgery for postoperative bleeding. Packed red blood cells were the only blood product, besides albumin, administered intraoperatively. The percentage of patients who received any blood product postoperatively decreased 50% postexchange (<italic>P</italic> = .11). Mean units of all blood products administered postoperatively were similar: 3.1 units (±2.6) preexchange versus 3.0 units (±2.2) postexchange (<italic>P</italic> = .54). Readministration of protamine postoperatively occurred in 7.6% of patients postexchange versus 13.8% of patients preexchange (<italic>P</italic> = .30). There was no difference in the postoperative administration of 1-deamino-8-<sc>d</sc>-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) or recombinant factor VIIa after the exchange. Mean chest tube drainage through 96 hours postoperatively was 1083 mL (±974) preexchange versus 1015 mL (±756) postexchange (<italic>P</italic> = .32).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Utilization of starch colloids for volume replacement in cardiac surgery has previously been curtailed by dose limitations and safety concerns.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0897190012451931">18</xref></sup> After the switch from HES 670/0.75, providers were much more likely to utilize a starch colloid for intraoperative fluid resuscitation and to administer larger volumes due to the reported improvements in safety. Our targeted exchange of HES products decreased the percentage of cardiac surgical patients who received intraoperative albumin, driving overall reduction in the amount of albumin used.</p>
<p>HES 130/0.4 appears to be a reasonable alternative to albumin to conserve blood-derived products and as an alternative for patients who refuse blood-derived products. A desirable, though nonsignificant reduction in blood product utilization did occur after the formulary change. Similar results were reported in a pooled analysis that compared HES 130/0.4 and HES 200/0.5, a pentastarch not available in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0897190012451931">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although clinical outcomes and cost considerations were not included in the study design, it is worth noting that increased acquisition costs for HES 130/0.4 compared to HES 670/0.75 are likely offset by the overall reduction in albumin utilization. Furthermore, a recent pilot study, utilizing an alternative HES for postoperative volume replacement, reported improvements in hemodynamic status—often a limiting factor in discharge from the intensive care unit after cardiac surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0897190012451931">20</xref></sup> The impact of HES 130/0.4 administration on clinically important outcomes is the subject of a large, multicenter prospective trial currently underway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0897190012451931">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite patient samples that were similar in characteristics and types of surgical procedures, there were unequal patient numbers in the 2 groups and the overall sample was too small to generalize conclusions to other settings. The magnitude of the change in albumin utilization would most likely be detectable in an even smaller sample than reported here. Safety parameters were insufficiently powered to account for multiple potential confounders of infrequent events.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Replacement of HES 670/0.75 with HES 130/0.4 resulted in a significant reduction in intraoperative albumin utilization in cardiac surgeries. Renal function parameters and indicators of significant bleeding did not differ after the change to HES 130/0.4 despite administration of larger volumes of HES to a larger percentage of patients undergoing cardiac surgery.</p>
