<abstract>
<p>In this article, the author argues that the narrative forms imposed on students closely follow the narrative conventions of the <italic>Bildungsroman</italic>, the novel of human emergence that has traditionally been associated with what educators of adults would call experiential learning. The author’s presenting question—If the self is a text, what genre is it?—is the literary form of the question of where the life narratives valorized in adult learning originate, why they appear to be unmediated and authentic, and what ideological meaning they carry. The author further argues that students are expected to reproduce quite particular narrative conventions: the use of the past to explain the present, and vice versa; memory as a form of psychic coherence; a double plot that has an echo in a split protagonist; and the erasure of social conflict. In the conclusion, the author briefly focuses on magical realism as an alternative narrative of experience.</p>

<p>The narrative turn in the humanities and social sciences has been both cause and effect of new ways of conceptualizing human selfhood. Rather than seeing people as having unmediated access to experience that they then use language to convey, narrative analysis across multiple disciplines looks at how people tell stories of themselves and how they construct identities in and through the process of telling those stories. As the self comes to be understood, not as an essence that predates anything we might say about it, but as the product of social relations and discursive forms, new attention is being paid to the ways in which narratives, including self-narratives, both reflect and construct particular identities, subjectivities, and experiences. The result, to quote Clifford Geertz, is a focus on how people work at “spinning the webs of significance in which they themselves are suspended” (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741713612442785">Holstein &amp; Gubrium, 1999</xref>, p. 101).</p>
<p>In a recent article, I explored the autobiographical narratives that typify both the practice of adult learning and the literature about it and argued that the life histories produced by adult learners in our classrooms are, in important senses, fictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0741713612442785">Michelson, 2011</xref>). That is, the narratives that students produce, however much they originate in real events, are multiply overdetermined by the structural and ideological frames within which they are encouraged to write. My point in that article was that, for all our valorizing of individuality, there are only some stories we allow our students to tell and only some forms of selfhood we allow to emerge in the process of telling them. In making an argument that drew heavily on narrative psychology, I acknowledged that many students experience moments of personal transformation in the generating of life narratives. For all our celebration of the uniqueness of students’ stories, however, we end up with a series of narratives that are suspiciously repetitious and that are as least as much the by-product of particular pedagogical practices as they are of authentic self-inquiry.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0741713612442785">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this article, I want to extend that exploration by returning narrative analysis to its original roots in literary theory and posing a very literary question: If the self is a text, what genre is it?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0741713612442785">2</xref></sup> I will argue that the narrative forms we impose on students depend on relationships that are fundamentally novelistic: between structure and meaning, between first-person narrators and their own past selves, and between learning and time. I will locate these conventions in a specific genre of the novel that was central to the emergence of the self-aware individual of modernity: the novel of development or, as often called by its German name, the <italic>Bildungsroman</italic>. I will then explore both the ideological encoding and narrative structures of the <italic>Bildungsroman</italic> that align with the life narratives of adult learning. Finally, I will focus briefly on an alternative genre, magical realism, to point to alternative ways for narrating experience.</p>
<sec id="section1-0741713612442785">
<title>Narrative Structure and Adult Learning</title>
<p>Only some genres and, indeed, some stories are available within a culture. For a tale to have meaning, the teller must draw on a shared cultural store of motifs, events, stock characters, and expectations and must combine them in a way that is comprehensible to a particular audience. This does not mean that every story is meant to mirror the felt conditions of the world, but it does mean that every narrative constructs a spatial and temporal realm in which objects and people exist in particular causal relationships and in which some things can and do happen, and not others. This is no less the case in autobiographical accounts and other narratives of selfhood. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741713612442785">Jerome Bruner (2004)</xref> says, “The ways of telling [life stories] and the ways of conceptualizing that go with them become so habitual that they finally become recipes for structuring experience itself” (p. 707).</p>
<p>The protagonist/narrators who are valorized in the literature on adult learning have a recognizable and generic role. They are individuals for whom life has not quite come together. Lack of professional fulfillment, a destabilized domestic life, financial insecurity, or similar factors have led to some form of psychic distress and/or social marginalization. Lack of self-confidence and/or socially imposed norms and values have delimited their life possibilities. These individuals, however, have it within themselves to live more integrated and satisfied lives; they are, as Robert Kegan has put it, “in grave danger of growing” (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0741713612442785">Taylor, 2000</xref>, p. 152). The plot set in motion by these factors is one of self-empowerment through a process of thinking back on one’s life.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0741713612442785">Kathleen Taylor’s (2000)</xref> examples are typical:
<disp-quote>
<p>I am the first woman in my family to get a divorce and the first to pursue a college education—I don’t know which is harder for my mother to accept. What I know is I must step outside the boundaries of my culture and learn to make my own way in the world.</p>
<p>In response to the Vietnam draft my family moved to Canada, where I finished high school. I tried higher education but dropped out because I couldn’t conform. I didn’t want to listen to some stuffy professor; I wanted to change the world! What I finally realized was I would have to have more education to make the kind of contribution to society that’s important to me.</p>
<p>I was raised in an extremely abusive environment. After high school, I worked as a lab technician but developed an increasing addition to alcohol and tried suicide more than once. Then I got pregnant, stopped drinking, and realized I had to get serious about bringing some financial security and stability into my son’s life and mine. (p. 151; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0741713612442785">Michelson, 2011</xref>, for similar examples)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Lawrence Daloz and Stephen Brookfield have both aimed gentle but pointed barbs at our infatuation with this particular narrative. In his story of Gladys, the student “who refused to grow,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0741713612442785">Daloz (1988)</xref> casts himself as the chagrinned hero—I expect he’d prefer antihero—who shares the adult educator’s faith that “a central part of growing up invites us to reconceive our earlier self and cultivate the growth of a more fitting and well-integrated new one” (p. 4). Gladys, however, resists Daloz’s best efforts as an “andragogical missionary.” “What’s missing?” he asks, with a vexation that is only partly tongue-in-cheek. “Is it something she lost, or has yet to find?” (pp. 6-7). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741713612442785">Brookfield (2000)</xref>, in turn, argues that “narratives of critical analysis in which people experience contradictions, are visited by revelations, get better, and come to fuller self-knowledge are necessary palliatives but essentially false” (p. 134). If Brookfield is correct, and I believe he is, it behooves us to explore the nature of this artifact: how it is shaped, how credibility is established, how the self at the heart of the narrative is understood. My presenting question—If the self is a text, what genre is it?—is simply the literary form of the question of where our narratives originate, what ideological meaning they carry, and what kinds of human experiences are included and excluded in and by the narrative.</p>

<title>The <italic>Bildungsroman</italic> as a Genre</title>
<p>A narrative genre can be defined as a collection of structural elements—character types, plot lines, tones of narrative voice—that together make up an identifiable kind of narrative, that are repeatedly drawn on by the tellers of tales, and that are recognizable to an audience. Whatever their formal elements, genres are deeply ideological; as both creations and reflections of specific historical and cultural moments, they carry elemental messages about structures of causality, available forms of human selfhood, and the ways in which life must, should, and/or might be lived.</p>
<p>As a genre, the novel has traditionally been associated with what educators of adults call experiential learning. Rooted in autobiographical and epistolary narrative forms, the novel both allows individual experience to serve as the structure for the plot and grants epistemological authority to that experience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0741713612442785">3</xref></sup> As “the novel of human emergence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0741713612442785">Bakhtin, 1986</xref>, p. 20), the <italic>Bildungsroman</italic> relates how people learn and grow and how the capacity for cognitive self-awareness, that is, self-reflection, develops through experience. The typical protagonist is a young person who searches for social and personal integration in an erroneous or misguided way and whose maturation comes through painful self-knowledge. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0741713612442785">Nancy Armstrong (2005)</xref> describes it, the <italic>Bildungsroman</italic> depicts how “a human subject with the restlessness to grow—over time and in successive states—[becomes] both more complete as an individual and more worthy in social terms” (p. 4).</p>
<p>Let us take Charles Dickens’s <italic>David Copperfield</italic> as an example.</p>
<p><italic>David Copperfield</italic> begins with David’s birth, at midnight, in the aptly named town of Blunderstone, and the first-person narrator recounts how his younger self blunders his way through a series of missteps and misjudgments. David is plagued both by social marginalization and by failures of discernment. The most serious of his shortcomings is a tendency to misjudge people, a character flaw that has its most telling effects concerning the girls he falls in love with and the boys he befriends. The trajectory of experiential learning in the novel moves from “the first mistaken impulse of my undisciplined heart” (p. 640)—a disastrous first marriage to the childlike Dora—to the “knowledge [that] came upon me, not quickly, but little by little” (p. 788) of what he really wants. Through a series of sometimes painful but always educative experiences, David comes into his own personally and professionally; by the end of the novel, he is a successful professional writer and a happily married man.</p>
<p>That David becomes a writer is significant in several ways. First, as a self-made professional, he is the iconic product of liberal individualism, self-possession, and economic meritocracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0741713612442785">Ruth, 2006</xref>). David is a model bourgeois for whom intelligence itself is a form of capital, reward is an outgrowth of intellectual labor, and success is based on knowing his own mind.</p>
<p>Second, David’s status as a writer helps keep focus on the narrative as “written memory” (p. 791). Until he writes his way into self-authorship, epistemological authority, such as it is, is in his aunt, Betsy Trotwood, who utters the line that could well be the mantra of theories of experiential learning: “It’s in vain to recall the past . . . unless it works some influence upon the present” (p. 336). The ability to perceive the meaning of one’s experience and to recount it as a coherent story is what demonstrates that the narrator/protagonist has achieved psychic and social agency.</p>

<sec id="section3-0741713612442785">
<title>Ideology and Self-Narration</title>
<p>In his aptly named book, <italic>The Content of the Form</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0741713612442785">Hayden White (1987)</xref> argues that narrative forms are not neutral; any life contains a multiplicity of events, but how we plot them and how we relate them to each other is necessarily ideological.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0741713612442785">4</xref></sup> Narratives—in both the writing and the reading—are not responses <italic>to</italic> society but, rather, social practices <italic>within</italic> it, practices that impose a particular conception of society and a particular way of constituting the self.</p>
<p>White, among others, argues that the <italic>Bildungsroman</italic> narrates the emergence of a kind of individual who is well socialized into the conditions of life as a citizen of the modern nation-state, a self-regulating individual whose desires for fulfillment and self-expression can be accommodated within the bounds of liberal capitalism. The existence of such an individual presumes particular kinds of social formations, and it is here that the <italic>Bildungsroman</italic> stakes out a position that is both culturally specific and ideologically conservative. In a fascinating study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0741713612442785">Joseph Slaughter (2007)</xref> traces the relationship between the <italic>Bildungsroman</italic> and a particular rhetoric of human rights that holds human aspirations and social institutions to be harmonious. By legitimating individual ambition, channeling rebellion into membership in benevolent social institutions, and making the individual both the sole agent and sole beneficiary of personal development, the <italic>Bildungsroman</italic> privileges individualist solutions and portrays social institutions as supportive of the needs of ordinary people. Thus, the <italic>Bildungsroman</italic> is able simultaneously to depict an <italic>un</italic>folding of individual development and the <italic>en</italic>folding of the individual into social institutions and roles.</p>
<p>There is, to be sure, an important value embedded here, namely, the belief that civil society should protect the right to personal development. In his Oxford Amnesty Lecture in 1992, literary critic Wayne Booth echoed adult learning’s celebration of “self-authorship” by connecting the freedom to create one’s own narrative with a society in which human rights are honored. Booth describes human rights as the guarantors of the individual’s “freedom to pursue a story line, a life plot” (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0741713612442785">Slaughter, 2007</xref>, p. 39). How, then, is this conservative?</p>
<p>First, change in the <italic>Bildungsroman</italic> is seen as the result of individual effort. Both the world and the self are malleable, and the world is structured both to teach and reward. As in <italic>David Copperfield</italic>, self-knowledge leads in congenial and normative directions. Success is largely marked by admission into hegemonic social formations: marriage, employment, a rise in economic and/or moral status. Progress is the result of the gradual incorporation of marginalized individuals rather than the result of collective action or large-scale social change.</p>
<p>Second, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741713612442785">Ermarth (1983)</xref> has argued,
<disp-quote>
<p>The individualizing of perspective in the <italic>Bildungsroman</italic> rests, not on idiosyncratic perception, but on consensus, that is, on a unity in human experience which assures us that we all inhabit the same world and that the same meanings are available to everyone. (p. 65)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Social legitimation is there for the taking, if one can learn, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741713612442785">George Eliot (1874/2008)</xref> wrote in <italic>Middlemarch</italic>, “to call things by the same names as other people call them” (p. 505) and in the process learn to self-manage desire within socially legitimate possibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0741713612442785">Armstrong, 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0741713612442785">
<title>The Educational Biography as <italic>Bildungsroman</italic></title>
<p>In my previous article, I analyzed a number of exemplary autobiographical essays that are given to students and used to model the cognitive self-awareness of the consummate adult learner. These models, I argued, are both pedagogical and normative; they anticipate both the <italic>process</italic>—generally called critical self-reflection—and the <italic>product</italic>—the resultant understanding of the self that the student is meant to achieve. The explicit plot of these narratives is extremely close to what George Eliot described as a conflict “between elemental tendencies and established laws by which the outer life of man [<italic>sic</italic>] is gradually and painfully being brought into harmony with his inward needs” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0741713612442785">Redinger, 1975</xref>, p. 325). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0741713612442785">Irvin Roth (1990)</xref> characterizes this same process as a cyclical movement “between developing environmental mastery and refining our internal process” (p. 118), whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741713612442785">Pierre Dominice (1990)</xref> argues that “in their narratives, most adults tell how they struggled to reconcile the expectations of their social environment with their own desire to lead a unique existence” (p. 207).</p>
<p>It might be argued that the similarities among these quotes are not evidence of a direct relationship between the <italic>Bildungsroman</italic> and the life narratives of adult learning. Rather, the similarities are the effect of a shared notion of human development that is so naturalized in contemporary literate cultures that the story will inevitably be told in multiple forms. In other words, the <italic>Bildungsroman</italic> and the educational biography share narrative conventions because, as products of the same cultural environment, they share assumptions about the lives thus narrativized.</p>
<p>This sharing of assumptions, however, is precisely the point. The life narratives of adult learning carry ideological meaning in the sense discussed above, seeing the self as adaptable, the world as forgiving, and the narrator as able to achieve a more coherent socialization that is at the same time a greater personal authenticity. The protagonist/narrator will have begun as marginalized in some way, by the status of “adult learner” if not by whichever life circumstances have motivated the return to formal education; by the end, she/he will have arrived at a new understanding and be rewarded with approbation from the social mainstream, with the college or university—I suspect our students are more aware of this than we are—serving as a stand-in for social institutions generally. Thus, the examples of student narratives previously cited assume that reconciliation with social institutions (“more education”) and individualism (“my own way in the world”) are in comfortable balance. A difficult world exists in Taylor’s examples—a war and a draft, sexism and oppressive gender expectations, domestic violence, substance abuse and suicide—but they are there as background to the main event, the transformation that is initiated by a change in consciousness and achievable through one’s own efforts.</p>
<p>Moreover, the forms of experience that are valorized in the life narratives of adult learning closely conform to those of the <italic>Bildungsroman</italic>: The experience that “counts” (quite literally in the case of the assessment of prior learning) is experience that can be framed as leading to psychic and cognitive self-awareness. It is not enough to know something; one must know that one knows it and how one came to know it. Epistemological self-knowledge is the means to a variety of ends that include psychic independence and social legitimation, and the ability to tell one’s story in these terms becomes evidence of a life well lived because, whatever one’s “first mistaken impulse,” one has arrived at a knowledge of the self that equates with social legitimacy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0741713612442785">
<title>Life Writing and Narrative Convention</title>
<p>There is evidence, not all of it anecdotal, to suggest that many adults find this form of self-narration liberatory.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0741713612442785">5</xref></sup> The opportunity to write oneself into greater self-awareness aligns with many of the forms of psychic development available to the cultural mainstream, and those already on course toward individual self-exploration and self-fulfillment may well find this practice deeply empowering. It may be that our current practices of self-narration work best with students who already implicitly understand how to frame of their lives in those terms. Thus, a White, middle-class woman returning to formal learning may be primed to discover psychic freedom through this form of self-narrative because she loved <italic>Jane Eyre</italic> as a girl.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0741713612442785">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>One might speculate, similarly, that the cultural background shared by many White Anglophone adult educators is one in which Jane Eyre and David Copperfield’s stories reverberate. Personal self-expression, self-fulfillment, and—to use the term often employed by adult learning theorists—<italic>self-authorship</italic> are deeply held values. One aspect of the 19th-century novel’s triumph was, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0741713612442785">Brooks (1984)</xref> points out, “to plot with a good conscience” (p. 114), confident that the plot lines of the genre corresponded to the real complexities and possibilities of human life. That faith has fallen under a good bit of suspicion, and as fiction, the naïve tale of social and psychic integration now lives largely in mass cultural genres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0741713612442785">Slaughter, 2007</xref>). But it retains its power, especially in the United States, as the dream of Americanization, of upward mobility through education and effort. It is a robust element of the value system within which American adult education is practiced and, I would argue, pulls that practice in the direction of particular essay questions and life narratives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0741713612442785">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>To be sure, some people’s lives can be articulated and even enhanced by these narratives. At the same time, they are only one of many processes through which human beings grow, learn, and change, and they are culturally and psychically restrictive in both narrative and epistemological terms. To tell their stories in the ways we expect, students have to reproduce a highly complex narrative structure using quite particular conventions that are characteristic of the <italic>Bildungsroman.</italic> These include the use of the past to explain the present, and vice versa; memory as a form of psychic coherence; and a double plot that has an echo in a split protagonist. These conventions are difficult enough in the artifact of a fictional narrative in which events and characters can be invented, and even harder to do with one’s own life as the necessary raw materials. Indeed, the sophistication required may have less to do with advanced cognitive development than with already being familiar with the narrative and having already internalized the rules.</p>
<sec id="section6-0741713612442785">
<title>The Past as Explanation</title>
<p>It may be that, as a variety of schools of recent historiography and philosophy have argued, chronological narrative is something that we impose on events as a way of ordering what would otherwise be the chaos of happenstance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0741713612442785">8</xref></sup> It is a way of insisting that life has the kind of coherence that we expect of a well-made story, or at least of living as if we believe that it does. In <italic>Reading for the Plot</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0741713612442785">Peter Brooks (1984)</xref> argues that plot is “the logic and syntax of those meanings that develop only through sequence and succession” (p. 113). In this view of things, narrative itself is an explanation: the events of the past are what explain the present, although it is only from the vantage point of the present that the past can be understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0741713612442785">White, 1987</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0741713612442785">
<title>Memory, Psychic Coherence, and the Double Plot</title>
<p>This relationship between past and present explains the centrality of memory both to the structure of the narrative and the evolution of the protagonist. Mistakes in the <italic>Bildungsroman</italic> tend to be a function of insufficient experience of the world, and happy endings are the result of the accumulation of memories of relevant experience. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741713612442785">Nicholas Dames (2001)</xref> points out, however, the <italic>Bildungsroman</italic> does not depict memory so much as it portrays the struggle to transform the seeming randomness and disorder of “real” memory into retrospective order. This, however, requires that one’s memories are amenable to psychic integration, that they are appropriately shared among relative strangers, and that they are conducive to cognitive stability and clarity.</p>
<p>Moreover, producing a semblance of retrospective coherence requires that two parallel narratives be told simultaneously: the forward-looking narrative of life incidents and the (sometimes explicit, sometimes implicit) backward-looking narrative of the coming into meaning. Arguably, this quality is even more exaggerated in the narrative practices of adult learning than it is in the <italic>Bildungsroman</italic> because the second narrative is being enacted as curriculum. The (not always unsung) hero of the tale is the educator who poses the question and gives the assignment. No wonder we are so enamored of this plot.</p>

<p>Although first-person narrators are, by definition, writing about themselves, the two parallel plots of the narrative—the process of living through experiences and the process of remembering them—have what are virtually separate protagonists: the past self versus the present self, the remembered versus the remembering self, the self that is written about versus the self that writes. These multiple splitting of the self must be lined up, so that the self that is written about is the remembered self of experience, while the self that writes is the self that remembers and reflects. These two selves, in turn, are expected to display a particular kind of personality, or, rather two kinds of personalities. While the remembered self can have all kinds of failures of insight and meaning-making—indeed, the greater the failures, the greater the potential for forward movement—the remembering self must be epistemologically sure-footed and capable of cogent moral and intellectual clarity. She/he must be able to perceive order in what, to the protagonist of the first narrative, was only a random series of events. She/he must be able to articulate, not only what has been learned but also what has been learned about the process of having learned it. And she/he must experience the coming to coherence within the self as a form of liberation that is both social and personal.</p>
<p>It is here, moreover, that students bear the brunt of the ways in which adult learning theory conflates oversimplified cognitive models—Kolb’s learning cycle is a good example—for the complexities of how knowledge is gained and deployed in the world. There is much evidence to suggest, for example, that the actual process of learning from experience is quite different from our favored models, that more expert practitioners are <italic>less</italic> self-conscious and systematic about the knowledge they draw from than the inexperienced.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0741713612442785">9</xref></sup> Moreover, the association of cognitive clarity with psychic coherence and a rewarding life might, these days, be seen as naïve, if not disturbingly misinformed. And it is certainly arguable that being <italic>less</italic> sure of things than one used to be is the better part of epistemological valor, at least in this world, if not in any world.</p>
<p>Finally, this narrative treats as universal a human experience that is possible only within quite specific historical circumstances. Self-realization is a social process; one cannot participate in what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0741713612442785">Slaughter (2007)</xref> calls “the empancipatory plot-logic of progressive linear improvement” (p. 110) under all historical conditions. The expectation that our students can represent themselves in these terms belies the conditions of life in which most people—many of them our students—live out their lives as social beings. For students whose life experience includes conditions of exile, isolation, terror, or even “everyday” oppressions of gender, race, nationality, sexual orientation, appearance, and class, self-representation as a newly coherent, socially integrated being all too often leaves the bulk of one’s history on the cutting room floor.</p>

<title>Magical Realism as the Anti-<italic>Bildungsroman</italic></title>
<p>Among the genres that took the place of the <italic>Bildungsroman</italic> in the intellectual life of the 20th century, the novels of magical realism have a particular pride of place. Just as the <italic>Bildungsroman</italic> was the product of emerging capitalist individualism in Europe, magical realism is the expression of the political culture of emerging postcolonial and marginalized settings. The different points of origin, in turn, are closely related to the kinds of experiences that can be depicted in each genre, the patterns of social inclusion and exclusion, and the ideological tropes for what constitutes cognitive and social agency.</p>
<p>The truth claims of conventional realism, as we have seen, rest on the reader’s confidence that the world portrayed is recognizable to ordinary human perception. Magical realism subverts this through a deadpan recounting of events that we know could not “really” happen, thus destabilizing our sense of what the world is like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0741713612442785">Faris, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0741713612442785">Slemon, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Magical realism makes the claim that is what is ordinary in one cultural or historical circumstance is fantastic in another, and vice versa, a claim that has both political and epistemological implications. Because it disconnects the novel from philosophical traditions that are historically associated with the West, magical realism, for all its whimsy, has a clear relationship both to the experiences of marginalized peoples and to the historical record, expressing the experience of those whose worlds have been “fissured, distorted, and made incredible by cultural displacement” (Boehmer, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0741713612442785">Hart, 2005</xref>, p. 6) and challenging the ways in which languages, ways of seeing, and justificatory truth claims were imposed on indigenous populations in the colonized world and oppressed populations in the West.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0741713612442785">10</xref></sup> The inability to separate reality from fantasy has an explicit political meaning in societies in which the official record erases or denies the crimes perpetrated by governments against their own people and/or rewrites history and current events to the advantage of the powerful; one cannot claim to learn from experiences that the official record denies ever happened, or, rather, one cannot do so in social contexts in which the official record has authority.</p>
<p>Like <italic>David Copperfield</italic>, Salman Rushdie’s <italic>Midnight’s Children</italic> has achieved iconic status as a classic of world literature. I will use this novel as an example of alternative ways of narrating the self or, rather—since the ability to narrate something called the “self” is precisely what is being subverted in the novel—alternative ways of narrating the relationships among individual experience and identity, national and group identity, and history.</p>
<p><italic>Midnight’s Children</italic> takes its title from the 1,001 Indian children who, we are told, were born between midnight and 1 a.m. on August 15, 1947, the first hour of India’s independence as a nation. Born at precisely midnight and thus sharing a moment of birth with his country, the narrator/protagonist, Saleem Sinai, is “mysteriously handcuffed to history” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0741713612442785">Rushdie, 1981</xref>, p. 9). He is also inextricably tied to midnight’s other children who, as they grow up, begin to meet telepathically in a conference that is convened in Saleem’s head. Saleem’s relationship to the thousand other children is further complicated by his being switched shortly after birth with another infant, so that, from the beginning of his life, he is actually someone else.</p>
<p>Saleem’s midnight birth is one of the many tropes in <italic>Midnight’s Children</italic> that ties individual destiny to the broader historical context. At the same time, it is worth noting that David Copperfield was also born at midnight. Rushdie’s novel is, among other things, a kind of anti–<italic>David Copperfield</italic>, a narrative that dismantles both the world and the self that made Dickens’ narrative possible. Indeed, Rushdie has a field day with all the conventions that define the <italic>Bildungsroman</italic>: the stability of the self, the centrality of the protagonist, the chronological discovery of pattern and meaning, and the existence of a recognizable world about which consensus is possible.</p>
<p>From the beginning, Saleem’s attempt to construct a coherent individual identity is rendered impossible by circumstance: “If I seem a little bizarre, remember the wild profusion of my inheritance . . . perhaps, if one wishes to remain an individual in the midst of the teeming multitudes, one must make oneself grotesque” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0741713612442785">Rushdie, 1981</xref>, p. 109; ellipsis in original). Saleem’s attempts to discover meaning and purpose are a send-up of the narrative structure of the <italic>Bildungsroman</italic>, in which events in the world are shaped around the protagonist’s need for meaningful experience:
<disp-quote>
<p>At the end of 1947, life in Bombay was as teeming, as manifold, as multitudinously shapeless as ever . . . except that I had arrived; I was already beginning to take my place at the centre of the universe; and by the time I had finished, I would give meaning to it all. (pp. 126-127; ellipsis in original)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Rushdie is devastating in lampooning the “aha” moment that is so conventional in narratives of adult learning, the moment of perceiving the pattern and meaning of one’s existence:
<disp-quote>
<p>I struggled alone, to understand what had happened to me, until at least I saw the shawl of genius fluttering down, like an embroidered butterfly, the mantle of greatness settling upon my shoulders. . . . I was gripped by hot fingers of excitement . . . because finally . . . I could glimpse—shadowy still, undefined, enigmatic—my reason for having been born. (p. 163)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For all the humor, however, Rushdie offers an important challenge to the concept of individual self-exploration and self-authorship; any attempt to construct an individual life narrative is impossible because we are always too bound up in history, so that “to understand one life, you have to swallow the world” (p. 109).</p>
<p>If Saleem’s experience is too tied to that of others be contained within the individual, it is also too fragmented to provide coherence or wholeness. The Double I of the <italic>Bildungsroman</italic>, which allows the narrator to write about his/her younger self from the point of view of psychic wholeness, gives way to a narrator whose “poor body, . . . buffeted by too much history, . . . has started coming apart at the seams” (p. 37). Nor can he impose coherence on a story that refuses to cohere; as he watches the cracks appear in his hands, along his hairline, and between his toes, the older Saleem is condemned “to see my own life—its meanings, its structures—in fragments also” (p. 107).</p>
<p>Telling a coherent story of one’s life is, finally, impossible in <italic>Midnight’s Children</italic> because the world itself is fractured, most clearly in the Partition of India and Pakistan, and also by a world in which truth has been corrupted by politics: “ [I]n a country where the truth is what it is instructed to be, reality quite literally ceases to exist” (p. 326). For all these reasons, Saleem cannot achieve narrative or personal coherence both because “I have been so-many too-many persons” and because, as both victim and master of his times, he will instead “be sucked into the annihilating whirlpool of the multitudes” (p. 463).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Although there are aspects of magical realism that would be difficult to reconcile with the adult learning classroom, it seems to me likely that the lives of many of our learners conform more to Saleem’s narrative than to David Copperfield’s. Cultural and geographic dislocation, economic destabilization, war and violence, the upending of expectations, and many other all-too-common contemporary realities mean that the world often does not allow for, let alone reward, a coherent experience of self.</p>
<p>For most people, it probably never did. The construction of a stable social identity grounded in psychic coherence and rewarded with social legitimacy has always been the artifact of a particular, historically restricted form of meritocratic citizenship. In many cases, it has served as a necessary and even helpful fiction, but only—tautologically—for those whom it helps. My concern is for the many students who “fail’ to complete an autobiographical narrative that conforms to our assumptions, reinscribes our favored narrative, and can be recognized in our terms.</p>
<p>What magical realism posits is not the refusal to learn from experience per se but the insistence that there is something in experience that, in a multifarious and unjust world, cannot be captured by hegemonic, normative, and transparent narratives of self. It allows for the exploration of hybrid ways of being and the depiction of luminal spaces that are not easily “captured”—and I use the word advisedly—in a narrative of unitary selfhood. To take one example, the socialization of immigrants is a story that can be made to conform to the <italic>Bildungsroman</italic> theme of social demarginalization: “In order to find myself, I had to reject my parents’ cultural values and come into my own as citizen of a new country.” Alternatively, “I grew up being encouraged by the broader society to look down on my own language and culture, but I have found a more empowered and authentic self by re-claiming my roots.” I have no doubt that there are many such narratives being reproduced in our classrooms, but I also suspect that the truth is more complex. In a world of border crossers of many different kinds, disordered, in-between spaces are the norm, and experience there both teaches careful balancing acts and precipitates free falls and hard landings. There is much to say about and much to be learned within such spaces, but they require a different narrative.</p>
<p>As a way to entertain what those different narratives might look like, we might begin with Rushdie’s dual metaphors of fragmentation and engulfment. On the one hand, as I have argued here, our practices presuppose the unified self of the <italic>Bildungsroman</italic> in which the only split is between the past and the present and in which the relationship between older and newer selves is fundamentally pedagogical. Other kinds of life narratives might allow for a more disquieting—or a more playful—exploration of selves that are “as teeming, as manifold, as multitudinously shapeless” (p. 126) as life in Bombay in 1947. On the other hand, if we take seriously the notion that “to understand a single life, you have to devour the world” (p. 109), we might structure assignments that allow for the more contingent and historically determined self of magical realism. Rather than imposing the expectation that life narratives somehow free us from historicity, alternative narratives might explore the ways in which individual lives have been “buffeted by too much history” (p. 37) and shaped by forces that are both global and historical.</p>
<p>We might, for example, ask students to write about an experience that they thought they understood at the time but that has seemed more and more complex and confusing as time has gone by. We might ask them to identify a moment of experiential learning that has not made life more intelligible, more authentic, or more empowered, but that left them, like Saleem, “perplexed by meaning” (p. 153). We might ask them about something that happened once that made them themselves instead of someone else they might have been, not because they were shaped by an undue socialization from which we can now help them liberate themselves, but because they are necessarily creatures of a history that both enables and constrains.</p>
<p>I must admit to offering even these alternatives with reluctance because they again assume that we know what questions to ask to give our students greater range of motion and vision. Lurking just behind that assumption is the conviction that we can help them find a truth that is more insightful, or clear-headed, or democratic, at which point Daloz’s andragogical missionary is back. At the same time, the broadening of approaches to life narrative beyond the <italic>Bildungsroman</italic> has to begin somewhere, and the “swirling universe” of magical realism might be a place to start.</p>
