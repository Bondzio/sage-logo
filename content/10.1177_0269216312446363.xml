<abstract>
<p>We describe two cases of peristomal inflammation which resulted in pain, poor adhesion of the stoma bag and faecal leaking. The inflammation did not respond to regular cleaning and barrier film sprays, but dramatically improved with the application of a beclometasone dry powder aerosol inhaler sprayed onto the inflamed skin around the stoma site. A steroid inhaler was used to decrease the peristomal inflammation without affecting the adhesion of the stoma bag which could be caused by creams.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Bowel stoma formation is a common procedure as part of either palliation or cure for a range of intra-abdominal or pelvic malignancies, especially colorectal carcinoma. Occasionally inflammation can occur around the stoma site leading to discomfort and poor adhesion of the stoma bag; this is especially true with ileostomies which tend to be higher output and alkaline.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216312446363">1</xref></sup> Simple measures can reduce this, such as regular cleaning with gentle drying and barrier film sprays.</p>
<p>We describe two cases of stoma site inflammation which did not respond to basic measures of cleansing and barrier film sprays. This resulted in a cycle of inflammation (pain and pruritus with excoriation) with decreased stoma bag adhesiveness and faecal leaking further increasing the inflammation. In both patients a beclometasone dry powder aerosol inhaler was sprayed onto the inflamed skin surrounding the stoma site after cleaning and before stoma bag application. The topical steroid was applied in this way to reduce inflammation without compromising stoma bag adhesion, which can occur with steroid pastes, creams or lotions.</p>

<sec id="section3-0269216312446363">
<title>Case 1</title>
<p>A 45-year-old male with a diagnosis of pseudomyxoma peritonei was admitted with an umbilical hernia that had become necrotic and was leaking infected fluid. This was resected along with part of his omentum that had also become necrotic and infected. He was left with a fistula between his peritoneum and abdominal wall, which continued to leak mucinous and ascitic fluid. When this was draining well it kept him completely symptom free and enabled him to continue to work. However, the large stoma bag, which was needed to cover the wound, was causing contact dermatitis. He had used his wife’s steroid cream with some benefit but found it made the bags less adhesive leading to leakage. A beclometasone dry powder aerosol inhaler to spray on the affected area before applying the stoma bags was used at each stoma bag change. This completely resolved the contact dermatitis without compromising the adhesion of the stoma bags. After resolution of the dermatitis he stopped using the beclometasone inhaler but got recurrent inflammation which was quickly relieved by a repeat course of steroid inhaler application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269216312446363">Figure 1</xref>, consent given). He continued to use the steroid dry powder inhaler occasionally which prevented further recurrence of the inflammation.</p>

<title>Case 2</title>
<p>A 67-year-old male, who had a defunctioning loop ileostomy for distal small bowel obstruction secondary to metastatic colonic adenocarcinoma, presented with pain around his stoma site. He had CT proven liver and lung metastases and was unfit for further oncological treatment due to multiple co-morbidities. Pain from his stoma site was managed with 30 mg slow release morphine twice daily and several doses of 10 mg immediate release morphine a day. He was washing and dabbing dry his stoma site with each bag change (which was every few days) and also using a barrier film spray. On examination, his stoma site was herniated and leaking liquid faeces, it was also very excoriated and inflamed. He had both right upper quadrant and peristomal tenderness. After not responding to basic therapy, he was commenced on a beclometasone dry powder aerosol inhaler to spray around the inflamed stoma site when changing the stoma bag and before using a barrier film spray. The following week his stoma was no longer leaking and the site was much less excoriated and painful. The integrity of the skin was restored such that the stoma bag adhered. This was maintained on subsequent reviews and the frequency with which he used the beclometasone inhaler was decreased without an increase in the inflammation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Peristomal inflammation is a well recognised complication of stoma bag use. Many simple measures can reduce the risk of this, such as regular cleaning with gentle drying and barrier film sprays. This does not always resolve the inflammation and topical steroids may be needed. These are generally applied as creams or lotions which may compromise the adhesion of the stoma bag. We have demonstrated in these two cases that a steroid dry powder aerosol inhaler sprayed topically onto the peristomal skin, at each stoma bag change, can be effective for resistant stoma site inflammation, without compromising the adhesion of the stoma bag. Within a week of using the dermally applied beclometasone inhaler the inflammation settled, the stoma bag was adhering well and the symptoms improved. We have since used this technique in five more patients.</p>
<p>The rationale for using a dermally applied corticosteroid is to reduce inflammation without compromising the adhesion of the stoma bag which occurs with creams or lotions. Previous recommendations to use topical steroids include using those with an alcohol base which evaporates,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216312446363">2</xref></sup> although this can cause local stinging and can be time consuming. Steroids are powerful anti-inflammatory agents that modulate gene transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216312446363">3</xref></sup> and both cellular and humeral immune function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216312446363">4</xref></sup> Steroids affect many aspects of immune function and have effects on both macrophages and neutrophils in contact allergy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216312446363">5</xref></sup> Although the topical use of steroids has a relatively low risk of systemic problems in adults, potential side effects of topical use include skin thinning and easy bruising, which are more prevalent in longer-term use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216312446363">6</xref></sup> However, we have found that after the skin has healed application of steroids only needs to be infrequent to maintain control.</p>
<p>We recommend controlled trials of steroid inhalers in similar situations where a topical steroid is needed to reduce inflammation and when the skin needs to remain dry as to not compromise the adhesion of a stoma bag.</p>
