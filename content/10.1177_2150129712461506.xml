<abstract>
<p>In 2008, chronic respiratory disease—including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)—was the fourth leading cause of death in Canada. Chronic respiratory disease represents a major burden of illness on individuals, families, and the health system. Provision of asthma and COPD education and management resources can serve to improve self-management strategies, leading to an improved quality of life. The Partnership in Lung Age Testing and Education (PLATE) program was a unique demonstration project examining a population-based approach to the management of respiratory disease. Objectives included improving patient education, increasing public awareness about chronic respiratory disease, and promoting a healthy lifestyle. First, 13 “Airways Clinics” in Toronto and Hamilton were undertaken in various community settings (eg, pharmacies, shopping malls), providing respiratory health education and FEV<sub>1</sub> measurement. Second, a follow-up survey examined knowledge gained from phase I. Eighty-seven participants included those with physician-diagnosed asthma, physician-diagnosed COPD, and symptomatic without diagnosis and/or long-time smokers. Airways Clinics were positively received by participants, with 77% of respondents more aware of the role healthy lifestyles play in disease management. Findings indicate that the highest level of interest came from high-needs communities, including low-income and older populations (between 50 and 79 years).</p>

<p>According to the World Health Organization, hundreds of millions of people worldwide suffer from chronic respiratory disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150129712461506">1</xref></sup> In 2008, chronic respiratory disease was the fourth leading cause of death in Canada.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150129712461506">2</xref></sup> Two of the most common chronic respiratory diseases are asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150129712461506">3</xref></sup> Symptoms of asthma vary, often revealing themselves in childhood, and are often linked to allergy. The onset of COPD often occurs in midlife, with slowly progressive symptoms in individuals with a history of smoking tobacco.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150129712461506">4</xref></sup> In high-income countries, COPD is very strongly linked to smoking history, where 73% of COPD mortality is associated with smoking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150129712461506">4</xref></sup> Chronic respiratory disease represents a major burden of illness on individuals, families, and the health care system, reflected in both direct (eg, hospital and physician visits, medication, and research) and indirect costs (eg, mortality and long-term disability) totaling more than $5 billion annually in Canada.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150129712461506">3</xref></sup> Risk factors for chronic respiratory disease include, but are not limited to, tobacco smoking, indoor air pollution, outdoor pollution, allergens, and occupational risks and vulnerability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150129712461506">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>A recent study suggests that the global prevalence of asthma is 4.5%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150129712461506">5</xref></sup> Findings also reveal country-specific variations in physician-diagnosed asthma in adults (eg, 21.5% prevalence in Australia and 0.2% in China), which indicates the extent to which asthma continues to be a major worldwide public health issue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150129712461506">5</xref></sup> Gender variations in asthma exist; males experience higher diagnoses in childhood, whereas females do so in adulthood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150129712461506">6</xref></sup> In 2005, 8.3% of the Canadian population reported that they were living with asthma (6.9% males and 9.6% females).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150129712461506">7</xref></sup> In Ontario, Canada, a recent population-level study estimated that the annual prevalence of asthma increased from 8.5% in 1996 to 13.3% in 2005, an increase of 55%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150129712461506">8</xref></sup> Rates of asthma incidence in children increased by 30% during the same 9-year period in Ontario.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150129712461506">8</xref></sup> These findings are consistent with those of To and colleagues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150129712461506">9</xref></sup> who suggest that <italic>1 out of every 3</italic> Ontario, Canada, residents aged 40 years and older are likely to be diagnosed with asthma during their lifetime.</p>
<p>COPD prevalence trends are not unlike those of asthma. More than 64 million people suffered from COPD worldwide in 2004, with 3 million COPD-related deaths in 2005.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2150129712461506">10</xref></sup> COPD presents itself as breathlessness, abnormal sputum production, and chronic coughing and is caused primarily by tobacco smoking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2150129712461506">10</xref></sup> In the United States, 5.1% of adults (aged 18 and older) had COPD between 2007 and 2009, with higher rates in women (6.1%) than men (4.1%) and in older adults between the ages of 75 and 84 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2150129712461506">11</xref></sup> Canadian research illustrates that <italic>1 in 4</italic> individuals will be diagnosed with COPD in their lifetime and that the risk is higher in men than in women (29.7% vs 25.6%), individuals of lower socioeconomic status, and those who live in rural settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2150129712461506">12</xref></sup> To reduce decline in respiratory function, improved management based on early diagnosis and early cessation of smoking is needed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150129712461506">7</xref></sup> Early detection and treatment of exacerbations in individuals with COPD has been shown to improve quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2150129712461506">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>A significant gap exists between existing asthma and COPD guidelines and current general management practices. Self-management is an important practice given that asthma and COPD are both chronic diseases and may worsen over time. Provision of asthma and COPD education and management resources can serve to improve self-management strategies, potentially leading to an improved quality of life. Previous studies have reported on the effectiveness of community-based education initiatives for asthma, particularly in primary care settings,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2150129712461506">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2150129712461506"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2150129712461506"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2150129712461506">17</xref></sup> and COPD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2150129712461506">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2150129712461506">19</xref></sup> For example, in Canada, To and colleagues found that the development and implementation of a community-based asthma care program in a primary care setting resulted in reductions in the risk of symptoms, exacerbations, productivity loss, and urgent health service utilization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2150129712461506">16</xref></sup> In addition, findings of a comprehensive cost-effectiveness analysis of a community-based multidisciplinary COPD rehabilitation program in the Netherlands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2150129712461506">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2150129712461506">19</xref></sup> indicate significant improvements in disease-specific quality of life, over a 2-year period.</p>
<p>In a US study examining the impact of the addition of in-home asthma self-management support by community health workers to clinic-based asthma education administered by a nurse, findings reveal an increase in both caretaker quality of life and symptom-free days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2150129712461506">20</xref></sup> These results are consistent with those of Peretz and colleagues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2150129712461506">21</xref></sup> who assessed the role of bilingual community health workers based in community organizations, and who found a reduction in hospitalizations and emergency room visits, in addition to caregiver confidence in asthma control, over a 12-month period. Schools also continue to be the focus of asthma education initiatives, given that that is where children spend a large portion of their waking time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2150129712461506">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2150129712461506"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2150129712461506"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2150129712461506">25</xref></sup> School-based interventions have shown promise as a venue for achieving sustainable improvements in asthma control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2150129712461506">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition, the role of pharmacies and pharmacists in asthma education and management provision has also been examined.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2150129712461506">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2150129712461506">28</xref></sup> The Asthma Friendly Pharmacy (AFP) initiative is a recent US initiative that aimed to mediate some of the challenges associated with providing patient-focused care in a pharmacy setting (eg, staff workload, workflow, additional training).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2150129712461506">29</xref></sup> With strong community support, the AFP model integrated brief asthma interventions into daily pharmacy workflow, while reaching a wide patient audience, and improved the number of exchanges between pharmacists and patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2150129712461506">29</xref></sup> In Australia, the findings of Saini and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2150129712461506">26</xref></sup> also found improvements in asthma knowledge and related skills as a result of a targeted community-based pharmacist-led asthma education initiative.</p>
<sec id="section1-2150129712461506">
<title>Problem</title>
<p>Although we know that asthma and COPD education and knowledge are important components of overall self-management in children and adults,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2150129712461506">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2150129712461506">22</xref></sup> recent findings indicate that extensive research in this area has been conducted in the home, primary care, school, and pharmacy settings, suggesting that there is a need to explore approaches to asthma and COPD education in other types of community-based settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2150129712461506">25</xref></sup> The primary objectives of the Partnership in Lung Age Testing and Education (PLATE) program were to improve patient education and increase public awareness of asthma, associated allergies, and COPD. To achieve these objectives, community-based “Airways Clinics” provided FEV<sub>1</sub> measurement (forced expired volume in 1 second) and education sessions using Asthma Society of Canada’s (ASC) educational materials to promote lung health.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-2150129712461506">
<title>Implementation</title>
<p>Airways Clinics were 2-staged, involving a single cohort of participants (aged 18 and older; n = 87). In phase I, participants completed a pre-intervention questionnaire (assessment questionnaire), followed by an educational intervention. After a 6-month period, participants completed a telephone questionnaire to determine if differences existed in participants’ awareness/knowledge of asthma and COPD.</p>
<p>In Ontario, Canada, 7 Airways Clinics were undertaken in Toronto (n = 54), with 6 in Hamilton (n = 33). They took place in pharmacies, shopping malls, and library/community centers. Airways Clinic venues were selected in consultation with Local Health Integration Networks (LHINs)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-2150129712461506">*</xref> through the completion of a needs assessment and the development of a community outreach and intervention plan. Program flyers and posters were distributed in clinic and local health care provider settings. The ASC posted clinic information on its Web site, in addition to local radio and newspaper advertisements. Professional associations, such as the Ontario Medical Association, were informed about this demonstration project and its activities.</p>
<p>All clinics operated on a drop-in basis, and 1 clinic offered appointments. All participants provided informed consent and completed an intake assessment questionnaire (eg, respiratory symptoms, asthma/COPD knowledge, quality of life, and lung-health risk factor knowledge). Based on their symptoms, participants were divided into 3 groups: (1) physician-diagnosed asthma, (2) physician-diagnosed COPD, and (3) undiagnosed respiratory symptoms. Following an intake assessment questionnaire, a certified asthma educator (CAE) or a certified respiratory educator (CRE) (Canadian Network for Respiratory Care: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cnrchome.net/">http://cnrchome.net/</ext-link>) conducted an FEV<sub>1</sub> measurement.</p>
<sec id="section3-2150129712461506">
<title>Intervention</title>
<p>The intervention consisted of a 15-minute education session during the Airways Clinic. CAEs and/or CREs undertook FEV<sub>1</sub> measurement to estimate lung age, as well as asked questions related to the impact of respiratory education on disease management, lifestyle issues (diet, exercise, and smoking), as well as information about community resources available for disease management and behavior change. FEV<sub>1</sub> measurement was performed using a PulmoLife (CareFusion, San Diego, CA) handheld device. To perform the test, participants were asked to breathe into a disposable mouthpiece; results were communicated to each participant, along with a suggestion for physician follow-up. Participants were then invited to take part in phase II.</p>
<p>If permission had been granted in the consent form, results of FEV<sub>1</sub> measurement were given to participants and forwarded to their primary health care provider by mail. Clinic recap sheets were also mailed to primary health care providers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-2150129712461506">
<title>Phase II</title>
<p>In phase II (6 months later), participants were invited to complete a questionnaire (n = 31) over the telephone. It assessed the uptake of self-management strategies reflected in changes to respiratory symptoms and quality of life. It also asked questions related to participant perceptions about the effectiveness of the Airways Clinic.</p>
<p>Questionnaire data were organized and analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS 17.0). Descriptive statistics were calculated to highlight differences between participant groups (1-3) in phases I and II. The study protocol and data collection instruments received ethical clearance from the McMaster University Research Ethics Board.</p>

<title>Outcomes</title>
<sec id="section6-2150129712461506">
<title>Phase I: Demographic Data/Health History</title>
<p>In phase I, nearly half of all participants (46%) were between the ages of 50 and 79, and the sample included more females (60%) than males (39%). Thirty-nine percent of the participants indicated their highest level of education as the completion of high school, or less. A higher proportion (54%) reported (either attending or completing) some level of postsecondary education. More than half of all participants (61%) reported physician-diagnosed asthma (group 1), 28% reported undiagnosed respiratory symptoms (group 3), and 11% of participants reported physician-diagnosed COPD (group 2).</p>
<p>When asked to describe the frequency of their asthma and COPD symptoms in the last month, nearly half of all participants with physician-diagnosed asthma reported having daily symptoms, whereas 23% reported symptoms 1 to 2 days per week. These findings indicate that participants with asthma did not have an acceptable level of asthma control, according to the Canadian Asthma Consensus Guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2150129712461506">30</xref></sup> Participants with physician-diagnosed COPD reported having either no symptoms (20%) or having daily symptoms (80%). Fifty-eight percent of these participants brought up phlegm and/or coughed most days, whereas 42% found themselves out of breath more easily than others their age. Seventy-five percent of undiagnosed participants reported that they had experienced (some type of) respiratory symptoms within the last month, including daily coughing (30%) and sputum production (25%).</p>
<p>Overall, 71 participants (82%) had experienced chronic respiratory disease–related symptoms in the period immediately prior to the survey (1 month for participants with the diagnosed disease and 6 months for participants without a diagnosis). Half of all participants indicated that their physical activity and daily activities had been limited. There is also a high probability of undiagnosed COPD among the undiagnosed participants based on results of the Canadian Lung Health Test (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lung.ca/diseases-maladies/copd-mpoc/signs-signes/COPDQuiz-MPOCQuiz_e.php">http://www.lung.ca/diseases-maladies/copd-mpoc/signs-signes/COPDQuiz-MPOCQuiz_e.php</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Overall, 63% of the participants reported that they had undergone an FEV<sub>1</sub> measurement in their lifetime. In both diagnosed and undiagnosed groups, 39% of participants reported receiving detailed and specific education regarding COPD, asthma, or respiratory symptoms, from a health care provider (eg, family physician, specialist, pharmacist, nurse practitioner, asthma educator, or Asthma Clinic). Sixty-seven percent of participants with physician-diagnosed COPD (group 2) reported that the pharmacist was an important source of information.</p>
<p>An integral part of ongoing asthma and COPD management is regular medication use. Most participants with a physician diagnosis of either asthma or COPD had been prescribed medications in the previous 6 months (81% and 90%, respectively). The majority of participants reported that they had (77% with diagnosed asthma and 70% with diagnosed COPD) been shown proper inhaler techniques.</p>
<p>Most participants (100% of respondents with COPD; 72% of respondents with diagnosed asthma) reported that they did not have a self-management plan, but indicated they would use it if they had one. Overall, all participants (either with physician-diagnosed disease or not) reported that they were confident in their ability to manage their condition. However, data related to symptoms, medication use, and quality of life suggest that participants were not appropriately managing their conditions.</p>
<p>There is a well-articulated association between allergies and asthma. Overall, 62% of all participants reported that they had allergies (77% diagnosed asthma, 40% diagnosed COPD, and 38% undiagnosed). Asthma is often considered an atopic disease, and even when it is not triggered by an allergen, the disease invokes systemic and local inflammatory responses similar to those invoked by allergic reactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150129712461506">5</xref></sup></p>

<p>Smoking history was an important component in understanding the overall respiratory health of project participants. Overall, 29% of participants were current smokers. Thirteen percent of participants with physician-diagnosed asthma currently smoked, and on average they had done so for 19 years. Forty percent of participants with physician-diagnosed COPD were current smokers, and on average they had smoked for 46 years. Finally, 58% of participants with undiagnosed symptoms currently smoked and had done so on average for 47 years. Overall, 88% of current smokers reported that they had tried to quit at some point in their life (40% had made 10 quit attempts), using nicotine replacement therapy, prescription medications, counseling, the smoker’s helpline, and hypnosis.</p>
<p>Close to half of the participants with COPD identified themselves as being current smokers, even with the understanding that smoking both causes and hastens progression of the disease and lung dysfunction. Seventy percent of the participants living with physician-diagnosed asthma reported that they had been exposed to secondhand smoke. Half (50%) of the COPD diagnosed participants reported secondhand smoke exposure, whereas 54% of the undiagnosed participants indicated that they had been exposed to secondhand smoke. Participants with asthma were more likely to indicate that they were at risk of secondhand smoke exposure than participants diagnosed with COPD. This may reflect an increased sensitivity to environmental smoke resulting in asthma flare-ups. A high level of exercise was observed across participants; however, findings indicate inconsistencies between participants’ reported limitations to physical activity and their overall engagement in exercise.</p>

<sec id="section8-2150129712461506">
<title>Phase II</title>
<p>The purpose of the phase II questionnaire was to assess the differences in participant’s knowledge and understanding of self-management skills after having attended an Airways Clinic in phase I. In this way, respondents (n = 31) were asked to describe their respiratory symptoms and current disease status. Seventy-one percent of the respondents indicated that they had diagnosed asthma, 10% had COPD, and 19% had undiagnosed symptoms (groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively).</p>
<p>Fifty-eight percent of participants with asthma experienced symptoms on a daily basis, which included coughing, chest tightness, wheezing, difficulty breathing, and shortness of breath; overall symptom prevalence was lower in phase II than in phase I. Two thirds of the participants with COPD reported having daily symptoms in phase II, which is lower than 80% in phase I. The percentage of participants with undiagnosed respiratory symptoms who reported having symptoms in the previous 6 months decreased from 75% in phase I to 50% in phase II (these results are not statistically significant).</p>
<p>Overall, there were improvements in the occurrence of symptoms across all groups given that a lower percentage of respondents experienced asthma, COPD, or more general respiratory symptoms in phase II (55%) compared with phase I (82%). This finding helps support the objectives of the PLATE program by improving disease self-management through a reduction in the number of unscheduled doctor visits. Trends show improvements in participants’ quality of life, measured by interference with daily activities, between phases I and II. There was an increase in the number of participants (41% vs 13%, respectively) reporting having had no asthma attacks in the 6 months succeeding the pretest, which suggests a possible improvement in asthma management/control. Forty-two percent of the participants had discussed their FEV<sub>1</sub> measurement with a regular health care provider after attending the Airways Clinic, particularly among participants who had undiagnosed symptoms. There was a shift in how participants used their short-acting beta agonist, with a significant increase in participants using it “as needed” (56%) and fewer (33%) participants using it “regularly.” More participants reported an increase in self-confidence in managing their chronic disease, as a result of attending the Airways Clinic.</p>

<sec id="section9-2150129712461506">
<title>Asthma and COPD Knowledge and Understanding</title>
<p>A key objective in phase II was to measure the efficacy of education as an intervention to improve asthma and/or COPD management. Findings illustrated that participants had improved knowledge and understanding of asthma management between phases I and II. Results indicate that almost all of phase II participants were aware that asthma was a chronic disease that would not go away if left untreated, indicating a high level of knowledge and understanding of the disease. There was an increased level of understanding of the role of smoking in COPD and the importance of quitting smoking in the prevention of COPD progression. Increased awareness and education related to breathing exercises and physical activity for improved respiratory health translates to an increase in the uptake of these activities. Thus, as a result of improved awareness of self-management practices, an increased proportion of respondents began engaging in breathing exercises after their visit to the Airways Clinic. Findings illustrate that there was a general increase in participants’ awareness of community resources related to asthma, allergies, and smoking cessation. Almost half (40%) of phase II participants reported that they used community resources as a <italic>direct</italic> result of having attended the Airways Clinic.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Findings of the PLATE program have helped us better understand the potential for and efficacy of community-based clinics for providing chronic respiratory disease education. Findings indicate (eg, symptoms) that some participants were likely to have undiagnosed COPD. The PLATE program helped facilitate an important link between a community-based education initiative and the primary care setting. Given that the objectives of the PLATE program were to help improve self-management strategies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150129712461506">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2150129712461506">13</xref></sup> results of FEV<sub>1</sub> measurement were forwarded to participants’ primary health care providers for follow-up, additional testing (if appropriate), and access to educational resources. In some cases, the information identified during the Airways Clinics was important enough to trigger further investigations by a clinician.</p>
<p>Findings illustrate that while many respondents reported that they were effectively managing their asthma, medication use patterns actually revealed a lack of self-management. Although we know that asthma and COPD education and knowledge are important components of overall self-management in children and adults,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2150129712461506">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2150129712461506">22</xref></sup> PLATE findings illustrate that the provision of targeted chronic respiratory disease education can help improve strategies for disease self-management.</p>
<p>Findings indicate that participants lacked awareness of local sources of information (eg, Lung Association, Asthma Society of Canada, etc). In any educational initiative—as with the PLATE program—the provision of educational information is a valuable component of overall disease self-management. One-to-one education sessions delivered by certified asthma/respiratory educators at the community-based Airways Clinics appears to be an appropriate approach in which to translate asthma, allergy, and smoking cessation information to the general population.</p>
