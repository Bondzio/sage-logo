<p>At the sharp, high-profile edges of the encounter between the new atheism and Christianity it is unusual to find many biblical scholars and practical theologians, and perhaps not even very many systematic theologians. In such encounters Christianity is often defended by apologists more typically skilled in philosophical argument or who are themselves practising scientists. This raises the question of the value and function within this encounter of the specific disciplines around which so much theological enquiry has been structured during the modern era.</p>
<p>Is there a public role for those disciplines in this encounter or do they perform a more ancillary role in the construction and clarification of the larger narrative of the Christian faith? Or, what does Christianity’s encounter with the New Atheism do to the disciplines themselves? The four essays that follow, one each by an Old Testament scholar, a New Testament scholar, a practical theologian and a systematic theologian provide an opportunity to reflect on the above questions. Each of the authors, all of them holding academic positions in Australia, were invited to engage the New Atheism within the framework and using the resources of their discipline.</p>
<p>Old Testament scholar, Mark Brett, contrasts the respective approaches to the Bible by two atheists, Richard Dawkins and Alain Badiou. Where Dawkins dismisses the Bible for its ‘chaotic, cobbled together anthology’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040571X12472606">1</xref></sup> Badiou engages the Bible (specifically the theology of Paul) as a witness to revolutionary events which are beyond conceptual control. Taking his cue from this engaged atheist interlocutor rather than surrendering to Dawkins’s conceptual straightjacket, Brett explores the biblical witness to creation. By demonstrating its resistance to conceptual control he also highlights its openness to diverse conversations between atheists and Christians.</p>
<p>New Testament scholar, Dorothy Lee, explores the Markan theme of the kingdom of God and the Johannine theme of Incarnation as comprehensive visions of human existence lived before God in a world given reality and purpose by God. As such they are meta-narratives which offer alternatives to the vision of human existence and the world narrated by the New Atheists. Lee contends that the ‘New Testament narration of Jesus Christ … challenges atheism not simply, or even primarily, by its arguments for God’s existence, but rather by its interpretation of the reality of the world’s being and the need for, and provision of, salvation’.</p>
<p>Practical theologian, Neil Pembroke, invited twelve of his Christian undergraduate students at a secular university to respond to set readings from both Dawkins and Hitchens. Using the method of interpretive phenomenology, he analysed their responses, some of which are presented here in the students’ own words. What is especially interesting is what most unsettled them. While untroubled by most of the criticisms levelled at Christianity, the faith of the students <italic>was</italic> troubled by the atheists’ use of historical-critical insights to question the integrity of the biblical material. While otherwise capable of resisting the provocations of Dawkins and Hitchens, their Christian formation had not prepared them for this particular line of critique.</p>
<p>Systematic theologian Neil Ormerod argues for the development of a ‘natural theology in the Christian tradition’. This might sound like a claim for conventional apologetics. In Ormerod’s hands, however, it is an attempt to generate debates with atheists, especially atheist scientists, about reason and the processes of reasoning, and indeed about the congruence between intelligence and existence. Such debates may well ‘shake loose’ many of the assumptions which sustain the divide between science and faith; and, with Augustine as his example, Ormerod suggests how the shaking loose of those assumptions might contribute to the ‘intellectual conversion’ which allows reality to be seen through the eyes of faith.</p>
<p>These essays may not answer all the questions posed above. But perhaps they do suggest that the conventional disciplines of Christian theology do have a role in ‘shaking loose’ many of the assumptions by which much of the encounter between Christianity and the New Atheism is often defined. And it may well be that it is the Christians as much as the atheists who need to be shaken. It might be tempting for Christians to limit the debates to questions about ‘the existence of God’, and sidestep the demands of faith’s rich vision of reality and human existence. Awareness of the nature and diversity of the biblical narratives could lead Christians into imaginative engagement with the question of truth. The Christian community can be challenged to better prepare its members for meeting the objections to faith.</p>
<p>Karl Barth once wrote that the ‘gospel must ever again be explored and sought and inquired into’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0040571X12472606">2</xref></sup> Perhaps one of the challenges of the New Atheism is for Christians themselves to be freshly curious about the faith, to resist the posture of defensiveness, and – drawing on the various theological disciplines – to develop generous and imaginative accounts of the faith.</p>
