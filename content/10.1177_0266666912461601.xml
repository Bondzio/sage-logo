<p>‘I can’t believe I just did that!’ is a fashionable way of saying that we have just done something that we can’t instantly rationalize. A commitment to understand what may at first seem irrational decisions and self-destructive conduct is the starting point of Banerjee and Duflo’s <italic>Poor Economics: Barefoot Hedge-fund Managers, DIY Doctors and the Surprising Truth about Life on Less than $1 a Day </italic>(Public Affairs 2011). Their perception is that development projects have failed in their thousands because their personnel have quite simply not understood the motivations that drive the decisions of the poor. In particular they look at those frequent ‘perverse’ decisions not to take up wonderful opportunities offered by governments and NGOs. The decisions are not simply irrational: they arise from the circumstances of people’s lives. Part, though only part, of the problem arises from difficulties people have in understanding just why an offer should be taken up. In the area of health, for instance, the messages that are received by citizens of industrialized countries are confusing enough (such and such foodstuff is good for you/ bad for you, your children should be immunized/ immunization may introduce other health problems). The confusion is even worse in communities where good basic education is uncommon and incentives to take up the offers made by projects may not be obvious.</p>
<p>Banerjee and Duflo’s conclusions from their investigations of the lives of “average poor women or men, with their hopes and doubts, limitations and aspirations, beliefs and confusions” are that development workers must attend to detail, understand how people decide and be willing to experiment. Vital to this is information. Of course projects need to be constructed on the basis of the best information that can be collected, but they also need to inform the intended beneficiaries as fully as possible. However, the authors are careful not to say that making good information available will magically transform the success of projects. They identify five key lessons for those who seek to improve the lives of the poor, of which only the first is that “The poor often lack information and believe things that are not true”. The implication is that an information campaign might well be part of a development project, but not just any information programme. Their specification could be summed as concerning content and focus (it must say something people don’t know), communication methods (it must communicate in an attractive and simple way), and it must come from a credible source (which could include community leaders, the press and radio, as well as official sources). Anyone who has worked with projects can probably cite programmes that told people what the ‘experts’ thought they should know, using methods that confused and alienated them, and failed to ensure that it emerged from established relationships of trust with the community.</p>
<p>
<italic>Poor Economics</italic> is not a book about information, though it can be read very profitably for its information-related lessons. The other four key lessons are that: the lives of the poor contain burdens of responsibility that the state removes from the shoulders of the privileged; markets don’t always work for the poor for reasons which can be identified and addressed; failed programmes are not so much the result of intractable circumstances in the poorer parts of the world, as of flaws in the detailed design of policies; and that negative expectations about what people can do tend to turn into self-fulfilling prophecies. Good information work undertaken in the context of the whole set of lessons is central to the book’s suggested formula for effective development. The message rings true: we really need to know why people do the things they do.</p>
