<p>As I worked on this review of Beth E. Richie’s <italic>Arrested Justice: Black Women, Violence, and America’s Prison Nation</italic>, there was a contentious challenge to the reauthorization of the <italic>Violence Against Women Act</italic> (VAWA)—the major source of grants to support shelters and programs for battered women in the United States. The challenge centered on provisions to extend services to lesbians and enforce new tribal provisions enabling prosecution of non-native abusers. The battle over VAWA, and, in particular, the resistance to providing resources to help indigenous women and lesbians, is a poignant reminder that we are far from ending violence against women and very far from changing the systems, institutions, social norms and beliefs that foster violence against women, especially women of color and queer women. Richie’s book is a powerful addition to our understanding of how these social forces have shaped not only criminal justice responses to violence against women but also the consequences of our responses.</p>
<p>Richie’s analytic framework for examining violence against Black women in households, communities and by the state through policing strategies is a compelling text for understanding that what we have constructed not only does not work; it has contributed to the build-up of a <italic>prison nation</italic>, a term she uses to describe both ‘the ideological and public policy shifts that have led to the increased criminalization of disenfranchised communities of color, more aggressive law enforcement strategies for norm-violating behavior, and an undermining of civil and human rights of marginalized groups’ (p. 3). This build-up, emerging from zero tolerance policies over the past 30 years that stiffen prison sentences for drug charges, has disproportionately affected girls and women of color, and serves to re-traumatize women caught in a cycle of victimization and criminalization.</p>
<p>Richie, a seasoned scholar activist, has spent the last 25 years working to stop violence against poor women. Her scholarship addresses the lack of attention paid to this disenfranchised group by the mainstream White feminist anti-violence movement that has often overlooked the intersections of race, class, gender and sexuality. She combines statistics and academic analysis with real-life examples of Black women who experienced different kinds of violence and fell through the cracks of both the justice system and the structures of social services meant to address violence against women. Not only are African American women at greater risk for being violently abused than are White women, but as a recent Sentencing Project report indicates, they are also incarcerated at a rate that is three times higher than that for White women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1362480613490017">Mauer, 2013</xref>). Richie specifically analyzes how institutional racism feeds African American women into the prison system by telling the powerful stories of violence experienced by three specific Black women. She describes the links between these stories as a ‘new level of disdain for Black women who are young, poor, queer, or living in vulnerable circumstances’ (p. 15). Richie effectively uses these women’s stories to illustrate how systems not only failed to protect them but also criminalized them.</p>
<p>Advocates and feminists who participated in the early days of what we thought was the movement to end violence against women will find the chapter titled ‘How we won the mainstream but lost the movement’ particularly useful. In it, Richie discusses the complex ways in which Black women experience violence, the anti-violence movement’s relinquishment of its radical praxis, and the expansion of incarceration as a protective response. One method by which advocates were made complicit was through the use of rhetoric that domestic violence could happen to every woman that led to the consequent erasure of the particular ways in which Black women (and other women of vulnerable identities) were violated and oppressed by multiple systems of inequality.</p>
<p>I nodded in recognition of how I unwittingly participated in this erasure during a time when we would not yet know the cost of a more serious legal response to the problems of domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking. Richie’s work made me wonder how we might hold the state accountable. Beyond the critique of what we have done in tandem with the rapid mass criminalization that began with the war on drugs and has seeped into multiple arenas of sanctions and punishment, what might we construct as an alternative project? How do we bring attention to women whose social positions leave them outside hegemonic gender and sexuality norms, embedded in structural racism and class inequalities?</p>
<p>Richie argues that an alternative anti-violence praxis begins with the use of a Black feminist theoretical approach that employs an intersectional lens. Such a lens focuses on both the everyday violence experienced by Black women and the broader contextual issues. Chapter 5 discusses what a Black feminist response to male violence as both a political and intellectual intervention looks like and how it includes both epistemological and reflexive standpoints embedded in Black women’s experiences. Richie concludes this discussion by producing a violence matrix across intimate households, community, and the social sphere that expands the meanings of violence and provides differential points for intervention. She outlines how a partner’s abuse of an undocumented woman interacts with potential arrest, prosecution and sanctions by the Immigrant Customs Enforcement (ICE) apparatus or builds links between prostitution and trafficking. This chapter is also useful for providing a history of Black feminist organizing through books such as Alice Walker’s <italic>The Color Purple</italic> and anthologies of writings that contributed to an influential body of work on race and politics in general and male violence in particular, on both the individual and system levels.</p>
<p>Beyond a much broader and intersectional understanding of violence, Richie suggests we develop ‘radical strategies’ that move beyond the mandatory arrest and pro-prosecution state response to the problem of male violence toward Black women. These ‘radical strategies’ include a recognition that over reliance on the legal system should be transformed into other systems of sanctioning and support embedded into community structures of accountability. Another recommendation is that services should address not only the individual physical or emotional harm but also community and social systems of harm. She suggests that a ‘culturally competent’ approach is critical to ensuring fair treatment by legal and other systems. Finally, she forcefully argues that a Black feminist theoretical approach leads to the grassroots dismantling of the prison nation that provides the overall context for the problem of male violence. She concludes by briefly linking this struggle in the United States to a global struggle as the prison nation is replicated in various sites for similar reasons. It is the later point that might have been more developed especially in the additional macro context of neoliberal economic policies that impoverish developing countries.</p>
<p><italic>Arrested Justice</italic> is a fascinating and well-written book. Researchers, educators, and students in multiple disciplines will appreciate this critical text, including those in criminology, race and ethnic studies, women’s studies, sociology, social work, and more. It should be read by everyone working to end violence against women.</p>
