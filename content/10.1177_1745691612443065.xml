<p>Due process does not require that every conceivable step be taken, at whatever cost, to eliminate the possibility of convicting an innocent person. Punishment of those found guilty by a jury, for example, is not forbidden merely because there is a remote possibility in some instances that an innocent person might go to jail. —Justice White<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1745691612443065">1</xref></sup></p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1745691612443065">Steven Clark’s (2012)</xref> article is a nuanced analysis of the data underlying and motivating various fashionable proposals for the reform of eyewitness identification procedures. It exhibits vividly some of the weaknesses and dangers associated with the widespread tendency to suppose that, where certain existing mechanisms for the acquisition of evidence have been shown to be responsible for occasionally producing false convictions of innocent persons, then a modification of those mechanisms is intrinsically desirable, whatever the costs in additional false acquittals might be.</p>
<sec id="section1-1745691612443065">
<title>The Dilemmas of Error Distribution</title>
<p>The concern motivating most such reforms is the discovery that certain forms of evidence currently in use sometimes finger innocent persons, occasionally leading to their conviction. Because wrongful convictions are otiose, the next move is usually to insist that we must take measures to minimize such wrongful convictions, even if such measures produce an abundant harvest of false acquittals. Clark rightly stresses that policy choices in such situations require a hard-headed appraisal of the respective costs of false convictions and false acquittals, something that the proponents of such reforms are often loathe to undertake, either because they believe that such reforms can be implemented without increasing the frequency of false acquittals (what Clark calls the “no cost view”) or because they hold with Blackstone et al. that false convictions are so much more egregious than false acquittals that one should be prepared to discount the costs of additional false acquittals without hesitation so long as the reforms in question reduce the rate of false conviction.</p>
<p>Such a strategy fails to reckon with the fact that there is no rule of admissibility that will not occasionally lead to the conviction of an innocent defendant. Confessions are sometimes false. Should we exclude them? Expert testimony is occasionally mistaken. Should it be excluded? Innocent defendants sometimes choose not to testify. Do we need a Carter-like rule blocking adverse inferences from silence to protect the innocent, silent defendant from wrongful conviction?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1745691612443065">2</xref></sup> Such knee-jerk reactions ignore the fact that confessions are usually true, that expert testimony is generally reliable, and that most nontestifying defendants are guilty. If confessions and expert testimony were routinely excluded from trial, and if jurors followed judges’ instructions to ignore defendants’ silence, vast numbers of true convictions would be replaced by false acquittals. That is why the quest for evidence that infallibly indicates guilt (or innocence) is a snark hunt. It is provable in principle that there is no rule of evidence or procedure that will not occasionally lead to a false conviction (or a false acquittal). The fact that relevant evidence leads to fallible inferences is no argument for the former’s exclusion. It is, however, an argument for telling juries how reliable the evidence is likely to be when we have the pertinent information.</p>
<p>Given that there are few free lunches, almost every exclusion of nonredundant relevant evidence alters both the conviction–acquittal ratio and the ratio of false acquittals to false convictions. The idea that one can reduce the frequency of false convictions by excluding relevant inculpatory evidence without paying a price in terms of increasing the frequency of false acquittals fails to reckon with the meaning of “relevance.” So long as a type of evidence increases the probability of guilt (thereby meeting the relevance condition), then a policy of excluding such evidence will lead to cases of guilty defendants who will be acquitted and who would probably not have been let off the hook had the evidence been admitted.</p>
<p>Classically and logically, the standard of proof is the instrument we use for distributing errors; the other rules of evidence are—or should be—designed principally to reduce errors, not to distribute them. Most of the reforms that Clark criticizes have the de facto effect of altering the distribution of errors while increasing, sometimes drastically, their aggregate frequency. This is simultaneously to assign a role to rules of evidence that they should not have, while thwarting their capacity to discharge the error-minimization role that they should have.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1745691612443065">3</xref></sup></p>

<title>Taking Base Rates Seriously</title>
<p>Without doubt, one of the most innovative aspects of Clark’s analysis is the attention he pays (rarely found elsewhere in the literature) to the issue of the proportions of suspects submitted to lineups or showups who are guilty and those who are innocent. Clearly, if most such suspects are in fact guilty, then the adoption of a new procedure that significantly lowers the rate of false identification, but also significantly lowers the rate of correct identifications, is ill advised. This is because the (presumed) high frequency of guilt among the suspects means that the absolute numbers of the falsely identified are already low and that our principal interest should be in not lowering significantly the number of truly identified. By contrast, if most suspects are innocent, precisely the opposite conclusion applies. The proposed reforms should be adopted forthwith.</p>
<p>For obvious reasons, settling this empirical question (what proportion of suspects subjected to line ups and showups are guilty) is absolutely essential to making a reasonable decision about whether the proposed reforms to existing procedures for handling eyewitness identification would be progressive or retrograde. Determining the answer to this question obviously requires us to leave the psychological literature in limbo until and unless we can assemble reliable data about the distribution of guilt and innocence among those suspects who are put through lineup-style or showup-style machinations. Clark’s hypothetical projections of error rates for several different patterns of distribution of guilt and innocence show just how sensitive this decision about identification techniques is to such variables.</p>
<p>Consider, briefly, a pair of examples from Clark’s Table 1. Many reformers hold that the present system of biased instructions should be replaced by unbiased instructions indicating to the eyewitness that the guilty person may not be in the lineup. Suppose that we have a sample of 200 lineups and that exactly half involve the perpetrator (“perp-present”) and the other half fail to include the perpetrator (“perp-absent”). There would be a net increase of three errors in the unbiased lineup (nine lost correct identifications and six lost false identifications) in comparison with a biased lineup. An alternative reform—a switch from simultaneous lineups to sequential ones—would produce five additional errors per 200 lineups (assuming, again, that the perpetrator is absent half the time) in comparison with a simultaneous lineup.</p>
<p>Were we to suppose, more realistically, that the proportion of lineups with truly guilty persons is more like 70% or 80% than a mere 50%, these error estimates linked to various proposed reforms would go up steeply. Under such circumstances, the arguments for reforming the system come unstuck with the realization that such reforms would dramatically increase the frequency of errors at trial. What sort of Orwellian twist are we giving to the language when we propose “reforms” that we have every reason to expect will significantly increase the rate of false verdicts? That hardly squares with the oft-repeated view of the Supreme Court that the principal function of a criminal trial is to discover the truth.</p>

<title>Lineups Versus Showups: A False Choice</title>
<p>If I have any bone to pick with Clark’s analysis, it is his partial acquiescence in the view that the often proposed reform involving the replacement of showups with lineups is obvious and desirable. His reasons for that conclusion are clear: It is the only prominent reform proposal that existing data suggest might simultaneously reduce false identifications and false nonidentifications. That combination of features would be compelling if it were necessary to choose between showups and lineups. I think Clark pays insufficient attention to the fact that these two forms of eyewitness identification are not necessarily rivals. Almost invariably, a showup occurs immediately or very shortly after the crime (often at the crime scene itself). By contrast, lineups usually occur only after a suspect has been interrogated and they require rather elaborate staging. The fact that these two forms of identification occur at different phases of a police investigation means that it can be appropriate to utilize them both rather than choosing only one or the other. It is particularly useful to use both if there is more than one eyewitness, as this will produce a more probative test of identification than either would produce on its own. Moreover, the showup—occurring much earlier in the investigative process than the lineup—can produce relevant inculpatory evidence much more quickly than a lineup will, thereby preventing the escape of a suspect who might otherwise elude a lineup altogether.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1745691612443065">4</xref></sup></p>

<title>Eyewitness Identification Errors and the Role of the Jury</title>
<p>Unfortunately, and with only a few notable exceptions, the reforms that many researchers propose suffer from two distinct errors, as Clark correctly observes. First, they either ignore whether the remedies they offer will increase the rate of false acquittals or blithely suppose that the remedies will not affect the frequency of such mistakes at all. Secondly, and more egregiously, they ignore the question of the likely distribution of guilty and innocent defendants among those who go to trial. This second mistake is even more serious than the first—if most defendants are truly guilty (as one might infer from existing conviction rates), the scope for false convictions is decidedly limited and most errors that occur will be errors of false acquittal. By contrast, if a substantial proportion of defendants are innocent, then false convictions can become a serious worry. The trouble is that if one pays no heed whatever to the actual distribution of innocence and guilt among those charged with or suspected of a crime, then one has no clue about whether reducing the ratio of false convictions to false acquittals should be the top priority or not.</p>
<p>It is not clear to me that there is any one or any set of eyewitness identification procedures that is unambiguously superior to others in all respects—a kind of lineup for all seasons. Some are more prone to false identifications or false misidentifications than others but until we know more than we now do about the distribution of guilt among suspects submitted to lineups, it is dicey to suppose that one is superior in any given context to another. What is clear, however, is that we now have enough empirical evidence about the error profiles of several different lineup procedures that we are in a position to insist that jurors should be informed about the proneness to error of whatever procedure is used in the case in hand. Armed with that information, the triers of fact can decide for themselves what the probatory power of any given eyewitness identification should be. The sharing of that information with jurors appears to me vastly more important than trying to arrive at the one, unique and definitive format for conducting identifications.</p>
<p>This is another way of saying that the real key to protecting innocent defendants is not the exclusive use of gold-standard, error-distributing identification procedures, but clear communication to jurors that eyewitness identifications, whatever their structure, are fallible. More specifically, jurors need to be informed about the known error profiles of the eyewitness identification(s) used in the case that they are trying. The demands of due process can be met not by limiting lineups to those forms that offer the greatest protection against false identification but by aggressively emphasizing what we now know empirically about the pitfalls of various forms of eyewitness identification.</p>

<p><italic>Carter v. Kentucky</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1745691612443065">1981</xref>) established the right of a silent defendant to request that the judge give a limiting instruction to jurors, informing them that the defendant has a right not to testify and that no adverse inferences should be drawn from his exercise of that right. Here is the model federal instruction crafted to satisfy Carter: “The defendant chose not to testify in this case. Under our Constitution, a defendant has no obligation to testify or to present any evidence, because it is the Government’s burden to prove a defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. A defendant is never required to prove that he or she is innocent. Therefore, you must not attach any significance to the fact that a given defendant did not testify. No adverse inference against a defendant may be drawn by you because he did not take the witness stand, and you may not consider it in any way in your deliberations in the jury room.” (Instruction 5-21, 1-5 Modern Federal Jury Instructions-Criminal § 5.07).</p></fn>
