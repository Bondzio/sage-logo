<abstract>
<p>This article examines the concept of internationalizing the curriculum in the context of Australian higher education. It draws on evidence from a research project driven by policy changes resulting from the diverse student demography. The article looks at the ways in which student diversity within the Australian higher education sector shapes academics’ pedagogical practices of internationalizing the curriculum (IoC). The author describes the process, findings and outcomes of a research project on IoC she was involved in. Interview narratives of a group of academics involved in this study are presented to highlight some of the cultural and pedagogical issues educators are engaging with in the process of knowledge production vis-a-vis IoC. Challenges of IoC and inclusive pedagogy for universities are also considered given the present market-driven goals of higher education.</p>

<title>International education in Australia</title>
<p>The core missions of universities as knowledge creating institutions are education and training of qualified and specialized labour, research and service to community. Universities also have the moral and social obligations of educating students to be democratic, caring, creative and responsible citizens. However, the notion of universities as providing a public good in providing a valuable contribution to society has been eroded over the past decades. Education as a state-funded resource available to everyone and to be collectively shared is now regarded as a commodity, a commercial product to be bought.</p>
<p>With the end of the Cold War, and coinciding with the period of neoliberalism, there has been a shift from considering education as a public good to education as a private consumer good. During this shift in social emphasis, the ‘new’ commodity that was increasingly expanded with an eye to its profit potential was international education. In a short time, Australia became the third largest purveyor of such education.</p>
<p>Since the 1980s, Australia has become a major player in the international student market, offering globally recognized courses and qualifications. Australia’s early involvement in international education is connected to the establishment of the Colombo Plan in 1951 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011392111429225">Meiras, 2004</xref>). This scheme provided aid through education. The seven founding nations of this scheme were Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, India, Ceylon and Pakistan, and later extended to include other countries. Bilateral aid flowed to developing countries in South and Southeast Asia. The Colombo Plan occupies a significant place in the history of Australia’s relations with Asia, where thousands of Asian students were given scholarships through this scheme to study in Australian universities.</p>
<p>The pace of internationalization of higher education picked up in the late 1980s with the deregulation of the Australian education sector and introduction of new incentives for entry into international markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011392111429225">Weiss and Ford, 2011</xref>). International education activity contributed AUD$19.1 billion in export income to the Australian economy in 2009–2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011392111429225">AEI, 2009</xref>). Education services are Australia’s largest services export industry ahead of other personal travel services ($12.1 billion) and professional and management consulting services ($3.1 billion) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011392111429225">AEI, 2009</xref>). International students represent approximately 20% of all higher education students in Australia. Students from China, India and Southeast Asia (Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia) constitute over 80% of international students in Australia at tertiary level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011392111429225">Weiss and Ford, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The above changes in the Australian higher education sector in terms of student diversity and the decreased funding support created the impetus for policy, educational and research strategies in international education within Australian academe. The terms ‘internationalization’, ‘internationalization of higher education’ and ‘internationalization of the curriculum’ now found in most Australian universities’ policy papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011392111429225">Clifford and Joseph, 2005</xref>) have generally been used to indicate the curricula needs of international students and Australian cultural diversity. International education and internationalization of higher education are also important features of educational policies and practices in the United States, United Kingdom, Europe, Canada and other nations. Governments and international organizations such as UNESCO and the World Bank also use these terms.</p>
<p>The shift of higher education from a public national good to a private consumer good resulted in a situation where universities had to attract more full-fee paying international students to make up for growing budget deficits in the sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011392111429225">Marginson and Considine, 2000</xref>). Therefore, research in international education and internationalization of higher education emerged from what began as a field of professional practices as a result of increased mobility of students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011392111429225">Dolby and Rahman, 2008</xref>). The focus was initially on service to international students and scholars. Academic research on international education now covers a vast array of topics, including markets and marketing, student satisfaction, international student learning, new models of pedagogy, intercultural relations, cost-benefit analysis, postcolonial relations with Asia, globalization and educational aid, flows of knowledge and cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011392111429225">Sidhu, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>But what do concepts such as internationalization and internationalizing the curriculum mean in practice? Which concepts and whose knowledge drive such transformation? This article focuses on these shifts and changes, as seen through the eyes of a group of Australian academics who act as conduits for change. I focus specifically on the issue of diversity as this is tied to internationalizing the curriculum (IoC). The views of the faculty offer an excellent entry point to examine the links between research and practice. It helps to focus on the specific issue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011392111429225">Fraser (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011392111429225">2005)</xref> raised about the politics of distribution and recognition, and the ways in which IoC brings into focus issues of privilege and marginalization. How are the different cultural groups and individuals privileged and marginalized through pedagogy and educational policies in relation to international education and IoC?</p>

<title>Researching internationalization of the curriculum: Policy and practice</title>
<p>A few years ago, I was a member of the Internationalization of Curriculum (IoC) Committee at a large Australian university. There was no official policy on IoC at the university then, so this committee was formed to provide input into the formulation of such a policy. A research project ‘Internationalizing the curriculum: An investigation of pedagogical practices at an Australian university’ was conducted by some members of this committee (including myself) and two project officers to ascertain the ‘state of play’ of IoC at the university, and to discover the views of staff and students on how the IoC agenda could progress.</p>
<p>The research team conducted a literature review in the area of IoC. We found that the literature on IoC can generally be grouped into three approaches: economic rationalist approach, integrative approach and transformative approach. These approaches are based on very different assumptions about the purpose of education, the role of faculty and students and the educational context. An economic rationalist approach to IoC focuses on educational capitalism and markets in relation to international students, offshore programmes, branch campuses overseas and twinning programmes. The bottom line is revenue and fee paying students are viewed as ‘customers’ and part of the university’s global trade. Curriculum is seen as ‘an international commodity to be traded’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011392111429225">De Vita and Case, 2003</xref>: 387). The curriculum is standardized for all students within this approach. Academics are seen as workers who ‘deliver pre-packaged education with efficiency and economy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011392111429225">Schapper and Mayson, 2004</xref>: 197).</p>
<p>An integrative approach to IoC is understood as the integration of intercultural dimensions into an already existing curriculum. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011392111429225">Mohanty (2003)</xref> describes this as ‘brief forays by students and faculty through the curriculum into non-Euro-American cultures’. This discourse reaffirms the binary of the western self and the global as constructed as the non-western global ‘other’. ‘Western’ and European nation-states provides a normative context and issues of lack of shared power are silenced. This approach conjures up an image of both students and educators dropping in and out of non-western contexts in relation to specific subject areas. This surface analysis to cultural differences does not allow for cross-cultural exchanges in terms of knowledge and pedagogical practices.</p>
<p>A transformative approach to IoC is aligned with a critical understanding of pedagogical enquiry that includes inclusive education, feminist pedagogies and anti-racist and postcolonial pedagogies. The following questions become part of the curriculum in considering IoC. ‘How does knowledge work in this curriculum? How was the curriculum produced? Where does it come from? Why are we using this type of curriculum? How does this curriculum understand gendered, racial and cultural differences? What does this curriculum mean to me as an educator and academic?’ (Clifford and Joseph, 2003: 25). The basic tenet of this approach is then a need to interrogate the philosophical underpinnings of the different epistemological and ontological frameworks, and link this to cultural hierarchies.</p>
<p>As a research team, we brought our knowledge of these different approaches to IoC to our task, but we had to begin with a conceptual definition of ‘curriculum’ that would facilitate our task. We also found useful the definition by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011392111429225">Smith (2000 [1996])</xref> on four ways of approaching curriculum practice: curriculum as a body of knowledge to be transmitted; curriculum as an attempt to achieve certain ends in students – product; curriculum as process; and curriculum as praxis. These aspects of curriculum are linked to the main purpose of education and IoC as to bring about an intellectual, social and behavioural change in students and educators.</p>
<p>In addition to the literature search, we conducted a web search of Australian universities’ websites to ascertain the progress in IoC around the country. While many universities mentioned ‘internationalization’ in policy documents, only a few had explicit policies on IoC then. Generally, the term internationalization, in Australian universities, as it was being practised (at least as far as we could discern from the university websites and policy documents) refers to the international movements of students and staff between countries, internationalization of higher education curricula and inclusive curricula, and international links, partnerships and collaboration.</p>
<p>The next phase in our project was locating research participants at our university. As there was no official IoC policy at the university at the time, deputy deans of faculties were approached to obtain the names of academic staff who they felt had some involvement with IoC and, therefore, would have some thoughts and ideas to offer on the subject. We next approached the academic staff identified by their deputy deans and 30 academics agreed to be part of the project. Student interviews were obtained through the networks of the project officers (who were postgraduate students) in Australia. Academics and students were from across the 10 faculties in the university. These include the faculties of science, medicine, engineering, information and technology, education, arts, law, business and economics.</p>
<p>In the next section of this article, I present the views of the academics involved in the above study on what they understood an internationalized curriculum to mean at the university and how they could be engaged with IoC practices. We read the interview narratives of the academics against the literature review we had conducted in relation to IoC (namely the three IoC approaches, economic rationalist, integrative and transformative, and Smith’s definition of curriculum) and looked for themes and subthemes that emerged from the interviews.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0011392111429225">
<title>Australian academics’ understandings and practices of IoC</title>
<p>The group of Australian academics interviewed in this study had multiple understandings of IoC ranging from normative representations to that of a critical approach where issues of difference, power and pedagogy are important. A critical approach to IoC evokes notions of transnational connectivity, interculturalism and reciprocal flows of individuals and knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011392111429225">Matthews, 2002</xref>). Such an approach considers the ways in which difference and power works through the structural operations of curriculum, pedagogical and assessment practices, research and other academic practices that privilege some knowledges and skills, and marginalize others.</p>
<p>As noted earlier, normative understandings of IoC within the higher education sector tend to be represented as educational capitalism and markets in relation to international students, offshore programmes, branch campuses overseas, twinning programmes. Twinning programmes are higher education programmes offered by Australian universities in offshore private colleges. For example, in Malaysia, students can complete the first one or two years of their Australian degree programme within a private college in Malaysia and complete the remainder of the programme at the Australian university, and obtain a degree from Australia. Monash University (Monash University Malaysia; Monash University South Africa), RMIT University (RMIT International University Vietnam) and Curtin University (Curtin Sarawak) are three Australian universities with overseas branch campuses.</p>

<title>Questioning knowledge production</title>
<p>Some of the academics in this study questioned the process of knowledge production in thinking about IoC. They were sensitive to the western privileging of particular forms of knowledge, as illustrated in the interview narrative of an academic in the education faculty:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>It’s high time for university lecturers to become culturally sensitive . . . those former colonized nations have been humiliated for more than a century, and many, many lecturers here they don’t realize . . . but in many Asian eyes they are quite arrogant, Western cultures can be very arrogant. . . . So I think our lecturers need to have that kind of respect and treat our students decently. (Faculty of education respondent)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Some academics emphasized that in IoC there must be a sense of willingness to open our minds to consider different perspectives. The idea of engaging with these different perspectives in ways that create awareness and respect that there are other ways of doing and understanding issues become crucial in internationalizing the curriculum:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Flexibility I suppose of mind but that is hard to get that . . . an ability to be able to interact and get out in the world and move around, interact with people in a way that’s productive, respectful and as I say being prepared to take on board interesting and new ways of dealing with things and not having a view that the way things that are done in Melbourne, Australia is the way things should be done. (Faculty of medicine respondent)</p>
<p>People interact differently . . . need to have an openness and a tolerance . . . it is heightening their awareness that things operate differently in different places. (Faculty of business and economics respondent)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>For some lecturers openness was also seen as linked to not privileging some perspectives over others, ‘what I am striving to do is to create materials or create a curriculum where no one perspective is privileged’ (faculty of education respondent). For an academic from a law faculty it was a notion of fairness, ‘internationalization of the curriculum has to mean greater access to value explicit education . . . by value explicit . . . is the notion of fairness in all things’:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>. . . keep listening to other people’s point of view . . . you learn and you see things from a different point of view, people are thinking about different ideas, it’s very important. (Faculty of education respondent)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>One lecturer spoke of her transnational research and felt it important for students to see ‘that it is just part of you, the principles of who I am as an academic, as well as what I am trying to engage them in’ (faculty of arts respondent). The participants said that it was important to reflect on what was happening in the classroom and to seek understanding. ‘It makes us be more reflective on the kind of teachers we want to be’ (faculty of arts respondent).</p>
<p>Notions such as respect, openness and fairness as represented in the interview narratives above indicate that some academics are beginning to think about some aspects of social justice in IoC. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011392111429225">Fraser (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011392111429225">2005)</xref> notes that from the politics of recognition perspective, injustice is rooted in institutionalized and cultural hierarchies and encompasses cultural domination, non-recognition and disrespect. I am not arguing that Australian academics (including myself) have fully embraced issues of social justice within their pedagogical practices. However, their interview narratives suggest that they are questioning issues of cultural hierarchies and privileging in the politics of knowledge production. To ask these questions indicates a willingness to interrogate the philosophical underpinnings of the different epistemological frameworks in our pedagogies, which is an important tenet in IoC.</p>
<p>The need to unpack a topic, understand some of the philosophical and cultural underpinnings and how this affects the application of concepts illustrates an openness to interrogate the politics of knowledge production. Being self-reflexive in our ways of knowing and doing, as illustrated in the interview quote below, provides the opportunity for critical examination in relation to the privileging and marginalization of different knowledges in the classroom:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>. . . makes you start thinking about where’s this come from, why are we doing it, how are people going to use it and to think outside . . . also attempts to understand how other people might be wanting to apply it . . . to take a concept – and dig it below and look at it a bit more closely and question as to how you are going to use the concepts or think of it. (Faculty of business and economics respondent)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Such practices of reflecting on the topics and the teaching strategies enable academics to integrate their teaching experiences with their wider life experiences of cultural diversity, and practise the open-mindedness that they value, in considering the ways in which the social world is organized in different ways.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0011392111429225">
<title>Cultural diversity and inclusive pedagogy</title>
<p>The notions cultural diversity and inclusive pedagogy are important dimensions of knowledge production within the context of IoC. For this group of Australian academics in our study, the focus of cultural diversity – as illustrated by their interview quotes below – are the students in relation to the different cultures, different attitudes, different knowledges and different learning styles they bring with them into the education environment and the broader society:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>If you look at culture it’s the whole way of life of the students, it’s not just an issue of their particular ethnicity or religious propensity, but it’s also who they are, where they come from, their own schooling or background, the need to open up their eyes to points of view and ideas that are very different from others in the class. (Faculty of education respondent)</p>
<p>It means that our students come to university with different attitudes and possessing different knowledge about how the world works, what interactions with other people involve, the way those interactions are conducted. It really makes a difference to their general background knowledge of life. (Faculty of information technology respondent)</p>
<p>Diversity makes a difference in that I have to deal with students from different cultures, and who have different approaches to learning, and different ways of learning. (Faculty of engineering respondent)</p>
<p>Also using the diverse student body as a resource helps to open up the Australian students as well as the other students by helping them see points of view that are different from the background they are coming from. (Faculty of art and design respondent)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The question then is, how do academics engage with students’ differences in their own practices. Some academics in this study felt that ‘culture’ also informed their pedagogical practices in internationalizing the curriculum, as illustrated in the interview quote below.</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>We have to understand to some degree, except that we can’t understand fully, the background of students and where they come from, but also it means looking at the expectations they have, thinking about their modes of learning, and also ensuring that what we teach has applicability outside of the place at which we teach it. (Faculty of business and economics respondent)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>They spoke of some of the challenges they encountered in understanding the background, expectations and styles of learning of their students:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>You have to firstly try and understand where someone is at when you are trying to educate them. It’s only when you find out where they are at that you can actually move them on from there. (Faculty of art and design respondent)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Yet the focus is again on the students’ culture. The concept of culture as represented by some of the Australian academics in this study is one that is static and bounded – and linked to social dimensions such as ethnicity/race, religion, nationality, beliefs, attitudes and values. Therefore, the curriculum can be enhanced by adding in or integrating different cultural perspectives and experiences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011392111429225">Apple (2003</xref>: 18) notes that culture is a ‘lived experience, developed out of and embodied in the day-to-day lives and interactions of specific groups’. There are many cultures, and some through webs of power come to dominate, be it within the classroom or other social spaces. The work of education is, then, to understand power and culture as played out through identity strategies and pedagogical practices within educational spaces.</p>
<p>A number of the academics felt that cultural diversity is about developing tolerance and understanding, ‘building bridges’ (faculty of arts respondent). Practical examples were given such as the provision of a prayer room and the rescheduling of labs for students whose religious holidays fell on lab days. Another said it was about ‘how you interact with your peers, how you interact with an academic staff member, to what extent is debate and alternative points of view encouraged or discouraged’ (faculty of engineering respondent). One lecturer emphasized that cultural diversity was about equality and not about difference meaning inferiority. Another lecturer preferred to use the term cultural difference as she felt that the term diversity ‘silences this issue of power . . . comes back again to privileging of some ways over the other, and you cannot run away from that because this is related to the issues of power, and power will always exist in the world. This is not your idealistic utopian paradise we all live in’ (faculty of education respondent). When asked how they gained knowledge of their students, academics had no systematic processes:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>The far bigger problem is being able to second-guess the background knowledge that our students will possess and coming up with examples and applications that calls on world knowledge that they have. (Faculty of IT respondent)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>A few lecturers held discussion groups with their students which brought out information about their backgrounds and cultures, but mainly knowledge is picked up coincidentally and comes from lecturers’ own life experiences:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>And that’s the knowledge that I draw on, so it’s not intuitive, nor do I make a conscious effort to research what the students know. I’m not sure that I would know how to go about that even if I wanted to make that effort. (Faculty of IT respondent)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>These responses from the academics indicate an engagement with cultural diversity in relation to students’ cultural and social backgrounds. However, very few of the academics in the study indicated a concern about interrogating their own level of understanding of cultural difference. It is evident that some academics in this study were not quite at a stage of considering the ways in which the students’ differences shape their own ways of being and doing as facilitators of knowledge (re)production. They had an understanding of cultural difference to be of an apolitical diversity. This notion of difference as represented in their interview narratives tends to be subsumed within the notion of cultural diversity which is generally understood as the harmonious coexistence of culturally diverse groups within an environment that at times allows for the coming together within the classroom and broader university environments. Such a depoliticized understanding of cultural differences as represented through the public discourse of cultural diversity does not interrogate the privileging and marginalization of knowledges as located within social, educational and economic hierarchies. Furthermore, these academics do not interrogate the ways in which they engage with students’ differences in their own ontologies and pedagogical practices.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0011392111429225">
<title>Putting IoC into practice</title>
<p>Some practical steps in ensuring their classroom pedagogy incorporated IoC were outlined by the academics in this study. A safe, respectful and conducive classroom environment together with clear communication creates the space for successful participation by all students, regardless of their cultural backgrounds:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>It meant that you had to be aware that different people would and wouldn’t ask questions, so it was not to stereotype people but to make sure that you create an environment which is sufficiently sort of warm, comfortable that means that everyone can participate in their own particular way. (Faculty of business and economics respondent)</p>
<p>I’m into social engineering so they have to talk to each other, so that means the local students and the overseas students. (Faculty of business and economics respondent)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>They also noted this facilitation role as challenging, and that they had to be careful not to slip back into the didactic mode. A variety of techniques was used to gain full participation in their classes. One technique used was breaking students up into small groups for discussion and then asking each group to report back to the class, allowing students to present ideas from the group (rather than personally) and to have ‘practised’ talking in the small group. Another technique was to ask everyone to write a response to an issue so that they were actively engaged and then build interaction on those written reactions. Asking people to write down their questions and contribute them to the class helped to build an enquiry base around the topic. Getting students to think of a point of view on an issue and then tell the person sitting opposite their viewpoint and answer their questions was also a useful technique. One lecturer said that it was rare for a class not to be able to come to some kind of agreement about points of view but that agreement didn’t matter unless it ‘goes against core values’ (faculty of education respondent). The lecturer said that the class had had a big discussion about their core values and drawn up a list for the class.</p>
<p>Some students are reluctant to talk in class because they do not believe that their English is good enough. One lecturer encouraged a student by saying that he would value the student’s cultural perspective on the topic and this gave the student confidence to commence contributing. Another lecturer gave the example of a first year camp being used to assist students with transition to the faculty culture, part of which is working in groups. As the students go through their course they learn about the dynamics of being in groups and the responsibilities of being in groups.</p>
<p>Other academics found that opportunities for cultural interactions were created when tasks were conducted in small groups. Academics from the faculties of engineering and education provided some examples from their own practices, as indicated below in the interview narratives:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Some of the groups ended up going well because they realized that if they just worked with their peers, or their normal group of friends, it’s very homogeneous in terms of thinking, whereas there is a bit more diversity that comes from the other groups. (Faculty of engineering respondent)</p>
<p>In my classrooms I try . . . [to create] that atmosphere where students can develop a sense of awareness that there are different ways of looking at things. (Faculty of education respondent)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Academics in this study raised questions around the most appropriate pedagogies for their diverse student cohorts. They exhibited a keen awareness of how uncomfortable some of their students are with their teaching strategies and of the need for inclusive pedagogies.</p>
<p>Educational activities to enhance students’ engagement with different cultures and environments were also seen to be a useful strategy in IoC. The Study Abroad programme assists students to study for one semester overseas at another university overseas. Students also have ‘opportunities to participate in off-campus training, practical experiences in business and industry’ which helps them ‘learn very fast’ (faculty of economics respondent). These experiences are seen as important in preparing students to work effectively and creatively in different cultural and social environments. Staff were also keen for students to be exposed to overseas environments. For postgraduate students this was usually feasible in terms of conference attendance and researching or learning new techniques at institutions overseas. It was also seen as useful for networking and finding post-doctoral positions. The staff also welcomed the input of visiting research students. ‘I bring in students from overseas . . . a research exchange . . . I see that this is a real positive towards my local research students. . .’ (faculty of science respondent). Another way of students engaging other cultures was through working online with students in other countries. Often such activities are built into curricula through personal networks with former colleagues overseas and through contacts made at conferences or visits to other universities. Some departments also saw field placements around Australia as moving students out of their comfort zone.</p>
<p>Questions around equity issues were raised in relation to educational activities such as Study Abroad, as despite grants from the programme, student still had to fund themselves. Even among the students who go on overseas tours ‘there are some who afford it easily and get something from families, and there are those who are really on a strict budget’ (faculty of art and design respondent).</p>
<p>We found in our research that some Australian academics in this study were thinking through the practical aspects of IoC in terms of social justice. Some ways in which curriculum can strive towards democracy and social justice in IoC include the development of more courses with an international focus; increased opportunities for faculty development that would enhance faculty members’ international expertise, providing incentives for teaching, research and service that include international experiences, the infusion of content with an international focus in core/required courses thereby ensuring that international awareness is a facet of all students’ educational experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011392111429225">Schoorman, 2000</xref>). Embedded within such practices are the addressing of the privileging of different knowledge and skills in the global and national order in order to avoid a colonizing pedagogy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011392111429225">Sadiki (2001)</xref> argues that ‘a globally sensitive, conscious and committed curriculum must be borderless, that is, one that is not guided by ethno-specificity or spatial particularity’.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, Australian academics involved in this study are thinking through the notion of IoC in relation to their pedagogies. Most of them tend to emphasize the practical aspects such as group work, teaching techniques and educational activities. What is not clear though is if these curricular practices do lead to a change in these academics’ understandings of knowledge production. How was critical and inclusive pedagogy being played out within their pedagogies?</p>
<p>Critical and inclusive pedagogy is a teaching approach that questions and challenges the social and political construction of knowledge and curricula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011392111429225">hooks, 2003</xref>). bell hooks, an educator adopting a critical pedagogy approach in her/his teaching–learning practices questions and challenges both her/his own and students’ mindset and ways of understanding the world and people in relation to issues of domination, beliefs and practices. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011392111429225">hooks (2003)</xref> writes of a pedagogy of hope: ‘educators who have dared to study and learn new ways of thinking and teaching (and I would add other academic practices) so that the work we do does not reinforce systems of domination, of imperialism, racism, sexism or class elitism have created a pedagogy of hope’ (2003: xiv).</p>

<title>Approaches to IoC</title>
<p>Australian academics involved in our study were positioned in different parts of the three approaches to IoC, economic rationalist, integrative and transformative. While most academics in this study were questioning their pedagogical practices in relation to IoC, inclusive and critical pedagogy, there were a few academics who expressed views that combined the economic rationalist and integrative approaches to IoC. As illustrated in their interview quotes below, internationalizing the curriculum referred to the curriculum content being international and a number of perspectives being introduced in examining an issue:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Have issues focusing on international case studies or whatever, as an example of the foreign or the other, and in a way that helps them understand more what’s going on in what would be traditionally called the domestic sphere. (Arts, MA programme respondent)</p>
<p>In my classroom environment that means exposing them to different realities of different groups upon the planet. (Law, MA programme respondent)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>A focus on international contexts and developing critical perspectives in the students was also seen as giving them a perspective from which to reflect on their own society:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Studying issues focusing on international case studies or whatever, as an example of the foreign or the other, and in a way that helps them understand more what’s going on in what would be traditionally called the domestic sphere. (Faculty of arts respondent)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Gaining access to international resources not only in relation to libraries and language but also to experts in the areas was also seen as essential in providing multiple and international perspectives to an issue or topic under study:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>. . . access to international sources . . . a variety of not only view points from each other, but also from guest lecturers and guest tutors. (Faculty of arts respondent)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Art and design courses at this Australian university now include curriculum materials from Asian art and architectural design, engineering draws on the design of transport systems from around the world, management has moved from a reliance on American textbooks to writing their own based on the Asia-Pacific region and pharmacy has moved away from its duplication of the London School of Pharmacy curriculum to be more patient-oriented.</p>
<p>Basically, for these few academics in the study, the curriculum remains the same with the addition of examples chosen to represent a ‘culture’ different from the one that dominates the university. Therefore, the curriculum can be enhanced by adding in or integrating different cultural perspectives and experiences.</p>
<p>Most of the academics in our study appeared to have adopted the aspects of an inclusive and transformative approach to IoC. The following interview quotes from three academics in our study capture the way in which knowledge and pedagogy are understood within a transformative approach to IoC:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>A sense of respect for different ways of knowing, being and doing.</p>
<p>In our teaching and other academic practices, there is a need to interrogate the philosophical underpinnings of our teaching materials and the knowledge we draw on.</p>
<p>. . . taking into account the idea of difference in your teaching . . . it is not just a matter of adding on flavours . . . it is engaging with different knowledge and engaging with literature from different contexts . . . and start to do a comparison and try to understand why it is different and complicates these understandings.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011392111429225">Trueit (2003</xref>: ix) in problematizing the notion of internationalization of the curriculum asks of us as academics and educators the following questions:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>When we come together from such diverse backgrounds, with international histories that involve colonization, occupation, political ignorance, and arrogance, how can we speak with each other in such a way that the past does not shadow the present encounter? Can we speak as scholars in ways that honour democratic ideals?</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>These questions are urgent given the current Australian sociopolitical climate that is located within discourses of fear and anxiety in relation to multiculturalism, Islam, terrorism and other cultural issues. These questions are also urgent given that within Australian academe discourses of neoliberalism, marketization, managerialism and research quality frameworks compete with discourses of social justice, tolerance, democracy and critical dialogue.</p>
<p>In keeping with global educational trends and developments in capitalist and postindustrial western nations, Australian universities now function as managerial educational institutions. There has been ‘a move from social conscience and responsibility towards an individualism . . . from morality to moralistic audit-driven surveillance . . . from critique to mindless criticism in terms of rules and regulations combined with individual vulnerability to those new rules and regulations, which in turn press towards conformity to the group’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011392111429225">Davies, 2005</xref>: 12). How does one hold on to notions of IoC and ‘inclusive pedagogy’ in which learners and teachers’ lived experiences are central to education in such an environment? Within this environment, the performative neoliberal subject academic is defined in terms of income, the individual self, economic survival, surveillance mechanisms for reporting and producing appropriate behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011392111429225">Davies, 2005</xref>). Such discourses of subject positionings are challenges for academics and educators who engage with the unravelling of social (in)justice and (in)equalities in the production and dissemination of knowledge within the classrooms and academe vis-a-vis IoC. Different ways of knowing and being are not acknowledged or rewarded within such an environment. An academic from the faculty of engineering who participated in this study captures this dilemma in the interview narrative below:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>It’s time, it really is . . . it’s in no way a lack of empathy with the ideal of IoC I think it’s a really good idea. It’s a situation that each day we tend to be confronted with a set of demands that are far greater than we can address on a given day and so it’s which ball you choose to juggle on that day. (Faculty of engineering respondent)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition, he notes that time is an important issue given this tension between the institutional imperatives of a neoliberal university environment and the ideology of an inclusive pedagogy. Time was a recurring theme in the interviews, or rather lack of it. It was seen as ‘the most precious resource’ (faculty of law respondent).</p>
<p>It was seen as necessary to ‘buy’ time so that people could come together and talk through issues. Interaction was seen as imperative for motivation and exchange of experiences. Time needed to be allocated to review the curriculum (e.g. two-day retreats) so that staff could discuss and explore ideas and issues together. These are some of the major challenges in an environment where the academic is pushed to take on the performative neoliberal subject.</p>
<p>As researchers on the project ‘Internationalizing the curriculum: An investigation of pedagogical practices at an Australian university’, we had the opportunity to share the findings of our study with academics from the different faculties through workshops and seminars. We also provided input into the development of IoC policies related to teaching, learning and other educational practices related to IoC. We felt positive that some academics in our study have a strong set of ethics of equity and justice in their educational practices. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011392111429225">Giroux (1992)</xref> describes this as developing a sense of critical agency, where students and academics develop the ability to make informed and reflective choices in practice. Yet there were also academics who subscribed to an apolitical understanding of IoC and thereby drew on the practice of ‘intellectual tourism’ in their pedagogy. There has to be a cultural remapping in our ways of being and knowing where we move out of our ontological and epistemological comfort zones for IoC to address issues of social justice.</p>

<sec id="section8-0011392111429225">
<title>Internationalizing the curriculum: Pedagogy for social justice</title>
<p>When I first started my position as a university lecturer in Australia at the end of 2002, teaching and research were equally valued within Australian academe. There was also more funding available from the federal government. Research examining issues of cultural and social inequalities and hierarchies within the field of education was given a space within the universities. Now, consistent with global trends, such political issues are silenced under the rubric of ‘cultural diversity’. The technical rationality approach to knowledge production with markers of positivism, descriptive and apolitical pedagogy and research and now instrumentalism is becoming more evident within Australian academe. These trends are not unique to Australian academe, but are present in all spaces of academe within the western English-speaking world, such as the United States, United Kingdom and Canada.</p>
<p>There is the visible embodiment of diversity through the presence of international students, and other students and staff from different cultural, social and economic backgrounds. However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011392111429225">Ahmed and Swan (2006</xref>: 97) argue, with the ‘bureaucratization of diversity’, ‘challenging inequalities’ is no longer an ongoing concern. Apolitical representations of difference provide challenges for cross-cultural pedagogy and dialogue within classrooms and academe.</p>
<p>The landscape of international education is changing dramatically, highly competitive and is market and profit driven. The traditional powers in higher education including the US, UK, Europe and Australia are no longer the main players in international education. Nations like Singapore, China and Malaysia who used to be importers of higher education are now repositioning themselves as exporters of higher education. The Middle East is also an important player in this field. In addition, there are private for-profit education providers such as Kaplan, Inc. based in the US that provides higher education programmes, professional training courses and other services for various levels of education globally including in Singapore, Australia and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>In the present times, dominant discourses of internationalization of higher education and internationalization of the curriculum are focused on the ‘global university’ and developing the ability and skills of staff and students to work efficiently across different national and cultural systems. International and global interconnectedness through educational and research partnerships with international agencies, government and institutions; industry engagements; and diversification of student cohorts and participation of students and staff in international mobility programmes are seen by universities to be indicators of internationalization.</p>
<p>Thus, despite the research that indicates there are different approaches to internationalizing the curriculum, the dominant version that emerges is partly driven by entities other than academics who are in privileged positions to direct the emphases in curriculum and pedagogical practice. Faculty understanding of and approaches to IoC can partly sustain this dominant approach including the practices of faculty who are interested in adding ‘diverse’ cultural practices to the curriculum or are eager to draw on the experiences of their students as native informants. Widespread adoption of a transformative curriculum faces the significant challenge of retraining faculty in transformative pedagogies and scholarly critiques of academic tourism. However, these seem to be insurmountable impediments within the quick-results demand constraints imposed by corporatized global university structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011392111429225">Tuchman, 2009</xref>). Thus, a significant hiatus remains between different types of research on the subject of internationalization and practices on the ground.</p>
<p>In order to bridge this gap, we need to interrogate the complexities of our positionings as educators and academics. We should emphasize as best as we can – given the current sociopolitical global order and the present market-driven goals of education – the pursuit of knowledge that can help us transform the world that we share to be more equitable, more inclusive, more just and more humane. What is considered as knowledge within a university classroom is constructed within relations of power. Knowledge is always situated and constituted within specific sets of local conditions and cultural values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011392111429225">Giroux, 2001</xref>). This means that curriculum is presented as something to be engaged with and critiqued. The classroom becomes a site in which this occurs. The curriculum is interpreted through this context of difference where there are cultural, social and political differences within and between groups of students and teachers.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011392111429225">Spivak (1990)</xref> argues that in working critically through one’s beliefs, prejudices and assumptions, ‘we need to do our homework, to work hard at gaining some knowledge of the others who occupy those spaces most closed to us – and also attempt to speak to others in such a way that they might take us seriously and be able to answer back’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011392111429225">Spivak, 1990</xref>: 62). Internationalizing the curriculum must focus on critical considerations of epistemological and ontological frameworks in the interplay of knowledge construction, curriculum and pedagogy. This is the challenge for academic and pedagogical practices of international education and IoC.</p>
<p>Our representations of individuals, collectives and cultures through our pedagogical practices and research circulate in the wider world. Such representations can either help reproduce cultural essentialism or challenge it. These representations can also contribute to systems of domination or enable understandings of difference. Knowledge production in teaching and research must, therefore, bring to light the interplay of material realities and discursive practices that privilege and marginalize different ways of being and knowing. Such knowledge contributes to understanding the ways in which institutional structures and cultural practices can contribute to a more just and more humane society.</p>
<p>How does one hold on to epistemologies and methodologies where lived experiences are central to knowledge production in the current climate within higher education sectors? How does one hold on to practices that emphasize the unravelling of power and discursive practices of knowledge production within academe? Contemporary times are interesting times for us located within ‘western’ academe as we ‘learn’ the balancing act between social justice, academic passions and instrumental performativity.</p>
<p>What matters most in this neoliberal knowledge economy is ‘the profitability of courses, or the way in which research projects generate interest that might attract further funding, or whether one’s work attracts students who will pay fees’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011392111429225">Ali, 2009</xref>: 83). Disciplines such as feminist studies, ethnic and racial studies, postcolonial studies and other disciplines are located at the margins. These disciplines are not as valued as those located within mainstream knowledge traditions (e.g. applied sciences, psychology) that generally do not interrogate issues of power, inclusion/exclusion, oppression and marginalization. Non-mainstream and critical disciplines create spaces to engage discussions about social inequalities and cultural hierarchies operating within academe and public spaces. This becomes more challenging as universities focus on commercial knowledge production and attracting funding from government and corporate agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011392111429225">Dei, 2010</xref>). In this context, Dei makes the important point that ‘privileging the production of knowledge that puts universities in good standing with governments and corporate funders means that faculty members, students, and staff who engage some of the tough, critical questions of our time may be scrutinized, if not policed, to ensure that their work does not create a moral panic or offend political or corporate sensibilities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011392111429225">Dei, 2010</xref>: 170). Pedagogy and research on critical questions of our times have no space within hegemonic frameworks of knowledge production. As argued earlier, the technical rationality approach to knowledge production and instrumentalism is the hegemonic discourse within academe.</p>
<p>Educators and academics who advocate for social justice in their practices negotiate significant power structures operating at the institutional level in their balancing act of sociological practices, epistemological approaches and pedagogy. These balancing acts at times come at great personal costs, in terms of career advancement and research funding, as we hold on to transformative approaches to knowledge production that do not fit into the profit economy of knowledge production and dissemination.</p>
<p>It is through coalitions, transnational and transversal politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011392111429225">Ali, 2009</xref>) that academics and educators located at the margins continue to ground and make visible their critical epistemological and pedagogical approaches. We continue to make visible the relationships between theory, practice and politics within an increasingly marketized higher education system through transnational networks of publishing and activism. It is through our active agency vis-a-vis these collective responses while at the same time negotiating the performative neoliberal academic subject.</p>
<p>For example, in my case, I have formed collaborative dialogues and transnational solidarities with colleagues on the Research Committee on Women in Society (RC32) of the International Sociological Association (ISA). We continue to engage with critical and transformative epistemologies and pedagogies through our conferences, essay competitions, collaborative research, publications and research training of the younger generation of scholars. I also continue to work with colleagues with similar politics both within Australia and in other countries on various projects, including higher degree research training. In addition, the complex power dynamics within the classroom ‘can be a useful site of scholarship and learning, and not simply of struggle’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011392111429225">Hase, 2001</xref>: 103) for both students and educators. In engaging with and through the identity politics of students and teacher, the classroom spaces create opportunities to develop new knowledge and understandings.</p>
<p>There is no denying that academics and educators who work at the margins of knowledge hierarchies to some extent are constrained by the material and social inequalities operating in the higher education sectors. Yet in the same instance, we also understand the interplay between cultural politics and knowledge production operating in our work environments. Amid cultural, economic and political constraints and opportunities, we learn to strategize, survive and build meaningful lives as academics and educators – and continue to make visible our knowledge traditions and pedagogies. Ways of being and knowing of researchers and educators entail processes of negotiation and contestation located within layers of difference, power and knowledge.</p>
