<abstract>
<p>As a public library, a public good, provides many external benefits for the community it belongs to, its public value needs to be carefully assessed. More specifically, the Korean Government demands information on the public value that ensues from the establishment of the Gwangju branch of the National Library. This paper therefore attempts to measure its public value by using the contingent valuation method and reporting the results of the contingent valuation survey. We adopted a strategy to use two split samples for on-site and off-site areas, which refer to one area surrounding the library and another that does not, respectively, and as such, the study focuses on the scale parameter of the contingent valuation model. The estimated value for the scale parameter is statistically significant at the 1% level. The statistical test of the hypothesis that the mean willingness to pay estimate for the on-site area is not different from that for the off-site requires estimating the mean willingness to pay separately for each area. The mean willingness to pay estimates for the on-site and off-site area are KRW 3330.5 (GBP 1.7) and KRW 3572.9 (GBP 1.8) per household per year, respectively. The national value expanded to relevant residents is about KRW 60bn (GBP 30m) annually for five years. The results are expected to be useful for policy makers in determining the economic feasibility of the branch.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>Total economic value is composed of use value and non-use value. Use value can be classified into smaller groups: direct-use value and indirect-use value. The former is achieved when goods and services are consumed directly by users, and the latter is derived from goods and services that, although beneficial, are not directly consumed or sold. Non-use value refers to less direct and less tangible benefits to society. When we consider the economic value of certain goods, it is easy to ignore non-use value. This is more common in the assessment of environmental or public goods. In addition, it is well known that a free market is likely to fail as a mechanism for allocating public goods. In order to supply a proper amount of public goods, the Government needs information on the value of the public goods. In this regard, methods for non-market valuation have been proposed to appropriately reflect non-use value and derive the genuine value of such goods.</p>
<p>The library service is one of the most important public goods; thus, we focused on the public library in this paper. A public library has considerable influence on and provides many benefits to the community it serves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961000612455820">Fraser et al., 2002</xref>). Not only are public libraries supporting the community’s children and students in their acquisition of educational skills but libraries also provide lifelong learning for everyone in the community. Libraries also serve the public by providing information about many useful and important topics such as real-estate information, consumer information, and health and legal information. As public libraries generate external benefits and provide substitutes for private goods, the value of them needs to be assessed carefully. Meanwhile, building a new public library needs financial supports from the Government and pressure on the public budget makes it important to quantify the value of the public library. These situations create the need for cost-benefit analysis. The costs of constructing a public library are relatively easy to measure; however, the benefits are complex due to the characteristics of public goods and need to be evaluated with attention.</p>
<p>In this paper, we estimate the value of a public library, specifically the Gwangju branch of the National Library in Korea (GBNLK) by applying a contingent valuation (CV) method. The GBNLK is a specialized library for the field of art and culture. It provides local residents with a broad range of services such as having an extensive collection of books for borrowing and consultation. We can capture use and non-use values of GBNLK and correctly estimate the public values of the public library from the estimation of CV. Further, we considered the scale parameter to improve CV in terms of methodology and reflect the property of sampling method. The spike model which controls zero WTP observations will be also addressed in the context.</p>
<p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces a brief review of previous research and Section 3 explains the measurement method employed in this study, the methodological issues associated with questionnaire design, and the survey. The willingness to pay (WTP) model is dealt with in Section 4. Explanations and discussions of the results appear in the penultimate section. Some concluding remarks are made in the final section.</p>

<title>3. Methodology</title>
<sec id="section4-0961000612455820">
<title>3.1 Measurement method: Contingent valuation method</title>
<p>As there is potential to underestimate the public value of a public library, we have to pay closer attention to measuring its public value perceived by a community. Further, in addition to its use value, its non-use value to the community should be evaluated. The public value of a library can be defined as the sum of its use value and non-use value. The cornerstone principle in measuring the public value of a public good is the concept of the consumer’s WTP for the good (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961000612455820">Brent, 1995</xref>). This concept, which represents the amount people would be willing to pay to receive a specified supply of a public good, is consistent with the tenets of modern microeconomics. The work of measuring the consumer’s WTP for a public library is achieved by using the CV method that has been widely applied to assessing the public value of a public library in the literature.</p>
<p>The blue-ribbon National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Panel concluded that the CV method can produce estimates reliable enough to be the starting point for administrative and judicial determinations and presented several recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961000612455820">Arrow et al., 1993</xref>). Although the CV method has some disadvantages and problems associated with eliciting preferences for public goods (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961000612455820">Bateman and Willis, 1999</xref>), the validity and accuracy of a CV study can be enhanced if the participants are familiar with the good being valued, if professional interviewers are employed, and if other conventions suggested by the NOAA Panel are followed. As discussed below, the present study meets such conditions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0961000612455820">
<title>3.2 Sampling and survey methods</title>
<p>The data on the household WTP for the GBNLK and characteristics used in this analysis were obtained from a 2009 survey of Korean households. The study area of this research was the whole country. The total number of households in the area was 16,916,966. In order to draw a random sample of this population, sampling was conducted by a professional polling firm. The survey participants included heads of household or spouses whose ages ranged from 20 to 65. The survey included 100 interviews for the pre-test and 1000 usable interviews.</p>
<p>In terms of the regional distribution of the sample, we divided the study area into two categories, ‘on-site area’ and ‘off-site area’. For this, 40% of the sample was randomly allocated to the area surrounding the proposed library, which is the on-site area. The other 60% of the sample was assigned to the remaining area of the country and is designated as the off-site area. When a building or a facility is established, it is more likely to attract the attention of nearby residents than those who are further away. Accordingly, we adopted this method to better understand the respondents’ opinions on the proposed library.</p>
<p>The survey could have been conducted by face-to-face interviews, telephone interviews, or mail. Of these methods, we chose to use face-to-face interviews with well-trained interviewers for the CV survey because they can offer the most scope for detailed questions and answers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961000612455820">Yoo and Kwak, 2009</xref>). By doing so, we could obtain a reasonable response rate. That minimized the danger of under-representation of low valuations from non-respondents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961000612455820">Hider, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0961000612455820">
<title>3.3 Survey instrument development</title>
<p>Before the survey design, we reviewed all of the available information on public libraries and a proposed policy of building a new library. The survey instrument (questionnaire) was developed with the assistance of experts at the polling firm. Prior to the survey, we conducted a pre-test with 15 individuals to discuss their understanding of and reaction to the questions on the questionnaire.</p>
<p>Based on the pre-test, we made the questionnaire and the visual aid easier to understand. Further, we simplified the general information on the library because the participants were very familiar with public libraries. The final questionnaire reflected participants’ input as well as the advice of survey experts employed to organize the fieldwork. The survey instrument included a brief explanation of the purpose and contents of the interviews, and clarified the context of the policy decision by providing general background information on GBNLK.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0961000612455820">
<title>3.4 Questionnaire structure</title>
<p>In any CV survey, the scenario should offer the respondents information on the characteristics of the specific good being evaluated and a context that is understandable, plausible, and meaningful for the enhanced credibility of the survey and more reliable results. The survey questionnaire is composed of (1) introductory questions such as respondents’ perception after receiving general background information on the public library; (2) a question on the monthly WTP for the proposed library; and (3) questions on household characteristics.</p>
<p>Before the key WTP questions were asked, the questionnaire constructed the general situation of the contingent market by providing general background information on the proposed library. The respondents were then asked whether they had been to a public library previously and whether they had visited the National Library of Korea. The respondents were presented with substitutes for the good to be valued in this study to prevent the overestimation of the true WTP. Finally, household information included income, age, education, gender, occupation, and so on.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0961000612455820">
<title>3.5 Elicitation method</title>
<p>Following the ‘blue-ribbon CV panel’ of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961000612455820">Arrow et al. (1993)</xref>, which preferred a referendum question to an open-ended question, we used a referendum or dichotomous choice (DC) question to elicit responses. An open-ended question is not recommended because of the tendency for respondents to overstate their WTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961000612455820">Hider, 2008</xref>). The DC model has been widely used since it was popularized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961000612455820">Hanemann (1984)</xref>. Typically, a random sample of the population is asked a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ question identifying their willingness to contribute a specific amount to the preservation of some environmental resource or the provision of a public good. The DC question format is classified according to the number of questions. If it asks the respondent only one close-ended question, the question format is usually referred to as the single-bounded (SB) DC question.</p>
<p>A double-bounded (DB) question presents each respondent with a sequence of two bids. The second bid is conditional on the response to the first bid; it is lower if the first response is ‘no’ and higher if it is ‘yes’. As the additional question provides sharper bounds for the respondents’ WTP, one can expect that DB questions are more efficient than SB ones. However, several studies pointed out that there can be some bias in going from the SB to the DB format.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961000612455820">McFadden (1994)</xref> found the hypothesis that the first and second responses in the DB question are drawn from the same distribution can be rejected at the 1% level and concluded that the DB question is initially inconsistent. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961000612455820">Bateman et al. (2001)</xref> found that bound effects are significant and generate some inconsistencies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961000612455820">Cooper et al. (2002)</xref> suggested that the DB question format is problematic in that the responses to the second bid may be inconsistent with the responses to the first bid. The question format employed in present study is the SB DC question, reflecting the findings of previous research.</p>
<p>The results of the pre-test were used to refine the range of bid amounts for the DC WTP questions. The respondents were randomly assigned to six sub-groups, with each sub-sample being asked to respond to a different bid amount (in KRW). The original bids used in this study were: KRW 1000, 2000, 3000, 5000, 7000 and 10,000 (at the time of the survey, GBP 1 was approximately equal to KRW 1993.8).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0961000612455820">
<title>3.6 Payment vehicle</title>
<p>The payment vehicle used for this study was income taxes, which are likely to be familiar to most respondents. Income taxes are often used to fund the construction of public facilities such as a new library. The GBNLK is also funded at the expense of government. As taxes provide most of the Government’s revenue and income tax, which makes up most of the total tax, suits the characteristics of the survey, income tax is appropriately chosen as a payment vehicle. Considering the fact that the income tax is charged to households, it is appropriate to survey on behalf of each household. The WTP question format asked each household to pay a particular dollar amount each year for five years. In this case, each respondent had to just decide whether the value of the library to him or her was at least equal to the amount to be paid. The WTP question was as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>Would your household be willing to pay a given amount or more each year for the next five years in income tax for the establishment of the Gwangju branch of the National Library, if the success of this project is guaranteed? If the majority of people are not willing to pay for the cost of building the library, Gwangju branch of the National Library will not be constructed. If the majority of people agree to pay the costs, the library would be built in Gwangju city.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Regarding the definition of the costs that the households themselves were likely to bear, we used a provision point mechanism. Respondents were told that:
<disp-quote>
<p>The amount you indicate will tell us what it is really worth to your household to have the project implemented. If the project actually costs less than people are willing to pay, you will only pay what it would cost. If the project turns out to cost more than people are willing to pay, it will not be implemented.</p>

<title>4. A model of WTP</title>
<p>The utility difference approach in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961000612455820">Hanemann (1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961000612455820">1989</xref>) provides one method for developing Hicksian compensated measures from DC-CV data. Alternatively, the WTP-function approach to DC-CV models focused on the difference in cost functions was discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961000612455820">Cameron and James (1987)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961000612455820">Cameron (1988)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961000612455820">McConnell (1990)</xref> showed that the two approaches are complementary, which implies that the choice between the two approaches is a matter of style as much as of known defects or merits and it is not clear which approach one should take. Thus, we consider here the utility difference approach only.</p>
<p>The observed discrete choice response of each individual is assumed to reflect a utility maximization process. In addition to conventional SB DC-CV models, the spike model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961000612455820">Kriström (1997)</xref> can be introduced to deal with zero responses efficiently. In this model, we consider a spike value which is close to the observed fraction of people refusing to pay.</p>
<p>Each respondent in the sample is asked if they are going to pay a given bid. There are two types of respondents who give a ‘no’ response to a given bid: the respondents with a zero WTP value and those with a positive WTP value that is less than the bid. Thus, for those respondents providing a ‘no’ response to the first question, a follow-up question is asked to determine whether they would show a positive WTP value. In this case, there are three outcomes: (1) the answer to the first question is ‘yes’ (yes); (2) a ‘no’ to the first question followed by a ‘yes’ (no-yes); and (3) both answers are ‘no’ (no-no).</p>
<p>Given the assumption of a utility-maximizing respondent and a sample of 1000 respondents, the log-likelihood function of the SB spike model can be formed. A WTP is recognized as a random variable and a cumulative distribution function (CDF) is also considered in the log-likelihood function. Following the practice of former studies, we assumed that the WTP is distributed as a logistic on the positive axis.</p>
<p>A scale parameter is explicitly considered in the course of estimation. The scale parameter is inversely proportional to the model’s standard deviation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961000612455820">Hu, 2006</xref>). To deal with two separate datasets from a particular data source, the differences in their scales must be explicitly considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961000612455820">Adamowicz et al., 1994</xref>). In practice, it is often convenient to estimate the scale parameter as an exponent function of a pseudo scale parameter in order to ensure that the scale parameter is positive.</p>
<p>If we estimate the model with covariates, the vector of covariates is considered within the log-likelihood function. To address the influence of socio-economic variables and estimate a genuine scale parameter, we can apply the model with covariates in the course of estimating the scale parameter. By using the parameter which is estimated from the log-likelihood function, the mean WTP can be calculated. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961000612455820">Hanemann (1984)</xref> provides a formula to calculate the mean WTP. The spike which implies the ratio of zero response can be also defined from the parameters.</p>

According to the interviewers’ comments, the WTP elicitation procedure was well within the respondents’ ability. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0961000612455820">Table 2</xref> presents the distribution of responses to the valuation question, indicating the total number of those respondents who stated that they would be willing to pay for the GBNLK at each bid level, ranging from KRW 1000 to 10,000 per household per year. Note that the number of ‘yes’ responses to the first bid amount decreases, as the bid increases. For example, 94 (56%) favored the project at the yearly cost of KRW 1000, whereas only 25 (15%) approved of it at the KRW 10,000 level.</p>

<p>We estimated the model, Equation (2), by using the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation method. The scale parameter λ is estimated as 0.980 for the whole area and it is statistically significant at the 1% level. This indicates we need to consider the scale of estimations in order to compare results for the on-site and off-site areas. The coefficients of most variables in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0961000612455820">Table 4</xref> are statistically significant at the 10% level and all the estimated relationships are consistent with our expectation. Using the Wald statistic, the estimated equation is statistically significantly different from zero.</p>
<p>After the data have been appropriately scaled based on the estimated scale parameter, we determined whether the parameters of the models estimated separately for the two areas are truly the same. We used a likelihood ratio test and the null hypothesis was that the estimates for the on-site area are not different from those for the off-site area. The log-likelihood for the on-site estimation is -378.506 and that for off-site estimation is -555.851. The probability distribution of the test statistic is approximated by a chi-square distribution with one degree of freedom. Judging from the result of likelihood ratio test, they were statistically different. Thus, we should estimate the WTP for each area separately.</p>

<p>The coefficient for the bid amount is negative, as expected. That is, a higher bid makes a ‘yes’ response less likely. One can use these regression results and Equations (5) to generate an estimate of the mean WTP. The yearly mean WTP per household is calculated as KRW 3330.5 (GBP 1.7). Its <italic>t</italic>-value is computed as 7.77; thus, we can reject the hypothesis that the mean is zero at the 1% level and conclude that the mean WTP is not different from zero.</p>
<p>Further, instead of reporting only the point estimate, we constructed confidence intervals for the point estimate of the mean WTP to take uncertainty into account. For this, we used the Monte Carlo simulation technique proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961000612455820">Krinsky and Robb (1986)</xref> whereby 10,000 replications are used. This method quantifies and models the uncertainty, shows the likely range of the WTP given the uncertainties involved in doing this type of estimation, and coincides with one objective of modern policy makers, who prefer to be presented with a range of values rather than one best value. The 95% and 99% confidence intervals are presented in the lower panel of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0961000612455820">Table 5</xref>. Note that the range is wider if increased certainty is desired.</p>
<p>The results for the off-site area are also presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0961000612455820">Table 5</xref> and they were similar to those for the on-site area. The yearly mean WTP per household is calculated as KRW 3572.9 (GBP 1.8). Its <italic>t</italic>-value is computed as 9.10 and we can reject the hypothesis that the mean is zero at the 1% level and conclude that the mean WTP is different from zero.</p>

<title>5.4 Expanding from sample to population estimates of WTP</title>
<p>Once individual estimates of mean WTP are obtained, the next step is to estimate aggregate values, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961000612455820">Arrow et al. (1993)</xref> have identified as one of the important issues in the use of CV results. When expanding the sample to the population, one critical concern is the external generalization of the sample values to the population. This is dependent on the representativeness of the sample frame and the survey response rate. As described earlier, the sample frame was a random sample of households selected by a professional polling firm. The sample response rate for the face-to-face interview was almost 100% and thus, our data are likely to provide accurate figures for the social value of the proposed public library.</p>
<p>Using the mean WTP in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0961000612455820">Table 5</xref>, the estimate of monthly WTP for the typical household in the survey was about KRW 3330.5 (GBP 1.7) for the on-site area and KRW 3572.9 (GBP 1.8) for the off-site area. One can generate an estimate of the total WTP for the entire population of the study area by multiplying the estimate per household by the number of households of the study area. According to the regional governments, there were 1,768,371 households in the on-site area and 15,148,235 households in the off-site area in 2009. Multiplying these by each area’s WTP respectively and annualizing it yields a total of about KRW 60bn (GBP 30m), as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0961000612455820">Table 6</xref>.</p>

<title>6. Concluding remarks</title>
<p>Ordinary markets do not exist for public goods including public libraries. Thus, a non-market valuation technique should be employed to assess the public value of a public library. To this end, we applied a survey approach called the CV method with a specific application to GBNLK, which the Korean Government is considering building. Three important findings emerge from the study in terms of research and policy purposes.</p>
<p>First, the results indicate that the CV method is effective in assessing the public value of a public library in the same context with previous literature. This study particularly focused on the GBNLK and the CV survey was relatively successful in eliciting WTP values. The WTP amounts were statistically different from zero. A highly educated population and recently developed skills in standard survey sampling and interviewing techniques provide a sound foundation upon which the special requirements of CV studies can be imposed. The results are expected to be useful for policy makers in determining the economic feasibility of the branch. It will reduce pressures on public spending by allocating government revenue effectively. In addition, the results also indicate that the CV method is applicable to public goods reflecting public value.</p>
<p>Second, the explicit consideration of the scale parameter in the CV model to analyze different characteristics embedded in the same data source provided meaningful results. This provides a differentiated contribution to assessing the public value of a public library. The scale parameter was statistically significant and the result of LR test indicated that the characteristics of the two groups were statistically significantly different. From the results, the study has reported the necessity of estimation which is performed with separating the two groups. We derived the mean WTP per household separately for the on-site and off-site areas to reflect the characteristics of data. The monthly WTP for the on-site area was KRW 3330.5 (GBP 1.7) and that for the off-site area was KRW 3572.9 (GBP 1.8). The national value expanded to relevant residents was estimated to be KRW60bn (GBP 30m) annually for five years.</p>
<p>Third, the spike model which was used here to deal with zero WTP observations provided a good fit to the data. The spike model appears to be ideally suited for estimating WTP in our sample, since a sizable fraction of the population has a zero WTP value. All the estimated coefficients were statistically significant at the 5% level. Given the base design of DC CV surveys, the efficiency of the estimation procedure can be enhanced by increasing the sample size or by posing another question only to those respondents providing a ‘no’ response. Because of the typically high cost of increasing the sample size, asking a follow-up question appears to be the less expensive alternative. This suggests that the spike model is a practical method for addressing DC-CV data with zero observations.</p>
