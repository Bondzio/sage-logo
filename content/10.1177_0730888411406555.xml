<abstract>
<p>Recent attention has been given to the supportive relationships that may develop among coworkers, and researchers have produced evidence that coworker support can be beneficial for worker well-being. However, studies that have examined the role of social support at work in protecting workers from the detrimental effects of a poor work environment have reported mixed results. The effects of coworker support appear to depend on the type of stressor experienced. This research focuses on stress from exposure to mistreatment by others. This type of stress may be particularly harmful for interactive service workers as they must negotiate interactions with others of various statuses in the workplace. Drawing on data from a large survey of workers, the ability of perceived coworker support to help protect workers from the negative effects of mistreatment by supervisors, customers, and coworkers is examined. The results offer some support for the stress-buffering hypothesis. Although being treated unfairly by others in the workplace is associated with low levels of job satisfaction and high levels of psychological distress, workers who report supportive coworker relationships appear to be protected from some of the negative effects of mistreatment.</p>

<p>The comments above, freely offered by respondents to a survey about work, illustrate the great impact that coworkers can have on the lives of individuals. Supportive relationships with others in the workplace can help create a meaningful experience for workers whereas negative relations with others can make work life miserable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0730888411406555">Chamberlain &amp; Hodson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0730888411406555">Frone, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0730888411406555">Hodson, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0730888411406555">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0730888411406555">Rumens, 2010</xref>). Indeed, workers who experience mistreatment at work may suffer significant consequences such as psychological distress, job dissatisfaction, and problems with substance abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0730888411406555">Frone, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0730888411406555">Martin, Tuch, &amp; Roman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0730888411406555">Pavalko, Mossakowski, &amp; Hamilton, 2003</xref>). Workers in interactive service occupations in which they must navigate the “service triangle,” or the complex power relations between themselves, managers and customers or clients, may be at an increased risk of experiencing negative interactions with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0730888411406555">Chamberlain &amp; Hodson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0730888411406555">Sloan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0730888411406555">Spencer &amp; Rupp, 2009</xref>). Thus, the impact of supportive coworkers may be particularly important for workers in a service work environment.</p>
<p>With a majority of U.S. workers now employed in service sector occupations, much of the recent research in the sociology of work has focused on service work and has identified important issues such as the unique experiences of workers in service positions, the experience and expression of emotions in the worker–customer relationship, the structure of control and the complexity associated with work within the service triangle, and the role of gender in service work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0730888411406555">BLS, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0730888411406555">Bolton &amp; Houlihan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0730888411406555">Brown &amp; Korczynski, 2010</xref>; Knudsen, &amp; Roman, 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0730888411406555">Leidner, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0730888411406555">McCammon &amp; Griffin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0730888411406555">Lopez, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0730888411406555">Troyer, Mueller, &amp; Osinsky, 2000</xref>). Yet, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0730888411406555">Lopez (2010)</xref> notes in a review of the sociology of service work literature, “the worker-customer relationship has to some extent been conceived too narrowly, as a dyad, with coworkers receding into the analytical background. . . .” (p. 263). In the service work environment, coworkers can be both a source of stress and a source of support. Although recent research has called attention to the importance of relationships among coworkers for worker well-being and job attitudes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0730888411406555">Chamberlain &amp; Hodson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0730888411406555">Hodson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0730888411406555">Lively, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0730888411406555">McGuire, 2007</xref>), the influence of coworker support on a worker’s ability to deal with the effects of unfair actions of others in the service triangle has yet to be examined using quantitative survey data.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0730888411406555">1</xref></sup> Can supportive relationships with coworkers buffer the negative effects of being treated badly by others in the workplace? According to the stress-buffering hypothesis, social support provided by coworkers may help prevent some of the negative effects of poor treatment at work. This research utilizes data from a large survey of state employees working in a variety of occupations to examine whether social support provided by coworkers can lessen the negative effects of exposure to unfair treatment from multiple sources—supervisors, customers, and coworkers.</p>

<title>The Influence of Others in the Workplace</title>
<p>Interactions with others in the workplace greatly influence worker well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0730888411406555">Bolger, DeLongis, Kessler, &amp; Schilling, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0730888411406555">Cortina, Magley, Williams, &amp; Langhout, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0730888411406555">Frone 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0730888411406555">Spector &amp; Jex, 1998</xref>). The significant impact of interpersonal relations is highlighted in recent research that identifies interpersonal conflict in the workplace as a characteristic of “toxic” work environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0730888411406555">Chamberlain &amp; Hodson, 2010</xref>). Severe cases of negative workplace interactions may take the form of workplace bullying, abuse, or harassment, and consequences of such poor treatment range from psychological distress to physical illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0730888411406555">Hodson, Roscigno, &amp; Lopez, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0730888411406555">Martin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0730888411406555">Pavalko et al., 2003</xref>). The growing body of literature on incivility, abuse, and bullying in the workplace suggests that unfair treatment by others is a real problem for workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0730888411406555">Andersson &amp; Pearson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0730888411406555">Cortina et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0730888411406555">Hodson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0730888411406555">Johnson, &amp; Indvik, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0730888411406555">Martin et al., 2003</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0730888411406555">2</xref></sup> Such experiences are very stressful and negatively affect worker well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0730888411406555">Cortina et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0730888411406555">Frone, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0730888411406555">Menaghan &amp; Merves, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0730888411406555">Pavalko et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0730888411406555">Spector &amp; Jex, 1998</xref>). In addition, the effects of interpersonal conflict in the workplace often spill over into a worker’s personal life, straining relationships with family and friends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0730888411406555">Bolger et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0730888411406555">Menaghan, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>The nature of service work may heighten the risk of experiencing mistreatment. Service workers often need to negotiate interactions between customers or clients, their supervisor(s), and other coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0730888411406555">Bolton &amp; Houlihan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0730888411406555">Leidner, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0730888411406555">Troyer et al., 2000</xref>). The multiple interactions service workers often have with others exposes the workers to various sources of potential mistreatment. Furthermore, workers holding little power in the workplace, which is the case for many lower-end service workers, may be particularly vulnerable to poor treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0730888411406555">Hodson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0730888411406555">Lively, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0730888411406555">Sloan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0730888411406555">Tuckey, Dollard, Hosking, &amp; Winefield, 2009</xref>; except see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0730888411406555">Schieman &amp; Reid, 2008</xref>).

<title>The Role of Coworker Support</title>
<p>One way to cope with stress experienced from mistreatment is to turn to coworkers for help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0730888411406555">Chamberlain &amp; Hodson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0730888411406555">Korczynski, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0730888411406555">Lively 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0730888411406555">McGuire, 2007</xref>). Although the treatment of workers in service roles by customers and supervisors has been given much attention in the literature, the role that coworkers play within a context of poor treatment by others in the service triangle remains unclear (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0730888411406555">Lopez, 2010</xref>). Because similar others provide the most effective social support in stressful circumstances, support provided by coworkers has the potential to be particularly beneficial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0730888411406555">La Rocco, House, &amp; French, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0730888411406555">Lively, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0730888411406555">Thoits, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0730888411406555">1990</xref>). Indeed, a recent investigation suggests that coworkers readily provide each other various types of support including the simple sharing of personal information and more emotionally intense forms of support such as providing counseling in response to a coworker’s personal troubles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0730888411406555">McGuire, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, there is evidence for a direct, positive effect of coworker support on worker well-being. In general, perceived coworker support is associated with increased job satisfaction and psychological well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0730888411406555">Ducharme &amp; Martin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0730888411406555">Hulbert, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0730888411406555">Hodson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0730888411406555">Loscocco &amp; Spitze, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0730888411406555">McCann, Russo, &amp; Benjamin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0730888411406555">Pugliesi, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0730888411406555">Turner &amp; Marino, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Although coworker support appears to be generally beneficial for workers, it is less clear whether support can protect workers from the consequences of being mistreated by others at work. The stress-buffering hypothesis suggests that, compared to persons with poor social support systems, persons who feel socially supported can cope more effectively in response to stressful situations. In other words, social support should moderate the negative effects of stress on well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0730888411406555">Cassel, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0730888411406555">Cobb, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0730888411406555">Cohen &amp; Wills 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0730888411406555">House, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0730888411406555">Thoits, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0730888411406555">Turner, 1983</xref>). Thus, the experience of stress from being treated badly by others may be less consequential for workers who have supportive coworkers compared to those who feel unsupported.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0730888411406555">4</xref></sup> Although the stress- buffering hypothesis has received support in the mental health literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0730888411406555">Cohen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0730888411406555">House, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0730888411406555">House, Umberson, &amp; Landis, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0730888411406555">Turner, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0730888411406555">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0730888411406555">Thoits, 1995</xref>), investigations of the buffering capabilities of <italic>coworker</italic> support have produced mixed results. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0730888411406555">Ducharme and Martin (2000)</xref> found a main effect of coworker support on job satisfaction but did not find a buffering effect of support on the relationship between negative job characteristics (e.g., demanding work, low income, low autonomy) and job satisfaction (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0730888411406555">Loscocco &amp; Spitze, 1990</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0730888411406555">Chamberlain and Hodson (2010)</xref> found that coworker solidarity may actually exacerbate negative job conditions. However, other researchers have found evidence of buffering in the relationships among stress, coworker support, and psychological well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0730888411406555">Haines, Hurlbert, &amp; Zimmer, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0730888411406555">House, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0730888411406555">La Rocco et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0730888411406555">Roxburgh, 2004</xref>). Still others have identified buffering effects of coworker support on the relationships between job strain and job satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0730888411406555">Schmeider &amp; Smith 1996</xref>) and emotional dissonance and job satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0730888411406555">Abraham, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>One message from the previous research on coworker support is that its effects vary depending on the type of support offered and the type of stress measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0730888411406555">Deelstra, Peeters, Schaufeli, Strobe, Zijlstra, &amp; van Doornen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0730888411406555">Ganster, Fusilier, &amp; Mayes, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0730888411406555">Haines et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0730888411406555">House, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0730888411406555">Thoits, 1995</xref>). In much of the literature on the stress-buffering properties of coworker support, the stressors examined were related to undesirable job characteristics (e.g., low autonomy) rather than due to negative interpersonal relations (Ducharme &amp; Martin, 2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0730888411406555">Haines et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0730888411406555">Loscocco &amp; Spitze, 1990</xref>). To my knowledge, the relationships among mistreatment in the workplace, coworker support, and psychological outcomes have yet to be examined. Due to the importance of dealing with other people in their work, mistreatment is particularly relevant for interactive service workers.</p>

Extensive interaction with others on the job has been linked to consequences such as psychological distress, emotional burnout, and turnover intensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0730888411406555">Bakker, vanEmmerik, &amp; Euwema, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0730888411406555">Ducharme, Knudesn &amp; Roman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0730888411406555">Erickson &amp; Ritter, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0730888411406555">Hochschild, 1983</xref>); however, researchers have also illustrated ways in which workers benefit from positive service interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0730888411406555">Bolton &amp; Boyd, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0730888411406555">Bolton &amp; Houlihan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0730888411406555">Brown &amp; Korczynski, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0730888411406555">Erickson &amp; Wharton 1997</xref>). The literature highlights the complexity associated with work that involves relations among groups of varying power—customers, managers, and workers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0730888411406555">Bolton &amp; Houlihan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0730888411406555">Leidner, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0730888411406555">McCammon &amp; Griffin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0730888411406555">Troyer, Mueller, &amp; Osinsky, 2000</xref>). Although the main effect of coworker support on worker well-being has been fairly well established in the literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0730888411406555">Bakker et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0730888411406555">Ducharme &amp; Martin 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0730888411406555">McCann et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0730888411406555">Turner &amp; Marino, 1994</xref>), it is uncertain whether support from coworkers can benefit workers in the context of negative experiences with others in service work. Examining the buffering effects of coworker support may allow us to specify when support from coworkers is most helpful and may contribute our understanding of workers’ positive experiences in interactive service work.</p>
<p>This research specifically examines whether coworker support serves a moderating function in the relationship between the experience of unfair treatment in the workplace by supervisors, customers, and coworkers and the outcomes of job satisfaction and psychological distress. Based on the previous research discussed above, the analyses are guided by three main hypotheses. First, given the great impact that working conditions can have on individuals and the centrality of interpersonal relations to service work, I expect that perceptions of unfair treatment from others—supervisors, customers, and coworkers—will negatively affect workers. Although there are multiple ways to assess worker well-being, job satisfaction and psychological distress have been the outcomes most commonly examined in studies of coworker support; as such, they are the key dependent variables examined in this study. In addition, because the main effect of coworker support on worker well-being and job attitudes has been well-documented, I expect that having supportive coworkers will be linked to lower psychological distress and greater job satisfaction. Finally, in accordance with the stress-buffering hypothesis, I expect that perceived support from coworkers will lessen the negative effects of being treated unfairly by others at work.</p>

<p>Pervious research has not examined coworker support in the context of unfair interactions with others of varying power in the workplace (except, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0730888411406555">Chamberlain &amp; Hodson, 2010</xref> on supervisory conflict), thus my general hypotheses do not vary by source of the stress. However, social support may be particularly helpful to workers who experience unfair treatment by their supervisors because the worker’s lower status relative to that of the supervisor may make it difficult for workers to address their feelings by confronting the supervisor directly (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0730888411406555">Lively &amp; Powell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0730888411406555">Sloan, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, turning to others for emotional support as a means of coping may be a likely recourse for workers when they perceive their source of stress as uncontrollable, which may be the case for workers subject to unfair treatment from their supervisor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0730888411406555">Thoits, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0730888411406555">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0730888411406555">Folkman, 1984</xref>). Because interpersonal relations with multiple groups of others of varying power in the workplace are central to service work, this research examines whether the effect of coworker support varies by the source of mistreatment.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>In 2004, I distributed a 10-page anonymous mail survey to a simple random sample of 2,500 state employees from one state in the southern United States. I followed Dillman’s (2000) Tailored Design Method for the survey implementation and made up to three follow-up contacts with potential respondents in an effort to maximize participation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0730888411406555">5</xref></sup> The response rate for the survey was 62% (<italic>n</italic> = 1,550). Fifty nine percent of the sample is women, 26% reported a non-White race or ethnicity, and the average age of the respondents is 47 years. On average, respondents had attended some college and were earning between US$20,000 and 30,000 annually. The analyses presented here include 1,395 respondents with full data on all measures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0730888411406555">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The population sampled included over 37,000 individuals working in more than 1,400 positions for the state. All employees were “career service” workers and had worked in their position with the state for at least 6 months. Career service jobs are all positions within the state in which the workers do not serve the governor directly. This classification includes positions ranging from those requiring no formal education and no experience to jobs requiring graduate or professional training. I selected the sample for the opportunity to survey workers in a broad range of occupations, with many different working experiences. (Please see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0730888411406555">appendix</xref> for a list of occupational areas included in the career service classification.) However, it should be noted that the analyses presented in this article are limited to the experiences of public service workers. Research suggests that public service workers experience many of the same interpersonal demands and conflicts as private sector service workers including expectations of performing emotional labor to provide quality customer or client service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0730888411406555">Houston, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0730888411406555">Jin &amp; Guy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0730888411406555">Mastracci, Newman, &amp; Guy, 2006</xref>). In addition, a recent study revealed that although rates of severe unfair treatment in the form of discrimination may be similar across sectors, public sector workers may experience higher levels of promotion-related discrimination due to biased evaluations of “soft skills” required for job performance whereas private sector workers are more frequently subject to firing discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0730888411406555">Byron, 2010</xref>). Although the reasons behind the experience of unfair treatment may influence the impact of coworker support, the current data do not allow for specific comparisons. Future research should consider the influence of coworker support in samples of workers in both public and private sector service occupations.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section6-0730888411406555">
<title>Coworker support</title>
<p>Social support may take different forms, and researchers have measured support in various ways ranging from the density of social networks and the strength of kinship ties to the perceived availability of support to the actual usage of social support (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0730888411406555">Cohen &amp; Wills, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0730888411406555">Ducharme &amp; Martin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0730888411406555">Hulbert, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0730888411406555">Lepore, Silver, Wortman, &amp; Wayment, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0730888411406555">Pearlin, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0730888411406555">Song &amp; Lin, 2009</xref>). Although there are many types of social support, one distinction common in the literature on coworker support is between expressive (e.g., providing the individual with emotional reassurance) and instrumental (e.g., providing the individual with material assistance) support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0730888411406555">Deelstra, et al., 2003</xref>; Ducharme &amp; Martin, 2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0730888411406555">House, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0730888411406555">McGuire, 2007</xref>). The greatest amount of evidence for the stress-buffering properties of social support comes from research on expressive, emotional forms of support—support aimed to make the individual feel validated and comforted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0730888411406555">Kessler, Price, &amp; Wortman, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0730888411406555">Thoits, 1995</xref>). Therefore, the measure utilized in the analysis below assesses perceived expressive or emotional support.</p>
<p>Perceived coworker support is measured by the sum of responses to the following three statements: “I feel that I can talk to my coworkers about personal difficulties,” “My coworkers do not take a personal interest in me” (reversed), and “When things get tough, there are people at work that I can turn to for help.” Each item was rated on a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>), such that a higher score on the measure indicates greater perceptions of coworker support (Cronbach’s alpha = .80).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0730888411406555">7</xref></sup> This measure is similar to measures of perceived expressive support utilized in previous research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0730888411406555">Ducharme &amp; Martin 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0730888411406555">Ganster et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0730888411406555">Turner &amp; Marino, 1994</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0730888411406555">Thoits (1995</xref>, p. 64) noted that “the simplest and most powerful measure of social support appears to be whether a person has an intimate, confiding relationship or not . . .,” and the measure utilized here assesses the extent to which workers believe this to be true in the workplace. The coworker support measure does not capture the actual usage of support or whether workers seek support for work-related problems; however, as noted above, the <italic>perception</italic> that support is available is what matters most for individual well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0730888411406555">Cohen &amp; Wills, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0730888411406555">Kessler et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0730888411406555">Thoits, 1995</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0730888411406555">
<title>Unfair treatment</title>
<p>Respondents were asked how often they feel they are treated unfairly at work by supervisors, customers or clients, and coworkers, each rated separately. Responses ranged from 1 (<italic>never</italic>) to 5 (<italic>always</italic>). Higher scores on each item indicate greater perceived mistreatment from the source in question. Respondents were given an option to indicate that they did not work with supervisors, customers, or coworkers. Fifteen respondents who indicated that they did not have a supervisor were excluded from the analyses of supervisor treatment whereas 188 respondents who did not work with customers were excluded from the customer treatment analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0730888411406555">
<title>Job satisfaction</title>
<p>The measure of job satisfaction is composed of the sum of answers to the following four statements: “Given the chance, I would change my present type of work for something different (reversed),” “I am proud of the type of work I do,” “My work gives me a chance to do the things I enjoy,” and “In general, I am satisfied with my job” (alpha = .84). Responses to each statement ranged from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>) such that a high score on this measure indicates a high level of job satisfaction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0730888411406555">
<title>Psychological distress</title>
<p>Psychological distress is measured with the mean of respondents’ scores on a series of questions about emotions. Respondents were asked to indicate on how many days in the past week they experienced each of the following symptoms of anxiety and depression: felt that she or he couldn’t shake the blues, sad, lonely, happy (reversed), calm (reversed), fearful, worried, anxious, and restless symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0730888411406555">Mirowsky &amp; Ross, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0730888411406555">Thoits, 2002</xref>). Answers to each item range from 0 days to 7 days, with a higher score representing greater psychological distress (alpha = .77).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0730888411406555">
<title>Control variables</title>
<p>Several variables that have been associated with coworker support, job satisfaction, and psychological distress are included in all models as control variables. Job characteristics were measured with a series of items that asked respondents to indicate how much they agree or disagree with statements about the work they do. Participants responded to each statement using a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>). The substantive complexity of work is assessed by the sum of responses to the following three items: “There is a lot of variety in the kinds of things I do at work,” “My job requires that I do the same things over and over” (reversed), and “I keep learning new things in my job” (alpha = .66). Worker autonomy, or the amount of control a worker has over her work, is measured by the sum of ratings on three statements: “My job allows me to make a lot of decisions on my own,” “My supervisor decides how my work tasks should be done” (reversed), and “I have flexibility in my work to decide when to do different tasks” (alpha = .63). Job demands are assessed with responses to the statement, “My job involves too much work to do everything well.” In addition, the pay grade of the respondent’s job was included as a control. The pay-grade scale, which was obtained from the state’s job classification database and coded onto each respondent’s self-reported job title, ranges from 4 to 41, with a higher pay grade indicating greater income.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0730888411406555">8</xref></sup> Each of the above job characteristics, with the exception of job demands, has been positively associated with coworker support and job satisfaction and is negatively related to psychological distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0730888411406555">Ducharme &amp; Martin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0730888411406555">Kohn &amp; Schooler, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0730888411406555">Miller, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0730888411406555">Roxburgh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0730888411406555">Schieman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0730888411406555">Yoon &amp; Thye, 2002</xref>). Job demands have been shown to decrease worker well-being (e.g., Ducharme &amp; Martin, 2001). Also, because workers may receive support in more formal ways through employee organizations, and union status may be related to workers’ experiences of mistreatment in the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0730888411406555">Balser, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0730888411406555">House, 1981</xref>), a control for whether or not a respondent is a member of the state’s employee association (0 = <italic>no</italic>, 1 = <italic>yes</italic>) is included. Thirty eight percent of respondents are members of the employee association. Finally, all models include demographic controls that have been shown to influence perceptions of social support and worker well-being: gender (0 = <italic>women</italic>, 1 = <italic>men</italic>), race (0 = <italic>non-White</italic>, 1 = <italic>White</italic>), age (in years), and education (measured ordinally; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0730888411406555">Bolger et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0730888411406555">Dickerson, Schur, Kruse, &amp; Blasi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0730888411406555">Kalleberg &amp; Loscocco, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0730888411406555">Kessler, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0730888411406555">Mottaz, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0730888411406555">Pugliesi, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0730888411406555">Roxburgh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0730888411406555">Wright &amp; Hamilton, 1979</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0730888411406555">9</xref></sup> A summary of the demographic composition of the sample and a description of the key variables are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0730888411406555">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Because the data utilized in this study are cross-sectional, the causal direction of the relationships examined cannot be confirmed. Although it is likely that decreased worker well-being would result from unfair treatment, and increased worker well-being would result from having supportive coworkers, panel data are necessary to verify the directionality of these relationships (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0730888411406555">Thoits, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0730888411406555">2006</xref>). However, there is some longitudinal evidence for the negative effects of mistreatment in the workplace on worker health and for the impact of job characteristics on psychological well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0730888411406555">Kohn &amp; Schooler, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0730888411406555">Pavalko et al., 2003</xref>). The interpretation of the analyses presented below is based on the assumption that unfair treatment and perceptions of coworker support precede the outcomes of job satisfaction and psychological distress. The stress-buffering hypothesis is tested using a series of ordinary least squares regression models.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>First, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0730888411406555">Table 2</xref>, many of the expected bivariate associations are statistically significant. Perceptions of unfair treatment at work, by supervisors, customers, and coworkers are negatively correlated with job satisfaction and positively associated with psychological distress. Consistent with previous research, coworker support is associated with greater worker well-being. Also, the job characteristic variables—autonomy, complexity, and demands—are correlated with job satisfaction and psychological distress in the expected directions. Worker autonomy and task complexity were also positively associated with coworker support, similar to findings of previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0730888411406555">Scheiman, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Job Satisfaction</title>
<p>The OLS regressions of job satisfaction on unfair treatment by a supervisor, by customers, or by coworkers,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0730888411406555">10</xref></sup> coworker support, and control variables are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0730888411406555">Table 3</xref>. The demographic and job characteristic variables are first included in Model 1, then perceived unfair treatment by supervisors, customers, and coworkers are added in Models 2, 3, and 4, respectively. As shown, each measure of unfair treatment is negatively associated with job satisfaction. Net of the demographic controls and job characteristics, the greater the level of perceived unfair treatment, the less satisfied the worker is with his or her job (<italic>b</italic> = −.643 for supervisors, <italic>b</italic> = −.329 for customers, and <italic>b</italic> = −.400 for coworkers). In Models 5, 6, and 7, the support measures, employee association membership, and coworker support are included. Although being a member of the employee association is unrelated to job satisfaction, coworker support is a significant predictor of job satisfaction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0730888411406555">11</xref></sup> Models 5 through 7 show positive main effects of support on job satisfaction.</p>

<p>To test the buffering hypothesis, the multiplicative interactions between perceived unfair treatment and coworker support are added in Models 8, 9, and 10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0730888411406555">Cohen &amp; Cohen, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0730888411406555">Jaccard &amp; Turrisi, 2003</xref>). As predicted by the hypothesis, Model 8 shows a significant and positive interaction coefficient and significant <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> change from the main effects model. Furthermore, Model 8 explains almost 46% of the variance in job satisfaction. Social support is particularly beneficial for workers who are treated unfairly by their supervisors. The moderating effect of social support on the relationship between perceived unfair treatment by supervisors and job satisfaction is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0730888411406555">Figure 1</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0730888411406555">Figure 1</xref>, workers who report a great amount of unfair treatment from their supervisors and who have limited support from coworkers report low levels of job satisfaction. By comparison, workers treated unfairly by supervisors and who perceive extensive support from coworkers report job satisfaction levels closer to those of workers who are not mistreated. Furthermore, among workers with low levels of coworker support, the difference in job satisfaction at low levels of unfair treatment and at high levels of unfair treatment is 2.75 points on the job satisfaction scale. In comparison, among workers high in perceived coworker support, the difference in job satisfaction between workers at low levels of unfair treatment and high levels of unfair treatment is 1.4 points. Thus, as suggested by the buffering hypothesis, the relationship between unfair treatment and job satisfaction depends on a worker’s level of perceived coworker support. However, coworker support does not have the same effect on the experience of unfair treatment from customers or coworkers—the interaction terms in Models 9 and 10 are not statistically significant.</p>

<p>Among the job characteristic variables, as expected, job complexity and worker autonomy predict greater job satisfaction, and job demands are negatively associated with satisfaction. These effects remain relatively consistent across all models. Of the control variables, neither gender nor level of education significantly affects job satisfaction. However, White workers report higher satisfaction than non-White workers and older workers tend to be more satisfied than younger workers. The effect of age is consistent with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0730888411406555">Kalleberg &amp; Loscocco, 1983</xref>).</p>

<title>Psychological Distress</title>
<p>The effects of the job characteristics are similar in the regression of psychological distress (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0730888411406555">Table 4</xref>). Greater autonomy and greater complexity correspond to lower levels of psychological distress whereas job demands predict higher levels of distress. As in the regression of job satisfaction, net of job characteristics and demographic controls, perceptions of unfair treatment by others predict increased psychological distress (<italic>b</italic> = .288 for supervisors, <italic>b</italic> = .163 for customers, and <italic>b</italic> = 331 for coworkers). Likewise, there is a significant main effect of coworker support on psychological distress. In Models 8, 9, and 10, the multiplicative interaction terms are added, and again, the interaction between coworker support and unfair treatment by a supervisor is statistically significant.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0730888411406555">12</xref></sup> The negative coefficient indicates that coworker support moderates the relationship between perceived unfair treatment by a supervisor and psychological distress, such that workers high in perceived coworker support experience some protection from the negative effects of unfair treatment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0730888411406555">Figure 2</xref>). Model 8 explains approximately 17% of the variance in psychological distress.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0730888411406555">13</xref></sup> In Models 9 and 10, the interaction terms are not statistically significant.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The analyses reported above examined the impact of unfair treatment and coworker support on worker well-being and tested the ability of coworker support to protect workers from the negative effects of being treated badly at work. The perception of being treated unfairly from each source examined—supervisors, customers, and coworkers—predicted lowered job satisfaction and increased psychological distress. Consistent with the stress-buffering hypothesis, coworker support significantly moderated the negative relationship between unfair treatment by a supervisor and job satisfaction and the positive relationship between unfair treatment by a supervisor and psychological distress. In each model, although perceptions of unfair treatment by a supervisor decreased worker well-being, workers with supportive coworkers were much less affected than workers who believed their coworkers were unsupportive. Furthermore, these relationships exist net of job characteristics and demographic factors. This finding suggests that workers who feel subjected to unfair treatment by their supervisors substantially benefit from having supportive coworkers. However, the effect of unfair treatment by customers or by coworkers does not depend on the worker’s level of perceived coworker support. Regardless of how supportive a worker’s coworkers are, experiencing unfair treatment by customers or coworkers significantly decreases the worker’s well-being. This finding illustrates the great impact that mistreatment by others—supervisors, customers, and coworkers—in the context of service work can have on worker well-being.</p>
<p>It may be the case that the <italic>type</italic> of support examined in this study—whether coworkers are available to help in difficult times—is beneficial for workers who experience unfair treatment by their supervisor but is not helpful for workers who are treated unfairly by customers or by other workers. There are many possible reasons for this difference. First, workers may be unwilling to discuss poor treatment by some coworkers with other coworkers. Workers may feel uncomfortable disclosing problems with their peers or they may not want to worsen the situation by involving additional workers in the conflict. In contrast, coworkers may be ideal sources of support for coping with mistreatment from a supervisor because they may work under the same supervisor and may share experiences of poor treatment. In such cases, coworkers should have a unique ability to empathize with one another and provide each other with a reliable source of comfort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0730888411406555">Hodson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0730888411406555">Lively, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0730888411406555">Marks, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0730888411406555">Thoits, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0730888411406555">1990</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, discussing problems with coworkers may aid a worker’s coping efforts in response to supervisor mistreatment because the mistreatment may be seen as unchangeable. Research suggests that emotion-focused coping (e.g., receiving comfort from coworkers) as opposed to other types of coping such as problem-focused coping (e.g., altering the situation), is most beneficial in uncontrollable circumstances (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0730888411406555">Thoits, 1995</xref>). Although workers may need to report to their supervisor, they may be able to avoid interactions with troublesome coworkers or terminate their association with disrespectful customers. Managing stress caused by unfair customers in ways that enable workers to move on and not dwell on the experience may be more helpful than turning to coworkers for support.</p>
<p>Also, it is possible that supervisors may actually serve as a source of support for workers who are mistreated by customers or other workers. For example, although workers may feel unable to confront a supervisor directly regarding his or her unfair treatment, they may report unfair treatment by customers or coworkers to a supervisor. Supervisors may be able to provide workers with instrumental support (e.g., intercepting the customer–worker interaction or disciplining the coworker) that may alleviate the stress for the worker. Although I am unable to determine the reason for the different effects of coworker support based on the source of stress, future research efforts may be directed at identifying the types of support that are most effective in dealing with difficult customers and poor treatment by coworkers. Furthermore, the quantitative data used in this study allowed for a test of the buffering hypothesis; however, they do not allow for a more detailed examination of the types of support sought by workers exposed to mistreatment. A multimethod approach, combining quantitative and qualitative techniques, would be most informative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0730888411406555">Lively, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Future researchers may also be interested in studying the consequences of different forms of mistreatment at work. The measure of unfair treatment utilized in this study was a broad measure meant to capture various types of mistreatment. Focusing on more specific forms of poor treatment by others in the workplace would allow researchers to assess whether the benefits of coworker support depend on more specific actions of others. For example, does coworker support benefit workers who experience discrimination at work to the same extent it benefits workers who are forced to work undesirable shifts?</p>
<p>Finally, this research also reaffirms the importance of job characteristics for worker well-being (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0730888411406555">Karasek, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0730888411406555">Kohn &amp; Schooler, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0730888411406555">Link, Lenon, &amp; Dohrenwend, 1993</xref>). Although excessive demands were associated with decreased worker well-being, job autonomy and complexity of work predicted higher job satisfaction and less psychological distress. Pay grade, however, was unrelated to job satisfaction and psychological distress when the other job characteristics and demographic variables were taken into account (also, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0730888411406555">Yoon &amp; Thye, 2002</xref>). Nevertheless, taken together these findings illustrate that having a desirable job does not compensate for the negative impact on workers of being treated badly at work. Controlling for the job characteristics most commonly associated with worker well-being, unfair treatment by others at work substantially compromises worker well-being.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Using survey data from a large sample of workers, I examined the relationships among unfair treatment by a supervisor, by customers, and by coworkers, coworker support, and worker well-being. As evidenced by the association between unfair treatment at work and worker well-being, here indicated by job satisfaction and psychological distress, being treated unfairly by others in the workplace is a stressful experience for workers. Given the significance of interpersonal relations in service work, mistreatment by others may be particularly harmful to workers in service positions. Furthermore, the analyses reported here also demonstrate that the treatment workers receive from other coworkers can greatly impact their well-being and job satisfaction. Thus, it is important to identify the ways in which the impact of stress from mistreatment by others can be mitigated or, ultimately, eliminated. Interacting with others in service relationships or encounters is a key feature in a majority of the jobs in the United States today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0730888411406555">BLS, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0730888411406555">Lopez, 2010</xref>). Specifying the moderators of the relationship between exposure to various sources of stress and worker well-being may help provide more satisfying work experiences for workers in interactive service positions.</p>
<p>Within the sociology of mental health and illness literature, stress process models suggest that social support can buffer the negative effects of stress on well-being (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0730888411406555">House, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0730888411406555">Thoits, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0730888411406555">Turner 1983</xref>). In the service work environment, coworkers may be a beneficial source of support for workers. As they share many similar experiences, workers may be increasingly likely to turn to coworkers for help managing their stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0730888411406555">Lively, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0730888411406555">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0730888411406555">Marks, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0730888411406555">McGuire, 2007</xref>). In the context of unfair treatment by others, coworkers have a unique ability to empathize with each other and this support may help protect workers from the consequences of poor treatment. Although the results of this study suggest that coworker support is generally beneficial for service workers, evidence for a buffering effect of support was only found for stress associated with unfair treatment by a supervisor. Whereas unfair treatment by a supervisor can result in psychological distress and compromise job satisfaction, this relationship is greatly diminished among workers who believe they have supportive coworkers.</p>
<p>However, although coworker support helps to protect workers from the consequences of negative treatment by their superiors, this finding should not lead us to underestimate the negative impact that unfair treatment has on workers, particularly on workers without supportive coworkers. Unfair treatment, especially by a supervisor, greatly detracts from a worker’s job satisfaction and is associated with psychological stress. Furthermore, unfair treatment in the workplace was quite common among the respondents, with 41% of workers reporting that they experience unfair treatment by their supervisor at least sometimes. Although coworker support benefits workers, it may also enable supervisors to continue to mistreat their subordinates with little repercussion (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0730888411406555">Lively, 2000</xref>). Thus, in addition to studying the ways in which coworkers help each other deal with stressors experienced in the workplace, future research efforts should ultimately be directed toward preventing the occurrence of unfair treatment.</p>

<p>To my knowledge, the first quantitative examination of the buffering effects of coworker support in response to the negative behavior of others is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0730888411406555">Chamberlain and Hodson’s (2010)</xref> analysis of workplace ethnographies in which they examine the buffering effects of coworker support on the relationship between supervisory conflict—which included contentious interactions with supervisors, contentious interactions with management, supervisory abuse, leadership, and communication measures—and job satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Unfair” treatment is meant to capture many types of mistreatment by others. Although many different actions may be considered forms of mistreatment, to be treated unfairly likely causes a worker to feel mistreated.</p>

<p>However, it should be noted that customers are not always in positions of greater power relative to service workers. For instance, the bill collectors in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0730888411406555">Hochschild’s (1983)</xref> research claimed a higher status position relative to the debtors (also, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0730888411406555">Bolton &amp; Houlihan, 2005</xref>). However, in many cases, low-end service jobs offer workers very little interactional power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0730888411406555">Hodson et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<p>Although it is possible that coworkers (as well as supervisors and customers) may be both source of stress and source of support, this research examines whether the perception of generally supportive coworkers can offset the negative effects of stressful relations with others. For example, a worker may be treated badly by one coworker but may turn to others for support in coping with the negative experience.</p>

<p>To the sampling frame of all career service state employees was provided by director of research for the state. The survey and implementation procedures were approved by the state’s research review committee. The survey was made anonymous by the use of identification numbers and response cards. In an initial contact letter to respondents, they were given the option to decline participation. If a respondent indicated he or she did not wish to participate in the study, no future contacts were made with that person.</p>

<p>An analysis of nonresponse by gender and region of the state did not reveal response biases. The sampling frame used in this study did not rank potential respondents by job or department status and thus I was unable to include those variables in the nonresponse analysis. In addition, a series of <italic>t</italic> tests comparing my sample to the characteristics of state residents according to the 2000 U.S. Census revealed that my sample contained significantly more non-Whites, women, and married individuals than the state as a whole.</p>

<p>Although it has been suggested that measures of negative affectivity be included in analyses of job stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0730888411406555">Brief, Burke, George, Robinson, &amp; Webster, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0730888411406555">Ducharme &amp; Martin, 2000</xref>), the data utilized in this study do not contain this measure, and analyses of personality characteristics are beyond the scope of this study. However, the analyses presented here were repeated with the inclusion of a measure of negative mood, and this variable had no effect on the results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0730888411406555">Brief et al., 1988</xref>).</p>

<p>Tests did not indicate multicollinearity of unfair treatment by coworkers and coworker support (VIF = 2.6). Although it may be expected that workers who are treated unfairly by coworkers would report low levels of coworker support, the magnitude of the bivariate correlation between unfair treatment by coworkers and support is weak (<italic>r</italic> = −.290). Thus, it is possible that workers may be treated unfairly by some coworkers and feel supported by others.</p>

<p>In addition to the analyses presented here, negative binomial regression models were used to predict individual items from the psychological distress measure as count variables. Statistically significant interaction effects were found for outcome variables including distress (interaction <italic>b</italic> = −.015, <italic>SE</italic> = .007), anxiety (interaction <italic>b</italic> = −.018, <italic>SE</italic> = .008), worry (interaction <italic>b</italic> = −.017, <italic>SE</italic> = .008), and outraged (interaction <italic>b</italic> = −.029, <italic>SE</italic> = .010).

<p>Although a much greater amount of variance in worker well-being was explained in the analysis of job satisfaction (45.5%) than of psychological distress (16.9%), this is to be expected as the job satisfaction outcome is specific to the workplace and psychological distress is a more general measure of well-being.</p>
