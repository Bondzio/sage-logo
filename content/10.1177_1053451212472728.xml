<p>Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) exhibit behaviors that affect their academic performance, interactions with others, and ability to handle routine tasks at home and school. Research has indicated that children with ADHD experience feelings of loneliness and isolation, low self-esteem, shyness, misunderstandings, being different, frustrations and verbal arguments with parents and siblings, being left out of school activities, interpersonal difficulties with peers, and the stigma of having a disorder. Over time they develop a perception of themselves as <italic>problem children</italic>, centered on being different from others, troublesome for family and teachers, disliked by peers, and powerless to manage impulsive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1053451212472728">Kendall, Hatton, Beckett, &amp; Leo, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053451212472728">Krueger &amp; Kendall, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1053451212472728">Shattell, Bartlett, &amp; Rowe, 2008</xref>). Such self-defeating and disabling narratives compound the behavioral problems that limit self-understanding and flexibility in self-management.</p>
<p>There is an abundance of literature on the medical and behavioral management of children with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053451212472728">MTA Cooperative Group, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1053451212472728">Toplak, Connors, Shuster, Knezevic, &amp; Parks, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1053451212472728">Waschbusch &amp; Hill, 2003</xref>). With the exception of some cognitive behavioral therapies, far less attention has been paid to interventions that can help to change unhelpful and self-defeating perceptions and produce change in behavior. Using language, stories, and narrative questioning, narrative therapy provides a framework for identifying unhealthy narratives and envisioning and developing self-enabling narratives that foster effective self-management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1053451212472728">Freeman &amp; Combs, 1996</xref>). This column presents a group narrative intervention for improving the behavior of preadolescent children with ADHD that can be implemented in school settings.</p>
<sec id="section1-1053451212472728">
<title>Theoretical Foundation</title>
<p>Narrative therapy holds that people attribute meaning to the experience of events in their lives, which over time shapes their perceptions and the stories they construct about who they are. The stories, or narratives, reflect their identities and how they live their lives. Some narratives have positive influences, and others have negative influences on the way people behave and manage themselves. Certain negative life experiences or the onset of psychological disorders can produce self-defeating and dysfunctional narratives that sustain the problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1053451212472728">Richert, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>A major premise of narrative therapy is that the person is not the problem. Rather, the problem is acknowledged as the problem, thereby distancing or <italic>externalizing</italic> it from the person. The externalization and objectification of problems are effective tools, especially for children, to better understand their dominant problem-saturated narratives and learn to deal with problems rather than view them as intrinsic to their being. Externalizing is also applied to potential solutions, or <italic>initiatives</italic>, which include thoughts, feelings, or actions that do not support and sustain problems. For example, initiatives in children with ADHD may include an intention to not blurt out answers before questions are completed, not interrupt conversations, and to coordinate physical movements with mental imagination. Narrative therapists assume that people are able, and have the competency, to construct alternative narratives and change their relationship with problems. The process is nonblaming and fosters a sense of control over problems and responsibility for self-management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1053451212472728">White &amp; Epston, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1053451212472728">White (2007)</xref> clarified the process of narrative therapy, technically known as the <italic>scaffolding conversation map</italic>, to indicate what changes would be expected in a successful session and how it should be applied to achieve the desired outcome. In the course of narrative therapy, client and therapist work together in a series of steps to (a) identify, name, and characterize problems and potential solutions; (b) evaluate the consequences of problems or potential solutions; (c) explore the thinking behind this evaluation and the effect of potential solutions on the clients’ day-to-day experiences; and (d) determine how to take responsibility for putting intentions and plans for managing problems into action. The sequential process of narrative intervention has been the subject of empirical validation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1053451212472728">Ramey, Tarulli, Frijters, &amp; Fisher, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>There is an abundance of writing by practitioners who have attested to the effectiveness of narrative techniques for addressing the needs of children with emotional and behavioral problems (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053451212472728">Bennett, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1053451212472728">Vetere &amp; Dowling, 2005</xref>). This literature includes a large number of case studies that have demonstrated the efficacy of narrative therapy in dealing with a variety of problems in children. For example, narrative techniques have been effective in (a) developing positive, empowering identities in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1053451212472728">DeSocio, 2005</xref>); (b) helping children of parents with affective disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451212472728">Focht &amp; Beardslee, 1996</xref>); (c) working with children with hearing impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1053451212472728">Furlonger, 1999</xref>); (d) healing children who have experienced sexual abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053451212472728">McKenzie, 2005</xref>); and (e) increasing the ability to accept nurturing and care in children with early childhood maltreatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1053451212472728">May, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1053451212472728">Sheibani, Yoosefi Looyeh, and Delavar (2007)</xref> applied narrative therapy to a small group of girls ages 10 to 11 years with depression. Using a pretest-posttest–only design and behavioral symptoms checklists, they demonstrated a significant reduction in symptoms as reported by parents and teachers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1053451212472728">Yoosefi Looyeh and Matin (2006)</xref> implemented a group narrative intervention for 20 boys and girls age 11 years with learning disabilities. The children were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. The intervention group displayed significant improvements in coping strategies, such as problem solving, stress management, dealing with negative emotions, and improved self-awareness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1053451212472728">Yoosefi Looyeh, Kamali, and Ashrafpouri (in press)</xref> used a similar group narrative protocol for 30 boys ages 10 to 11 years with oppositional defiant disorder. Boys in the intervention group received 15 sessions of 90 minutes of narrative therapy twice weekly. Parents and teachers reported significant improvements in the behavior of the children in the intervention group but no improvement in the behavior of the wait-list group.</p>

<title>Group Narrative Intervention for Children With ADHD</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1053451212472728">Yoosefi Looyeh and Kamali (2012)</xref> implemented a group narrative intervention for preadolescent girls with ADHD in a school setting. Children in the intervention groups attended 12 sessions of approximately 60 minutes of narrative therapy twice weekly, with homework between sessions. Children who participated in the narrative intervention demonstrated significant improvements in school-related behaviors as reported by teachers. The results suggested that group narrative intervention is an effective technique for improving the behavior of children with ADHD. In the study, a school counselor with training in narrative techniques facilitated the sessions. Teachers played a minor role as cofacilitators. Experience has indicated that school counselors, social workers, and special education teachers who are familiar with narrative therapy can facilitate the sessions. To assist facilitators, we describe the process of the narrative intervention, group activities and sessions that are used, the focus of the group conversations, and expected outcomes in this article (see <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1053451212472728">Note 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Implementation</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1053451212472728">Table 1</xref> presents the steps in implementing narrative interventions. Group activities, storytelling, and story making provide a medium for facilitating the intervention. Stories narrated by the facilitator depict situations similar to the day-to-day experiences of children with ADHD at home, school, or other settings. The scenarios describe the behavior of the story’s actors, consequences, how they feel and think about themselves, and how others react to them. The stories allow the children to observe their problems and potential solutions from a distance, as somewhat independent observers. The stories told by the children allow them to communicate and project their problem-saturated narratives or to construct new narratives.</p>

<p>The intervention starts with (a) guiding the children to describe and construct definitions of the problems based on their own experience and (b) exploring the relationships among problems, solutions, and consequences. Initially, the aim is to develop an understanding of why a problem is a problem, not what caused the problem. As the sessions progress, the children reflect on whether they want the problem in their lives, what would happen if the problem were to continue to exist, and, alternatively, what would happen if they had control over the problem by behaving differently. The focus then shifts to identifying alternative behaviors, the effects on their lives, and what they can do to manage problems differently than they have in the past.</p>

<sec id="section4-1053451212472728">
<title>Group Activities</title>
<p>Six group activities used in the sessions are briefly described. These activities are based on or adapted from the comprehensive collection of play therapy activities compiled by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1053451212472728">Kaduson and Schaefer (1998)</xref>. In most sessions, more than one activity is used to provide variety and stimulate interest in the group interactions. Some activities are repeated in more than one session with different stories and characters but were focused on either different ADHD-related behaviors or particular steps of the narrative intervention. In the first few sessions the focus was on the behavior of the characters in the stories. As the sessions progressed, the children told stories based on their own experience.</p>
<sec id="section5-1053451212472728">
<title>The feeling word game</title>
<p>This group activity, used in Sessions 1 through 3, is aimed at increasing emotional self-awareness and expressing feelings and thoughts associated with emotions. Each child is given a set of cards with names of various emotions (e.g., happy, sad, angry) and a box of tokens. After a demonstration, they take turns in making up and telling stories. When an emotion is expressed in the story, they name and describe the emotion and place a number of tokens corresponding to the intensity of the emotion on the relevant card in front of them. In the second and third sessions they are encouraged to tell stories based on their own experiences at home or school, and they begin to express their ADHD narratives and how they feel.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1053451212472728">
<title>Metaphors for calmness</title>
<p>Metaphors for calmness, used in Sessions 2, 3, and 6, are aimed at identifying and naming impulsive behaviors, and creating awareness of consequences of impulsivity and how to manage it. The facilitator tells a story in which a character exhibits impulsive behaviors and how it affects the character’s interactions with others. In Session 2 the conversation is focused on naming and describing the behavior of the characters in the story. In Sessions 3 and 6 the children describe similar experiences they have had, how they felt about the way others responded, and the consequences of behaving differently from the way they usually deal with similar situations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1053451212472728">
<title>The scarf story</title>
<p>This activity, used in Sessions 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8, is aimed at recognizing the importance of nonverbal behaviors and coordination of physical movements with verbal imagination. The children take turns at moving under a large scarf held by the group. The facilitator tells a story with a character who engages in various physical movements. Following instructions, at certain points in the story the scarf is raised and the child under the scarf mimics and acts out movements of the story’s character as it is being narrated by the facilitator. Initially the focus is on describing difficulties the child has in following movements of the character in the story. In Sessions 4 through 6 the child under the scarf is asked to act out the movements and at the same time describe what the story’s character may be feeling and thinking. In Session 8, the children take turns and replace the facilitator as the storyteller. Each session ends with a discussion about identifying and characterizing difficulties the children have in synchronizing actions with mental images of behaviors and the consequences of exercising self-control.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1053451212472728">
<title>Metaphors for attentiveness</title>
<p>This activity, used in Sessions 4, 5, 9, and 10, is aimed at increasing understanding of inattention and distractibility. The facilitator tells a story that contains a character who exhibits symptoms of attention-deficit disorder (e.g., distractibility, trouble listening or following directions, forgetfulness, disorganization). Each child is given 10 cards containing words and pictures with references to the events in the story. When an event in the story is mentioned, the children are expected to pick up and raise the relevant card. The conversation centers on the children who miss raising the correct card on time, identifying and describing inattention and its consequences, and searching for possible solutions for managing it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1053451212472728">
<title>Storytelling with objects</title>
<p>This activity, used in Sessions 7, 10, 11, and 12, is aimed at internalizing solutions and developing expertise in self-management through identifying and characterizing alternative solutions to problems. The children take turns and choose one of five objects to tell a story in which a character exhibits problems at home or school and how effectively he or she deals with the problems. In Sessions 7 and 10 the conversation is focused on the feelings, beliefs, and thinking of the actor in the story, and the thought process the actor goes through to evaluate various solutions and the consequences of managing problems. In Sessions 11 and 12 the emphasis is on what they would do if they experience similar problems, why they would choose a particular solution, and their assessment of its effects on their lives.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1053451212472728">
<title>Metaphors and fairy tale</title>
<p>Metaphors and fairy tale, used in Sessions 7, 8, 11, and 12, is aimed at helping the children develop plans and take responsibility for self-management. The facilitator tells a story with a character who displays selected ADHD symptoms. The character in the story reflects on and evaluates various solutions for dealing with the problem. The story ends with the character feeling good about successfully having identified and responded with solutions that resulted in positive consequences and affirmative feedback from others. In Sessions 7 and 8 the children mentally rehearse the process of choosing and executing solutions. In Sessions 11 and 12 the conversation places more emphasis on describing the positive consequences of adopting alternative solutions and why the alternative behaviors are desirable.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1053451212472728">
<title>Homework</title>
<p>The choice of homework and the debriefing conversations parallel and support specific outcomes expected in successive sessions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1053451212472728">Table 2</xref>). Homework allows the children to reflect on and develop awareness of problems at home or school, ask for feedback, and share their experiences with other children in the group. Homework may be assigned to the group or individuals, depending on the content of a session and the emphasis the facilitator may wish to place on specific problems, solutions, or steps in the narrative intervention to achieve the desired outcome. It is helpful to provide each child with a pocket-size booklet with an attached pen for recording assignments and keeping a diary of behaviors, events, feelings, and thoughts he or she wishes to discuss with the group.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The intervention described in this article offers a practical approach for improving the behavior of children ages 8 to 11 years with ADHD. Groups of three to four children with comparable levels of communication skills and two weekly 60-minute sessions are suitable for working with children with ADHD. Larger groups and longer sessions are likely to divert attention from the group conversations. Our experience has indicated that some parents are more willing to support the intervention when it is offered in a school setting, viewing it as part of their children’s education. This may be a salient issue for girls from certain cultural backgrounds who may experience a greater stigma from being labeled a “problem child” and receiving “treatment” in a clinic setting.</p>
<p>Narrative intervention offers a structured process for guiding children to identify and describe their problems and how they typically deal with them, and also incrementally in manageable steps to shift their narratives to how they may effectively manage their problems. The medium of storytelling/story making provides a safe and entertaining environment for engaging the children in group conversations. As the sessions progress, the children are able to differentiate between ADHD and non-ADHD behaviors and consequences, explore alternative solutions with positive consequences, construct new narratives, and develop the self-management skills they need to behave differently. During the last few sessions, the conversation is focused on developing plans and taking responsibility for self-management. The children describe solutions they have identified, how they would put them into action, and the positive effects of having control over problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1053451212472728">Yoosefi Looyeh &amp; Kamali, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Following the narrative approach, the facilitator does not offer solutions or persuade the children to adopt a particular course of action. Rather, the facilitator guides the children to explore, identify, evaluate, and pursue solutions on their own initiative. This plays an important role in internalizing new narratives and increasing the potential for behaving differently. The children are viewed as being able to define their problems, envision and characterize solutions, and take responsibility for self-management. Consequently, in the sessions they are actively involved in defining problems based on their own experiences, developing awareness of the association between problems and solutions and consequences in terms they understand, and evaluating and choosing solutions they are able to implement. The result is a newfound sense of personal agency, a sense that they can regulate and manage their behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1053451212472728">White, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In a group setting the narrative process is aided by sharing stories about the children’s experience of ADHD; the reactions of parents, teachers, and peers; and the successes or failures of various initiatives and the resulting effects on their lives. Often the behavior of the children in the sessions reflects their ADHD symptoms, such as interrupting others, not listening, and not talking excessively. A sign that the intervention is successful is when the children begin to identify and remind each other of inappropriate behaviors and the consequences and to offer solutions without prompting.</p>
