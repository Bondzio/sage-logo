<body>
<p>Welcome to the special edition of <italic>Teaching Sociology</italic> focusing on Writing in Sociology. This edition has been a vision of mine for three years and been in process for nearly two years, so it is exciting to see these wonderful manuscripts in print. Thank you to the more than 30 authors who submitted manuscripts and to the many reviewers who volunteered their time to read those manuscripts. Without all of you, there would be no special edition.</p>
<p>I want to thank Suzanne H. Hudd, the guest editor for this edition of <italic>Teaching Sociology</italic>. She was a thoughtful reviewer and editor, and the manuscripts in this edition have benefitted from her input. But even more, I want to thank her for her commitment to this special edition, given her other statuses as department chair, researcher, professor, wife, and mother (and those are just the ones I know about!). Many a morning we have exchanged several emails before 5:30 <sc>am</sc>—we bonded over being early risers. Sue—it has been a pleasure to work for and with you on these manuscripts. Words cannot express how much fun I have had these past few months, sharing your vision of this special edition. I have learned a tremendous amount about how I can better teach writing to my students from working with you and all the authors who submitted manuscripts for this edition. I know that readers will learn a tremendous amount from reading this edition of <italic>Teaching Sociology</italic>.</p>
<p>I also want to thank these outgoing members of the Editorial Board: Erin K. Anderson, Kevin J. Delaney, Jeffrey C. Dixon, Theodore Fuller, Patti A. Guiffre, Kathy Livingston, Suzanne B. Maurer, Miriam Michelle Newton-Francis, Diane Pike, Christopher Prendergast, and Stephen J. Scanlan. These board members have worked hard these past three years. Almost every manuscript reviewed has a <italic>TS</italic> Editorial Board member as one of the reviewers, so they have been kept busy! Moreover, they have given me good advice about the journal and have been a wonderful support system.</p>
<p>Joining the Board beginning in 2013 will be Deborah A. Abowitz, Corey Dolgon, Belisa E. Gonzalez, Angel Hoekstra, Peter Kaufman, Sadie R. Pendaz, Diane Pike, Rashawn Ray, Jenny M. Stuber, and Esther Wilder. I am grateful for their accepting my invitation and look forward to working with them for the next few years.</p>
<p>Another person to whom I owe an enormous debt of gratitude is Glenn Muschert, my outgoing Deputy Editor. While I have extended my time as Editor, Glenn wants to move on, taking his career of teaching, learning, and scholarship in new directions. While I am sad to have him leave as Deputy Editor, I am excited for this new phase of his professional life and look forward to the many successes that I know will come his way. It is hard to put into words what he has done for the journal. Officially, he oversees all the film, book, and Web site reviews, which means he receives books and films, has to find reviewers, ships the book or film to them, work with reviewers as they write the review, urge them gently if reviews are past due, and then work with me and my Managing Editor, Roseanne Ponce, to ensure timely production. Unofficially he is my “go-to” person when I need a sounding board and is a reviewer when I have had many people turn me down and need a review quickly. I also want to thank his graduate assistants during his term, Sarah Hahn (Miami University’s Gerontology Program) and Pam Brown (now assistant professor at Central Missouri State University).</p>
<p>While Glenn is “retiring” he has graciously promised to be there to help Christopher Wellin, who is coming aboard as the incoming Deputy Editor, learn our processes. I want to thank Chris for accepting this position and I look forward to working with him.</p>
<p>I hope that you find as many intriguing ideas about writing in this edition as I have. Enjoy and Happy New Year.</p>
