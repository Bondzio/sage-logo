<p>One of the lessons underlying this set of reviews of books from the <italic>JMCQ</italic> bookshelf is that even as the nation emerges, dripping, from the backwash of the latest quadrennial political paroxysms, certain constants remain. New communication technologies and environments, First Amendment concerns, professional journalistic practices, global mass communication comparisons, how traditional media—broadcast and print—morph in the new digital age: issues confronting producers and consumers of information are larger than parochial partisan politics.</p>
<p>One of the challenges to The Book is that this most venerable of mass media is so easily outpaced by its younger offspring. Thus, as President Barack Obama’s first term ends, we draw lessons from how the “communicator-in-chief” won in 2008. “By the time this book review is published, the 2012 presidential election will have been decided,” observes Queenie A. Byars in reviewing John Allen Hendricks and Robert E. Denton’s examination of <italic>Communicator-in-Chief: How Barack Obama Used New Media Technology to Win the White House</italic>, but like the rest of the field, the lessons are evolutionary. What will the new standards of presidential campaigning be now?</p>
<p>That longer view of journalism is reinforced in other books discussed here, such as Steven Hallock’s <italic>Reporters Who Made History</italic>, which asks ten prominent bylines—Juan Williams, Ben Bradlee, Georgie Ann Geyer, and others—about the lessons they learned and how journalism has changed. “Not surprisingly, they note the impact of technological innovations such as the Internet, the twenty-four-hour news cycle and the economic pressures on newspapers and television news operations,” writes reviewer Elizabeth Atwood.</p>
<p>Another look back at literal lessons learned comes in the form of Philip Meyer’s memoir, <italic>Paper Route: Finding My Way to Precision Journalism</italic>. Many will enjoy the confession of the godfather of the scientific method, whose first look at the chi-square scared him: “The formula seemed very complicated to me,” he writes, “and the calculation was pure drudgery.”</p>
<p>Other greats of the field are examined in this batch of books, including <italic>Pauline Kael: A Life in the Dark</italic>, by Brian Kellow (“Pauline Kael has been described as the preeminent film critic of the twentieth century. If this is hyperbole, it is right in synch with her style, both personal and on the written page,” observes reviewer Katherine Orloff); and Oscar Gandy reviews Michael Morgan’s look at the father of cultivation theory, George Gerber: “The media that Gerbner studied for most of his career no longer actually exist,” observes Gandy, who worked with Gerbner. “We might wonder what he would have thought of the Internet as we experience it now.” Indeed.</p>
