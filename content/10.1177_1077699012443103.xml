<p>One of the most fruitful recent developments in the study of the civil rights era in the United States has been what might be called the global turn. Beginning with Mary Dudziak’s 2000 book <italic>Cold War Civil Rights</italic>, new scholarship has increasingly viewed the postwar struggle over racial equality as an international story, necessarily examined in the context of the global cold war and the emergence of new nation-states in the postcolonial era. Seen in this broad perspective, the course of the American civil rights movement was significantly affected by the propaganda war between the United States and its communist adversaries as both sides sought prestige and influence among the nonaligned states in what were then called the third world. The American “race problem” gave a significant propaganda advantage to its enemies. How could lynching, legal segregation, and the everyday humiliation of racial minorities take place in a nation that cast itself as a model of freedom and democracy?</p>
<p>Scholars have long noted that racial inequality, especially when it turned violent, was America’s greatest embarrassment on the global stage. <italic>The Opinions of Mankind: Racial Issues, Press, and Propaganda in the Cold War</italic>, by Richard Lentz and Karla K. Gower, is a far-reaching study of the role of the press as the forum in which these contentious issues played out. Lentz, a longtime journalism educator, and Gower, who teaches at the University of Alabama, have unearthed a great number of examples from foreign newspapers that clearly show how negative stories about race relations tarnished the American image, which is not entirely new.</p>
<p>What is immensely useful with this book, however, is the authors’ examination of the extensive efforts undertaken by the U.S. government to monitor, in hopes of countering, this negative international publicity. To some degree, this was reported in the American press. News magazines, for example, used to run articles on how the foreign press reported on stories about race relations. Much more evidence is drawn from the files of State Department foreign service officers and diplomats, who paid attention to the local press in their region and reported back to Washington on the way news about the United States was handled. Lentz and Gower have also unearthed records from organizations like the United States Information Agency and United States Information Service, which made more formal and systematic efforts to track and analyze press reports from overseas. This information was used to determine what kind of propaganda response, whether in the form of media messages or publicity tours by American jazz musicians, should be undertaken in response.</p>
<p>The heart of the book is arranged in a roughly chronological manner, with chapters detailing foreign press response to incidents like the response to the <italic>Brown</italic> decision, the Emmett Till murder and subsequent trial, the Montgomery bus boycott, the Little Rock Crisis, the Freedom Rides, and the riots in Watts, among others. Not surprisingly, each chapter offers many powerful examples of harsh criticism of racism in America. On the other hand, the authors point out that positive developments, like the passage of the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts in the mid-1960s, generated largely positive press response. All but the most strident foreign critics recognized that America was making progress with its racial problem, and the authors argue that foreign press coverage generally became less harsh as the 1960s progressed.</p>
<p>One particularly thoughtful aspect of the book is the authors’ discussion of the role of the U.S. media. The Soviets, the Chinese, and others did not have foreign correspondents reporting from the American South. Instead, they relied heavily on the Associated Press and the major U.S. newspapers and magazines to get accurate and timely reports. This put the American press in the awkward position of supplying the raw materials that made for such fine propaganda. As scholars of cold war–era journalism have long noted, the American press by and large accepted the cold war consensus and worked to promote the national interest. In this case, however, the duty to report honestly about the racial crisis undermined their efforts to present the United States as a party of virtue. As the book makes clear, most American news outlets did their best to soften the damage by arguing that, despite isolated and unfortunate incidents, race relations were improving and that, in any case, our cold war enemies had their own race problems that made them look just as bad.</p>
<p>The authors do a service by broadening their scope of inquiry beyond the high-profile stories of the black freedom struggle in the South. The international press also took note of America’s treatment of its Native American population and was at time harshly critical. So, too, were stories about mistreatment of Latinos in the Southwest, which was of special interest in the Latin American news media, a region targeted by Soviet propaganda. Another racial flashpoint that drew criticism was treatment of local citizens near U.S. military bases overseas. Stories about the rude behavior and occasional violence against locals in the Panama Canal Zone and other locales lent themselves to charges that the United States had become a harsh colonial overlord and raised questions about the nation’s self-proclaimed role as a liberator.</p>
<p><italic>The Opinions of Mankind: Racial Issues, Press, and Propaganda in the Cold War</italic> is clearly argued and well organized. Although the writing style is workmanlike rather than eloquent, the subject matter is compelling, and the book is highly readable. It is clearly an essential piece of scholarship on cold war journalism, as well as U.S. race relations, and deserves a wide readership among historians and mass communications researchers.</p>
