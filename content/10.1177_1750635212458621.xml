<abstract>
<p>One consequence of the eroding business model of quality newspapers in Western countries is the reduction in the number of permanent correspondents and regional bureaus. It has been argued that the importance of foreign correspondents has been overstated and that news agencies, social networks and citizen-journalism can fill the gap. In contrast, the authors argue that the loss of presence in foreign countries has harmed the news media’s ability to uncover evolving crises and provide in-depth and reliable background reporting. This is particularly problematic for conflict prevention because decision-makers use quality news media alongside intelligence reports for identifying and prioritizing threats. Cost-considerations stand in the way of re-opening foreign bureaus, but quality news providers need to become more inventive in how they can preserve the early warning function of quality news coverage. One way forward is to cultivate links with country and area specialists from academia, NGOs and the non-profit media.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>Foreign affairs coverage by Western news media organizations has been in gradual retreat for more than a decade, whereas media organizations in East Asia and many African countries have been expanding more recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1750635212458621">Sambrook, 2010</xref>: 69). This retreat has been accelerated by the financial crisis as news organizations have reinforced their efforts to cut costs by closing more of their foreign bureaus. Compared to a census taken in 2003, the number of foreign correspondents employed by US newspapers shrank from 307 to 234 in 2010, the latter number also comprising staff and contract writers who were not included in 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1750635212458621">Kumar, 2011</xref>). Probably the most telling examples are <italic>The Boston Globe</italic> and the <italic>Chicago Tribune</italic> which have both closed all of their foreign bureaus since 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1750635212458621">Enda, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1750635212458621">Carroll, 2007</xref>: 14). The <italic>Chicago Tribune</italic>, being the founding paper of the <italic>Tribune Company</italic>, now gets its foreign news from the <italic>Los Angeles Times</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1750635212458621">Enda, 2011</xref>), which currently has 13 foreign offices with 16 correspondents, down from 30 correspondents in 24 bureaus in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1750635212458621">Kumar, 2011</xref>). While this trend is particularly stark in the US, most media organizations in Western countries are struggling to fund their foreign affairs coverage at a time when their business model of selling news in print is threatened by the shift of audiences and advertising to the internet. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1750635212458621">Martin Moore (2010)</xref> has found similar trends in the UK. <italic>The Daily Telegraph</italic>, according to Moore, now has eight correspondents, a marked decrease from its 12 in 2006. And <italic>The Independent</italic>, a paper with an above average share of and dedication to international news has allegedly had to cut foreign staff and close four overseas bureaus (pp. 32–34).</p>
<p>While this trend has not gone unnoticed and has attracted considerable comment within the trade (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1750635212458621">Constable, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1750635212458621">Enda, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1750635212458621">Sambrook, 2010</xref>), its implications for the conduct of foreign policy and, in particular, international efforts to prevent evolving humanitarian crisis and security threats are hardly explored. We argue that the Western news media’s gradual loss of presence in the field and deep knowledge of many countries and regions has diminished their ability to spot potential crises, reduce evidential uncertainty and illuminate how an escalation of violence may matter <italic>before</italic> a conflict has fully erupted. We are increasingly left with less trained eyes and ears on the ground, concentrated in fewer countries that are seen as crucial, and only reinforced by so-called ‘parachute journalists’ who jump from crisis to crisis without providing information early enough or delivering adequate context. It is true that decision-makers, advisors and analysts have various sources of early warning at their disposal, but our interview findings suggest that quality news media and individual journalists writing for them play a tremendously important role in informing both policy-planning and decision-making as well as the allocation of attention to countries and issues. We argue that this trend has negatively affected the prospects for preventive action by states and international organizations and want to contribute to a debate about how quality news providers can adjust so that they can still deliver reliable anticipatory coverage with less resources. The article starts with a discussion of the news media’s role in foreign and preventive policy. We then briefly describe the changes in foreign reporting and discuss the implications for foreign policy-making and in particular conflict prevention. Finally, we explain which actors have stepped in and what could be done to facilitate the production of anticipatory foreign affairs journalism.</p>
<p>The article draws on findings from 35 semi-structured interviews with journalists, government officials and NGO representatives which were conducted within a larger research project on early warning and preventive policy, focusing on the US, UK and Germany as key responders. As warning tends to occur before a conflict becomes salient in the audiovisual media, most journalists interviewed have a background in print journalism. Interviewees were chosen on the basis of their involvement in covering intra-state conflict as well as their long-standing experience in the field of foreign and conflict reporting. They originate from 14 different news organizations, of which 12 were daily newspapers and two were television channels. The large majority (30) of interviews were conducted face-to-face and five took place on the phone. Interview length varied from 25 to 90 minutes, with 45–50 minutes representing the average time.</p>

<sec id="section2-1750635212458621">
<title>2. Foreign affairs coverage and preventive policy</title>
<p>Academics and practitioners have questioned whether the media actually contribute to preventive policy. From this critical perspective, the news media usually fail to pay attention early enough and mostly lag behind developments on the ground, sometimes taking an interest even after governments do, or merely following government action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1750635212458621">Gowing, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750635212458621">Jakobsen, 2000</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1750635212458621">1</xref></sup> As one journalist put it, the media’s contribution to preventive policy and conflict warning is often accidental because it is not one of their actual tasks but at best a by-product. This criticism is not unfounded as a general observation, but underestimates the potential of the news media as illustrated by those cases in which media coverage did raise the profile of crises and alerted publics and decision-makers. Journalists have reported on impending or escalating conflicts, either because of a moral obligation to victims to do so or because they think their readers would value this information. Even if the media’s performance in this field lags behind what would be desirable, they still play an underappreciated role in preventive policy, especially with regard to their role as an information broker. The ‘diffusion of sources’ is a key feature of the field of preventive policy where various producers of warning (intelligence, NGOs and news media) often rely on the same open-source information or contribute different pieces of information that may eventually convey that a conflict is likely to escalate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1750635212458621">Meyer et al., 2010</xref>: 563). News media pieces are part of the ‘swirl of intelligence’ which constitutes warning, as one former advisor of President George W Bush put it. In his view, the media were among the most important sources as well: ‘In comparison to all other types of warning they have a dramatic mobilising effect and they are certainly much more effective than intelligence’ (anonymous interview, 20 October 2009). Similarly, an advisor to a former German Foreign Minister emphasized that newspapers are one of the most important sources of information when trying to anticipate potential conflicts, also in light of other information at his/her disposal. For him/her, the particular value lies in the different perspective reporting brings to the process and the way knowledge is processed and presented compared to in-house information, for example embassy reporting (anonymous interview, 3 November 2010a).</p>
<p>Moreover, some decision-makers value not just particular papers, but have over the years come to trust the analysis of particular individuals writing for these papers. When asked about which sources she or he relies on for early detection of potential conflicts, a foreign policy advisor in the German Government not only mentioned the media but named specific correspondents, depending on the region in question. He or she also revealed that he or she especially cherished the analysis of one correspondent, writing for a paper with a diametrically opposed ideological outlook to the government, due to the journalist’s track-record and expertise (anonymous interview, 3 November 2010b). This view has been echoed by others: ‘If one had been following with attention the reporting of Dominic Johnston [Africa correspondent of the German TAZ], one would have had an excellent source of early warning’, according to the former Spokesperson of the German Greens, Winfried Nachtwei (interview, 14 September 2011, authors’ translation). The previous examples all relate to the function of the quality news media as an independent source of information heavily used by the foreign policy community, and the role of correspondents as ‘experts’ for a particular region, country or issue. This role is particularly pronounced for regions and countries where Western governments lack their own intelligence capabilities. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1750635212458621">Alan Kuperman (2007</xref>: 258) in these instances argues, ‘the news business is relied on to serve as a surrogate early-warning system.’</p>
<p>Hence, we are not talking about aggregate media influence along the lines of the so-called CNN-effect or ‘agenda-setting’, but the role and impact of individual journalists as country experts and their contribution to the foreign-policy process by providing independent analysis and functioning – often accidentally – as elements of early warning systems (see, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750635212458621">Livingston and Eachus, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1750635212458621">McCombs and Shaw, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1750635212458621">Robinson, 2003</xref>). While we do not wish to claim that all foreign correspondents in fact deliver high quality coverage of the kind that is crucial to prevention, they are in principle well-equipped to ‘witness’, ‘decipher’ and ‘interpret’ as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1750635212458621">Timothy Garton Ash (2010)</xref> argued. With the knowledge about the society they live in, the language it speaks, well-established local contacts and the possibility of travelling around and seeing things with their own eyes, foreign correspondents are a unique source of analysis and sometimes advance information, instead of merely ‘reacting to events and playing catch up’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1750635212458621">Moore, 2010</xref>: 49). Andrew Stroehlein, a former journalist and now spokesperson for the International Crisis Group (ICG), highlighted the ability of long-term correspondents to know:
<disp-quote>
<p>when a bomb going off was nothing special or whether it was a real signal that things are going to kick-off, not just because they have been there, spoke the language, but because they had a feel for the place. There is a bit of art to it; it’s not pure science and numbers. They have a feel that something changed in society that tensions were building up. (Andrew Stroehlein interview, 1 September 2011)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The second reason why quality text-based news media matter for conflict prevention is their ‘agenda-setting function’ at the level of foreign policy communities, i.e. their ability to put issues on the political agenda and create pressure to react to a problem. Although the latter may play a crucial role when a crisis has already gained pace, for preventive policy, lead news media are crucial as they can substantially boost weak signals above the background noise and provide context and texture in a way that other sources of analysis usually cannot achieve. In every country there are ‘lead’ media outlets; for example, in the US, these are <italic>The New York Times</italic> (<italic>NYT</italic>) and to a certain degree <italic>The Washington Post</italic>. If they decide to prominently cover an issue, other newspapers, news magazines and even television often follow with their coverage as editors use them for selecting topics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1750635212458621">Gans, 1979</xref>: 91; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1750635212458621">Shoemaker and Reese, 1996</xref>: 125). For the US, Andrew Natsios, the former Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) underscored the special importance of print media, in particular of the <italic>NYT</italic> and <italic>Washington Post</italic>: ‘If you don’t get their attention and they don’t believe you, then, it’s not going to get reported. If the <italic>New York Times</italic> says something is happening, people think it is happening. For better or for worse’ (Andrew Natsios interview, 22 October 2009). A spokesperson for the ICG emphasized the ability of elite-focused news media such as the <italic>NYT</italic> or the <italic>Financial Times</italic> (<italic>FT</italic>) to either ‘bump-up’ a particular country-case on the order of priority within policy communities if it has been ignored, or to influence debate about a case where there is already a cacophony of voices. Several of our interviewees confirm that foreign affairs bureaucracies, including their embassies, are very sensitive to news coverage at home and, while they convey warnings without media reporting, they do get ‘switched-on’ to emerging conflicts once leading ‘home news media’ report about them. News media warning can thus trigger in-house warnings.</p>

<sec id="section3-1750635212458621">
<title>3. Changes in foreign reporting and their implications</title>
<p>It has been argued that the decline in foreign correspondents should not be too much lamented as news organizations can compensate through information that is freely available on the internet or by hiring freelancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1750635212458621">Sambrook, 2010</xref>). Over the last years, journalists have increasingly learned to use information produced by eyewitnesses, local observers or responders. Reading blogs and websites, following podcasts, using social networks and sifting through video databases like YouTube have become part of their daily routine. At a first glance, these ‘new’ sources of information have proved that they provided an added value that a single correspondent in a country struggled to produce. Taking the Fort Hood shooting as an example, Sambrook details how <italic>The Guardian</italic> produced the bulk of its breaking-news reporting on the basis of open-source information from the internet. To get the ‘immediate facts of the story’, the paper did not need a correspondent on the ground and, as emergency services updated their websites frequently, they could even tell how the story unfolded while their correspondent was still on his or her way to Texas. The task of the reporter sent to Fort Hood was not reporting the news anymore but providing background, follow-up and feature coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1750635212458621">Sambrook, 2010</xref>: 8–9).</p>
<p>However, the Fort Hood shooting took place in a rather ‘uncomplicated’ information environment. First of all, journalists reporting about it from a distance could rely on official statements by the emergency services, i.e. they knew the sources and could expect that they would get reliable information. Secondly, we are dealing with a single event instead of a process unfolding over time. It was not a question of realizing that something was actually going on. And finally, for the in-depth coverage, <italic>The Guardian</italic> decided that they needed a reporter on the ground.</p>
<p>These conditions are typically not found when covering emerging crises in foreign countries. Many of the most atrocious conflicts tend to erupt in the most deprived areas of the world where mobile (not smart) phones are the most advanced technology used outside cities. Similarly, as recent events in Tunisia, Egypt and Syria, as well as in Iran in 2009, have demonstrated, ‘stand-in’ information sources are usually not available to, or used by, the media before a crisis has escalated. So even if these sources exist, they tend to be used only after a conflict has erupted to add ‘colour’ and authenticity, but all too often turn out to be quite unreliable as the case of the persecuted ‘lesbian blogger in Damascus’ illustrates.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1750635212458621">2</xref></sup> So while alternative sources have opened up avenues for reporting when journalists struggled with limited freedom of movement or a lack of presence on the ground, one still needs knowledge and expertise of journalists permanently based in a country or region to adequately use these sources and provide context. If, as various editors stated, their most important and trusted source for selecting foreign stories is their own correspondent or reporter, his or her familiarity with the subject and region will matter decisively for the quality of coverage. Jonathan Steele, a veteran correspondent with <italic>The Guardian</italic>, agrees that the reporter in the field makes the difference
<disp-quote>
<p>particularly for these stories that aren’t the obvious ones on the news agenda. Where you’re the first to get there or the first to sense that something is happening and ought to be looked at, it’s very much the reporter who does that. (Jonathan Steele interview, 24 January 2011)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Thus, the availability of ‘new’ sources of information does not compensate for individual journalistic expertise. We argue that both taken together represent an added value.</p>
<p>The internet not only offers an unprecedented number of news sources from all around the world to journalists but also to their readers, viewers and listeners. This development, in theory, gives audiences enormous opportunities to pick the news they are interested in, often from sources closer to events than their local newspaper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1750635212458621">Sambrook, 2010</xref>: 31). In the case of the general population however, we know that ‘internet usage is driven by personal need and interest. Unlike broadcast and print, there is little discovery of content not directly relevant to the individual … Audiences rarely encounter the wider world online’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1750635212458621">Fenyoe, 2010</xref>: 3). In the case of political decision-makers, though active ‘information-seekers’, time coupled with deeply ingrained consumption habits still favours newspapers and their online off-shoots. They offer a selection of what they deem is important that everybody should know about. They not only give decision-makers ideas about which issues are discussed in the public domain but also bring these topics together. Furthermore, newspapers reassure decision-makers of a problem’s importance because the issue has ‘survived’ the media’s own selection process. Besides their own consumption habits and allegiance to a trusted source, the aspect of time is also likely to affect the next generation of people in power who might very well belong to the group that is pursuing alternative sources of information for their daily news diet. Even if they had the inclination to wade through different blogs, specialist publications and various newspapers’ websites, it is likely that time would forbid it. To some extent, press clippings relieve policy-makers from gathering information relevant to them. Yet, we know from intelligence studies that decision-makers frequently do their own analysis and rely on sources of their own choosing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1750635212458621">Betts, 1978</xref>).</p>
<p>The second problem arising from a concentration on a smaller number of newspaper sources providing original foreign affairs coverage and the internet is the loss in width and nuance. ‘Smaller’ papers, such as the <italic>Boston Globe</italic> or the <italic>Baltimore Sun</italic> brought their own distinct perspective of reporting into the general discourse. The aspect of getting alternative perspectives becomes all the more important in light of a potentially narrowing focus in the coverage of the <italic>NYT</italic> and the <italic>Washington Post</italic>. In an interview, a former foreign correspondent stressed a shift in priorities towards being more specific to the paper’s target audience, for example in the UN, World Bank or US administration. Furthermore, the dynamics of the internet have led to the expectation to quickly respond to incoming information instead of pursuing stories independently. Now correspondents are expected to be more immediate in their reporting and on top of developments. As a consequence, it has become much more complicated for a reporter to ‘disappear’ for a week or two for research purposes (anonymous foreign correspondent interview, 18 November 2010).</p>
<p>This issue is further aggravated by the imbalanced distribution of correspondents around the globe. Whereas at the time of writing the <italic>NYT</italic> has 50 correspondents/staffers in its 24 foreign bureaus – an impressive number in economically difficult times – there are only four correspondents in total who are responsible for covering the African continent. They are distributed across three bureaus, if one counts Cairo towards the Middle East. For Southeast Asia, there is one permanent correspondent based in Jakarta, and two in South America (Caracas and São Paulo). After closing its bureau in Johannesburg in 2009, the <italic>Washington Post</italic> has one correspondent each for Africa and South America and none in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Instead of countering a concentration on just a few sources, news outlets on the internet are rather contributing to this trend, as the example of internet news agencies, like Google News, shows: ‘The evolution of the online news agency has laid bare the news industries’ near total dependence on a few wholesale news providers and the limitations on public discourse that it inevitably yields’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1750635212458621">Paterson, 2006</xref>). Instead of providing readers with diversity in reporting foreign news, this, according to Paterson, is little more than a pretence, which, without change, gives audiences ‘the dangerous illusion of multiple perspectives which actually emanate from very few sources’.</p>
<p>More closely related to the traditional approach of correspondent-based foreign coverage is the use of freelancers. Marcus Brauchli, the <italic>Washington Post’s</italic> Executive Editor, for example, argues that a bigger contribution of freelancers more than compensates for less foreign bureaus and correspondents:
<disp-quote>
<p>There are more reporters around the world writing for an international audience than there have ever been. The quality and depth of coverage are greater than they have ever been. There is a great deal of nostalgia for the newspaper correspondent of yore, but when the <italic>Baltimore Sun</italic> had a single correspondent in Asia and he got to go to Korea or the Philippines for a week having never been before, was he really bringing greater authority and knowledge to his readers? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1750635212458621">Sambrook, 2010</xref>: 30)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>If freelancers know their audiences well enough, they might even be able to continue ‘to act as a bridge between the living rooms at home and an alien place on the other side of the world’. However, others do not share Brauchli’s optimism. Quentin Peel, the former Foreign Editor of the <italic>FT</italic>, and now the paper’s Berlin Correspondent and Associate Editor, doubts that newspapers nowadays are taking so much copy from freelancers but would rather rely on the internet: ‘One of the saddest things is that freelancers, that tradition, is nothing like as strong as it used to be.’ Above all, he pointed out that freelancers often did not have the financial means to sustain long research trips for in-depth coverage (Quentin Peel interview, 1 November 2010). Whereas correspondents working for ‘smaller’ news organizations have often operated under and still need to deal with tight budgets and limited ‘freedom of movement’, there remains a significant difference between receiving a regular salary, as well as having a limited expenses account, and shouldering all the costs of living and research upfront in the first place. An additional problem is that freelancers, who are not permanently based in the country or region they are reporting about, might overstate the potential for violence. This is the case not only because they may have a strong financial incentive to sell their stories, but also because they may lack the experience to judge whether a specific violent event is actually ‘normal’, rather than a ‘mere’ indicator of escalation. One practitioner from an NGO lamented that newspapers as well as news agencies are:
<disp-quote>
<p>hiring younger and younger [people]; they are not even hiring staff, but freelancers. They are hiring people from outside who have a detached view; they are hiring locals who have good contacts, but may be partisan one side or another. Rather than having the 40-year-old experienced correspondent on the ground in Nairobi, they have the 22-year-old, first shot out of university and absolutely amazed by absolutely everything. (Andrew Stroehlein interview, 1 September 2011)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>However, Brauchli seems to have a strong argument when pointing out the limitations of correspondents, particularly of smaller newspapers, who often have to cover large areas.</p>
<p>Whereas neither the internet alone nor inexperienced freelancers seem to sufficiently fill the void, the same can be said about ‘parachute journalism’ in response to bloodshed, which Andrew Stroehlein from the ICG described as ‘a feeding frenzy of at best limited value’ for the purpose of preventing harm. All three have in common that they contribute little to proactive reporting, spotting problems or conflicts before their consequences become visible and providing the ‘bridging function’ foreign correspondents used to fulfil.</p>
<p>A potentially promising actor to stand-in for a thinner presence of newspaper correspondents are NGOs and the evolving type of ‘non-profit journalism’. Starting with the former, researchers generally agree that the role of NGOs as an alternative provider of information has greatly increased over the last years as their resources have expanded whereas those of the news media have shrunk. The ICG, for instance, has more analysts on the ground than the <italic>NYT</italic>, the <italic>FT</italic> or CNN and is only surpassed by BBC News, Al Jazeera Arabic and Al Jazeera English, and large news agencies. Some NGOs are now capable of conducting extensive research and producing in-depth analysis as well as background information which partly used to be the news media’s domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1750635212458621">Moore, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1750635212458621">Sambrook, 2010</xref>). This view is widely shared among journalists as well. For example, Richard Beeston, the Foreign Editor of <italic>The Times</italic> (London), replying to the question of whether NGOs have become more important over the last years and partly filled a gap where correspondents have left, said: ‘I think so. They’re more aggressive, they’re more media-friendly and easier to use. They produce more thick reports … and have learned from journalism how to personalize stories’ (Richard Beeston interview, 11 October 2010). Answering to the same question, Lindsay Hilsum, Channel 4 News’ International Editor, stated: ‘yes, I totally agree with that. Particularly the ICG and Human Rights Watch and, to some extent, Enough do as well, do the in-depth reporting that we don’t do. Yes’ (Lindsay Hilsum interview, 27 January 2011). And Richard Dowden, the Director of the Royal African Society who previously was a foreign correspondent himself and Africa Editor of <italic>The Independent</italic> and <italic>The Economist</italic>, reaches a similar conclusion:
<disp-quote>
<p>Yes. I think the good ones have, Human Rights Watch in particular. They do some really heavy-weight reports which previously would have been written – more briefly – by journalists. They are written differently but they may reach the same conclusions. These NGOs do the sort of job a journalist would have done 20, 30 years ago. Only a little bit would have appeared in a newspaper but the journalist might have written a book about it afterwards. (Richard Dowden interview, 8 February 2011)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The role of NGOs has undergone changes as well and, from a communication perspective, NGOs are now acting in a much more multifaceted way than before. On the one hand, they are a source of information for the media. On the other hand, they need the media for amplifying their messages to reach decision-makers and the general public to achieve their substantive mission. For Iain Levine, HRW’s program director overseeing the organization’s research and reporting work: ‘The media is the single most important magnifier of our voice.’ Consequently, HRW invests immense efforts in readying its ‘products’ for media use and offering material to journalists, for example interview data or B-roll (secondary) footage. Press releases are written following a very strict formula to maximize effectiveness and usability:
<disp-quote>
<p>They read like an AP news story. And that’s how they’re deliberately written. So as much as possible people can almost use them verbatim and it looks like a news story. You know, we spend a lot of time on the quotes because that’s the thing that often gets taken up and put in a news story. You want to get the quotes in because that’s an important way of saying what you have to say and giving Human Rights Watch the profile. (Iain Levine interview, 26 February 2010)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Yet Levine also emphasized the growing and immense importance of spreading the message independently, becoming a medium itself. Through its own YouTube channel, podcasts and the website, HRW has increasingly become a ‘purveyor of information in many different formats to reach the media and the public’. The same phenomenon can be seen in the case of the ICG, who produce their own regular newsletter, reports and podcasts, which are widely disseminated among the expert community. A spokesperson for the ICG pointed out that they were usually not targeting the general public with their products, but that they were highly confident that their products reached expert communities even without mass media coverage, particularly in those countries not normally at the centre of Western interests.</p>
<p>Although some NGOs seem to have strong capacities in terms of the information and analysis they can provide about regions and problems not covered by others, they also face severe limitations compared to newspapers, especially when it comes to their reach and ‘credibility’. As Levine himself pointed out, the media are of immense importance for magnifying the message and, in spite of the efforts to directly address the public, their reach does not equal the ability of the news media. Though principally agreeing on the changed role of NGOs, Beeston made the same point, doubting that the ‘run-of-the-mill reader is happily spending the morning reading the Amnesty International website’. In his view, it still takes a newspaper to raise the salience of issues to a level at which the general public registers them (Richard Beeston interview, 11 October 2010). Andrew Stroehlein (ICG) highlighted the importance of media coverage in outlets such as the <italic>FT</italic> or the <italic>NYT</italic>, which he considered important to reach senior decision-makers and break-through with new perspectives on countries with strong Western interests. He also argued that even though the decimation in foreign correspondent numbers had strengthened their position as a source for journalists, this was no compensation for continuous and intelligent foreign affairs coverage that newspapers could provide.</p>
<p>A related yet distinct issue concerns the perceived ‘bias’ of NGOs versus the news media’s ‘neutrality’ or indeed distinct appeal to different parts of the political spectrum. While some NGOs, especially the ICG, enjoy high credibility because of the general perception that ‘they don’t have a particular axe to grind’ (Quentin Peel interview, 1 November 2010), others are seen as prone to exaggeration in order to increase donations or for ideological reasons. In fact, senior decision-makers have told us that calls for action from humanitarian NGOs could be counter-productive for making the case within government that costly preventive action was in the national interest (anonymous interviews). Hence, NGOs credibility will always suffer from their commitment to particular missions, but also the perception that their public communication is in fact public relations in the service of organizational maintenance and growth.</p>
<p>Another yet less well-known alternative source of in-depth foreign reporting can be found in the non-profit journalism sector. Organizations like the International Reporting Project (IRP) based at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, the Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting in Washington DC, or the Institute for War and Peace Reporting in London publish quality foreign affairs coverage, often from countries and regions omitted even by elite newspapers. These actors not only provide outlets for publication but also train journalists and help freelancers fund their travel and research. Furthermore they try to facilitate the publication of copy in mainstream media outlets produced by journalists they are funding.</p>
<p>The IRP was founded in 1998 and its funding comes entirely from private foundations. According to its founder, John Schidlovsky, a previous foreign correspondent for the <italic>Baltimore Sun</italic>:
<disp-quote>
<p>The reason for the creation of this project was to enable US media to do a better job of covering international stories at a time when many news organizations were beginning to cut back. If anything, the reason for our project has become even more important, as the trend for cutting resources, reducing resources for foreign coverage has accelerated.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>By now, the IRP has become the most applied for journalism programme in the US with hundreds of applications from US journalists for grants that make it possible to go overseas and do international reporting (John Schidlovsky interview, 28 March 2011).</p>
<p>The emphasis of the project’s work is on the ‘developing world’ because it receives very little coverage compared to its size and population. Furthermore, journalists are sent to potential conflict areas usually not during conflict but before or afterwards when mainstream media interest is low or has faded again:
<disp-quote>
<p>When conflict erupts, the US media actually does a fairly decent job of gathering its forces and spending resources to cover that conflict. We would rather send somebody to an area that no one is covering but has the potential to emerge as a conflict area. Many of our journalists have gone to countries before conflict erupted. They have been able to report on early signs of conflict and warnings of conflict. (John Schidlovsky interview, 28 March 2011)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The Pulitzer Center similarly focuses on under-covered and systemic international issues and seeks to facilitate the production of ‘deeper-dive-type coverage that isn’t the story at the moment’ but which will have ‘value over time’ (Jon Sawyer interview, 28 March 2011). Jon Sawyer, a former foreign reporter for the <italic>St. Louis Post Dispatch</italic>, founded the Center with a grant from the Pulitzer family, who owned and later sold the paper he was working for. Sawyer explained that: ‘The explicit aim of the Center was to make sure that we would fill gaps in coverage and assure that there would be alternative voices, multiple voices. And we didn’t come in with any ideological point of view.’ Initially, the idea was to empower journalists working as freelancers or for regional papers to do in-depth foreign reporting. Yet, work funded by the Pulitzer Center increasingly gets published in national and international media. Sawyer remarked that he didn’t realize the speed with which the old model of foreign reporting would collapse:
<disp-quote>
<p>Pretty quickly we would begin to find work appearing in elite outlets. It was not just helping people writing stories for smaller, regional papers but we were funding stories that were in the <italic>Washington Post, The New York Times</italic>, in <italic>NPR, PBS Frontline</italic> and the <italic>News Hour</italic>. Now we’re working with lots of different players and we try to get a range of outlets across media platforms and keep positioning those issues.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>For the Pulitzer Center, the cooperation with other media outlets offers the opportunity to make people aware of its work and increase the impact of their output because, as Sawyer acknowledged, mainstream and elite media ‘have a lot more reach than we have’.</p>

<title>4. Which way forward?</title>
<p>Before setting out some options for sustaining anticipatory news coverage, it is important to look more closely at those quality news providers who have resisted the trend towards massive closures of their foreign offices. For some of them, having an extensive network of dedicated, experienced and trusted foreign correspondents is part of their brand identity and organizational culture. The <italic>Neue Zürcher Zeitung</italic> (<italic>NZZ</italic>), for instance, prides itself on being an author-led paper, which trusts its correspondents to announce not only what they want to cover, but largely also how much space they want to attribute to it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1750635212458621">3</xref></sup> With the first part of the paper dedicated to foreign affairs, it often leads with foreign news about countries that would never make it to the front page of most newspapers in other countries. In addition, a number of seasoned editors made the case that interpretation and analyses of foreign affairs became more important, not less, and that foreign correspondents were still needed to provide this extra quality. Stefan Kornelius, Foreign Editor of the <italic>Süddeutsche Zeitung</italic> (SZ), thinks that in-depth coverage is exactly what newspapers have to deliver rather more often than less, as ‘snapshot news’ is omnipresent and people are not willing to read this any more. ‘We have to be different and we’re trying to deliver something different’ (Stefan Kornelius interview, 30 November 2010). And Klaus-Dieter Frankenberger, the <italic>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung’s</italic> (<italic>FAZ</italic>) Foreign Editor, voiced a very similar view:
<disp-quote>
<p>People generally know what is happening … We have to provide an added value. And added value doesn’t come from repeating agency reports … That’s not the point of a foreign correspondent. S/he’s showing people a panorama and explains events. That’s why foreign correspondents won’t become extinct. Foreign correspondents dying out, this is against our interest … Feature, analysis, commentary – people know the news anyway. (Klaus-Dieter Frankenberger interview, 15 November 2010)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Thomas Scheen, the Africa correspondent of the <italic>FAZ</italic>, who considers himself one of the lucky few who is still granted permission to choose his stories and pursue research as he sees fit, commented:
<disp-quote>
<p>The whole world is talking about the news media in crisis and that quality is the only way to survive against the internet and YouTube. The <italic>Tagesschau</italic> provides the basic information and ‘we’, the newspapers, follow up with the background the next morning. Making the difference, however, is only possible when authors have enough background knowledge, which they have acquired on the ground. (Thomas Scheen interview, 12 November 2010)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>If everyone else is cutting down on their foreign correspondent network, those papers and organizations that do not follow the herd mentality and ringfence journalistic resources and editorial space for in-depth foreign affairs coverage suddenly stand out from their competitors and may be able to charge customers more for a product that has become more distinct from news on the internet.</p>
<p>However, this model will only be viable for very few news organizations and these will not be able to provide the breadth of geographical coverage and diversity of perspectives that resulted from a large number of media outlets producing their own original coverage. Even if papers like the <italic>NYT</italic> or the <italic>FT</italic> still field impressive correspondent networks and papers like <italic>The Guardian, The Times, FAZ</italic> or <italic>SZ</italic> will continue to afford their own correspondents around the world, their resources are limited and often concentrated on a relatively small number of countries. In our case studies of different conflicts, journalists working for ‘smaller’ papers often contributed crucial pieces that either were significantly ahead of the respective newspapers of record in grasping the true nature of events or even led the way for their larger competitors. When Richard Dowden, the then-Africa Editor of <italic>The Independent</italic>, referred to the violence in Rwanda as ‘genocide’ on 10 April <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750635212458621">1994</xref> (‘Rwanda’s twins locked in eternal war’), he was among the first to employ this term. It was based on his experience and how he understood the general conflict between Hutu and Tutsi (Richard Dowden interview, 8 February 2011). Most media outlets did not use the term before 20 April, quoting Kenneth Roth, the Executive Director of HRW. Two years earlier, it was Roy Gutman, then a correspondent for <italic>Newsday</italic>, who broke the story about Serb concentration camps in Bosnia, which earned him a Pulitzer Prize in 1993. Similarly, the above-mentioned Dominic Johnson, Foreign and Africa Editor of the German daily <italic>tageszeitung</italic>, a newspaper with a circulation of roughly 55,500, is seen as one of the pre-eminent journalists writing about African politics, especially the Great Lakes, in Germany. In the case of Darfur, for example, with the exception of the <italic>SZ</italic>, the <italic>tageszeitung</italic> and Johnson were the first to report on the war in greater depths from December 2003 onwards.</p>
<p>We agree that a return to what Sawyer calls the ‘golden era’ of correspondent-based foreign affairs journalism as in the 1990s and early 2000s would neither be sensible nor realistic under current conditions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1750635212458621">Enda, 2011</xref>). At the same time, this type of journalism will continue to exist but just as one among other models of foreign reporting. From a practical and normative perspective, we do not need to preserve individual newspapers, TV- or radio-channels. What does need to be preserved is the ability of quality news providers to (i) competently monitor developments in more than just a handful of strategically important foreign countries; (ii) cultivate the country and area expertise needed to verify and judge warning signals; and (iii) effectively convey warning messages so that audiences understand potentially harmful trends and why they matter to them.</p>
<p>One potential way forward lies in strengthening non-profit media such as those described above. They offer a distinct and added value by enabling dedicated journalists to spend time on researching an (often overlooked) issue or country in-depth, which may then lead to anticipatory in-depth reporting. Whether or not non-profit media are more or less biased than for-profit media will depend on the funding selection criteria, but there are two other problems: the lack of a continuous presence on the ground as well as the limited impact they have on decision-makers and the public. It is therefore necessary to explore other alternatives. For the <italic>FT</italic>’s Quentin Peel, a potential remedy could be ‘the internet plus media-aware academics, who are specialists in the subject, who can sort of put it into context’. However, he continued to say that ‘most academics work to a completely different time-schedule to any journalist’ which would hamper this kind of cooperation (Quentin Peel interview, 1 November 2010). Yet, we think there is considerable merit in this idea if the collaboration is properly structured and enriched by access to local sources. First of all, the potential gap between academic and media work ‘routines’ is not as great as it may have been in the past. Anticipatory and background coverage is by its very nature less deadline-driven than ordinary news-coverage and there is a growing and sizeable group of academics and other area experts who regularly blog about current affairs or write for consultancies such as Oxford Analytica or the Economist Intelligence Unit. Media organizations should involve country experts not only after a crisis has exploded, but also seek to develop a more formal cooperation with them to detect crises upstream: these experts, who are normally based outside the countries/regions but regularly travel there for research, can help with monitoring developments if they are given access to news agency reporting and other types of open-source intelligence so that they can flag-up unusual events or activities that need to be investigated further. These experts usually have their own local contacts, but could be given modest resources to hire local staff for monitoring or checking up on particular issues or trends and, if necessary, for travelling to the country themselves. They will not need strong financial incentives to keep themselves informed and would greatly appreciate being given access to news agency material as well as the enhanced opportunity to highlight emerging problems in a country or region they typically care about instead of facing the hazards of submitting an op-ed piece that may get rejected. While the media organization will need to initially invest time in order to identify suitable experts to collaborate with and ringfence regular but not frequent slots for such coverage, once the collaboration is set up it will be considerably cheaper than funding a full-time presence in those countries. This solution would also avoid the pitfalls of partisanship and blindness through familiarity that can arise from employing only local journalists, the risk of overwarning arising from inexperienced and financially incentivized Western freelancers, or the risks of inaccuracy and lateness arising from non-expert journalists writing stories on the basis of unverified and de-contextualized data from social media, other forms of ‘crowd-sourcing’ and data-mining.</p>
<p>Finally, adjustments cannot be limited to the media sphere, consumers have to adapt as well. If quality foreign affairs coverage is such a crucial piece of information for decision-makers, it might be worth seeking new sources more actively. We have argued that various sources within the NGO community or non-profit media are increasingly writing reports and analytic pieces that would have been featured in mainstream newspapers 10 years ago. These actors can rely on long-term country experts for their analysis as in the cases of ICG and HRW and usually follow the same journalistic quality standards as mainstream media to make sure that their reporting is accurate, lest their reputations would suffer. While expert communities within government are already to a large degree tuned into these sources, they often struggle to get the attention of decision-makers when mainstream media outlets do not pick them up. In a workshop on the media and preventive policy, a senior EU foreign affairs official complained about the difficulties of getting his peers to go beyond their favourite daily newspaper. It is true that many senior decision-makers are often provided with press-cuttings and selections from a range of sources, but much of that material remains unread. Our interviews suggest that information use among policy-makers is in part a function of their professional background, in particular, whether they are used to processing large quantities of information from diverse sources, such as former journalists and lawyers. There are, however, also indications of a generational gap visible in the preference of some decision-makers for certain newspapers or trusting in certain individuals. In multi-national settings such as the EU, there are also national and linguistic filters to information use. Thus, if decision-makers do not want to miss the warnings that do exist, they will need to leave their informational comfort zone and familiarize themselves with alternative sources.</p>
