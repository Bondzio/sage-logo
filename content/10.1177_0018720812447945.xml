<sec id="section2-0018720812447945">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>In many developed countries, elderly people are overrepresented among pedestrian fatalities from motor vehicle accidents.

<title>Results:</title>
<p>A significant interaction was found between age group and crossing time.

<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>This study implies that even if older pedestrians correctly evaluate the road situation, they may nonetheless endanger themselves by underestimating the time that it will take them to cross the street. We suggest that minimizing this effect could be accomplished by educating seniors to the fact that they are not as fast as they once were and that this fact needs to be factored in to street-crossing decisions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Globally, motor vehicle accidents are a leading cause of death, and many of the fatalities are pedestrians. In the United States in the year 2000, motor vehicles killed almost 3 times as many people as AIDS killed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018720812447945">Mokdad, Marks, Stroup, &amp; Gerberding, 2000</xref>). In Israel, the percentage of vehicular pedestrian deaths is higher than in most Western countries, where they are nonetheless a significant proportion of those killed and maimed in vehicular accidents. Recent statistics show that in Israel, 32% of accident fatalities are pedestrians, compared with 12% in France, 13% in Australia, 21% in the United Kingdom, 14% in Germany, and 11% in the United States (Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics, 2010). In Japan and in large cities in the United States, the rate is comparable to that in Israel (32% and 35%, respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018720812447945">Retting, Ferguson, &amp; McCartt, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018720812447945">World Health Organization, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Among the pedestrians killed, elderly people often represent a disproportionate number relative to their number in the population. In Israel, for example, in the past decade, an average of 162 pedestrians were killed per annum, and of those, 62, or 38%, were older than 65. In the current population of 7.24 million people, there are 710,000, or just fewer than 10%, older than 65. Thus, the elderly are almost 4 times as likely to be a pedestrian fatality relative to their number in the population. These statistics are not unique to Israel. In Australia, persons older than 65 make up less than 13% of the population and account for 32% of pedestrian deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018720812447945">Gorrie, Brown, &amp; Waite, 2008</xref>). In a recent study in Ireland, older people represented 36% of pedestrian fatalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720812447945">Martin, Hand, Trace, &amp; O’Neill, 2010</xref>). The phenomenon whereby elderly people are disproportionately represented in pedestrian fatalities is not new. In 1982, elderly people were disproportionately represented in Montreal pedestrian fatalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720812447945">Allard, 1982</xref>). This trend is widespread although not universal. For example, in the United States, death rates of pedestrians older than 65 are lower than for most age groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018720812447945">Campbell, Zegeer, Huang, &amp; Cynecki, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018720812447945">Zegeer, Stutts, Huang, Zhou, &amp; Rodgman, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>The disproportionate representation of elderly people among pedestrian fatalities is of increasing importance for two reasons. In many Western countries, the percentage of elderly people within the population is increasing. At the same time, in many Western countries, pedestrian traffic fatalities are declining, but the rate of decline for fatalities among elderly pedestrians lags behind the overall positive trend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018720812447945">Gorrie et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to help gain an understanding of the causes and explanations behind the higher rate of elders’ injuries and fatalities as pedestrians. There are most likely multiple factors, many of which have previously been studied.</p>
<sec id="section7-0018720812447945">
<title>Explanations for Elderly Pedestrian Fatalities</title>
<p>The most parsimonious explanation for this trend might simply be that it is a statistical aberration. Older pedestrians who are involved in motor vehicle accidents are much more likely to be seriously injured or killed than younger people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018720812447945">Gorrie et al., 2008</xref>), probably because of their frailty. Thus, according to this explanation, they are no more likely to be involved in a motor vehicle accident, but the results of such an event are more often fatal.</p>
<p>Another statistical explanation is that it is incorrect to simply look at elderly people as a percentage of the population when discussing pedestrian accidents, just like it would be incorrect when dealing with vehicle-to-vehicle accidents. In the latter case, it would be standard to look at some more meaningful measure, such as kilometers driven, and elderly people would probably be less represented than in the general population. So, too, in evaluating pedestrian fatalities, it might be proper to look at kilometers walked or, even better, hours spent walking. For elderly people, walking is a more important form of transport than for younger adults such that the percentage of a person’s travel time on foot is highest for those older than 65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018720812447945">Keall, 1995</xref>), which might explain the seemingly higher rate of pedestrian fatalities.</p>
<p>Other explanations for this unfortunate statistic relate to the effect that aging has on various sensory, motor, and cognitive abilities. As people age, neurodegenerative diseases that result in mild to severe dementia become more prevalent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018720812447945">Gao, Hendrie, Hall, &amp; Hui, 1998</xref>). In addition, many older people develop mild cognitive impairment that affects functioning but is not diagnosable as dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018720812447945">Lindesay, Briggs, &amp; Murphy, 1989</xref>). This impairment can affect executive function and other skills that are needed to successfully cross a busy intersection.</p>
<p>Dual tasking often increases reaction time and complicates the tasks, and it has been suggested that walking as a secondary task is more difficult for elderly people, which also may play a role in the increased accident rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018720812447945">Sparrow, Bradshaw, Lamoureux, &amp; Tirosh, 2002</xref>). To successfully cross a street without getting struck by a motor vehicle, a pedestrian needs to be aware of all approaching vehicles, whether they are forward moving or reversing; to estimate the time to arrival of the vehicles; to estimate the time needed to cross the street; and then to make a decision to proceed only when the latter time is shorter than the former. Among older people, vision and hearing are often impaired or at least degraded. This impairment may affect a person’s ability to see and hear motor vehicles, which in turn can affect the detection of vehicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018720812447945">Mohr et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Cognitive factors may also play a role. Older people may simply be less attuned to their surroundings and changes in those surrounding. An important factor in negotiating the street is distance estimation, and elderly people, even when they detect an approaching vehicle, may be poor at estimating its distance. This poor estimation may be linked to impaired depth perception among elderly people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720812447945">Bian &amp; Andersen, 2008</xref>). Alternatively, it is possible that elderly people are poor at time estimation. Several studies dealing with time estimation among elderly people, both prospective and retrospective, indicate an effect of aging but show inconclusive results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018720812447945">Wearden, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Motor function decline can also play a role. Older people walk slower than younger people, thus increasing their “street time” while crossing streets and increasing the risk of an accident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720812447945">Langlois et al., 1997</xref>). Both older pedestrians and drivers need to be cognizant of this increased street time to avoid an accident.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0018720812447945">
<title>Motor Imagery and Aging</title>
<p>The decrease in physical activity that takes place during the process of aging has a negative influence not only on physical fitness, which causes elderly people to walk slower, but also on the ability to imagine the performance of movements, particularly in relation to self-movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018720812447945">Mulder, Hochstenbach, van Heuvelen, &amp; den Otter, 2007</xref>). From an internal perspective, imagery refers to the ability to imagine that one is performing the movement oneself, together with the appropriate kinesthetic sensations. From an external perspective, imagery refers to the ability to imagine that someone else is performing the movement. It is not known whether a differentiation takes place between these two imagery modes when one ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018720812447945">Mulder et al., 2007</xref>). In a study aimed at examining whether the ability to imagine movements was influenced by age, it was found that older participants (&gt;65 years old) were slightly worse in motor imagery capacity than were younger participants, particularly in relation to motor imagery from an internal (first-person) perspective. The elderly participants showed better imagery scores when they had to imagine movements from an external perspective compared with the imagery scores obtained from the internal perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018720812447945">Mulder et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In another study, the effects of advanced age on motor imagery ability was examined in the context of estimation of reachability, that is, estimating whether an object is within reach or out of grasp. Results indicated that the younger group was significantly more accurate than were the older adults. Whereas both groups made more errors in extrapersonal space, the values were significantly higher for the older group; that is, they overestimated to a greater extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018720812447945">Gabbard, Cacola, &amp; Cordova, 2011</xref>). These findings add to the general notion that there is a decline in the ability to mentally represent action with advanced age.</p>

<sec id="section9-0018720812447945">
<title>Motor Imagery and Street Crossing</title>
<p>To safely cross a street, a pedestrian is required to estimate the gap in traffic and then evaluate whether that duration is greater than the time it will take him or her to cross the street. The second half of this equation is a motor imagery task in which the pedestrian imagines himself or herself crossing the street and estimates the time it will take. He or she then compares this estimate to the estimated time of arrival of any oncoming traffic and, if it is shorter, proceeds to cross (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018720812447945">Papadelis, Kourtidou-Papadeli, Bamidis, &amp; Albani, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>It is important to note that there are two estimates that need to be made to safely cross a road: (a) the time it takes the individual to cross the road and (b) the time of arrival of the next vehicle. Our study focused only on the first aspect. Others have shown that various factors, such as speed and distance of the car, can affect the ability to accurately judge the second component, the time of arrival of the vehicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018720812447945">Oxley, Ihsen, Fildes, Charlton, &amp; Day, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>We hypothesized that some elderly (compared with young) pedestrians fail in the motor imagery task and thus do poorly at estimating how long it will take them to get to the other side. The aim of our study was to compare estimated with actual crossing time for elderly and young pedestrians and to see whether there is a difference that can explain at least part of the overrepresentation of elderly people among pedestrian fatalities.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 36 volunteers; 19 composed the elderly persons group (12 women, <italic>M</italic>
<sub>Age</sub> = 75.45, median<sub>Age</sub> = 74.00, <italic>SD</italic> = 5.53; and 7 men, <italic>M</italic>
<sub>Age</sub> = 79.71, median<sub>Age</sub> = 79.00, <italic>SD</italic> = 7.02), and 17 students composed the undergraduates group. All participants gave informed consent prior to participation.</p>
<p>For the older participants in the study, we were interested in the subpopulation that is more likely to be involved as pedestrians in motor vehicle accidents. Those who are not independent and are regularly accompanied by an escort will likely not be involved in accidents. Which seniors will be involved? Those seniors who are independent and are participating in multiple activities will. Such individuals are precisely those represented in the senior citizen club from which we took our participants. We were interested in older individuals who are active yet sense that they are elderly, that is, individuals who are independent yet feel a need to be in a somewhat protected environment. To recruit such individuals, we approached a senior citizen club in the Tel Aviv area and requested participation of their members and used membership in the club as an inclusion criterion for the study. All members visit the club thrice weekly, and the daily program includes some form of occupational therapy, gymnastics, and lectures. Membership in the club is contingent on meeting certain criteria of everyday independent functioning, good health, good mental and physical condition, and social skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018720812447945">Tel Aviv City, n.d.</xref>).</p>
<p>The elderly participants who attended the club and participated in the study reported their everyday life functioning. They were asked to answer to what extent they agree with some statements concerning their capabilities on a scale of 1 (<italic>absolutely agree</italic>) to 6 (<italic>absolutely disagree</italic>). Most of them live on their own and do not need any assistance in functioning (<italic>M</italic> = 1.63, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.06), shop alone (<italic>M</italic> = 1.63, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.41), and go out of their home at least once a day (<italic>M</italic> = 2.38, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.85). They also reported their road-use habits and declared that they cross streets at least once every 2 days (<italic>M</italic> = 2.00, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.31).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0018720812447945">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The grouping variable in this study was age group (young or elderly). The dependent variables measured were precrossing time estimation, actual crossing time, and postcrossing time estimation, all in seconds.</p>
<p>Each participant was asked to complete three tasks, and the entire process was repeated twice. The first task was a prospective time estimation of road crossing. Participants stood at the edge of a 7-meter-wide road that was free of any obstacles and that the experimenter had determined was free of oncoming traffic. The participant was asked to estimate the time it would take him or her to cross the road. This time estimation was conducted in the following manner: The participant was instructed to estimate the time it would take him or her to cross the road using a motor imagery process. Motor imagery can be described as an active cognitive process in which movements are mentally rehearsed without any overt body movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018720812447945">Mulder et al., 2007</xref>). The motor imagery process started as soon as the experimenter announced, “Start,” and ended when the participant announced his or her mental arrival. There were no practice sessions, as this task was deemed simple, and indeed, none of the participants had trouble understanding it or performing it. The instructions did not emphasize speed but, rather, emphasized that the participant should envision crossing at his or her usual pace. This procedure was repeated for the next two tasks as well.</p>
<p>Following the estimation, participants were requested to actually cross the street, thus providing an actual crossing time. Measurement of crossing time began from a stationary state, and the participants were told to begin crossing on the cue from the experimenter.</p>
<p>Following the actual street crossing, participants were asked to estimate the time it took them to cross the road, again using mental imagery. Participants accomplished this retrospective time estimation of road crossing by visualizing themselves as they began to cross the street on a signal from the experimenter and then indicating when they visualized reaching the other side.</p>

<sec id="section13-0018720812447945">
<title>Locations</title>
<p>The experiment took place in two locations, one for the elderly participants and one for the college students. The two sites were selected to be near the day center and near the university but as similar to each other as possible in traffic features. Both were one-way streets approximately 7 m wide with minimal traffic volume. The two streets are located in small, quiet neighborhoods in the center of the country. Very few vehicles pass by these streets (approximately 20 vehicles hourly at between 30 and 40 km/h). Also, very few other pedestrians passed by (approximately 30 hourly). The experiment was carried out during daytime hours in clear weather.</p>

Pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni adjustment indicated that elderly persons’ actual crossing time (<italic>M</italic> = 8.31, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.54) was significantly longer than both their precrossing evaluation (<italic>M</italic> = 5.69, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.31) and their postcrossing evaluation (<italic>M</italic> = 5.56, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.33), <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and evaluations did not significantly differ from each other. In contrast, the undergraduate group’s crossing times failed to display a significant difference across measurements.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Motor programming theory suggests that an integral component in an effective outcome is an adequate action representation of the movements, that is, the ability to create an appropriate and effective action representation used to plan and execute movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018720812447945">Gabbard et al., 2011</xref>). In this study, participants were asked to estimate the time needed to cross a road. The results showed no significant differences in both prospective and retrospective time estimation across age groups. However, significant differences between the age groups were found in the time for actually crossing the road. Since the estimations made by the elderly group do not differ from those made by the undergraduate group, seemingly, these results suggest that elderly people do not suffer from motor imagery impairment. However, prospective time estimation was conducted in regard to the actual crossing time, showing time estimation of this elderly group to be inaccurate. It seems that prospective time estimation among elderly people is impaired and might partially explain the overrepresentation of this group among pedestrian fatalities from motor vehicle accidents.</p>
<p>In a real-life study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018720812447945">Oxley, Fildes, Ihsen, Charlton, &amp; Day, 1997</xref>) in which older and younger pedestrians were observed crossing a two-lane highway, some interesting differences in behavior were observed. The time to start, or “kerb delay,” was significantly different between the two groups, whereby the elderly participants took longer to take the first step. The researchers also found that older pedestrians behaved in a less safe manner in that although they left longer times before the arrival of the next car, they also took disproportionately longer to cross. This finding can be explained with our finding that elderly people are poor at judging how long it will take them to cross the street.</p>
<p>It is important to note that there are two estimates that need to be made to safely cross a road: (a) the time it takes the individual to cross the road and (b) the time of arrival of the next vehicle. Our study focused only on the first aspect. Others have shown that various factors, such as speed and distance of the car, can affect the ability to accurately judge time of arrival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018720812447945">Oxley et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018720812447945">Lobjois &amp; Cavallo, 2009</xref>) have shown that vehicle speed plays a role in the time gap selected, whereby elderly people do not take faster speeds into account and select shorter gaps for faster cars. This behavior can also play a role in increasing the number of accidents and the severity of those accidents.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the difference found in our study between the predicted crossing time of the older adults compared with their actual crossing time was highly significant not only in a statistical sense but in a road-crossing sense as well. The 2-s difference is a huge disparity. For a car on a side street traveling at 40 miles per hour (60 km/h), those 2 s represent a distance of approximately 120 feet (33 m) of travel, a distance that can be the difference between life and death for a pedestrian.</p>
<p>A party interested in guaranteeing safe crossing of roads is the authorities who design the infrastructure. In a Dublin study in which a strong inverse correlation was found between age and walking speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018720812447945">Romero-Ortuño, Cogan, Cunningham, &amp; Kenny, 2010</xref>), and in a Spanish study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018720812447945">Romero-Ortuño, 2010</xref>), it was found that crossing times at intersections are insufficient for elderly people. Studies have shown that if the duration of the yellow and red signals is modified, pedestrian crashes can be significantly reduced, and it is thus recommended that in areas with a high concentration of elderly people, a walking speed of no greater than 1.0 m/s be assumed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018720812447945">Retting et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In Israel, streetlights at intersections are designed so that pedestrians can cross at a rate of 4 km/h (1.11 m/s). If seniors are walking slower than that rate, the system is stacked against them. In the United States, lights are usually timed for a walking speed of 1.22 m/s, although in some high-density areas in New Haven, Connecticut, the assumed walking speed is a slow 0.92 m/s. In several studies, it was found that more than 90% of people older than 72 walk slower than that, and in a study in which they were specifically told to cross at a fast speed, 60% were still slower than 1.22 m/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720812447945">Langlois et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>What we are suggesting is that indeed, accidents involving older pedestrians sometimes result when older adults try, but fail, to precisely time their walk between gaps in traffic. In most instances, they do time it correctly, and in others, the incoming car slows down. Many elderly do cross the street safely. What we were looking for is that slight disadvantage that older pedestrians have that might help explain their overrepresentation among pedestrian fatalities. On the basis of our findings, we suggest that older adults’ underestimating their crossing time may be one such factor.</p>
<p>In summary, to safely cross a road, a pedestrian must accurately evaluate the road condition such that he or she knows when the next vehicle will arrive, and he or she must evaluate his or her own crossing time. This study did not examine the ability of older pedestrians to correctly evaluate the road situation, and it may be that they are impaired in that judgment as well. What this study did address is their ability to correctly estimate their own crossing time, and we found that they may endanger themselves by underestimating the time it will take them to cross the street. We suggest that minimizing this effect could be accomplished by educating seniors to the fact that they are not as fast as they used to be in the past and that this fact needs to be factored into street-crossing decisions. In parallel, drivers should be aware of this trend and take it into consideration when giving way to elderly people.</p>
<p>A training protocol for the elderly pedestrian could be beneficial. It could be simulator based, possibly involving crossing actual streets, and give seniors some feedback as to the accuracy of their estimations. Evidence on the effectiveness of training aimed at older drivers is limited but sufficiently encouraging to merit further research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018720812447945">Kua, Korner-Bitensky, Desrosiers, Man-Son-Hing, &amp; Marshall, 2007</xref>). This evidence refers to physical therapy, perceptual therapy, driver education, and other training. There are even fewer studies that deal with training for older pedestrians. One of the few studies that deal with training elderly pedestrians assessed the effectiveness of a training program for older pedestrians that combined behavioral and educational interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018720812447945">Dommes, Cavallo, Vieenne, &amp; Aillerie, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>In line with that study, we suggest that senior centers, such as the one in which we conducted our study, test older pedestrians before and after training in road crossing using the method we examined in the current study (imaginary and cognitive). The older participants would be asked to perform the task of assessing the time required to cross a street, then to perform an actual crossing and to become aware of the time it took them. This procedure should be repeated several times until the older pedestrians become accurate in their assessments such that the gap between their precrossing estimate and the actual crossing time is reduced to a minimum. Trainers should repeat this evaluation after 6 months to ascertain that the training has been retained and to reinforce it.</p>
