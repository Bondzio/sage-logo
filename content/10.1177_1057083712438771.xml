<abstract>
<p>In recent years, professional development has become a topic of an increasing amount of research. However, studies are often general in nature or focused on beginning teachers specifically. Recently, researchers have begun to explore professional development over the course of a teacher’s entire career. The purpose of this study was to investigate the professional development needs of a particular population of experienced teachers: those known as second-stage teachers, commonly defined as teachers who have experience of 4 to 10 years and have passed the “survival years.” Research questions were as follows: (a) How do second-stage music teachers describe their professional development experiences? and (b) How do second-stage music teachers perceive their professional development needs? Findings are organized into the following themes: forms of professional development, professional development needs at different times, obstacles to professional development, and concerns about a lack of professional development.</p>

<p>Professional development has been identified in recent years as an area of particular importance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1057083712438771">Ester (2007)</xref> observed, “Given the pace of change in society at large and education in particular, quality professional development is an absolutely essential element of the profession” (p. 4). Although research has been conducted on the professional development of music teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1057083712438771">Bauer, Forsythe, &amp; Kinney, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1057083712438771">Hookey, 2002</xref>), investigations have often been either general in nature or focused on beginning teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1057083712438771">Conway &amp; Christensen, 2006</xref>). Recent researchers have explored professional development as it pertains to the experienced music teacher, defined as “an in-service teacher who has been in the field beyond the first few years of teaching” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1057083712438771">Conway, 2007</xref>, p. 9), as well as professional development over the course of a teacher’s entire career. In a review of professional development for the experienced music teacher, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1057083712438771">Bauer (2007)</xref> concluded, “It is essential that additional research on all aspects of professional development for the experienced music teacher be conducted” (p. 20).</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate professional development as perceived by a specific population of experienced music teachers: those identified in educational research as second-stage teachers. Second-stage teachers have passed the initial years of teaching, or “survival years,” and are often characterized with terms such as <italic>professional teacher</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1057083712438771">Steffy, Wolfe, Pasch, &amp; Enz, 2000</xref>). Research questions were as follows: (a) How do second-stage music teachers describe their professional development experiences? and (b) How do second-stage music teachers perceive their professional development needs?</p>
<sec id="section1-1057083712438771">
<title>Professional Development</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1057083712438771">Hookey (2002)</xref> states, “At a fundamental level, <italic>professional development</italic> refers to a change in a teacher’s knowledge base and actions” (p. 888). She defines professional development as “the set of activities designed to promote personal professional change” and “a lifelong project” (p. 888). The latter is a strong statement of the need for continued professional development and, therefore, investigation into professional development itself, whether or not teachers’ professional development needs remain consistent, and what teachers specifically feel that they need to grow as professionals.</p>
<p>Recent research has indicated that music teachers’ needs and interests for professional development may change over the course of their careers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1057083712438771">Bauer et al., 2009</xref>). In a study of 19 experienced music teachers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1057083712438771">Conway (2008)</xref> concluded that, “the professional development needs of these music teachers may have changed throughout their careers” (p. 16). As a further indication of the need to explore experienced teachers’ professional development, the Society for Music Teacher Education has identified Professional Development for the Experienced Teacher as an Area for Strategic Planning and Action. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1057083712438771">Bauer (2007)</xref> advised that
<disp-quote>
<p>increased discernment of the professional development preferences and needs of experienced music teachers, the professional development needs of teachers at different stages of their careers, the role of professional development in the retention of teachers and in the quality of their professional life, and the types of professional development appropriate for specific teaching areas and responsibilities must be sought.

<title>The Second Stage</title>
<p>Educational research has recently focused on a specific portion of teachers’ careers: the time immediately following the first few years of teaching, referred to as the “second stage” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1057083712438771">Berg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1057083712438771">Charner-Laird, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1057083712438771">Donaldson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1057083712438771">Donaldson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1057083712438771">Kirkpatrick, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1057083712438771">Szczesiul, 2007</xref>), where specific topics have included differentiated roles, professional collaboration, support and retention of newly-tenured teachers, job engagement, and career development. More precise definitions of the second stage use such criteria as the specific number of years’ teaching experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1057083712438771">Charner-Laird, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1057083712438771">Donaldson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1057083712438771">Donaldson et al., 2005</xref>), characteristics (level of self-confidence), or factors, such as tenure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1057083712438771">Berg et al., 2005</xref>). The second stage has also been given names, such as “professional teacher” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1057083712438771">Steffy et al., 2000</xref>), “stabilizing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1057083712438771">Leithwood, 1992</xref>), “stabilization” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1057083712438771">Huberman, 1993</xref>), and “competency building” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1057083712438771">Fessler &amp; Christensen, 1992</xref>). Common themes across the definitions are an increase in self-confidence, a shift from self-focus to student focus, and an interest in greater pedagogical mastery.</p>
<p>Additionally, second-stage teachers are frequently described as having passed the initial “survival stage” of teaching. Evidence in both general education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1057083712438771">Ingersoll &amp; Smith, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1057083712438771">Smith &amp; Ingersoll, 2004</xref>) and music education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1057083712438771">Hancock, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1057083712438771">Madsen &amp; Hancock, 2002</xref>) indicates that a large percentage of teachers leave within the first 5 years. Although second-stage teachers have passed the initial survival stage, attrition rates remain high in both music and general education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1057083712438771">Donaldson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1057083712438771">Hancock, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1057083712438771">Luekens, Lyter, Fox, &amp; Chandler, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1057083712438771">Huberman (1993)</xref> even terms this portion of the career as a “danger zone.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1057083712438771">Berg et al. (2005)</xref> argue, “Teachers who become frustrated by their attempts to experiment and grow tend to leave” (p. 4). Moreover, Berg et al. suggest that the results of second-stage attrition can be substantial: “Attrition comes with significant financial and educational costs. Hiring, induction, and mentoring expenses associated with new teachers are substantial, and they are incurred not only when teachers leave the profession, but also when they change districts and schools” (p. 2).</p>

<sec id="section3-1057083712438771" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1057083712438771">Bauer (2007)</xref> suggests a need for multiple modes of inquiry to be used with regard to this topic: “Well-designed quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods investigations are needed to develop broad perspectives and detailed understandings of this complex phenomenon” (p. 20). This qualitative study used a multiple descriptive case study design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1057083712438771">Merriam, 1998</xref>, pp. 29-31, 40). Merriam states that cases can be distinguished from other forms of qualitative research in that they are “intensive descriptions and analyses of a <italic>single unit</italic> or <italic>bounded system</italic>,” also giving as examples “an individual, program, event, group, intervention, or community” (p. 19). The bounded system in this study is second-stage music educators. Merriam also writes, “<italic>Descriptive</italic> means that the end product of a case study is a “rich ‘thick’ description of the phenomenon under study” (p. 29).</p>
<sec id="section4-1057083712438771">
<title>Sampling</title>
<p>The study used a purposeful sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1057083712438771">Merriam, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1057083712438771">Patton, 2002</xref>) of music teachers in the second stage of their careers (<italic>N</italic> = 3). The participants are referred to as Sarah, Janean, and Taryn (pseudonyms). All three were European American and female. They represent a variety of levels (elementary, middle, and high school) and areas (band, general, choral, strings, music appreciation, and drum line). This diversity of level and subject gave the potential for the second stage to be viewed through a variety of musical, as well as level-specific, lenses while still maintaining the small number of participants recommended for descriptive case study research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1057083712438771">Creswell, 2006</xref>). Participants’ characteristics are summarized in the following table:</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Given the variety of second-stage descriptions in the research literature, sample selection can be problematic. Research into new teachers is clear: 1 to 3 years of experience is a common criterion. With the emphasis on attrition in second-stage literature, I specifically used number of years of teaching experience as the initial criterion here. Based on the evidence that a large percentage of teachers (as many as 50%) leave teaching entirely within 5 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1057083712438771">Ingersoll &amp; Smith, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1057083712438771">Smith &amp; Ingersoll, 2004</xref>), I defined the second stage as beginning at Year 6.</p>
<p>A faculty member, who had worked with them as both preservice and in-service music teachers initially, recommended the specific participants. The current researcher made the final selection based on this recommendation, 6 or more years of teaching experience, and my own observations of the participants (I had observed two of them teaching, as well as served with them on a panel discussion on urban teaching).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1057083712438771">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Data were collected through a background survey, a journal, three individual semistructured interviews, and a focus group interview with all participants. Each participant completed an 18-item, open-ended survey. The survey was used to ascertain basic background information (ethnic background, level of education, areas taught, and specifics of teaching experience). After each participant’s background survey had been returned, I sent her directions for keeping a journal, as well as a journal prompt on which to focus the first journal entry. Initial journal prompts included the following: Please take a couple of days and reflect on your time as a new teacher. Do you ever notice yourself being reminded of your time as a new teacher? What are your thoughts? What seems different now? Additional journal prompts were given after each interview. Subsequently, I interviewed each participant three times using a semistructured format (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1057083712438771">Seidman, 2006</xref>). Finally, after all interviews were completed, I held a focus group interview with all three participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1057083712438771">
<title>Validity</title>
<p>The trustworthiness (validity) of this study was addressed through data collection triangulation, member checks, and the focus group interview. The use of multiple sources of data (background survey, journal entries, individual interviews, and focus group interview) constitutes data collection triangulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1057083712438771">Denzin &amp; Lincoln, 2006</xref>). The participants reviewed their interview and focus group transcripts for accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1057083712438771">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985</xref>) and were also periodically given emerging findings and analysis to review.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1057083712438771">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Interviews and the focus group were audiotaped and transcribed by the researcher. After transcribing the interviews, I coded them for categories and themes, using the research questions as the primary analytical lens. Data were analyzed using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1057083712438771">Merriam’s (1998)</xref> constant-comparative model.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1057083712438771">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>Each participant’s story is presented individually, followed by a collective discussion. The data are organized based on three primary themes: forms of professional development, professional development needs at different times, and obstacles to obtaining professional development. In some cases, additional categories emerged.</p>
<sec id="section9-1057083712438771">
<title>Sarah</title>
<p>Sarah had taught elementary general and choral music for 4 years in a large urban district before taking a 1-year sabbatical to complete her master’s in music (MM) in music education. She was currently in her third year teaching elementary general and choral music in a small charter district in the same large city.</p>
<sec id="section10-1057083712438771">
<title>Forms of professional development</title>
<p>Sarah described a variety of forms of professional development, both formal and informal. She had completed her MM, had become certified in Gordon’s Music Learning Theory, and had participated in a 3-week trip to Africa to study Ghanaian music. Sarah attended conferences and workshops but stated that those alone were insufficient: “I need to renew more often and in a variety of different ways, not just once a year at the state conference.” Sarah summarized some of her professional development experiences:
<disp-quote>
<p>I continue to grow as a teacher by seeking out knowledge (publications, workshops), taking breaks, and fostering relationships with my students and other educators (music, general ed.). . . . going to a workshop or having a meaningful discussion with another teacher will often give me the shot in the arm that I really need.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sarah also served as the fine arts coordinator at her school, a role that she credits with fostering her development as a professional:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think becoming the team leader for the AMPP program . . . AMPP: arts, music, PE, and performing arts—that definitely changed a lot for me. The focus became much more not just on my piece of the puzzle at school, but a larger team idea.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Finally, Sarah also found participation in this study to be professional development:
<disp-quote>
<p>seeing the amount of growth that I’ve experienced in talking about it. It’s a little bit shocking for me in many ways. . . . you do your daily thing and all of a sudden, in writing and in talking, I am really reflecting back on where it was that I started from.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1057083712438771">
<title>Professional Development Needs at Different Times</title>
<p>Sarah identified specific times in her career when she felt that there was a need for certain kinds of professional development. After her third year of teaching, Sarah became certified in Music Learning Theory:
<disp-quote>
<p>That was something that I needed. I think I only had in my repertoire what I had learned in undergrad, and that was really running stale for me at that point. I needed a new perspective, and it provided a new perspective and a new methodology for me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>More important than the content was the timing: “I don’t think that it was the fact that it was specifically Music Learning Theory. I think it could have been Orff. I think it could have been Kodály. But I was ready at that point for more content.”</p>
<p>Additionally, Sarah completed her MM after her fourth year, describing it as “the most invigorating, renewing thing that’s ever happened in my career.” Furthermore, her MM work sparked an interest in continuing toward a PhD and college teaching.</p>
<sec id="section12-1057083712438771">
<title>Obstacles to professional development</title>
<p>Sarah felt “taken for granted” by her administration. Ironically, the problem was a lack of problems. Having achieved competence in classroom management, Sarah had few disruptions. To her administration’s perception, everything was running smoothly in the music classroom, and therefore, she did not need any extra attention:
<disp-quote>
<p>My administrators are extremely supportive and appreciative. I don’t feel that I receive support for renewal, however, especially for reflection and professional development. I am not observed often—after all, the music room is a place of enthusiasm and Ms. [ ] is organized, manages well and is enthusiastic with the kids! From my administrators’ perspective, I have it all together.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This lack of feedback was a concern: “I am thinking ‘How do I ever improve my teaching practice if I don’t ever get any sort of constructive feedback?’” Sarah’s sentiments clearly indicate that she <italic>does</italic> perceive a need for both feedback and support.</p>
<p>Also, Sarah was interested in pursuing a doctorate and becoming a college professor. However, she identified family issues as an obstacle. More specifically, given her needs for child care, she would not be able to enter a doctoral program far from her current home: “Taking account of [my] family situation and wanting to have a second child . . . I don’t see that starting a PhD and having a second child is a good plan for the same year.”</p>
<p>Additionally, Sarah lost her job as a result of taking a sabbatical to complete her MM:
<disp-quote>
<p>[A]s much as I went and called . . . officially I was fired in April. For abandoning my job. Because they hadn’t processed my paperwork. . . . they lost my paperwork and said that I hadn’t filed it even though I had my copies stamped and everything. Huge mess. It still says on my records . . . that I abandoned my job.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this case, the obstacle came from the district through administrative risks in taking an official leave from a job that the teacher currently holds. The second-stage teacher, who has already spent several years in the profession, might be presented with very real difficulties for obtaining graduate education—the risk of job loss.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1057083712438771">
<title>Janean</title>
<p>Janean had taught middle school band for 4 years in a large urban district before being laid off because of budget cuts. She was currently in her third year teaching high school band music theory and music appreciation in the same large city district.</p>
<sec id="section14-1057083712438771">
<title>Forms of professional development</title>
<p>Similar to Sarah, Janean discussed both formal and informal types of professional development, such as attending meetings and maintaining relationships with other directors: “[Going] to the [state] conference every year. Staying in close touch with what’s going on with some of the thriving programs around.” Additionally, Janean was pursuing her master’s degree. Although not in music specifically, she still perceived an integral relationship between her master’s and her work as a music educator. Janean was completing a master of social work: “I was doing a lot of social work as a music educator. And I decided to pursue a master’s in that to fuel my role as a music educator.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1057083712438771">
<title>Obstacles to professional development</title>
<p>Time for professional development was an issue for Janean: She received only 1 day per year for professional development. Additionally, Janean encountered difficulties in implementing new ideas based on her own professional development: “There has not been room to be innovative . . . Within this school, the things that I am able to improve upon would really have no place to be employed, or opportunity to be employed.” For example, although Janean sought to implement a comprehensive music program with a greater concert band presence and a focus on literacy, she stated that her administration wanted an exclusive focus on marching band and public performance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1057083712438771">
<title>Leaving music teaching</title>
<p>During her third interview, Janean told me that she had decided not to return to her position. Janean’s obstacle to professional development in the form of implementing changes, encountered over several years, was a primary factor:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’m being asked to do things and make things happen that [go] against why I’m interested in teaching music anyway. And it’s only going to get worse, I feel . . . It doesn’t fit with how music education should be made available, and how I can be an effective music educator and maintain the integrity of music education.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As a 7-year veteran who was highly regarded by colleagues and active in district events (Janean was currently serving as the district adjudication chair), her decision to leave represents the loss of a motivated, active music educator.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section17-1057083712438771">
<title>Taryn</title>
<sec id="section18-1057083712438771">
<title>Forms of professional development</title>
<p>Taryn also experienced both formal and informal professional development. She was pursuing a master’s in curriculum and instruction: “I am kind of in a master’s that I am interested in because I would really like to do music curriculum, which is interesting because I don’t plan as much as I should.” Moreover, similar to Sarah, Taryn said that conversation with colleagues was an important part of professional growth:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think that a big part of it is just talking. This is probably the most that I have ever spoken with a colleague, ever. . . . So just sitting down with people that I can converse and they know exactly what I am talking about—that’s the best thing.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Research has strongly suggested that second-stage teachers benefit from taking on leadership roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1057083712438771">Donaldson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1057083712438771">Fiarman, 2007</xref>) at the school or district level, as well as in professional organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1057083712438771">Steffy et al., 2000</xref>). Although Taryn was not interested in a leadership role within a professional organization, she was interested in large-scale curriculum writing: “I’ve kind of wanted to become a curriculum specialist because I <italic>really</italic> enjoy putting that sort of stuff together. I did the one for the district.” This would be a significant role indeed, as Taryn taught in a large urban district.</p>
<p>Finally, Taryn had been reflecting and writing extensively on her thoughts and experiences about music education for years. She had not, however, considered the possibility that the act of writing and reflection might itself be a form of professional development. After her third interview, Taryn sent me two documents that she had written during her third year titled “Set Up to Fail: A Crisis in Urban Music Education: Thoughts and Tips From an ‘Urban’ Music Teacher” and “The Real Reason Public Schools Are Failing: An Insider’s Look at the Mess.” Both of these were lengthy ruminations on issues in urban music education and on education in general.</p>

<title>Professional development needs at different times</title>
<p>Taryn’s professional development needs changed fundamentally in the second stage as, earlier in her career, she had perceived no need for professional development at all: “Confident and energetic then. Indestructible would be a better way to say it. I remember a couple of pieces that we had done, and I remember thinking that there was <italic>No Way</italic> that I could fail.” This may be because of the fact that she perceived few classroom management needs, a very common concern among new teachers, as she was taking over a program with well-established routines with which she was already familiar. However, her perceptions changed after the first few years: “When I started, I knew everything. . . . Now that I have that experience and can reflect back I think, ‘Wow, I don’t know as much as I think I do, do I!’” Taryn also discussed feeling the need to review material:
<disp-quote>
<p>Do I go back and take beginning theory again, or beginning score study again, . . . I think there is this learning from “I know everything” to now “I know quite a bit, but I don’t know as much as I should.” That’s where I am right now.</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section20-1057083712438771">
<title>Obstacles to professional development</title>
<p>Taryn had faced a number of obstacles to obtaining professional development. Those included fear of losing her well-established program, fewer observations as a veteran teacher, and a history of negative experiences at state events, specifically interactions with colleagues: “I’ve been burned so many times that I don’t even put my foot forward.”</p>
<p>Although she is required to get a master’s, Taryn was unable to pursue the program that she wanted. Similar to Sarah, Taryn is concerned about losing her specific job as a result of taking time away from her school during the academic year:
<disp-quote>
<p>I was disappointed because the master’s that I really wanted required me to spend time away from my job. And, in [state] right now, that is very dangerous . . . I can go to the board and I can petition the board to say “Can I take a sabbatical for a year to do my master’s degree?” They will grant it but they don’t guarantee . . . You’ll get a job back, but you might not get <italic>your</italic> job back.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is not simply a fear of unemployment. Taryn is not willing to risk the loss of the band program that she has been building for 9 years:
<disp-quote>
<p>I put way too much time into this program to leave and risk not getting it back because it’s a target right now—brand new facilities, new building, great program. If I were to step out for a second, someone would have it right away.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This may be even more common for second-stage teachers who have invested several years building programs, rather than beginning teachers who will not have as much time invested in one program.</p>
<p>Finally, Taryn was often unsuccessful in seeking professional development through interactions with her district colleagues: “I haven’t met with high school teachers for a year and a half or more. I talk to one director frequently. Other than that it seems like there is no interest.” She has approached other band directors and asked if she could observe them, as well as asked them if they would be willing to observe her, and has met with resistance: “I know that what I’m doing is not perfect, and if there’s something that you’re doing that I think will work for me, then I’d like to know because I’d like to use it.” She also said, “I feel like people are looking to me to help them be better teachers, but where do I go? I’d like to go to the other schools. I want to see what the other teachers are doing.” Mentoring is often identified as an appropriate form of professional development for second-stage teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1057083712438771">Berg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1057083712438771">Donaldson, 2005</xref>), but it is a role that Taryn is reluctant to take on in her school.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>All three participants identified a variety of types of valuable professional development, both formal (workshops, certification, graduate degrees) and informal (conversations with colleagues, reflection, and writing). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1057083712438771">Bauer et al. (2009)</xref> found that, among 783 music teachers, “the most desired approach to professional development was attending professional music conferences” (p. 109), although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1057083712438771">Conway (2008)</xref> found that experienced teachers “viewed informal interactions with other music teachers as the most powerful form of music teacher professional development” (p. 12). Evidence from this study, particularly as collected in the focus group interview, indicates that among second-stage teachers, there is clearly a place for both. Although it is true that teachers are under pressure to fulfill specific requirements, such as renewing their teaching credentials, it is also strongly suggested that valuable professional development may take place in unstructured formats.</p>
<p>Research into teachers’ careers indicates that teachers’ professional development needs change over the course of their careers, as with Sarah and Taryn. According to the research literature, second-stage teachers change their focus from themselves to their students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1057083712438771">Steffy et al., 2000</xref>). Whereas newer teachers are often concerned with classroom management, more experienced teachers who are comfortable with classroom management <italic>focus on</italic> different forms of pedagogy. Sarah no longer concentrated solely on managing her students and choosing material. She was more interested in growing as a teacher, and her vision, in terms of pedagogy and the scope of her curriculum, had expanded. Conversely, however, Taryn’s focus had shifted from what her students could do to what she, herself, could do.</p>
<p>Although it is not a profound finding that professional development can be difficult to obtain, it is important to note the nature of these obstacles and their relationship to the second stage. In Sarah’s case, the problem was a lack of problems. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1057083712438771">Steffy et al. (2000)</xref> suggest that second-stage teachers are prone to being treated differently by their administrators because of the teachers’ reliance on their students, rather than their administrations, for support: “Because [second-stage] teachers look to their students to provide them with motivation, administrators often treat them differently, give them less attention, and take them for granted” (p. 8).</p>
<p>Taryn’s and Sarah’s experiences also demonstrate obstacles toward a significant form of professional development: graduate education in the form of a master’s degree. Sarah’s pursuit of an MM directly cost her a job. Taryn’s job situation has determined her options for a master’s degree—not the loss of employment but the loss of the program that she has worked for years to build. Although job loss can be a concern for teachers at any point in their careers, it may be different for second-stage teachers. With 5 to 10 years invested in one program, the prospect of losing the program in which one has invested so much time to build might prevent a teacher from pursuing a master’s degree.</p>

<title>Conclusion and Implications</title>
<p>Simply passing the survival years is not enough. The attrition rate for second-stage teachers is also alarmingly high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1057083712438771">Donaldson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1057083712438771">Luekens et al., 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1057083712438771">Berg et al. (2005)</xref> suggest, “Meeting teachers’ needs for experimentation and growth during the second stage of their teaching careers . . . stands to not only support them to remain in teaching beyond the “danger zone” but also to serve schools’ improvement needs” (p. 6). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1057083712438771">Berg et al. (2005)</xref> propose that “during this period, teachers who become frustrated by their attempts to experiment and grow tend to leave” (p. 4). Janean cited a lack of opportunities for growth via implementing changes as a primary factor in her decision to leave teaching. She had been repeatedly stymied in her attempts to effect change in her program and, therefore, had not been able to continue developing as a professional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1057083712438771">Hookey, 2002</xref>). Janean represents a loss of 7 years of experience. Although not every 7-year teacher is an exemplar, based on colleagues’ comments (Samantha and Janean both taught in the same district) and my own observations, Janean was an excellent music educator.</p>
<p>One possible way to foster professional development is to allow them to take on differentiated roles in schools. Research into teachers’ careers has established that many music teachers feel isolated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1057083712438771">Conway &amp; Christensen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1057083712438771">Lipscomb &amp; Sindberg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1057083712438771">Renfro, 2003</xref>). Administrators might make conscious efforts to bring second-stage music teachers into expanded roles in the school. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1057083712438771">Berg et al. (2005)</xref> presented a number of different roles assumed by second-stage teachers, including instructional coaches and area coordinators (e.g., Sarah’s role as an AMPP coordinator), which contributed to growth for both the teacher and the school.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1057083712438771">Berg et al. (2005)</xref> state, “These differentiated roles provide these teachers opportunities to rotate in and out of their classrooms, full- or part-time, to engage in differentiated work in their schools and districts.” This study indicates that second-stage teachers benefit from moving beyond their classrooms, although not necessarily relinquishing teaching duties, to become active in the school. Sarah currently served in a leadership role in her school, Janean served as district adjudication chair, and Taryn planned to participate in district level planning.</p>
<p>How might second-stage music teachers use their particular disciplines to take on such roles? Is such a technique possible for ensemble directors, who might be concerned about the impact on their ensembles if they spend substantial time out of rehearsal? Second-stage teachers might be placed with one another as professional collaborators. This has been studied specifically for second-stage teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1057083712438771">Charner-Laird, 2007</xref>). Finally, research into the second stage might be included with research of the larger idea of the career cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1057083712438771">Steffy et al., 2000</xref>)—a theoretical construct that examines teachers’ entire careers and that has received increased discussion in music education.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all three teachers discussed the value of their participation in this study on their growth as educators. They mentioned having articulated certain things for the first time, as well as never having talked this much with colleagues before. A growing body of literature exists on the topic of small groups of teachers forming groups for their own professional development in music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1057083712438771">Stanley, 2009</xref>) and in general education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1057083712438771">Charner-Laird, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, administrators should recognize that the entire teaching faculty needs both formal and informal professional development. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1057083712438771">Leithwood (1992)</xref> discusses principals’ responsibility to address experienced teachers’ need to expand their professional knowledge, cautioning that “failure to provide opportunities for the development of professional expertise may well lead to professional disaffection when teachers are seeking new challenges and have new concerns” (p. 95).</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1057083712438771">Hookey (2002)</xref> pointed out, professional development is a “lifelong project.” Teachers can and should still be developing as professionals after 30 years. One challenge, however, is identifying the formats in which professional development may take place. Taking a workshop is an obvious form of professional development for a teacher, but what about the 20-year veteran teacher who leads the workshop? Or the 25-year veteran who serves as a regional or state officer in a professional organization?</p>
<p>Second-stage teachers represent a valuable resource in music education. However, as indicated by the participants here, those resources are in need of consistent professional development if they are to truly thrive throughout an entire career of teaching music.</p>
