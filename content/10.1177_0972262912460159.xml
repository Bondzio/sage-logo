<p>Ever since the emergence of state as an important institution in human history, it has altered the ways the societies are being organized. This has happened because for the first time in human history, individuals surrendered their certain aspects of liberty to create an institution which had right to govern them. State once formed has undergone several reincarnations. In each reincarnation, its power to govern was appropriated by different groups of people or alliance of different groups. These different groups of people, who appropriated the power of state, created different kinds of political regimes, which served their group interest better. Therefore, the conditions of life of other groups of people who were not part of the ruling alliance depended on the political regimes created by the ruling alliances. Hence, quality of polity depended on how inclusive was the ruling alliance.</p>
<p>The book under review, written by D.N. Ghosh, explores the relationship between different political regimes, which have been experienced by humanity and group of people who were engaged in business. The book in a way is an attempt to explore the relationship between the creators of the wealth (merchants and businesses) and the institution (state) which determines the nature of distribution of wealth, that is, the relationship between business and polity.</p>
<p>The book has been correctly described by the author as an odyssey, where author takes the reader on a long journey to explore how political regimes located in different units of space and time organized relationship between business and polity. The journey begins at the ancient Greek city states, where the reader is made aware about the nature of relationship that existed between metic (merchant) and polis (Greek city state). Here the reader comes to know that metics in Greek city states were generally foreigners, who were living as fringe elements of the society in separate locations. The basis of polity depended on the owners of land.</p>
<p>After experiencing the relationship between business and polity in Greek city states, the reader is transported to the political regimes of ancient Rome. The Roman polity worked with the help of legions who protected and helped in the expansion of the Roman Empire. The power of polity was in the hands of owner of land which was distributed quite unequally. Over time, the governing classes became self centred and lost contact with the real wealth creators of the society. The Roman polity experienced crisis when it failed to keep balance with creators of the wealth.</p>
<p>The reader is then taken to the ancient political regimes that ruled the Indian subcontinent. The author describes in detail the relationship between political regimes and merchants during Maurya and Gupta dynasties in India. During this period Indian merchant communities had established trading networks in the domestic market as well as across different countries. After an encounter with the ancient Indian political regimes, the reader reaches at ancient China. Here, farming was the basis of resource generation for different polities. Due to the significance of the farmers the political regimes were either indifferent to business or were antagonist to the businesses. The ruling philosophical ideology of the polity ‘Confucianism’ was against merchants. Despite the fact merchants were accepted by political regimes. The importance of merchants depended on whether Chinese empires were fragmented into several polities or were centralized under unified polity.</p>
<p>As time comes closer to Middle Ages the reader is taken to Arabian economies. Here the reader is made to understand the relationship between polity and business during the political regimes of Qurayshities, Ummayads and Abbasids. These political regimes created symbiotic relationship with business to exploit the advantage of the common market which spread from Central Asia to Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>The strong linkages between business and polity emerged in European continent during the period when mercantilist philosophy was dominant. Mercantilism was the philosophy to enrich the nation-state through protection of foreign trade. State helped in the manipulation of prices through tariffs to increase the gold reserves of the country. Gold reserves became the measure of the might of the empires. This phase of relationship between business and polity in Europe has been described by the author as period of Economic Nationalism. The economic nationalism emerged as a consequence of fusion between sword and purse.</p>
<p>The author also takes the readers to important locations like Japan, Portugal, Spain and Holland, and finally culminates in Britain with the founding of British Empire, that is, Pax-Britania. Finally the reader’s journey stops at contemporary America which has emerged as invisible global empire by protecting private property, free market and freedom to enterprise. The polity in the US provides a unique relationship between polity and business, where US polity has become complementary to the business interests and they together have provided basis for the existing hegemony of US. By the end of the odyssey the reader realizes, how different political regimes interacted with the businesses and how the nature of interaction between them determined prosperity as well as duration of polity. The author also makes the readers to realize that most of the political regimes established relationship between polity and business and neglect the interest of other groups. These neglected groups of people are now asserting their claim on national resources. Therefore, it is in the interest of the polity to become more inclusive to accommodate the interest of those groups also who have been disadvantaged. The reader also realizes that the kind of scholarship that is manifest in the book is slowly vanishing.</p>
<p>However, while travelling with the author as a reader, one observes certain small omissions of important locations in time and space. For instance, the relationship between business and polity required detailed account of Mughal, Safavid and Ottoman empires because these empires were important transformers of the polity where they were located. The author has also not analyzed the influence of institutions like Roman Church and Pope, and Caliphate on trade and commerce. The author has also neglected the detail regarding the relationship between European empires and big trading companies. The author has also not included in his book the polities which also monopolized the businesses. It seems these omissions have emerged because the author wanted to take the reader on a vast journey across time and space within the length of a book. Due to this reason the author has spent less space of his book on each episode, viz., Greek has been covered in 17 pages (pp. 3–20), Roman empires in 19 pages (pp. 21–39).</p>
<p>Despite these small omissions, the book is a comprehensive account of relationship between polity and business. The book will interest readers from different disciplines.</p>
