<title>Background</title>
<p>After clinical trials end, continued follow-up of the assembled cohort often is desirable for additional research. Factors influencing participants’ decisions to consent to additional follow-up and how these shape posttrial cohorts have not been broadly studied.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1740774513477931">
<title>Purpose</title>
<p>We examined how two re-enrollment campaigns and the passage of time altered features of the posttrial cohorts compared with the original Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) Hormone Therapy clinical trials.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1740774513477931">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We examined associations that markers of sociodemography, health, lifestyle, and on-trial experiences had with re-enrollment and contrasted the characteristics of successive posttrial cohorts with those of the original enrollees.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1740774513477931">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The posttrial enrollment campaigns re-enrolled 81.1% and 82.5% of available women, respectively. Women who re-enrolled tended to have better health characteristics than those not re-enrolled. Compared to women of comparable age in the original cohort, women retained for the second posttrial follow-up less often had a history of cardiovascular disease (odds ratio (OR) = 0.36), hypertension (OR = 0.57), diabetes (OR = 0.59), or measured cognitive deficit (OR = 0.40). These women more often had graduated from high school (OR = 1.72) and had participated in other WHI trials (OR = 1.76).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1740774513477931">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>We have examined experience with creating follow-up cohorts from participants in a single study. Thus, our findings may not apply to other cohorts and protocols.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1740774513477931">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Posttrial enrollment in follow-up studies can be successful; however, the characteristics of the resulting cohort may differ substantially from the originally assembled group of trial participants. Collection during the original trial of potential predictors of differential re-enrollment may strengthen interpretation of findings.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Posttrial follow-up of clinical trial cohorts is conducted for many reasons. These include describing posttrial trajectories of outcomes to see whether they diminish with time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774513477931">1</xref>], remain constant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1740774513477931">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1740774513477931"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740774513477931">4</xref>], or expand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1740774513477931">5</xref>]; detecting new effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1740774513477931">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1740774513477931">7</xref>]; examining long-term safety issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1740774513477931">2</xref>]; examining the downstream consequences of on-trial events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1740774513477931">8</xref>]; examining posttrial treatment in the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1740774513477931">9</xref>]; assessing the impact of withdrawal of therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1740774513477931">10</xref>]; and establishing surrogate outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1740774513477931">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1740774513477931">12</xref>]. Posttrial follow-up also provides well-characterized cohorts for epidemiologic studies and for recruitment into new ancillary studies and clinical trials.</p>
<p>Much has been written about general correlates of participation in clinical research studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1740774513477931">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1740774513477931">14</xref>]. Participation is thought to be influenced by personal demographics, health status, risk factors, and sociocultural dimensions. The cohorts that are enrolled in clinical trials, due to eligibility criteria, recruitment approaches, and volunteerism, generally do not reflect the general population and are often healthier with respect to many characteristics, as has been observed in the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1740774513477931">15</xref>]. Much less has been written about correlates of participation in posttrial follow-up studies, and re-enrollment rates may vary markedly. The Physicians’ Health Study, Diabetes Reduction Assessment with Ramipril and Rosiglitazone Medication Trial, and the Diabetes Control and Complication Trial enrolled &gt;99%, 97%, and 96% of eligible participants in posttrial follow-up studies after 5, 3, and 6 years of on-trial follow-up, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1740774513477931">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1740774513477931">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1740774513477931">17</xref>]. Other trials have had much less success. For example, the Polyp Prevention Trial enrolled 63% of its available participants into a posttrial study after a 4-year trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1740774513477931">18</xref>].</p>
<p>The WHI has organized posttrial follow-up of its clinical trial cohorts for such reasons and provides a rich basis for examining factors that reshape study cohorts through reconsenting processes. We have examined how the two WHI re-enrollment campaigns, occurring in 2004–2005 and 2009–2010, and the passage of time altered broad features of the posttrial cohorts compared with the original WHI cohort, which was recruited in 1993–1998. Of the three intersecting clinical trial programs conducted by the WHI, we focus on the hormone therapy trials to have a uniform set of eligibility criteria that defined the baseline cohort. We study measures of socioeconomic status, medical history, overall measures of health, and cognitive function based on the rich literature that describes how each of these factors is related to enrollment at the start of clinical trials. We also examine whether participation in other WHI trials or an ancillary study affected re-enrollment to assess the potential role of overall study burden/commitments among the subsets of women eligible for these other studies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1740774513477931" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The WHI Hormone Therapy (WHI HT) trials were designed to assess the impact of two regimens of postmenopausal hormone therapies compared to placebo on major clinical events, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, bone health, and stroke. Eligibility criteria and recruitment procedures for these trials have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1740774513477931">19</xref>]. Postmenopausal women, aged 50–79 years at initial screening, were eligible for participation. A 3-month washout period was required for women who were using postmenopausal hormones when screened. Major exclusions related competing risks for major trial outcomes (invasive cancer in the past 10 years; breast cancer at any time or suspicion of breast cancer at baseline screening; acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or transient ischemic attack in the previous 6 months; and known chronic active hepatitis or severe cirrhosis), safety (blood cell counts indicative of disease, severe hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, and current use of oral corticosteroids), and adherence or retention concerns (unwillingness or inability to complete baseline study requirements). Following the completion of three screening visits and a run-in, women who met all inclusion criteria and had no exclusion criteria, who remained interested in participating, and who gave written informed consent were assigned randomly with equal probability to active therapy or placebo. For women with an intact uterus, this therapy was one daily tablet that contained 0.625 mg conjugated equine estrogen and 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (PremPro; Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Philadelphia, PA) or matching placebo (estrogen+progestin (E+P) Trial). For women who had a previous hysterectomy, therapy was one daily tablet that contained either 0.625 mg conjugated equine estrogen (Premarin; Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Philadelphia, PA) or matching placebo (estrogen alone (E-Alone) Trial).</p>
<p>Some women enrolled in the WHI HT trials were also eligible for recruitment into two other intersecting randomized controlled trials that were conducted in parallel to assess the impact of supplementation with vitamin D and calcium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1740774513477931">20</xref>] or dietary counseling to reduce fat intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1740774513477931">21</xref>] on health outcomes. Women above the age of 65 years and free of dementia were also eligible for recruitment into a large ancillary study – the WHI Memory Study (WHIMS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1740774513477931">22</xref>].</p>
<sec id="section9-1740774513477931">
<title>Termination of WHI HT trials</title>
<p>Both of the WHI HT trials were terminated prior to their planned 8.5-year durations. After a mean follow-up of 5.2 years, the E + P Trial was stopped because the overall risks exceeded benefits. The incidences of cardiovascular outcomes (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and venous thromboembolic disease) and breast cancer were increased in women assigned to active treatment; however, colorectal cancers, hip fractures, and other fractures were reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1740774513477931">23</xref>]. In February 2004, the E-Alone Trial also was stopped because assignment to conjugated equine estrogen increased risk for stroke and did not affect the risk for coronary heart disease over an average of 6.8 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1740774513477931">24</xref>]. Follow-up of women from both trials continued until 2004–2005, when the first posttrial extension study began.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1740774513477931">
<title>Extensions 1 and 2</title>
<p>The WHI Extension 1 enrolled consenting participants from each of the original WHI study components for an additional 5 years of follow-up, from 2005 to 2010. Its purpose was to describe the long-term effects of the original interventions, to document changes in hormone use in participants from the WHI HT trials, to expand the range of scientific questions that could be addressed reliably in the WHI, and to provide an infrastructure to support additional investigations requiring some of the unique features of a very large longitudinal study of postmenopausal women. All surviving women who were not lost to follow-up or who had not withdrawn were eligible for the posttrial Extension 1. The WHI Extension 2 enrolled women for five additional years of follow-up from 2010 to 2015. Extension 2 was designed to extend the goals of Extension 1 in an aging cohort for an additional 5 years. All surviving women from Extension 1 who were not lost to follow-up or who had not withdrawn were eligible for Extension 2.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1740774513477931">
<title>Potential predictors of re-enrollment</title>
<p>At WHI enrollment, sociodemographic measures and medical history were collected by self-report. Physical measures such as blood pressure, weight, and height were collected at clinic visits by a standard protocol. Body mass index (BMI) in kg/m<sup>2</sup> was calculated from the measured weights and heights. Hypertension was defined as a self-report of prior diagnosis, current pharmacological treatment, or a measured blood pressure exceeding 140/90 mmHg. The modified Charlson Index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1740774513477931">25</xref>] was used as a general measure of adverse health history and was collected at baseline and grouped according to scores of 0, 1, and &gt;2. Participants were also asked to rate their general health according to a Likert-type scale. The Modified Mini-Mental State Exam (3MSE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1740774513477931">26</xref>] was collected on women aged 65 years or older at WHI enrollment and annually thereafter among the subset of 7479 women also enrolled in the WHIMS ancillary study. Because the significance of lower 3MSE scores in these measures is dependent on education level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1740774513477931">27</xref>], scores &lt;88 for women with 9 or more years of formal education or &lt;80 for women with 8 or fewer years of education were used to identify low performers. Moderate performers had scores above these cutpoints (80 and 88) through 94. High performers scored between 95 and 100. During the trial, self-report of health diagnoses, medications, and hospitalizations were collected at least annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1740774513477931">13</xref>]. Medical histories were updated annually after the end of the trials. Medication use was recorded 3 years after the end of the trials. Health status reports were updated from their most recent annual assessment to compare the most current status of cohorts in the analysis at different enrollment phases.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1740774513477931">
<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>We computed the percentages of women from the WHI HT trials who re-enrolled in WHI Extensions 1 and 2 and compared those percentages among important subgroups defined by socioeconomic factors, health indicators, and on-trial experiences using chi-squared tests for unadjusted comparisons and logistic regression for comparison with adjustment for geographic region and markers of socioeconomic status. Because our large sample size affords substantial power, to provide some control for Type 1 error among the multiple inferences we required P &lt; 0.001 for the findings from univariable analyses that we chose to highlight. We compared the characteristics of the cohorts of women at the time they enrolled in Extensions 1 and 2 with the characteristics of women in a similar age range at the time when they enrolled in the WHI. To do this, we chose cohorts of women who were in the age range of 64–79 years at three points of time: original WHI enrollment, at Extension 1 re-enrollment, and at Extension 2 re-enrollment. We estimated the odds ratios (OR) that women randomly chosen from each of the posttrial cohorts, compared to a randomly selected woman at WHI enrollment, would have selected characteristics. These univariable analyses were supported with forward stepwise logistic regression to identify sets of characteristics that discriminated between randomly selected women from the cohorts at the three time points.</p>

<p>We also examined re-enrollment percentages into the Extension 1 from the trial and into Extension 2 from Extension 1 with respect to WHI treatment assignment, participation in other WHI studies, and updated markers of health that reflected both events that happened prior to and during the WHI Trial follow-up (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1740774513477931">Table 2</xref>). Covariate adjustment was used to control for differences in markers of socioeconomic status (age, race/ethnicity, and education) and geographic region that were found to be related strongly to re-enrollment (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1740774513477931">Table 1</xref>) and focused on other factors that were associated with decisions women made about re-enrollment. Re-enrollment percentages for Extension 1 were lower among women who had participated in the E-Alone Trial (i.e., who had a prior hysterectomy), but did not differ between active and placebo assignment. Women who had also participated in other WHI trials more often re-enrolled in Extension 1; however, participation in the WHIMS ancillary study had little influence on re-enrollment. In general, women who reported prior health conditions (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or cancer) re-enrolled slightly less often. The factors associated with the lowest percentages of re-enrollment into Extension 1 were lower cognitive function, self-report of poor health, and history of cardiovascular disease. The factors associated with the lowest percentages of re-enrollment into Extension 2 were self-report of poor health, history of cardiovascular disease, and current smoking.</p>

<p>We also compared the cohort of women available for study at three phases of WHI: during their hormone therapy trial and during posttrial Extensions 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1740774513477931">Table 3</xref>). These comparisons aggregate losses to follow-up and to re-enrollment. To limit the influence of age, we described women who were at a common age range of 64–79 years at the beginning of each study phase. The descriptors of these women are the most recent that were available concurrent with or prior to when they entered the stage (e.g., medical histories for women in Extension 1 and 2 were updated to include events that occurred after WHI enrollment). The mean (standard deviation (SD)) ages of the cohorts were fairly similar: 69.6 (4.0), 71.5 (4.5), and 73.0 (3.9), respectively. Through the progressive study stages, other characteristics of the cohorts changed. In a graded fashion over time and compared to the original cohort, the typical participant in this age range was more likely to have a high school education (at Extension 2 OR = 1.72), but less likely to be of a racial/ethnic minority (at Extension 2, OR = 0.72), to smoke (at Extension 2, OR = 0.66), or to be obese (at Extension 2, OR = 0.81). Over time, the typical participant had fewer comorbid diseases and better self-reported general health. Women who had participated in other WHI clinical trials were more likely to be represented. The most pronounced differences over time were related to history of cardiovascular disease (less likely to have cardiovascular disease at Extension 2, OR = 0.36) and deficits in cognitive function (less likely to have impaired cognitive function at Extension 2, OR = 0.40).</p>

<p>To support the univariable analyses, we applied forward stepwise logistic regression to identify a pool of important discriminators between the retained cohorts. Because baseline cognitive function measures were available for only subsets of women, we conducted parallel analyses without and with cognitive function available for selection. In order of ORs from the final model, the characteristics selected as being more influential among Extension 1 women compared to the WHI cohort at baseline were no history of cardiovascular disease, participation in other WHI trials, higher education, not currently smoking, majority race, no hypertension, obesity, no diabetes, good general health, and low Charlson Index. When analyses were restricted to women with baseline cognitive function assessment, the ordered factors were participation in other WHI trials, good general health, obesity, no prior cardiovascular disease, higher cognitive function, and no hypertension. The factors selected as being more influential among Extension 2 women compared to the WHI cohort at baseline were no history of cardiovascular disease, higher education, no hypertension, participation in other WHI trials, majority race, not currently smoking, no diabetes, obesity, and low Charlson Index. When these analyses were restricted to women with baseline cognitive function assessment, the ordered factors were low Charlson Index, higher cognitive function, and participation in other WHI trials.</p>

<sec id="section14-1740774513477931" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our analyses yielded three principal findings, which we discuss in turn. First, experience from the WHI demonstrated that many individuals are very willing to agree to long-term participation in studies and to transition from clinical trials to epidemiologic surveillance studies. Second, while re-enrollment levels may not be as high as retention levels during the trial, similar factors are related to each. Of the factors we studied, the most important are levels of general health and cognitive function. Third, because rates of re-enrollment and retention may vary among subgroups, analyses of posttrial data should address missing data. Minimizing the number of times women are asked to re-enroll may improve overall re-enrollment and follow-up rates.</p>
<p>Posttrial studies provide an opportunity to leverage the considerable effort and expense of recruiting and characterizing cohorts of volunteers for the cost-effective study of new research questions. They permit research goals to be addressed that require long-term follow-up and may be prohibitively expensive without the upfront investment provided by the original trial. Some draw from the original randomization of the parent trial to compare the long-term consequences of its interventions. Within the WHI HT cohort, these have produced major findings on the long-term impact of conjugated equine therapies and stopping these therapies on individual components of its primary composite outcomes, such as cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1740774513477931">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1740774513477931">29</xref>], cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1740774513477931">28</xref>], and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1740774513477931">29</xref>]; on secondary outcomes such as menopausal symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1740774513477931">30</xref>]; and on outcomes from ancillary studies such as brain volumes and cognitive function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1740774513477931">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1740774513477931">32</xref>]. However, the value of a well-characterized and sustained cohort of volunteers extends far beyond these aims, as noted in the introduction.</p>
<p>Overall, re-enrollment percentages in observational extensions of the WHI HT trials exceeded 80% at each extension, signaling the commitment women had toward volunteerism and the ability of the study staff and investigators to engender and facilitate this commitment. Re-enrollment percentages were lower than retention percentages (based on refusals) both on-trial and within the time frames of the extensions (which exceeded 90%), indicating that the decision to re-enroll is different from a decision about continued involvement in an ongoing study. Re-enrollment percentages within the WHI trials were fostered through individual contact and repeated attempts to engage all women to participate in the extension studies. The WHIMS ancillary study was able to achieve high levels of re-enrollment despite its primary negative findings for conjugated equine estrogen therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1740774513477931">33</xref>].</p>
<p>The WHI experience demonstrates that some of the same features that affect initial enrollment in clinical trials and participant retention also affect posttrial re-enrollment. These include sociodemographic markers and medical history. Among the strongest of these factors that we considered in the WHI were markers of health, perceived health, and cognitive function, both in univariable and multivariable analyses. This finding underscores the importance of tailoring re-enrollment practices to accommodate the needs of women with increasing health-related barriers and cognitive deficits. These findings also signal the importance of expanding data collection modes to include, as may be necessary, home visits, telephone- or mail-based assessments, and information from proxies. The higher rates of attrition among less educated women and those from traditionally underrepresented minorities underscore the importance of additional research on better ways to continue to engage these volunteers in posttrial follow-up studies. Importantly, we found that participation in an ancillary study was not associated with poorer retention, and participation in other WHI trials was associated with greater re-enrollment. These additional engagements did not appear to lead to participant burn out and may mark women with higher levels of commitment.</p>
<p>The WHI posttrial cohorts grew increasingly healthier and more cognitively intact from baseline through the two extensions, as evidenced by our comparisons of comparably aged cohorts, likely reflecting the successive winnowing of less healthy women through attrition and refusal to reconsent to longer follow-up. At each stage, the women who ceased being followed had poorer health and were at higher risk for disease-related events. This finding has many consequences for posttrial studies. The age-specific event rates observed on-trial for health outcomes may be higher than those that are encountered posttrial because women who continue to be followed are healthier. This tendency may also alter any projections of long-term (i.e., posttrial) cost benefit and, perhaps, estimates of posttrial safety. If posttrial cohorts overrepresent participants who are less likely to have events or to require larger health-care expenditures, projections of cost benefit may be underestimated. If the range of health is compressed during re-enrollment, risk factor relationships may be altered. In posttrial studies, in which the control group is offered active therapy, its benefits may differ from those observed on-trial because the posttrial cohort may not be similar to the participants who were assigned to active therapy at baseline during the trial.</p>
<p>Our findings have other important implications for the conduct of studies with planned posttrial follow-up. First, aggressive and targeted re-enrollment may be valuable to preserve as representative a cohort as possible. Ideally, preparations should begin well before the cessation of trials, to prepare trial participants for the prospect of posttrial studies and to underscore their importance. During the trial, data should be collected to identify those at greatest risk for loss to follow-up and for use in analyses to address missing data. Our analyses indicate that it may be critically important to collect markers of self-perceived health, medical history, and cognitive function. Additionally, lower event rates because of the winnowing of participants who have poorer health and who are at an increased risk of disease outcomes may sap power from posttrial studies. We observed that substantial numbers of WHI participants were lost during each reconsenting campaign; thus, it may be important to maximize the time span for which consent for posttrial studies is obtained, rather than mounting a series of short-term extensions that require reconsent. The differential follow-up that we observed has important implications for statistical analyses. Ignoring lost and missing follow-up data is likely to bias estimates and introduce discontinuities in long-term trends. Analytical approaches must assess factors predictive of missing data. For example, we found little difference in the retention rates among women assigned to active versus placebo therapies, so that posttrial comparisons comparing treatment arms may not be biased. However, we found differential re-enrollment between the E-Alone versus E + P Trial cohorts so that comparisons between the relative posttrial effects of these active therapies may be biased if potential missing data mechanisms were ignored. Fortunately, great progress has been made in statistical approaches to deal with missing data. With the rich resource of having sequences of data available on individuals prior to the time when they are lost to follow-up, the breadth of available approaches and the strength of their performance are increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1740774513477931">34</xref>].</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Posttrial enrollment in follow-up studies can be successful and can greatly expand the breadth of scientific findings. However, the characteristics of the resulting cohort may differ substantially from the originally assembled group of trial participants. Collection during the original trial of potential predictors of differential re-enrollment may facilitate re-enrollment.</p>
