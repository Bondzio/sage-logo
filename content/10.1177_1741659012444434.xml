<abstract>
<p>This paper analyses the fate of social democratic sensibility in thinking about crime and criminal justice that prevailed for most of the 20th century, until a profound rupture in culture, political economy, crime and criminal justice. The paper proposes an ideal-type of social democratic criminology, and contrasts it with the law-and-order perspective that displaced it after the 1970s. The sources and consequences of this seismic shift are analysed and evaluated. Finally, following the fracturing of the last forty years’ neoliberal hegemony in the wake of the 2008 financial crash, it considers the prospects of a revival of the social democratic perspective in criminological thinking.</p>

<title>Prologue: Two Quotes in Search of an Analysis</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We are not letting the public in on our era’s dirty little secret; that those who commit the crime which worries citizens most—violent street crime—are, for the most part, the products of poverty, unemployment, broken homes, rotten education, drug addiction and alcoholism, and other social and economic ills about which the police can do little, if anything. Rather than speaking up, most of us stand silent and let politicians get away with law and order rhetoric that reinforces the mistaken notion that the police—in ever greater numbers and with ever more gadgetry—can alone control crime. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741659012444434">Di Grazia, 1976</xref>)</p>
<attrib>Crime is down: blame the police. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741659012444434">Bratton, 1998</xref>)</attrib>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This paper analyses the profound rupture in culture, political economy, crime and criminal justice that is highlighted by these contrasting quotes. It will probe the fate of social democratic sensibility in thinking about crime that the first quote encapsulated, and its subsequent suppression by the law-and-order toughness captured by the Bratton quote. Finally, following the fracturing of the last forty years’ neoliberal hegemony in the wake of the 2008 crash, it will consider the prospects of a revival of the social democratic perspective in criminological thinking.</p>

<title>Social Democracy: The Realistic Ideal</title>
<p>A distinction between revolutionary communist and social democratic versions of socialism developed in the early 20th century. After the First World War it became usual to distinguish social democracy from Bolshevism on the Left, and from liberalism on the Right. In Britain it came to be associated as an intellectual perspective with the ethical socialism of Tawney, Laski, T.H. Marshall and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741659012444434">Dennis and Halsey, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Arguably its most developed and coherent exposition came in Rawls’ <italic>Theory of Justice</italic>, published in 1971 just as the postwar social democratic (or at any rate, Keynesian mixed economy welfare statist) consensus was being ousted by the neoliberal blitzkrieg—a prime example of the Owl of Minerva flying at dusk. Rawls himself was an avowed liberal who would have shunned the social democratic label. But his two principles—equal liberty subject only to respecting the same for others, and equal distribution of resources abridgeable only in the interests of the least well-off—are a succinct statement of social democratic values. And his rigorous derivation of these principles offers social democrats powerful arguments in their defence. In the next section I will suggest an ideal-type of the social democratic perspective (for a more detailed account, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1741659012444434">Reiner, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1741659012444434">2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1741659012444434">
<title>Social Democracy: An Ideal-Type</title>
<p>There are of course many varieties of social democratic thinking. The following ideal-type should be read as an attempt to distil its key dimensions. The model hypothesises that there are nine quintessential characteristics of social democracy.</p>
<sec id="section4-1741659012444434">
<title>1. Primacy of the Ethical</title>
<p>In recent times the language of ‘morality’ has been stolen by the shrill sexual conservatism of the <italic>Mail</italic>, the <italic>Sun</italic>, and the Tea Party. ‘For right-wing intellectuals and activists values seem to be about sex and almost nothing else; vast areas of social life are left to the radically amoral play of market forces. And yet they have “values”, and we [the liberal left] don’t’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1741659012444434">Walzer, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>This process has been aided by reluctance on the Left to acknowledge the values underpinning their critiques of capitalist political economy. Originating in Marx and Engels’ project of establishing a scientific materialist base for socialism, and their critique of idealistic ‘utopianism’, it encouraged hubristic optimism about the inevitability of socialism, minimising the significance of moral persuasion and political action (see the withering critique of this ‘obstetric’ view of history in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741659012444434">Cohen, 2001</xref>). Against the long-dominant strain of materialist determinism in Marxism it is useful to re-emphasise the moral roots of the critique of capitalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1741659012444434">Lukes, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1741659012444434">Thompson, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The paramount distinguishing feature of social democracy is a commitment to democratic means. This implies what one influential history of the perspective has called the ‘primacy of politics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741659012444434">Berman, 2006</xref>). It entails developing persuasive ethical arguments for social democracy’s values, expressed in religious and secular versions of the ‘Golden Rule’—‘love your neighbour as yourself’ (Leviticus 19: 18). It is the quintessential expression of mutuality, reciprocity, basic human equality, the entitlement of all beings to ‘equal concern and respect’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741659012444434">Dworkin, 2002</xref>). This moral foundation informs social democracy’s critique of capitalism.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1741659012444434">
<title>2. Critique of Capitalism</title>
<p>In common with Marxism, social democrats recognised both the productive power of capitalism, and its liberatory effects in destroying feudal hierarchies and pieties. But ethical socialists like Tawney, who stressed the ‘sickness of an acquisitive society’, saw that material affluence posed moral dangers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1741659012444434">Tawney, 1921/1961</xref>). Wealth was not to be pursued as an end in itself, only as a means to welfare and justice.</p>
<p>Capitalism had intrinsic flaws, despite its virtues. It encouraged a culture of possessive individualism, and generated ever greater inequality unless the state intervened to modify this. There was no automatic alleviation of poverty with growth; left to itself, wealth trickled up, not down. Unregulated competitive production brought external diseconomies like pollution, as calculations of private cost/benefit neglected the social impact of commercial activities. And we have recently relearned the Keynesian message: capitalism is prone to cycles of boom and bust, despite New Labour’s hubris.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1741659012444434">
<title>3. Gradualism</title>
<p>Fabian gradualism was the default position for social democracy, because of its commitment to building democratic consent. Socialism was to be achieved by evolutionary, not revolutionary, means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741659012444434">Bernstein, 1911</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1741659012444434">Steger, 2006</xref>). Socialism was conceived of either as a distant destination to be approached asymptotically, not abruptly, or even as just one element in a permanently mixed economy, as achieved by the actually existing social democracies of post-Second World War Britain and the Scandinavian varieties of welfare capitalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741659012444434">Esping-Anderson, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741659012444434">Hall and Soskice, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>A paradoxical consequence of the desire to work through winning hearts and minds by argument, and the eschewal of the use of force except defensively, was a lack of glamour and cool.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The trouble with the social democratic ideal is that it does not stock … any of the exciting commodities which various totalitarian movements … offer dream-hungry youth … It has no prescription for the total salvation of mankind. It is … an obstinate will to erode by inches the conditions which produce avoidable suffering, oppression, hunger, wars, racial and national hatred, insatiable greed and vindictive envy. (Kolakowski, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1741659012444434">Jenkins, 1989</xref>: 142)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1741659012444434">
<title>4. Equality <italic>and</italic> Democracy</title>
<p>A defining characteristic of social democracy is the simultaneous commitment to equality <italic>and</italic> democracy. As expressed in Rawls’s two principles of justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1741659012444434">Rawls, 1971</xref>), a fair society must provide to its members equal basic liberties, <italic>and</italic> equality of material distribution (subject to the ‘difference’ principle, permitting inequalities that improve the lot of the worst-off).</p>
<p>A standard trope of right-wing criticisms of socialism is the claim that it violates democracy and liberty (as communist societies did). Social democrats would retort that equality and liberal democracy are mutually reinforcing, not contradictory. Material inequality frustrates the democratic process, producing the ‘best democracy money can buy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1741659012444434">Palast, 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1741659012444434">
<title>5. Quiet Optimism</title>
<p>Until the early 1970s social democrats enjoyed a tacitly Whig view of history as progressive, although rejecting any notions of historical inevitability. This quiet confidence in the movement towards greater and more inclusive equality was a deeply embedded perspective, across the political spectrum. In 1873, for example, Alfred Marshall, the architect of neoclassical economics, addressed the Cambridge Reform Club on ‘The Future of the Working Classes’, asking ‘whether there be valid ground for the opinion that the amelioration of the working classes has limits beyond which it cannot pass?’, and concluding that there were not (cited in T.H. Marshall’s seminal social democratic analysis of citizenship and social class, delivered in 1949 as the annual lecture in honour of his namesake (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1741659012444434">Marshall, 1950/1963</xref>: 69–73).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1741659012444434">
<title>6. Dimensions of Justice</title>
<p>The primary focus of social democratic movements historically was on the injustices and harms flowing from class inequality. But many social democrats were in the vanguard of struggles against other aspects of inequality: race, gender, sexual preference etc. These concerns flowed from a fundamental conception of human equality, expressed, for example, by Tawney: ‘differences of character and capacity between human beings, however important on their own plane, are of minor significance compared with the capital fact of their common humanity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1741659012444434">Tawney, 1931/1964</xref>: 61). The fundamental egalitarian principle underlying social democracy led to activism in relation to further dimensions of inequality as awareness of the issues increased. Social democrats were in the forefront of the 1950s/1960s campaigns to promote equality in relation to gender, race and sexuality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1741659012444434">
<title>7. The State as Instrument of Justice</title>
<p>Social democracy saw capturing the state as a crucial means of welfare and redistribution. Making political democracy truly representative of the wider social interest was necessary to balance capital’s power. ‘Is the reality behind the decorous drapery of political democracy to continue to be the economic power wielded by a few thousand … bankers, industrialists, and landowners?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1741659012444434">Tawney, 1935/1953</xref>: 60).</p>
<p>At the same time, social democrats (most obviously Orwell) were acutely aware of the dangers of state power. Making electoral democracy more than a disguise for plutocracy or autocracy was a matter for struggle and organisation, not a foregone conclusion. ‘Socialism accepts … the principles which are the cornerstones of democracy, that authority, to justify its title, must rest on consent; that power is tolerable only so far as it is accountable to the public’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1741659012444434">Tawney, 1931/1964</xref>: 197). But until the 1970s there was a considerable degree of optimism that the struggle was succeeding, as represented for example by Marshall’s account of the spread of social, not just civil and political, citizenship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1741659012444434">Marshall, 1950/1963</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1741659012444434">
<title>8. Science as a Condition of Social Advance</title>
<p>Social democracy in line with other socialist and modernist movements saw the development of physical science as a positive force, alleviating material pressures and making general welfare possible. They were similarly enthusiastic and optimistic about social science. Rigorous social research was the key to evidence-led understanding and reform of social problems.</p>
<p>Positivism has become a term of abuse in progressive sociological and criminological circles. But what is dismissed today is largely a caricature of what was espoused as positivism in earlier generations. The positivism of most social democrats (e.g. the early Popper) was reflexive and tentative, neither claiming that science held a ‘mirror to nature’ nor engaging in ‘abstracted’ or ‘voodoo’ empiricism.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1741659012444434">
<title>9. Modernism</title>
<p>The values underpinning social democracy were ancient (harking back to the Hebrew prophets and Jesus, Spartacus and Mohammed). They also had numerous medieval and early modern antecedents: John Ball—‘When Adam delved, and Eve span, who was then the gentleman?’, Wat Tyler, Jack Straw (of the Peasants’ Revolt), More’s <italic>Utopia</italic>, the 17th-century Levellers and Diggers such as Gerard Winstanley.</p>
<p>Despite these venerable roots of inspiration, social democracy is a quintessentially modern movement and perspective. It is only in modern times that egalitarianism has plausibly come to be seen as a practical political project, not a millenarian dream.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1741659012444434">
<title>Social Democratic Criminology: An Ideal-Type</title>
<p>There has never been a recognised or espoused school of social democratic criminology (SDC). But a recognisably social democratic analysis of crime and its causes was a widespread sensibility among academic criminologists, opinion-formers, criminal justice practitioners and policy-makers before the 1970s. It was not restricted to overt social democrats, but was the tacit conventional wisdom across the political spectrum (as illustrated by the quote by Boston police chief Robert di Grazia which heads this paper).</p>
<p>Five elements express the essence of the social democratic sensibility on crime.</p>
<sec id="section14-1741659012444434">
<title>1. Crime in its Place</title>
<p>Crime often involved acts that inflicted serious harm and were morally repugnant. But most crimes paled into relative insignificance compared to the many other serious problems facing the world: economic depression, inequality, poverty, war, health, housing, education. These were the issues that were the stuff of political argument and public concern, capable of trashing lives in a way that only the rarest crimes could. Crime and criminal justice did not figure as major public issues, apart from some special concerns, notably capital punishment, and even these were not matters of party political debate. Criminal justice was seen as something on which there was agreement in principle, with debates about technicalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1741659012444434">Loader, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1741659012444434">
<title>2. Social and Individual Responsibility</title>
<p>Crime was caused by a mix of social and individual processes. The overall level of crime at different times and places was a function of political economy and culture, as explained by Robert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1741659012444434">Merton’s (1938)</xref> influential anomie theory, for example. But individual offenders had a degree of autonomy, and hence responsibility, that justified the imposition of punishment, although the primary purpose of this was to rehabilitate. While penal policy was important in relation to the conduct of identified offenders and the achievement of justice in specific cases, crime control was primarily a function of social, economic and cultural processes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1741659012444434">
<title>3. Concern for Offenders and Victims</title>
<p>Sympathy for the suffering of victims, especially of unjustified violence, was taken for granted, and hardly needed spelling out. But this did not mean that offenders were not also subjects of concern. The intellectual puzzle was how and why someone (presumed to be of the same common human stock as non-offenders) had done wrong. Morally and practically there was the question how their behaviour could be reformed and future wrongdoing averted, for their sake as well as for potential future victims.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1741659012444434">
<title>4. Limits of Criminal Justice</title>
<p>Criminal justice has serious moral and practical limitations. SDC (in common with liberalism) saw punishment as inherently problematic as it involved the infliction of pain, and was justifiable only if necessary and proportionate. So the reach of criminal law and sanctions should be restricted to occasions where it prevented greater harm to innocent victims.</p>
<p>Practically, criminal justice was not the major element in public protection because it did not and could not reach the root causes of criminality. Ultimately crime levels were shaped by deep social, economic and cultural processes, and could be reduced only by broader policy reforms beyond the ambit of criminal justice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1741659012444434">
<title>5. Stay Calm: Crime Under Control</title>
<p>Although crime by definition inflicted harm on victims, the overall state of crime was not regarded as problematic until the remorseless rise in the recorded statistics after the mid-1950s (until the mid-1990s). While crime was a matter of concern, it was not a threat to the social order as such, and did not register high in public anxieties until the 1970s, as indicated by opinion polls and political debate. Occasional spectacular crimes aroused considerable public interest, as well as localised fears. But the overall pattern and level of crime did not excite great alarm or moral panics—a term only introduced in the early 1970s as the cultural climate changed.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1741659012444434">
<title>Social Democratic Criminology: A Suppressed Success Story</title>
<p>The gradual and uneven spread of social citizenship from the mid-19th century to the 1970s saw a growth of increasingly shared prosperity, security and inclusion. In criminology this has variously been analysed, for example as the ‘solidarity project’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741659012444434">Garland, 2001</xref>), or ‘pseudo-pacification’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741659012444434">Hall and Winlow, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741659012444434">2004</xref>). Measured crime rates were low and stable from the 1860s until the First World War, and despite increase in the inter-war period there was little general alarm. Policing of public order also became more pacific, shifting from a ‘battle’ to a ‘match’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741659012444434">Geary, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>Recorded crime began a seemingly inexorable rise from the mid-1950s up to the mid-1990s. This was stimulated by the advent of consumerism (it is symbolic that the beginning of the crime rise coincided with the launch of commercial television in Britain, with its fuelling of acquisitive aspirations). Mass affluence brought significant changes in the nature of property and in attitudes and practices concerning it. There was a proliferation of big-ticket consumer durables (such as cars and television sets) that were highly tempting and vulnerable to theft. They were also much more likely to be insured and thus reported if stolen. Rising crime rates from the 1950s to the 1970s were in large part a result of a greater propensity for crime to be recorded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1741659012444434">Reiner, 2007</xref>: 64–65). Consumerist culture no doubt stimulated ‘criminality’—‘the tendency of our society to produce criminals’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741659012444434">Currie, 2000</xref>: 6). Aspirations were heightened faster than legitimate opportunities to acquire the tempting goodies, exacerbating Mertonian anomie. But until the neoliberal counter-revolution of the late 1970s the crime rise was at least as much a recording phenomenon as a problem of enhanced criminality.</p>
<p>The spread of citizenship not only ameliorated crime and disorder, but also underlay a civilising transformation of criminal justice. During the century between the 1850s and 1950s, ‘policing by consent’ became established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1741659012444434">Reiner, 2010</xref>: chapters 2, 3). Police legitimacy in the sense of growing public acceptance did not mean legitimate policing practices prevailed. There was undoubtedly much corruption <italic>sub rosa</italic>, and brutal treatment of powerless ‘police property’ groups, disguised by the cosy <italic>Dixon of Dock Green</italic> image. During the same period ‘penal welfarism’ became the prevailing response to apprehended offenders, again with its own failings and abuses, but with an aspiration of benign rehabilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741659012444434">Garland, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Although it had complex conditions of existence, the underlying context was the gradual incorporation of the mass of the population into social as well as civil and political citizenship. The heyday of social democratic criminology was an era of greater justice and greater peace. And the reversal of the trend toward greater inclusion with the advent of neoliberalism over the last thirty years generated crime and disorder explosions, and the harsher politics of law and order of recent times.</p>

<sec id="section20-1741659012444434">
<title>Repression of Social Democratic Criminology: How and Why?</title>
<p>During the 1970s the postwar Keynesian, mixed economy, welfarist consensus rapidly became displaced by a neoliberal hegemony in economic and social policy. In criminology, the social democratic sensibility was attacked head-on by a new right-wing politicisation of ‘law and order’. Social democratic analysis of crime and criminal justice became an electoral ‘hostage to fortune’ for the parties of the Left, castigated as ‘soft and flabby’ if not actively encouraging of crime and disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741659012444434">Downes and Morgan, 2012</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section21-1741659012444434">
<title>The New Law-and-Order Consensus</title>
<p>In the early 1990s the Clinton Democrats and Tony Blair’s New Labour sought to shed this electoral liability by declaring they were at least as ‘tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime’ as their right-wing opponents. A new consensus on ‘tough’ law and order rapidly emerged. It reversed the five elements of SDC with a new model based on these core propositions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1741659012444434">Reiner, 2007</xref>: chapter 5):</p>

<list-item><p><italic>Crime is solely due to criminals</italic>. Crime is the result purely of the <italic>individual</italic> pathology or choice of offenders.

<list-item><p><italic>The conquering ‘culture of control’</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741659012444434">Garland, 2001</xref>). Crime and its control become the focal points of popular culture and practices. Fear, risk and insecurity govern daily life, from the design of homes and cars, to the journey to school and work, and their layout and organisation. A self-generating loop develops between fear and visible measures intended to contain risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1741659012444434">Zedner, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1741659012444434">2009</xref>). Supposed security devices symbolise and express the fears they are intended to alleviate, thus exacerbating underlying anxieties. Even if they succeed in suppressing the actual occurrence of crime they testify to the underlying persistence of criminality, so public fear survives despite the statistical drop in offending.</p></list-item>

<title>How the Law and Order Consensus Developed</title>
<p>During the 1980s Margaret Thatcher’s Tories pledged a ‘ring of steel’ against crime and disorder. But despite the tough rhetoric, this was largely a phoney ‘war on crime’ (except in the sphere of public order where there was a clear espousal of militaristic policing tactics). One reason for this was the continuing commitment of Labour to a social democratic analysis of crime as socially caused. As crime rates rose rapidly to record levels due to monetarist economic policies that exacerbated the causes of crime, and as the inner cities broke out in unprecedented rioting, there was a constant threat that the social democratic analysis might become more widely plausible.</p>
<p>New Labour’s espousal of tough law-and-order politics from 1992 defused this debate, and ensured the hegemony of tough law and order in practice. On gaining office in 1997, New Labour initially adopted a ‘third way’ combination of toughness plus smartness. The flagship 1998 Crime and Disorder Act encouraged evidence-led policy and partnership (embodied in the ensuing Crime Reduction Programme), but also minimum mandatory sentences, ASBOs, curfews and prison privatisation. Over time, ‘tough on crime’ eclipsed ‘tough on the causes of crime’: there was a remorseless growth of police powers (without the concern for balancing safeguards as in PACE [Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984], which were watered down), and record increases in prison numbers—despite falling crime rates.</p>

<title>Con-alition Criminal Justice</title>
<p>When David Cameron became Conservative leader at the end of 2005 he embarked on a series of much-publicised stunts signalling the ambition of detoxifying the Tory brand. Embracing the mantle of compassionate conservatism, Cameron sought to become ‘heir to Blair’ by identifying with green and liberal issues, suggesting an image of cool modernity. This <italic>volte face</italic> had already been presaged under the leadership of Michael Howard, erstwhile tough Home Secretary, when, on civil libertarian grounds, the Conservatives opposed Labour’s attempt to give the police the power to hold terror suspects for 90 days. Cameron also entertained a social analysis of crime, in his so-called ‘hug-a-hoodie’ speech in July 2006, suggesting that without an understanding of crime’s ‘root causes’ criminal justice policies were just a sticking plaster.</p>
<p>The Conservative-Liberal Democrat Con-alition elected in 2010 at first stirred some hopes of change to the culture of control. Its early statements and policies suggested a return to the ‘smart’ consensus that prevailed briefly around 1990 (embodied in the 1991 Criminal Justice Act), based on the premise that prison was an ‘expensive way of making bad people worse’. Many liberal and even radical criminologists welcomed the Con-alition’s early moves on criminal justice. In particular there was a warm reception for a landmark speech by Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke on 30 June 2010 at the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies, trumpeting a promised ‘rehabilitation revolution’.</p>
<p>Initially too the Con-alition government appeared as if it might reverse the trend towards remorseless expansion of police powers. Home Secretary Theresa May announced on 8 July 2010 that s. 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000, empowering officers to stop and search anyone in a designated area without having to show reasonable suspicion, was suspended. This followed a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights that the powers were unlawful because they were too broadly drawn and lacked sufficient safeguards to protect civil liberties. However, the ensuing Terrorism Act 2000 (Remedial) Order March 2011 merely tightens the procedure and criteria for declaring a designated area <italic>and</italic> retains the power to stop/search in the absence of reasonable suspicion. Furthermore, the recording requirements under Code 1 of PACE were reduced, and the requirement to record ‘stop and account’ actions was abolished as part of a bonfire of unnecessary paperwork.</p>
<p>After a few brief salad days during which the Con-alition appeared to burnish its liberal criminal justice credentials, there has been a rapid return to form as the government has reverted to tough law and order. This has been facilitated by some unforeseeable events and personality clashes, but is more fundamentally the predictable unfolding of the consequences of its quintessentially neoliberal economic strategy. It was sadly predictable that the Con-alition’s liberal pretensions would be frustrated in practice by increasing crime and disorder flowing from the austerity cuts to welfare and the global economic downturn. What was somewhat less predictable was the speed and savagery with which David Cameron squashed Kenneth Clarke’s reforms, buckling under to tabloid fury.</p>

<title>Explaining the New Law-and-Order Consensus</title>
<p>How can the development of the post-1992 law and order consensus be explained?</p>
<list id="list2-1741659012444434" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Truth will out?</italic> This is the account favoured by conservatives. Mrs Thatcher said she hadn’t made law and order an issue, the British public had. In this view law and order is simply the only solution to soaring crime rates. But in Britain crime rates had increased for 20 years before law and order began to be politicised; it remains in place despite crime falling for nearly two decades. In the USA it has been shown that the politicisation of law and order tracks political and media campaigning but not crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741659012444434">Beckett, 1997</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Blame it on The Sun?</italic> To what extent is the dominance of the law-and-order perspective due to the huge exaggeration of the threat of crime by most of the media, which has been documented by countless studies? Certainly the media have played a major role in recurrent moral panics, amplifying fear and insecurity.</p>
<p>There have been quantitative and qualitative shifts in media discourse, paralleling the rise of law-and-order politics. Increasing media focus on crime is an important trend of recent decades (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1741659012444434">Reiner, Livingstone and Allen, 2003</xref>). Narrative structures in media crime stories have also changed in ways conducive to the law-and-order frame. These changes include: (a) <italic>Accentuate the negative</italic>—bad news drives out good. Crime is depicted as ever more heinous and threatening; (b) <italic>Victim culture</italic>—media narratives construct a zero sum game of victim vs. offender; (c) <italic>Individualism and decontextualisation</italic>—offenders and victims are not depicted as part of social relations and structures, but purely as individually evil or innocent; (d) <italic>Desubordination</italic>—crime is constructed as bad by media narratives because it hurts and traumatises sympathetic individuals, not as an offence against an authoritative structure of law and morality.</p>
<p>These transformations in the pattern of media narratives frame the issue in law-and-order terms. However, the media shifts developed dialectically with the politicisation of criminal justice discourse and policy, rather than as a prior and independent cause.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>New times, new crime and control?</italic> The transformation of the politics of law and order is fundamentally related to the deep ruptures in political economy, culture and social relations associated with the hegemony of neoliberalism since the 1970s. This involved a corruption of 1960s liberalism, which had been associated with an ethic of reciprocal individualism concerned with peace and justice as well as freedom, summed up by the slogan ‘make love, <italic>not</italic> war’.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Neoliberalism generated hugely greater inequality and social exclusion, producing more crime and wider insecurities. It also undermined the efficacy of, and belief in, social tools for alleviating these problems. Neoliberalism spawned a narcissistic, consumerist, cool culture of aggressively egoistic individualism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1741659012444434">Hall, Winlow and Ancrum, 2008</xref>). ‘Make love, <italic>and</italic> war …. <italic>and</italic> loadsamoney’.</p>

<title>Reviving Social Democratic Criminology? Prospects and Problems</title>
<sec id="section26-1741659012444434">
<title>Social Democracy or Barbarism</title>
<p>Social democracy is <italic>needed</italic> if we are to avert the barbarisms of excessive crime and repressive control that flow from the deeper evils of inequality and injustice produced by neoliberalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741659012444434">Hall, 2012</xref>). If there is no reversal of these drivers of egoism and exclusion, the ‘high crime’ society and cultures of control will worsen.</p>
<p>The vaunted intelligence-led, actuarial risk-based tactics for preventing crime largely work through ‘liddism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1741659012444434">Rogers, 2010</xref>), the suppression of crime and disorder by smart situational opportunity reduction and problem solving. They turn criminology from intellectual analysis of the concepts and causes of crime to ‘liddology’, the technical design of better-fitting lids with which to hold down social tensions. In so far as they are targeted pre-emptively against potential offenders they increase the exclusion of those predicted to be risky, exacerbating the fundamental causes of crime.</p>
<p>And behind recorded or unrecorded legally defined crime, the ‘zemiologists’ remind us of the multiplicity of harmful wrongs and cruelties perpetrated by the powerful, by corporations and states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1741659012444434">Hillyard, Pantazis, Tombs and Gordon, 2004</xref>). The respectable ‘killing fields’ of pollution, dangerous work conditions, destruction of public health and welfare in the name of fiscal prudence and private profitability, wars of choice, are also fuelled by rampant neoliberalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741659012444434">Green and Ward, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1741659012444434">Nelken, 2012</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-1741659012444434">
<title>But Can Humpty-Dumpty Be Put Together Again?</title>
<p>It is often claimed that social democracy has been rendered unattainable by neoliberal globalisation that severely restricts the capacity of states, weakening them in the face of financial markets and multinational corporate behemoths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741659012444434">Crouch, 2011</xref>). But such ‘impossible’ shifts have happened before. Indeed, a key example is the 1970s revival of neoliberalism, overwhelming the seemingly entrenched, necessary and functional postwar mixed economy, welfarist settlement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741659012444434">Harvey, 2005</xref>). The impossible dream of Hayek and his associates, fantasised about in the heady air of Mount Pellerin in 1947, eventually came to be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Is it possible that the apparently immovable blocks in the way of social democracy and its criminological sensibility, in particular public opinion and the media, might be shifted?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-1741659012444434">
<title>Public Opinion</title>
<p>Opinion polls regularly portray a perspective of populist punitiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1741659012444434">Pratt, 2006</xref>), suggesting a public belief that policing and punishment have become too liberal, and a demand for tougher sentencing. This coexists with more nuanced views, however. When details of cases are given to people their views of the appropriate sentences are not out of line with judicial practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1741659012444434">Roberts, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1741659012444434">Hough and Roberts, 2012</xref>). Surveys also record considerable public support for social causation explanations, alongside the headline punitiveness, which are often based on lack of accurate information about the pattern of crime in reality, and of sentencing practice.</p>
<p>More broadly there is evidence that public attitudes are becoming more deeply shaped by the neoliberal hegemony of recent decades, and that support for welfare has lessened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1741659012444434">Park, Clery, Curtis, Phillips and Utting, 2011</xref>). Forty years ago Rawls’s theory of justice assumed plausibly as a premise that popular decision-making was strongly risk-averse and was governed by the ‘minimax’ principle of minimising the possibility of the worst possible outcome. But this has come to be replaced by cultural adulation of risk-takers and ‘edgework’. The meaning of ‘security’ has shifted from a primary focus on social welfare to crime control and terrorism. But surveys suggest some ambivalence, just as with crime. In Britain there remains considerable support for the National Health Service, for example, and a belief that inequality is too great—although there is resistance to higher taxation for these purposes. The post-crash furore about bankers’ bonuses indicates the potential for arousing popular sentiment in favour of greater social justice. The ambivalence in popular attitudes to criminal justice issues, and economic/social matters more generally, suggests that anxieties may be tapped to support an analysis of these problems in terms of fundamental causes, as in the heyday of social democracy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section29-1741659012444434">
<title>The Media</title>
<p>Media power in the criminal justice field has been illustrated many times, most recently by the Con-alition U-turn over Kenneth Clarke’s exploration of a more liberal penal policy. Most people derive their ‘knowledge’ of crime and criminal justice from the media rather than direct or even vicarious experience, so media (mis)representations are significant in framing policy discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741659012444434">Greer and Reiner, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>More broadly, the media are a significant factor in explaining a major mystery. How is it that despite the economic and financial collapse since late 2007, which might have been expected to have discredited the neoliberal model, its savagely deflationary prescriptions for dealing with the sovereign debt and deficit crises (resulting <italic>inter alia</italic> from governmental support for banking) remain the orthodoxy guiding government policy? This zombie neoliberalism survives largely because most of the media support it. But media power has limits. Despite widespread media support, David Cameron failed to achieve Conservative victory in 2010, and it became necessary to form the present Con-alition. The hold of zombie neoliberalism is vulnerable.</p>

<p>The post-2007 crisis triggered huge self-questioning by the erstwhile bastions of belief in the virtues of unfettered economic and financial globalisation. The banks were the first to rediscover the merits of Keynesian public spending—for themselves as beneficiaries!</p>
<p>There is hot pursuit of ways of regulating financial flows and excessive risk-taking by legal reforms, with fundamental assumptions of corporate and financial law being placed under the microscope: who is the lender of last resort? What are the perils of limited liability? Should a Tobin tax be introduced? Can the threat of capital flight be challenged? Global financial institutions and the markets they operate in depend upon special legal rules and national support structures which could and should be changed. Arguments about the impossibility of social democracy, because globalisation has terminally shackled national governments’ taxation and redistributive capacities, are challenged increasingly.</p>
<p>The growth of UK Uncut, the international Occupy and other fair tax and anti-neoliberalism movements suggests increasing space for arguments about fairness.
