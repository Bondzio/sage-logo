To address this issue, pharmaceutical companies around the world are making efforts such as focusing on early-stage clinical development and using innovative methods for clinical trials represented by an adaptive design.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2168479013488584">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2168479013488584">3</xref></sup></p><p>Recently, nations in regions such as East Asia have become increasingly involved in multiregional clinical trials (MRCTs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2168479013488584">4</xref></sup> These efforts seek to deliver needed medicines to patients by using an appropriate development strategy that considers the characteristics of specific regions (eg, ethnicity, medical practice, and local regulatory requirement). Therefore, it is important to understand the characteristics of each country and region in terms of clinical trials in order to work within the business environment and to seek an appropriate development strategy. However, to date, little has been reported on strategies and methods for drug development that allow companies to pursue simultaneous development while taking into account these characteristics.</p><p>To address the problem of “drug lag” in Japan, regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical companies through years of collaborative effort have been accelerating new drug development using a flexible approach. One example is a bridging strategy that complies with the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E5 guideline, which enables us to extrapolate western data to Japan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2168479013488584">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2168479013488584">6</xref></sup> The strategy of using MRCTs has been commonly applied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2168479013488584">6</xref></sup> In Japan, as is the case globally, the implication of early stage clinical development such as proof of concept (POC) is being discussed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2168479013488584">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2168479013488584"/>’<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2168479013488584">9</xref></sup> The Japanese government has encouraged the establishment of facilities that focus on translational research and domestic innovation to enable the implementation of early stage clinical development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2168479013488584">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2168479013488584">9</xref></sup> Since a clinical trial in the early stage of development is generally conducted with a small number of patients, careful planning is required to collect safety and preliminary efficacy data with accuracy and precision.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2168479013488584">10</xref></sup> In this context, it is important to accumulate knowledge about the characteristics of clinical trials in Japan to enhance early stage clinical development as well as to contribute to new drug development worldwide.</p><p>Data variability is one of the most important factors for precise estimation of treatment effects as well as calculation of sample size. However, no report has quantitatively examined the variability of Japanese clinical data such as coefficient of variation (CV) and standard deviation (SD), which closely relate to the precision of data. Hence, it would be of great interest as well as importance for both pharmaceutical companies and regulators to determine whether Japanese data have specific tendencies or patterns that will affect the development of an appropriate strategy for worldwide drug development.</p><p>In the present study, we examined 29 products recently approved in Japan to characterize Japanese clinical trial data in terms of data variability compared with non-Japanese data.</p></sec><sec id="section2-2168479013488584" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="section3-2168479013488584"><title>Data Sources</title><p>Japanese New Drug Application (NDA) approval information such as review reports and NDA dossiers were obtained from the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) web site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.info.pmda.go.jp/">http://www.info.pmda.go.jp/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="section4-2168479013488584"><title>Search Strategy</title><p>As the aim of the present study is to characterize Japanese clinical trial data in comparison with non-Japanese data in terms of their variability such as CV and SD, we selected products for which a so-called bridging strategy was employed to construct a Japan NDA data package from the standpoint of data comparability. We used “iyaku Search,” a public database provided by the Japan Pharmaceutical Information Center (JAPIC), to search relevant products. In a bridging strategy, similar clinical trials (eg, study design and target patient criteria, range of testing dose regimens, etc) are usually performed in Japan and Western countries as per the ICH E5 principle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2168479013488584">11</xref></sup> In the present study, data provided from clinical trials conducted in Western countries are called “non-Japanese data.”</p></sec><sec id="section5-2168479013488584"><title>Database Creation</title><p>New drugs, including new chemical entities and line extensions, approved in Japan from January 2000 to January 2011 were reviewed. For the condition of comparison, response variables represented as continuous values (eg, blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, hemoglobin A1c, average duration of a disease such as flu), which were used as a primary end point in the trial, were prioritized. If the variable used as a primary end point for a specific product is not represented as continuous values, we used variables for secondary end points if applicable. We selected products for which the mean value of the response variable and its SD with the number of subjects at the end of treatment (EOT) for both Japanese and non-Japanese were available in the Japan NDA dossier. Mean value of the response variable with its SD and subject number at the baseline (BL) were also collected. Coefficients of variation were calculated based on them. Relevant clinical information, such as approved indication, dosage and administration, and the countries where the trial was conducted, and other information such as company name and a product’s approval year were also added to the database.</p></sec><sec id="section6-2168479013488584"><title>Data Analysis</title><p>First, to assess the associations between Japanese data and non-Japanese data in terms of mean values and their CV at EOT and BL, scatter plots were made for these variables. Second, the ratio of the Japanese value to the non-Japanese value (J/G ratio) was calculated for each of the CVs and SDs of the response variable at BL and EOT and for SD of the amount of change from baseline (CFBL). Third, the relationships between the J/G ratios and the following factors as candidate covariates were investigated: (1) therapeutic group (based on the first level Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical [ATC] Classification System),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2168479013488584">12</xref></sup> (2) bridging condition (applicable, not applicable, or not applied in any reason), (3) approval year, (4) company type (domestic, foreign-affiliated), (5) drug type (biological, chemical), (6) type of the continuous response variable (objective end point, subjective end point), (7) pattern of bridging approach (phase 2 vs phase 2, phase 3 vs phase 3, phase 2 vs phase 3, or not meeting the bridging condition), (8) number of countries in which the non-Japanese clinical trial was conducted (single country, multiregional), and (9) presence or absence of difference in the approved dosage between Japan and the US.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section7-2168479013488584"><title>Results</title><p>Pharmaceutical products approved in Japan from January 2000 to January 2011 were reviewed.

The variability of data is often considered in many aspects in clinical trials, for example, sample size estimation for conventional as well as adaptive design trials and precision of the estimated results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2168479013488584">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2168479013488584"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2168479013488584"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2168479013488584">16</xref></sup> In this context, to characterize Japanese clinical trial data in terms of data variability is valuable.</p><p>In the present study, CV, a unitless ratio that is useful to compare variables expressed in different units, was mainly used for the data comparison because the types of clinical end point employed in each product are different and the unit for the specific response variable as well as the sample size varies greatly among products. In addition, CV can be used for sample size estimation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2168479013488584">17</xref></sup> As the present study results suggest, the variability of data should be considered depending on the situation of clinical development and characteristics (eg, POC studies, adaptive design, and powered clinical trials).</p><p>An important observation is that Japanese data are similar to non-Japanese data in terms of data variability. This is supported by the findings that most of the plots between Japanese and non-Japanese data for the values of CV are close to the line of the equation <italic>y</italic> = <italic>x</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2168479013488584">Figure 1</xref>). When we looked closely the data, we observed a similar proportion of J/G ratios in terms of CV and SD at EOT. In contrast, at BL, the majority of the products provided a low J/G ratio in SD, while the proportion was similar in CV. Since CV is calculated by dividing SD by the mean value, the difference can be accounted for by the difference in mean values between Japanese and non-Japanese data. When the mean values themselves are compared, 16 of 19 products indicated a low J/G ratio at BL. A similar tendency was also observed in SD for CFBL, but the reason is not clear.</p><p>Among products in this study, bazedoxifene acetate for osteoporosis consistently showed low J/G ratios for both CV and SD at EOT as well as at BL, for which bone mineral density (BMD) was used as a response variable. In addition, better results in the primary end point, CFBL in BMD, were provided in Japanese data. NDA dossiers didn’t provide any consideration why this finding was observed. Regarding estradiol, the J/G ratio for the mean and SD showed very low values at BL (0.50 and 0.49) as well as at EOT (0.35 and 0.31), for which the number of hot flushes was used as a response variable. The number of hot flushes at BL that we assessed in the present study is consistent with the findings reported by Gold et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2168479013488584">18</xref></sup> that vasomotor symptom prevalence rates in Japan are lower than in most non-Japanese populations.</p><p>In contrast, somatropin (1.55), pegvisomant (1.27), and bosentan hydrate (1.43) showed higher J/G ratios for the mean values at BL. However, the reason why baseline data between Japanese and non-Japanese data were so different was not considered in the NDA dossiers.</p><p>The J/G ratios for 3 diabetes drugs, alogliptin benzoate, insulin glulisine, and insulin aspart, showed a consistently narrow range of fluctuation for CV at EOT as well as at BL—between 0.96 and 1.08. Furthermore, the range of J/G ratios for the mean value among the 3 products was also quite small, between 0.89 and 1.01, which leads us to believe that theoretically, Japanese patients can be candidates for early clinical development of diabetes drugs from the standpoint of data variability.</p><p>In the assessment of the effect of covariates on the J/G ratio, no clear relationship or trend was suggested in the present study. Although all J/G ratios provided by the products developed by domestic companies showed values less than 1, further investigation is needed because we had only 5 products from domestic companies. It is notable that (1) availability of the bridging strategy and (2) difference in approved dosage between Japan and the US were not the potential factors for generating a specific tendency in the J/G ratio (data not shown).</p><p>There are several limitations in this study. First, we examined only 29 products recently approved in Japan for which continuous response variables were available in the clinical trial data in both Japan and Western countries under comparable design; products that are normally assessed with clinical efficacy rates, such as for infectious diseases, were not included. Although we found 17 more products that had primary end point data represented as continuous values, they were excluded from the present study due to the unavailability of the comparable data in the NDA dossiers. Because of small sample size, we did not include products classified into the following categories: B: Blood and blood forming organs; D: Dermatologicals; and P: Anti-parasitic products, insecticides, and repellents. A way is needed of examining products for which efficacy was evaluated by clinical efficacy rate. In addition, from the standpoint of data comparability, it would be reasonable to assess approved products by bridging strategy. However, the ability to generalize the findings into other products approved by nonbridging strategy is limited. It would also be challenging to seek a way of comparing data for products developed by a nonbridging strategy for further examination. Another limitation is that we have not conducted a specific statistical analysis because of the small number of samples for the comparison, which resulted in showing only descriptive statistics of the key figures. Furthermore, limited information was available to understand when the comparable clinical trials were conducted, in other words, whether there were long intervals between the initiation of the Japanese trial and the non-Japanese trial, and we have an interest in knowing whether the time gap may influence the J/G ratio in terms of data precision.</p><p>The key finding is that Japanese data are similar to non-Japanese data in terms of data variability. This might encourage pharmaceutical companies, academic research organizations, and the health authority in Japan to accelerate their participation in MRCTs, while the conduct of early stage clinical trials in Japan might be supported in specific diseases such as diabetes and osteoporosis. It would be valuable if MRCTs can produce data that provide supporting evidence about the nature of the differences and similarities between specific countries/regions and others. </p></sec><sec id="section9-2168479013488584"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study identified some characteristics of Japanese clinical trial data compared with non-Japanese clinical trial data by examining the values of response variables and their CV and SD used as efficacy end points. To evaluate the clinical utility of a drug, safety profiles should be considered along with efficacy. Another assessment is underway to characterize safety profiles of Japanese data in comparison with non-Japanese data. To tackle the global problem of increasing attrition rates of R&amp;D as well as the problem of “drug lag” in Japan, studies to characterize specific regions and areas must be more widely and actively conducted. If any characteristics or advantages from the strategic standpoint of worldwide development are suggested for specific countries/regions, they should be used to improve the probability of success, especially in the early stage of clinical development. </p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict" id="fn1-2168479013488584"><label>Declaration of Conflicting Interests</label><p>The
