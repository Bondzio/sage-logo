<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this paper is to provide a review of the background information regarding low-carbon housings in the United Kingdom and to raise the concern of the possible high indoor pollution load due to the emissions from building materials and combustion products which would adversely affect the indoor air quality in air-tight buildings, especially homes. The standard guidelines given by the Building Regulations in the UK are reviewed especially in relation to mechanical ventilation with heat recovery systems. Also research literatures in relation to heat recovery ventilators and the use of air-cleaners from Korea, Hong Kong and China and from Europe are also included to illustrate the various possibilities to conserve energy and to achieve adequate ventilation with an improvement of indoor air quality. The effectiveness of using a heat recovery ventilator system and trickle ventilators in unoccupied super-energy-efficient test houses is illustrated by reviewing the long-term indoor volatile organic compound (VOC) concentrations in these test houses. The awareness of the issue is important for the future design and indoor air management of buildings, so as to provide adequate ventilation for living spaces without costing too much on energy efficiency.</p></abstract>

<sec id="sec1-1420326X11431907" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Buildings are significant contributors of green house gas emissions to the atmosphere, considering:
<list id="list1-1420326X11431907" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>About 40% of emissions are generated through building architecture, construction, maintenance, heating, lighting and interiors fitting.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Nearly 50% of carbon emissions are building related.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In United Kingdom, 27% CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are from housing and 73% from space and water heating.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>10% of United Kingdom CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are associated with the manufacture and transport of construction materials.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The estimated embodied carbon generated by building a house is about 50 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>About a third of building-related emissions is from unregulated end-use appliances.</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>The subsequent impacts of global warming, due to the green house gas emissions, have led to an increasing demand of sustainable construction including further tightening of energy efficiency of homes in different parts of the world. The UK Government has announced targets to make all new homes zero carbon from 2016, demanding that all emissions from the house and activities within it must be net zero over the course of a year. Buildings are now being built with much higher air-tightness requirement according to the Building Regulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11431907">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1420326X11431907">2</xref>]. However, there are increasing concerns raised regarding the impact of the air-tight housings on health and well-being of the occupants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X11431907">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1420326X11431907">4</xref>]. There is a particular concern regarding the shortage of research (and funding) to properly monitor and study the impacts to better co-ordinate the requirements of the different parts of the Building Regulations Approved Document (AD) L (energy conservation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X11431907">5</xref>] and F (means of ventilation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11431907">6</xref>].</p>
<p>There should be mandatory indoor air quality management plan agreed at the start of the construction project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1420326X11431907">4</xref>]. Indoor air contaminants should be regulated by third party testing according to guidelines given by expert bodies and standards; and that low emission materials should be used for interior fittings of materials as standard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1420326X11431907">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X11431907">7</xref>]. The possible impacts on health due to the emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and HCHO (formaldehyde) have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X11431907">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1420326X11431907">10</xref>]. There is a need to evaluate the toxicological impacts of pollutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X11431907">11</xref>] as well as to educate the general public and the construction industry about the impact of emissions from construction products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X11431907">12</xref>]. The highly air-tight buildings with low ventilation particularly in a warm interior environment could encourage development of moisture risk, which would lead to proliferation of moulds, leading to air-borne transmission of fungal spores that could also have an effect on occupants’ health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1420326X11431907">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X11431907">14</xref>].</p>
<p>The adequate provision of an IAQ management plan is an important part of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) green building rating system and also in Hong Kong Building Environmental Assessment Method (HK BEAM) and several other green building certification schemes introduced in Korea, Japan and China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1420326X11431907">15</xref>]. The incorporation of an IAQ management plan in the Code for Sustainable Homes and in BRE Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) has been proposed by Yu and Crump [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X11431907">7</xref>]. To minimise occupants’ exposure risks to indoor pollutants and to enhance environmental quality of buildings, there is a need to consider guidelines and standards for buildings including criteria for ventilation, materials emissions and IAQ criteria for indoor air pollutants such as total VOCs (TVOC), benzene, formaldehyde, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, microparticulates and polyaromatics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1420326X11431907">16</xref>]. Already a wide range of international standards are now available for determination of indoor air pollutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1420326X11431907">17</xref>]. There are also government guidelines as well as regulations produced by the European Commission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1420326X11431907">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1420326X11431907">21</xref>], US EPA and ASHRAE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1420326X11431907">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1420326X11431907">23</xref>], Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1420326X11431907">24</xref>], Hong Kong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1420326X11431907">25</xref>], China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1420326X11431907">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1420326X11431907">29</xref>], Korea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1420326X11431907">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1420326X11431907">33</xref>], Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1420326X11431907">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1420326X11431907">36</xref>], Finland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1420326X11431907">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1420326X11431907">39</xref>] and Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1420326X11431907">40</xref>].</p>
<p>Although natural ventilation is the most desirable means to control thermal comfort and IAQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1420326X11431907">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1420326X11431907">45</xref>], this however could be counter-productive in terms of achieving the near zero carbon housing to conserve heat. The purpose of ventilation is to remove or dilute the indoor air pollutants (VOCs, HCHO, NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic>, CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, moisture, microbes and odours), to establish a balance of fresh air and metabolic gases for occupants and to regulate the indoor thermal environment for the comfort of occupants. There are various literature providing reviews and assessment of the effectiveness of various types of ventilations for various types of buildings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1420326X11431907">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1420326X11431907">62</xref>]. To satisfy the requirement of the building regulations (or building codes) of various countries, mechanical ventilation with heat recovery is required and there are various reports regarding the effectiveness of such system in terms of improving IAQ of homes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1420326X11431907">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1420326X11431907">65</xref>] and offices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1420326X11431907">66</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1420326X11431907">70</xref>]. There is also an increase use of demand control ventilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1420326X11431907">71</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1420326X11431907">74</xref>], higher efficiency of filters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1420326X11431907">75</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1420326X11431907">77</xref>] and air-cleaning systems [78−81].</p>
<p>The purpose of this paper is to provide a review of the background information regarding low carbon housings in the United Kingdom and to raise the concern of the adverse effect on IAQ for air-tight buildings, especially homes. The standard guidelines given by the Building Regulations in the United Kingdom are reviewed especially in relation to mechanical ventilation with a heat recovery system. Also research literatures in relation to heat recovery ventilators and the use of air-cleaners from Korea, Hong Kong and China and from Europe are also included to illustrate the various possibilities to conserve heat and to achieve adequate ventilation with an improvement of IAQ. The effectiveness of using heat recovery ventilator and passive trickle ventilators in super-energy-efficient test houses is illustrated by reviewing the long-term indoor VOC concentrations in these test houses. The awareness of the issue is important for the future design and indoor air management of buildings, so to provide adequate ventilation for living spaces without costing too much on energy efficiency. An estimated 70% of building energy could be lost due to mechanical extractor ventilation, but this could be recovered by heat recovery systems and 20% energy could be lost via duct leakage in domestic warm air HVAC systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1420326X11431907">82</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1420326X11431907">83</xref>]. It is difficult to save energy while to provide adequate comfort for occupants in terms of IAQ.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1420326X11431907"><title>Zero-Carbon Housing in United Kingdom</title>
<p>The definition of zero-carbon housing in the United Kingdom is based on the requirements for Level 6 of the Codes for Sustainable Homes with a net zero emissions in relation to Building Regulations issues (i.e. zero emissions from heating, hot water, ventilation and lighting) and all energy use in a home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1420326X11431907">84</xref>].</p>
<p>The Code for Sustainable Homes was developed by the UK Government to enable a step change in sustainable building practice for new homes. The Code is intended as a single national standard to guide industry in the design and construction of sustainable homes, to drive continuous improvement, greater innovation and exemplary achievement in sustainable home building. The Code is closely linked with the Building Regulations and has nine categories (energy/CO<sub>2</sub> emission, water, materials, surface water runoffs, wastes, pollution, health and well-being, management and ecology). There must be a minimum standard of achievement for the categories in relation to energy/CO<sub>2</sub>, water, materials, surface water run-offs and waste. The sustainability rating Levels 1–6 represent the overall performance of a home in respect to the rating standard of all the categories. Homes built to achieve a rating of Level 4 and above would be described as sustainable exemplary homes and should have a high level of energy efficiency. The completely zero-carbon home (Level 6) or the near zero-carbon home (Level 5) is very rarely achieved in real homes construction but in a small number of showcase homes and currently there is a debate to provide a more flexible definition, in order to allow achievement of the government target of zero carbon homes by 2016.</p>
<p>The new proposals have flexibility in mind and in addition to a reliance on in-built energy efficiency and on-site renewable energy generation; a range of additional, mostly off-site solutions (called Allowable Solutions) would be made available to developers as ways to meet the zero carbon standard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1420326X11431907">85</xref>]. A typical average sized house built to the Building Regulations (AD L, 2006) releases just over 3 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> per year. This figure is the sum of both regulated and unregulated energy use. Regulated energy use is covered by existing Building Regulations and includes energy used in a home for water heating, lighting, heat pumps and fans. Unregulated energy use is not covered by existing regulations and includes energy consumed by the occupants; such as cooking and using of electrical appliances such as televisions, hi-fi and computers. At present, approximately two thirds of the carbon emissions from the average house built to 2006 standards come from regulated energy use, whilst the remaining third comes from unregulated emissions. The new proposed definition of zero-carbon home would require the average house to be built to 2006 Building Regulations and the regulated emissions are to be reduced by 100%. The unregulated emissions will not be addressed as a part of the policy. Therefore homes in the future should be well insulated and sufficiently air-tight to meet the requirements of the Fabric Energy Efficiency Standard of the Building Regulations. There is also the on-site contribution (e.g. heating by community network and use of microgeneration for energy such as photovoltaic cell) of the so-called carbon compliance which should be reduced by 70% of the regulated energy use.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-1420326X11431907"><title>UK Building Regulations on Ventilation and IAQ</title>
<p>The increased air-tightness and the reduced air-change rate allowed in a home would increase pollutant concentrations within the living spaces and due to the reduced air-flow, would limit the capacity to reduce pollutants concentrations effectively.</p>
<p>In England and Wales of the United Kingdom, the Building Regulations AD F (2006) provides the guidance to achieve health and well-being (including comfort) of occupants by means of ventilation. A ventilation rate of between 0.5 and 1.0 ACH is considered sufficient to prevent moisture development in the air and a relative humidity should not exceed 70% for a prolonged period to avoid the consequent risk of condensation and mould growth. This is usually achieved in most homes by natural ventilation by opening windows, and in recent years trickle ventilators installed in double glazing units. Local extractor fans are also used for intermittent purging of air in areas such as the kitchen and bathroom and in commercial buildings, the printing areas. Mechanical ventilation is recognized as a means to improve thermal comfort of overheated buildings during hot summers. The following means of ventilation are allowed:
<list id="list1-1420326X11431907" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>local extract fans run intermittently,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>mechanical extract ventilation, both central and decentralised,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>whole house mechanical ventilation and heat recovery,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>single room heat recovery ventilation.</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>The Building Regulations AD F requires a reasonably high level of air tightness, and 3–4 m<sup>3</sup>/h per m<sup>2</sup> of envelope area at 50 Pa pressure difference would be the air permeability of the most air-tight buildings using normal methods of construction. The permitted maximum is 10 m<sup>3</sup>/(h/m<sup>2</sup>) at 50 Pa.</p>
<p>Due to the “leaky” nature of homes in England and Wales, a combined air change rate of 0.5 ACH is required by AD F, which allows for the ventilation rate assumed for mechanical ventilation and heat recovery system and the infiltration that can occur which would add to the overall building ventilation rate. Also due to the ever-increasing improvement in technology, continuous mechanical ventilators with heat recovery and with demand control are now almost standard in new homes, built to the higher energy efficiency requirement of the UK Building Regulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1420326X11431907">86</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1420326X11431907">87</xref>]. However, there have been reports given by the European Commission Collaborative Action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1420326X11431907">21</xref>], that there could be risks in the performance of these mechanical ventilators, including:
<list id="list1-1420326X11431907" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>HVAC components may be dirty when installed or become dirty after installation and release pollutants with odours,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>poor control of indoor temperature due to the absence of cooling,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>low humidity in winter,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>noise generated by forced airflow and fans,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>draught caused by forced airflows,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>systems with mechanical cooling can have additional risks relating to cooling coils because of the potential for microbial growth and presence of biocides,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>air re-circulation can result in dispersion of indoor generated pollutants within the house and involve higher air velocities and associated noise and draughts, and supply ducts may become contaminated with indoor-generated pollutants.</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>Performance criteria for assessing effectiveness of the ventilation strategy would be by measurement of indoor air pollutants. AD-F provides the guideline values for indoor air pollutants such as NO<sub>2</sub>, CO; TVOC; O<sub>3</sub> and bio-effluents for monitoring. The document also advise the use of low-emission materials, based on labelling criteria available and on the guidance provided by BRE Digest 464, 2002 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1420326X11431907">88</xref>].</p>
<p>Performance and suitable selection of filters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1420326X11431907">75</xref>] and regular maintenance of the ventilation system are crucial to maintain a good IAQ of the building and this is required as a part of the certification rating system of the indoor environmental quality category of LEED and HK BEAM schemes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1420326X11431907">15</xref>].</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1420326X11431907"><title>Control of IAQ by Ventilation in Energy-Efficient Housings</title>
<p>In majority of homes at present, the IAQ would be controlled by natural ventilation by opening and closing windows and/or the use of trickle ventilators installed in the double glazing units of their homes. The phase out of traditional chimney in most modern houses has limited the application of stack ventilation but there are many modern designs of buildings including homes employing passive stack for effective ventilation of space, particularly in commercial buildings. The control of IAQ by limiting the emissions from sources such as the use of low emission materials is an important consideration which could reduce some of the ventilation demand in energy-efficient housings.</p>
<p>The primary engineering control for the maintenance of IAQ is the use of ventilation, using the controlled airflows to mitigate the levels of air contaminants by:
<list id="list1-1420326X11431907" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>dilution with fresh outside air,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the use of re-circulation systems incorporating chemical and physical contaminant cleaning devices,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>both dilution and the use of recirculation systems with air-cleaners.</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>The following parameters have a critical influence on the design ventilation rates (the volume of outside air or air actually introduced into the space) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1420326X11431907">47</xref>]:
<list id="list1-1420326X11431907" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The impairment of the air quality caused by the occupants.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Emissions from materials in the space including furniture and fittings.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Indoor household activities including smoking and cleaning.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The quality of the infiltrating outside air.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The thermal load in the indoor environment.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The characteristics of the living space and dimensions.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The thermal and air quality comfort requirements of the occupants.</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>The principal considerations for reducing energy consumption in ventilation and air conditioning systems are as follows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1420326X11431907">47</xref>]:
<list id="list1-1420326X11431907" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Establish constructional, operational and organizational conditions which will facilitate low energy consumption in the system.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Determine sizing criteria in accordance with actual demand. Avoid unnecessary functions and oversized systems and components.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Use components with high efficiency levels across the whole operating range.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Design systems for demand-controlled operation, and operate them accordingly. A simple time switch can be used to achieve considerable savings. Demand-controlled ventilation systems can reduce costs but without reducing the required level of comfort.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Ensure that the relevant operating parameters and energy consumption can be measured, and undertake these measurements regularly during operation to maintain an energy budget.</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>Energy-optimized solutions are possible if sources of pollution are avoided, or if the emissions are at least extracted locally, the movement of air from the supply vent to the extract vent should be optimised to achieve ventilation effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1420326X11431907">47</xref>]. Alternatively, air could be delivered to the vicinity of people as in displacement ventilation and if smoking is prohibited within the occupied space and near the air entry into that space, then a reasonably good IAQ would be expected. If allowing cigarette smoking in the space, the design flow rate of the outside air must be based on the estimated number of cigarettes per hour and 50–130 m<sup>3</sup>/cigarette has been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1420326X11431907">47</xref>] and this would have an important impact on energy conservation, which may require the use of air cleaners especially in spaces of less than 100 m<sup>3</sup> volume.</p>
<p>In air-only systems where the thermal load is such that the supply air volume is greater than the outside air flow rate due to comfort and health requirements, the additional air should be supplied in the form of re-circulated air. Re-circulated air, however, should be used only where there is little or no pollution caused by work processes or from the internal environment – unless the re-circulated air is suitably filtered so that it is of the same quality as the outside air [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1420326X11431907">47</xref>].</p>
<p>The selection and performance of the air filter would be important and guidelines are given in ASHRAE 62.1:2010 and regular maintenance is required in LEED as a part of the IAQ management plan for certification rating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1420326X11431907">15</xref>]. To satisfy the ventilation requirement for gaseous pollutants and keep the particle concentrations below those under no ventilation, a filter with a performance that would exceed MERV11 should be used when the size of the residential housing unit is in the range of 150–300 m<sup>3</sup>. Filters for which the performance was lower than MERV07 were found to be insufficient for reducing indoor particle concentrations below the levels obtained under no ventilation as reported by Noh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1420326X11431907">75</xref>].</p>
<p>In household properties in apartment buildings in Hong Kong, Mak et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1420326X11431907">76</xref>] reported that about 90% of families surveyed have installed window typed air-conditioners in their apartments, and 9% of households use the split-type units, while the rest are without any air-conditioning facility. Due to the health concerns regarding particulate pollution from outdoors, high-efficiency filter would be necessary to reduce air-borne particulate concentrations in indoor environments of homes. The testing of the performance of filters is given by ASHRAE 52.1:2007 for dust-spot efficiency and the filter efficiency for particle size ranges of 0.3–1, 1–3 and 3–10 mm.</p>
<p>One of the most effective measures for the optimization of energy consumption for the distribution of air is to separate the thermal conditioning of the air (heating and cooling) from the air renewal process, by using radiator-type systems (e.g. radiators, and heated/chilled ceilings) for heating and/or cooling. This means that the flow rate of the air discharged into a space can be limited to the outside air flow rate actually necessary for hygiene purposes. From the point of view of energy consumption, the outside air flow should be based on the required volumetric flow rate per person. Here, it should be noted that the “required” flow rate depends significantly on the type and intensity of any sources of odour. Personalised ventilator system has been advocated for commercial buildings to improve IAQ but with energy saving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1420326X11431907">89</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1420326X11431907">90</xref>].</p>
<p>Mechanical supply ventilation is relatively simple to apply and operate and air can be filtered, but the system can be perceived by occupants to have high running costs and be noisy. Also, the system requires maintenance, its effectiveness depends upon the building layout and it is prone to occupant tampering and, often, these systems are not run continuously as recommended. However, the application of heat recovery ventilators that recycle heat generated in the indoor space are being widely used in the Far-east Asian and European countries due to the technical and economic advantages of both recovering heat and to deliver adequate air supply to occupants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1420326X11431907">91</xref>]. The annual heating energy could be effectively saved by the application of heat recovery ventilators, and the energy savings would vary according to the outdoor climatic conditions that affected sensible and latent heat. The recovery of sensible and latent heat could reduce annual energy consumption of up to 40%, and the optimum control strategies depended on the ratio of latent to sensible heat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1420326X11431907">92</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1420326X11431907">93</xref>]. The application of heat recovery ventilators has been demonstrated by previous studies and would reduce heating energy consumption, but the operation of such systems in cold climate may not be economical when the cooling set-point was above 24°C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1420326X11431907">92</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1420326X11431907">94</xref>]. A survey was conducted to assess the energy saving by application of heat recovery ventilators in several cities demonstrating a saving of 20% of energy during heating seasons and that the energy savings would exceed the operational costs of the ventilation system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1420326X11431907">95</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1420326X11431907">96</xref>]. Studies also showed that these systems could also improve air-exchange and IAQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1420326X11431907">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1420326X11431907">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1420326X11431907">97</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1420326X11431907">99</xref>].</p>
<p>Braham [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1420326X11431907">66</xref>] provided a review of low-energy building with various fabric energy storage and ventilation strategies and demonstrated that systems incorporating efficient heat recovery and effective fabric energy storage have higher year-round comfort criteria, and significantly lower prime energy consumption, than natural ventilation strategies. Supplementary cooling and heating demands and consumption are shown to be minimal in such buildings for temperate maritime climates. With fabric energy storage systems, the installed boiler capacities in commercial buildings can be reduced from typical values of 150–200 W.m<sup>−2</sup> to below 50 W.m<sup>−2</sup> gloss floor areas (GFA). The measured ventilation loss was only 0.09 W.m<sup>−2</sup> GFA.K<sup>−1</sup>. The specific fan power of the heat recovery mechanical ventilation system was 4.1 W.1<sup>−1</sup>.s<sup>−1</sup>. In addition, using mechanical ventilation allows the fresh air intakes of the central air-handling plant to be located for the highest possible IAQ throughout the building. It also permits the use of heat recovery from the exhaust air, in addition to filtration, humidification, supplementary heating and cooling of the ventilation air and controlled room air distribution.</p>
<p>Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1420326X11431907">100</xref>] examined the application of mechanical ventilation and energy recovery system in homes under various control schemes in high rise buildings in Korea and evaluated the energy saving potential of such systems and reduction of VOCs and formaldehyde. Field measurement results indicate that heat recovery and mechanical ventilation could effectively improve IAQ and provide effective energy savings. The indoor concentrations of formaldehyde were reduced by 54.6% after the heat recovery ventilators were operated for 24 h. The initial concentration was reduced by 82% after 168 h. Toluene concentration was reduced by 50% and other VOCs were also reduced by 40.1% to 53.1% after operation of the mechanical ventilation and heat-recovery system. Annual energy savings of up to 20.26% were predicted when the heat recovery ventilators were operated for 24 h continuously, exchanging sensible and latent heat. The heat recovery ventilators could save energy more effectively in winter than in summer due to the greater temperature difference between outdoor and indoor air. Based on the preferred operation schedules of homes surveyed, an annual energy savings could be as high as 8.52%.</p>
<p>Although ventilation is an effective method for reducing indoor air concentrations of pollutants, this could be further enhanced by using air-cleaning methods. There are different types of air-cleaners, from simple filters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1420326X11431907">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1420326X11431907">76</xref>], sorptive building materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1420326X11431907">101</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1420326X11431907">102</xref>], use of zeolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1420326X11431907">78</xref>] to the use of nano-technologies, utilising photo-catalysts for degradation of air-borne pollutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1420326X11431907">79</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1420326X11431907">81</xref>]. The researches reported so far have shown a high efficiency in the removal of VOCs, formaldehyde, NO<sub>2</sub> and CO in indoor air.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-1420326X11431907"><title>Long-Term Concentrations of VOCs in Energy-Efficient Test Houses</title>
<p>A study of the sources and concentrations of four energy-efficient test houses built in 1992 has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1420326X11431907">103</xref>]. The monitoring of the VOCs and formaldehyde in these houses provides an illustration of the possible IAQ concerns regarding the development of low-carbon, energy-efficient domestic housings. Two types of housings were monitored. One pair of unoccupied traditional masonry four bedroom detached houses were built to a higher insulation and air-tightness standard of the UK Building Regulations requirements and likely would meet the Level 4 and possibly Level 5 of the current Code for Sustainable Homes. The unoccupied “Swedish” test houses were built to meet and exceed the energy requirements of the Scandinavian insulation standards and likely to meet the Level 5 of the Code for Sustainable Homes. The houses were built with higher air-tightness specification than the normal standard type of UK housings and have a timber framed construction, cladded by brick and tiling externally. All windows and doors are triple glazed. The houses are well insulated throughout and have been described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1420326X11431907">103</xref>]. All the houses have the similar arrangement and furniture fittings in the rooms. The houses are carpeted throughout, except the bathroom, kitchen and airing cupboard. The bathroom and kitchen have vinyl floor coverings. All the internal doors are coated with white gloss paint. The external windows and doors are wood stained. All the ceilings are coated with emulsion paint. Medium weight curtains with motorised cord pulls are fitted to the lounge/diner and bedroom windows.</p>
<p>The Swedish energy-efficient test houses were mechanically ventilated and had heat recovery installed to maintain a constant temperature of about 20 ± 2°C, 30–55% relative humidity and about 0.3 h<sup>−1</sup> average air change rate. The indoor temperature was more or less constant at 20°C during winters, but in summers, it fluctuated between 20°C and 30°C. The humidity was about 33% during colder months, increasing to over 40% in June–September. Ventilation in the traditional masonry energy-efficient test houses was provided by trickle ventilators and extract fans installed in the kitchens and bathrooms, complying with the UK Building Regulation requirements. In addition, blockable passive stack ventilators were installed in the kitchen and bathroom for separate examination of their effectiveness, but these are only used occasionally. The average air change rate in the traditional masonry houses was about 0.5 h<sup>−1</sup>.</p>
<p>The sources and concentrations of VOCs in the indoor air of the test houses have been discussed elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1420326X11431907">103</xref>]. The indoor concentrations of TVOC and other VOCs (benzene, toluene, xylenes, ethylbenzene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, decane and undecane) were monitored over a 7-year period using a passive diffusive sampling method by exposing Tenax absorbent tubes in the living room and main bedroom over a 28 day period and the tubes were analysed by gas chromatography method using flame ionisation detector for quantification and mass spectrometer for identification of compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1420326X11431907">104</xref>]. The detection limit of the method using a 28-day sampling period was about 1–2 µg.m<sup>−3</sup>. The sampling tubes were replaced after every 4 weeks after the exposure. The method was as prescribed by the international standard, ISO 16017-2:2003. Also monitored was 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentanediol mono-isobutyrate, which is a coalescent solvent for emulsion paints used on walls and ceilings of the houses. Indoor concentrations of formaldehyde were also monitored using diffusive samplers (GMD 570) containing 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) coated on a filter paper. The fixed formaldehyde was analysed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. The samplers were exposed to the room atmosphere for 3 days, giving a 3-day average concentration, and the sampling was repeated every 28 days. The detection limit for the method using a 3-day sampling period is 1 µg.m<sup>−3</sup>. This sampling and analysis of formaldehyde are as prescribed in the international standard, ISO 16000-4:2004.</p>
<p>The TVOC concentrations in the Swedish test houses were initially very high, about 16,000–19,500 µg m<sup>−3</sup>, during the first on-site measurement prior to the first monitoring period after completion of the houses. The 28-day average TVOC concentration during the first month of monitoring was 9,700 µg m<sup>−3</sup>. The first year annual mean TVOC concentrations in the test houses were well exceeding the 95 percentile of mean values found in the survey of indoor air pollution in 876 English homes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1420326X11431907">104</xref>]. This concentration took over a year to reach 635 µg m<sup>−3</sup> and took 16–18 months to reduce to a steady concentration of 200 µg m<sup>−3</sup>, meeting the guideline values as recommended by the European authors for good IAQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1420326X11431907">18</xref>]. This value is also close to the mean value found of normally occupied homes in England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1420326X11431907">104</xref>]. The concentration was maintained at this value during the rest of the 7-year monitoring showing the ineffectiveness of the ventilation system for removal of VOCs in the indoor environment of the air-tight house and there was always a “reservoir” of VOCs exist in the house. There was a dominant presence of 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentanediol mono-isobutyrate from the beginning of indoor monitoring of the houses and, although much reduced after 9 months to a year, both isomers of 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentanediol mono-isobutyrate persisted in the house over the 7-year monitoring period. Since the houses were unoccupied, VOCs generated by occupants’ activities would not be contributed to the indoor concentration. The concentrations of VOCs in the different rooms in the house were shown to be not statistically different, indicating that there was an adequate air circulation within the house and that the emissions from the local source in each room were well mixed with the indoor air of the house. The introduction of new materials (e.g. painting of a door or installing new wood-based panels) and their emissions would soon be transmitted to the rest of the house [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1420326X11431907">105</xref>].</p>
<p>The initial concentrations of TVOC in the energy-efficient traditional masonry houses were similar to the Swedish houses. The decline of the TVOC concentrations inside the houses was also similar to the Swedish energy-efficient test houses. This showed that the low air change rate provided by the passive ventilation using trickle ventilators in these houses was not sufficient for quick removal of VOCs in the house, bearing in mind that the houses were unoccupied, there was no opening of windows by occupant intervention and entry to the houses was infrequent except for the replacement of samplers by the researcher at the beginning of each month.</p>
<p>Due to the use of low emission particleboard flooring in the house, the formaldehyde concentration was mostly below the WHO guideline value of 100 µg m<sup>−3</sup> and with an average concentration of 59 µg m<sup>−3</sup> in the first year. A maximum concentration of 122 µg m<sup>−3</sup> was measured during the summer of the first year after the completion of the house when the indoor temperature exceeded 30°C. The concentration dropped to just below 50 µg m<sup>−3</sup> during autumn and rose again during the following summer to about 100 µg m<sup>−3</sup>. The results indicated that the lack of sufficient air exchange in the house could exacerbate the rise in formaldehyde concentration during the first 2 years of the newly built energy-efficient house, especially during hot summers. The subsequent indoor concentrations in summers were between 50–90 µg m<sup>−3</sup> and in winters were between 10 and 40 µg m<sup>−3</sup>. The second year annual mean formaldehyde concentration was 52 µg m<sup>−3</sup> and this declined to a steady annual mean value of 35 µg m<sup>−3</sup> during the following years. This value is a little higher than the mean value of 22 µg m<sup>−3</sup> found by the indoor air survey of 876 normally occupied homes in England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1420326X11431907">104</xref>] and a mean of 26 µg m<sup>−3</sup> in 70 homes in Southampton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1420326X11431907">106</xref>] and 20 normal homes in Hertfordshire which had been upgraded with mechanical ventilation and heat recovery installation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1420326X11431907">107</xref>]. The houses in Hertfordshire were built to the normal standard of homes in the United Kingdom and therefore not as air-tight or well-insulated as the Swedish test houses. So, there were higher air-change rate and higher frequency of opening windows and doors due to occupants’ activities and interventions.</p>
<p>The benefit of natural ventilation as provided by stack ventilators in commercial office building for removal of VOCs is illustrated by a study of a new naturally ventilated, energy-efficient office building [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1420326X11431907">108</xref>]. The TVOC concentration declined from an initial peak of 1225 µg m<sup>−3</sup> to about 200–300 µg m<sup>−3</sup> after 8 months in office areas connected to a stack natural ventilation system. In office area not connected to the stack ventilation system, it took over 1 year for the TVOC concentration to decline from a peak of 2000 µg m<sup>−3</sup> to 500 µg m<sup>−3</sup>. The study illustrated the benefits of planned ventilation for achieving good IAQ.</p>
<p>There is a need to reduce the initial high concentration of TVOC and formaldehyde by using low-emitting materials, thereby reducing the risk of high VOC exposure during the first 6 months after building completion. The alternative would be to use air-cleaners or to apply a high mechanical ventilation flow to flush the building for an initial period of say 2–3 months to reduce the initial high indoor concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1420326X11431907">15</xref>]; however this would have an energy cost during the initial period, but allowing the use of a low air change ventilation later after the reduction of indoor concentrations of pollutants.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-1420326X11431907" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The increasing demand by environmentalists as well as governments have further increase the tightening of energy efficiency requirements for buildings. The UK Government’s target of zero carbon homes by 2016 would have a serious implication on building and IAQ of homes. There is a need to review the requirements and examine the various ventilation options including the use of air-cleaners to reduce the indoor air pollution burden in the homes whilst allowing energy conservation. The use of low emission materials for new build or refurbishment would alleviate the need for a higher air change rate and therefore would reduce the energy cost or carbon emissions.</p></sec></body>
