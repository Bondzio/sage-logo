<abstract>
<p>School nurses care for children with a variety of health-related conditions and they need information about managing these conditions, which is accessible, current, and useful. The goal of this literature review was to gather and synthesize information on technology-supported resources and to determine which met the educational needs of school nurses. Successful online educational programs were interactive and self-directed. The most common barriers were lack of time to find educational information, lack of knowledge about computers, technology, the Internet and specific programs, and lack of administrative support from school officials to use technology to access information and evidence for practice. Recommendations for successful use of technology to meet practicing school nurse’s educational needs are offered.</p>

<body>
<p>School-age youth increasingly bring a variety of health-related needs into the classroom. The extent to which these needs are met has implications for the child and their family. The school nurse role is critical to the implementation of quality school health services. For many children, contact with a school nurse may be the only consistent access to a health care professional. Optimally prepared school nurses are needed to meet the multiple, complex demands of 21st-century health care in educational settings. Quickly changing technologies, rapidly expanding information, and increasingly complex care requirements have left school nurses seeking the support and further training necessary to provide quality care for children. The school nurse is often the only health professional in an educational setting; other school nurses may be miles away in other districts with little or no contact between them. This is in contrast to nursing professionals in acute care or primary care settings where support and information can be easily obtained from nursing colleagues in the same institution.</p>
<p>School nurses need information about managing health conditions, which is accessible, current, and useful. This information can be offered as separate educational programs or made available when it is needed, or “just in time.” “Just in time” availability of information could occur in a variety of settings and times such as a remote school location, on the playground, or in the middle of a busy lunch hour. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840512443261">National Association of School Nurses (2011</xref>) commented about the importance of educational activities:<disp-quote>
<p>The quality of nursing practice is directly linked to the practitioner’s body of knowledge and the level of skills. The availability of national, regional, state and local educational activities related to practicing in the school setting, benefits the school nurse and the children and communities served.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Advances in technology have broadened access to this information. The broadened access can increase support of the school nurse by providing the necessary information to meet diverse needs. The goal of this literature review was to gather and synthesize information on technology-supported resources and to determine which meet the in-depth educational and just-in-time informational needs of school nurses.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>A literature search was performed utilizing the databases, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PubMed, and the Educational Resources Information Center. The period of review was 1990–2010 with a focus on those articles from 2000 to 2010, keeping in mind that technology changes very quickly and articles older than 10 years may not offer currently relevant information. Only peer-reviewed journals were evaluated. Search terms used were <italic>continuing education</italic>, <italic>school nurs*</italic>, <italic>technology</italic>, <italic>Internet</italic>, and <italic>web-based</italic>. This search yielded 42 articles, 29 of which were specific to school nurses and 7 of which were related to continuing education and school nurses. Due to the small number of studies found with the initial terms, the search was expanded to include the terms <italic>computer assisted</italic>, <italic>computer mediated,</italic> and <italic>multimedia learning</italic>. This search yielded 146 articles, of which 19 were related to continuing education, school nurses, and technology. The abstracts were read to identify those research studies that were related to school nurses or nurses in a setting with similar continuing education needs, such as the need for “just in time” learning or the use of technology to meet continuing education needs. In addition, the <italic>Journal of School Nursing</italic> from 2005 to current was hand searched for studies related to the search terms, yielding one additional article. Summaries of the 19 articles included in this literature review are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059840512443261">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>Most of the reviewed studies did not identify a guiding theoretical framework. Of the three articles that identified a guiding theoretical framework, two used the diffusion of innovations theory. This theory predicts the likelihood that a new practice will be adopted by a particular culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059840512443261">Rogers, 1962</xref>). This theory could be applicable in considering school nurses’ acceptance of the use of new technology for meeting their educational needs. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840512443261">Bachman and Hsueh (2008</xref>) used the diffusion of innovations theory to identify characteristics of a program that are associated with participants perceiving that it is a better method of learning. The program must be convenient, satisfying, and have some advantage over an existing method. Another theory related to technology use in nurses is the technology acceptance model. This model focuses on factors that affect adoption of technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840512443261">Mazhar, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840512443261">Chen, Yang, Tang, Huang, and Yu (2008</xref>) utilized this theory and found that increased adoption of web-based learning techniques for continuing education was related to the nurse’s perception of the usefulness and ease of use of the technology. They also found that most nurses reported a high likelihood of using web-based learning.</p>

<title>Increased Use of Technology</title>
<p>Studies have indicated that nurses have an interest in learning through the use of technological resources. A literature review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059840512443261">Cobb (2004)</xref> found that the use of technology for continuing education is on the rise in the health care field. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840512443261">Adams (2009</xref>) found that school nurse respondents, who worked primarily in large school districts, used Internet sources more than textbooks. A study that evaluated the use of online continuing education for school nurses about diabetes management in children, reported an online course offered improvement in patient care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840512443261">Bachman &amp; Hsueh, 2008</xref>). Access to computers was not identified as a barrier and a course being online was seen as a strength of a program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059840512443261">Ellery, McDermott, &amp; Ellery, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059840512443261">Sweeney, Saarmann, Flagg, &amp; Seidman, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840512443261">Charles and Mamary (2002</xref>) reported that 85% of nurse practitioners had access to the Internet, similar to findings in other studies. These studies were from the early 2000s, with the use of technology continuing to evolve and advance, it is likely that this number will continue to increase. Indeed, according to Adams’ (2009) study of school nurses, 80–96% of nurses had access to a computer at work and 70–80% of the nurses used the computer.</p>
<p>Another advantage to technology use is its ability to provide information that is “just in time.” Technology offers access to information at the time and place that it is needed. School nurses have indicated they need this just in time access, since they often cover a wide geographical area and care for many children with a variety of medical needs. Strategies were identified that were successful in providing technology-enhanced continuing education for school nurses. Several studies discussed the need for training to be interactive for the information to be retained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840512443261">Bernardo &amp; Stein, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840512443261">Charles &amp; Mamary, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840512443261">Durkin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059840512443261">Huckstadt &amp; Hayes, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059840512443261">Neafsey, 1997</xref>). Technology can offer this interactivity through the innovative expansion of capabilities, including animation, hypertexts, video, and graphics. Using technology for continuing education and just-in-time learning lends itself to more self-directed learning. The nurse is able to choose what information they want and access it when they need that information. Additionally, the nurse is able to progress through the material at an individualized pace, which may lead to greater use of the educational materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059840512443261">Neafsey, 1997</xref>).</p>

<title>Barriers to Technology Use</title>
<p>Most studies in this review identified at least some barriers to the use of technology for continuing education. The most common barriers cited were lack of time to find educational information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840512443261">Atack, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059840512443261">Cobb, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840512443261">Dee &amp; Stanley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840512443261">Gregg &amp; Wozar, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840512443261">Hegge, Poers, Hendrickx, &amp; Vinson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059840512443261">Vought-O’Sullivan, Meehan, Havice, &amp; Pruitt, 2006</xref>), lack of knowledge about computers, technology, the Internet and specific programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840512443261">Atack, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840512443261">Charles &amp; Mamary, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059840512443261">Cobb, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840512443261">Dee &amp; Stanley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840512443261">Gregg &amp; Wozar, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840512443261">Hegge et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059840512443261">Huckstadt &amp; Hayes, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059840512443261">Neafsey, 1997</xref>), and lack of administrative support from school officials in using technology to access information and evidence for practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840512443261">Adams, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059840512443261">Spenceley, O’Leary, Chizawsky, Ross, &amp; Estabrooks, 2008</xref>).</p>

These characteristics include lack of access to a computer while away from the office and lack of remote access to databases such as the CINAHL and the National Library of Medicine (NLM), and lack of remote access to educational programs. While studies found that attending a professional conference is still the most common way for nurses to receive continuing education, authors discussed the need to look beyond conferences to provide education that is available at the time that it is needed and where it is needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840512443261">Charles &amp; Mamary, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059840512443261">Cobb, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840512443261">Dee &amp; Stanley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059840512443261">Spenceley et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Components of Successful Educational Programs</title>
<p>Factors that could enhance the use of technology for education were identified in the articles reviewed. Different types of technology as well as different components of continuing education were identified as enhancing the educational experience. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840512443261">Dee and Stanley (2005</xref>) discussed nine types of health care resources that were used for education, including humans, books, journals, databases, handheld computers, Internet sites, electronic books and journals, teleconference or meetings, and drug representatives. The authors identified the three most frequently utilized health care resources as the computer, the Internet, and search engines. Components of continuing education that nurses found most helpful were also identified. Characteristics that should be considered in the development of technologically innovative educational programs include quick access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840512443261">Atack, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840512443261">Dee &amp; Stanley, 2005</xref>), the ability for the program to be completed in small pieces or “chunks,” and the flexibility to be able to interrupt and return to the program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840512443261">Atack, 2003</xref>). Other characteristics of successful programs include convenience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840512443261">Bachman &amp; Hsueh, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840512443261">Bernardo &amp; Stein, 2009</xref>), ease of use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840512443261">Chen, Yang, Tang, Huang, &amp; Yu, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840512443261">Dee &amp; Stanley, 2005</xref>), reliability, and concise information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840512443261">Dee &amp; Stanley, 2005</xref>). The respondents in Dickerson and Feitshans’ (2003) study reported that the Internet offered up-to-date information that assisted with keeping current in professional practice and offered ease of access.</p>
<p>Several authors identified the importance of using interactive techniques rather than static presentation of information. This was done through the use of appealing and interesting information using graphics, links, case study format, animation, and offering interactive test questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840512443261">Durkin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059840512443261">Huckstadt &amp; Hayes, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Another aspect to consider in creating successful educational programs is including ways for school nurses to have access to other school nurses for support, to offer opportunities to ask questions of experienced experts, and to provide opportunities to network with other nurses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840512443261">Adams, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840512443261">Dee &amp; Stanley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840512443261">Dickerson &amp; Feitshans, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059840512443261">Huckstadt &amp; Hayes, 2005</xref>). Listservs provide this opportunity. Listservs provide a sense of belonging with others of similar profession and offer a method to gain information from across the globe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059840512443261">Thompson &amp; Penprase, 2004</xref>). They are especially helpful for school nurses since they tend to practice in isolation.</p>

<title>Summary and Recommendations</title>
<p>The indications from the literature are that school nurses, in general, are accepting of technology to enhance their learning, as long as it is perceived as both useful and easy to use. Use of technology is increasing among school nurses with upward of 80% using the computer at work. Technology-based education offers several advantages over traditional methods. It can provide access to information at the time and place that it is needed. This is a particularly useful characteristic for school nurse practice, which often takes place across buildings and settings. Technology-based educational offerings can include an interactive component that increases understanding and retention. Most importantly, technology affords the ability for learning to occur in a self-directed way. School nurses can choose what information they want, when they want it, and can progress through the material at an individualized pace. School nurses indicated that barriers to technology use include a lack of time to find educational information, lack of knowledge about computers, and lack of administrative support from school officials. Successful education programs are convenient, easy to use and quick to access, offer reliable and concise information that can be completed in small chunks, and offer the flexibility to be able to interrupt and return to the program.</p>
<p>School nurses require up-to-date and accurate information that is readily available during their workday. Through advancements in technology, this information can be provided utilizing a variety of means. Along with offering various informational and educational methods, it is imperative to offer clear and easy-to-follow training for the programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840512443261">Dee &amp; Stanley, 2005</xref>) as well as adequate technological support to manage malfunctions and maintenance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840512443261">Gregg and Wozar (2003</xref>) reported an increased use of the Internet for finding information after training was provided. The training included information on identifying and using quality and reliable medical information. While it is important to train nurses accessing the education program, it is also important to provide information to the school administrators on the importance of evidence-based practice and continuing education for school nurses. Nurses are more likely to access the available information and apply it to practice if they have the support of their administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840512443261">Dee &amp; Stanley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059840512443261">Spenceley et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>It is not a new idea to involve end users of programs in the design of the program. This holds true for school nurses as well. In order to increase the likelihood of the nurse accessing and using the educational tool, they need to be involved in the design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059840512443261">Spenceley et al., 2008</xref>). This involvement leads to a feeling that their voices are being heard and their needs are being met, and leads to a feeling of ownership. In addition, it is important to create an interactive program that makes learning interesting and enjoyable, holds the nurses’ attention, and assists with retention of the material. Many innovative technologies are being developed for use in the creation of educational tools to make them interactive, informative, and current.</p>
<p>School nurses, who often practice in rural, remote, and isolated school settings, must have the knowledge and skills to accurately assess, diagnose, identify outcomes, plan, implement, and evaluate children’s health issues. With the advancement of technology and the development of technological means to increase the availability of educational resources, school nurses have improved access to the information needed in order to benefit the school nurse, children, and community.</p>
<p>Mobile devices, such as smart phones and tablet computers, can be used to bring information to school nurses. A mobile information delivery device could serve as an “e-resource” providing clinical expertise, including guidelines, videos, and websites. This is an example of an innovative use of technology to reach nursing professionals who practice largely in isolation. In times of scarce resources, the use of technology has the potential to improve the school nurses’ access to information, which can increase knowledge, skills, and competency of the school nurses who provide school-based care to children with a variety of health-related conditions.</p>
