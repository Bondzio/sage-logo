<p>We animals play, human and non-human alike. Why we do so has been a matter of interest for philosophers, historians, ethologists, and other scholars for at least two centuries. In <italic>Impure Play,</italic> Alexander Riley contributes to this rich body of scholarship by examining the role of play within popular culture. Riley contends that each of these topics is given short shrift in the contemporary social sciences. Social scientists are wont to study the hard stuff of work rather than the ephemera of play, just as they devote more attention to social and economic structures than to leisure and popular culture. The research agendas of social scientists are thus inflected with enduring and widespread prejudices concerning the significance of play in modern societies. Riley seeks to redress this situation. After an initial chapter concerning theories of play and the disciplinary status of his subject, the author presents a series of topically diverse studies in popular culture, each of which is interwoven with themes of sacredness, transgression, and tragedy, all conceived in the late Durkheimian tradition of American cultural sociology.</p>
<p>Riley writes against the methodology of the British school of cultural studies, charging that such work is reductionist with respect to popular culture. He argues that the British school reads popular culture as epiphenomena of some deeper and more important structure, usually race, class, or gender. Whatever we take from such readings, Riley suggests they are never satisfactory because cultural phenomena are always somewhat autonomous from the material conditions of their production. Getting at the autonomous dimension of culture demands we set aside the very questions that were central for the British school. Thus we move from an external analysis of culture-in-terms-of-structure to an internal interpretation of meaning-in-terms-of-culture.</p>
<p>Riley proposes that cultural phenomena which are ‘serious’ and those which are ‘playful’ are far from mutually exclusive. Many apparently playful phenomena are in fact deadly serious, as seen in the heady passion, incipient tribalism, and extreme violence associated with the game of soccer. Extending this line of reasoning, Riley makes a crucial theoretical distinction. While Roger Caillois famously maintains that play is ‘activity which finds its end in itself’ (p. 9) and that it ‘rests, relaxes, distracts, and causes the dangers, cares and travails of life to be forgotten’ (p. 9), Riley believes that this account is at best incomplete. Play can also be associated with levels of seriousness akin to those of the sacred. Professional athletes, for example, display a ‘dedication to training and preparation [which] often directly mirrors the kind of ritualistic obsession of the behavior of the religiously devout’ (p. 10). Countering Caillois again, Riley argues that such behavior cannot be explained in terms of financial interests, since sportspeople often pursue financially irrational courses of action because something higher is at stake. Despite his firm critique, Riley does not entirely reject the Cailloisian account of play. It captures the ‘pure’ dimensions of play but requires a complement which captures forms of play which are tainted with various kinds of seriousness, hence the need for the concept of ‘impure play’. The chapters following this theoretical excursion are driven by this basic distinction, drawing our attention to the ubiquity of impure play in the popular culture of modern societies. In subject and interpretation, these chapters are diverse, and only their prominent features are sketched here.</p>
<p>The first empirical chapter examines a literary scandal in France provoked by the work of Michel Houellebecq. While this particular scandal seems explainable by the fact that Houellebecq did indeed aim to shock, Riley suggests there is more at stake. In a manner reminiscent of Pierre Bourdieu, Riley contends that Houellebecq’s fiction conveys an incisive sociology of French society. It is because it can cut at the nerves of society that mere fiction can provoke a traumatic reaction. And so the play of literature sparks a crisis of morality. In the following chapter, which concerns the sub-cultural genres of gangsta rap and death metal, we are confronted with aesthetic forms which, with their spit, blood, guns, drugs, and bling, exhibit an unseemly obsession with social taboos. The get-ups of gangsta rappers and of the death metal set may appear comically playful to serious cultural analysts, but they have been interpreted as anything but playful by the general public. Indeed, they have triggered a series of moral panics in much the same manner as did rock music in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Returning to sport in more depth, Riley describes a number of events where the cloak of professionalism was torn away and the order of the game collapsed, sometimes leading to a breach in the social order of the audience as well. One such event was the infamous ‘malice in the palace’ where the Indiana Pacers and the Detroit Pistons started a fight that tore through a basketball stadium and lodged itself in the cultural memory of American sport. The social world of video games gets bound up in similar processes but in a different way. Video games are by definition a means of play, yet they are frequently linked to (and even blamed for) the full spectrum of adolescent pathology, ranging from domestic isolation to schoolyard shootings. Riley warns against these simplistic and moralistic interpretations. While many video games entail high levels of violence, he suggests they permit equally high levels of narrative flexibility. Even games which involve serial killing are imaginatively re-interpreted by their players, often along moralistic lines. Thus video games are indeed serious but seldom in the ways feared by their detractors.</p>
<p>Riley then turns from the sphere of virtual to that of real violence, examining the televised suicide of the American politician R. Budd Dwyer and its place within American popular culture. The relationship between this lamentable event and questions of play is not entirely clear, though its links to sacredness and transgression are obvious enough. Following Baudrillard, Riley suggests that acts of suicide, especially when committed in public, can possess a distinctive power. This power results from their being interpreted in particular ways. Riley examines a number of public suicides, proposing that Dwyer’s death remains memorable because of the narrative that framed its interpretation, according to which an upright individual was hounded by the system, finally choosing an honorable end. Lacking a tragic narration of this kind, other public suicides are readily interpreted as the actions of psychotic outsiders, and such events are not memorable because their stories cannot be easily retold in a meaningful way. What can we say about a psychotic who does something mad?</p>
<p>Given its focus on play in popular culture, Impure Play exhibits some surprising omissions, especially with respect to the existing literature. The most obvious of these from a cultural sociological perspective is the book's neglect of Clifford Geertz, and in particular, his essay on the Balinese cockfight, which mobilizes the concept of ‘deep play’. Geertz took the concept from Jeremy Bentham, who used it to refer to certain kinds of irrational actions, like placing potentially ruinous bets on games of chance. The relationship between ‘deep’ and ‘impure’ play deserves attention. Another relationship which might have been considered concerns the significance of impure forms of play to the perennial question of social order.</p>
<p>These reservations aside, <italic>Impure Play</italic> is to be commended, for it is laden with insights into spheres of cultural life that professional sociologists seldom attend to, let alone study. The book should be seen not as a unitary work but as a collection of essays fortified with a common method and themes – ironically, perhaps, much like a volume of Geertz. While the dominant themes are transgression, tragedy, and the sacred, other more subtle ideas emerge from its chapters as well. These ideas are expressed in a tone so personal that it borders on the confessional and is often beguiling. Literary scandals, heavy metal, video games, and the other subjects explored are not mere grist for a scholarly mill; they are experiences that delight, fascinate, and at times trouble the author. Despite its call to take play seriously, here is a book brimming with play, and in its transgression of the objective voice, it too is impure.</p>
