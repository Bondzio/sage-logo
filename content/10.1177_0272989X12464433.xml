<abstract>
<p>The present research provides empirical evidence of whether communicating the prenatal risk of chromosomal anomalies using comparison scenarios influences women’s ability to distinguish between different risk levels. In 2 experiments, participants read a description of a hypothetical woman who was learning of the risk of chromosomal anomaly as a result of a prenatal screening test. Both experiments used a 3 (risk level) × 3 (scenario) full between-subjects design. In accordance with the experimental condition, participants were presented with a low (e.g., 1 in 5390), a medium (e.g., 1 in 770), or a high risk value (e.g., 1 in 110). Such risk values were presented either on their own or along with additional information illustrating a comparison scenario that provided 2 numerical comparison points. Participants were asked to evaluate the risk of chromosomal anomaly. In Experiment 2, participants’ numeracy skills were also assessed. Results showed that the use of comparison scenarios results in significant differences in perceived risk across risk levels whereas such differences are not significant without the comparison scenario, but such a technique has differential effects according to participants’ capacity to deal with numbers. Although the technique is beneficial for high-numerate participants, it has no effect on low-numerate participants.</p>

<p>In prenatal risk communication, as well as in other domains of medical practice, risk is often communicated by means of raw numbers rather than verbal labels or graphic displays. For example, pregnant women who are screened for chromosomal anomalies of the fetus are commonly provided with test results indicating the risk of anomaly in the form of a ratio (e.g., 2 in 1000). Likewise, pregnant women who decide to undergo an invasive diagnostic procedure (e.g., amniocentesis) are warned about the incremental risk of miscarriage from the procedure in a numerical format (e.g., 1 in 200 or 0.5%). Informed decisions require patients’ complete understanding of the risk associated with the options from which they have to choose, and efficient prenatal risk communication hinges on future mothers’ grasp of statistical information. Unfortunately, patients’ innumeracy is notorious: Lay people have extreme difficulties in translating numbers into meaningful concepts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272989X12464433">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272989X12464433">2</xref></sup> Even simple questions involving risk—such as which number represents the biggest risk of getting a disease from 1 in 10, 1 in 100, and 1 in 1000—are difficult to solve for about 22% of people.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272989X12464433">3</xref></sup> Generally speaking, approximately 20%–30% of highly educated people either attach no meaning to statistical information or have wrong or vague representations of its meaning (see also Peters and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272989X12464433">4</xref></sup>).</p>
<p>Whereas several numerical formats are available to express risk, ratios in the 1-in-<italic>X</italic> format are extensively preferred, especially in the fields of genetic counseling and obstetrics,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272989X12464433">5</xref></sup> owing perhaps to their intuitive sense of clarity and simplicity: Health practitioners’ preference for ratios with a numerator of 1 and shifting denominators (e.g., 1 in 200) seems to result from a spontaneous attempt to make the population size statistics more understandable to the public<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272989X12464433">6</xref></sup> and from the belief that this format might be particularly motivating.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272989X12464433">7</xref></sup> Despite the seemingly valuable simplicity of ratios in the 1-in-<italic>X</italic> format, several doubts about its appropriateness were recently raised (see also Zikmund-Fisher<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12464433">8</xref></sup>). Experimental research showed individuals’ greater difficulty in assessing ratios in the 1-in-<italic>X</italic> format compared with other formats (such as rates, e.g., “5 in 1000,” or frequencies, e.g., “5 out of 1000 patients”) and diminished capacity to comprehend it<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272989X12464433">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272989X12464433">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272989X12464433">10</xref></sup> as well as individuals’ biased ability to evaluate it, showing a systematic increase of perceived threats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272989X12464433">11</xref></sup> The 1-in-<italic>X</italic> format appears to be so misleading that some authors have advocated that it be retired from use in clinical communication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12464433">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Given the relevance of the decisions that future mothers have to make in the light of risk information, given the difficulties that they can experience in grasping statistical information in the way it is currently communicated,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272989X12464433">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272989X12464433">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272989X12464433">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272989X12464433">11</xref></sup> and given the difficulties of embodying nonnumerical formats (e.g., graphic representations) in routine clinical communication (e.g., telephone consultations), the challenge for applied cognitive psychology is to show how numbers conveying risk in the 1-in-<italic>X</italic> format can be efficiently communicated to patients.</p>
<p>According to Kunreuther and others,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272989X12464433">12</xref></sup> people given low probabilities in ratio format associated with some event may not know how to evaluate them. People find it difficult to gauge how concerned they should feel about a 1 in 100,000 probability of death without some comparison point. Yet individuals are much better able to evaluate probabilities when they are given relevant comparison scenarios involving 2 comparison points (e.g., a description of a high- and a low-probability automobile accident scenario). For instance, providing respondents with a vivid 2-comparison point scenario helps them to distinguish between different levels of risk of dying from toxic material release (1 in 650; 1 in 6300; 1 in 68,000).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272989X12464433">12</xref></sup> These results can be ascribed to the notion of evaluability,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272989X12464433">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272989X12464433">14</xref></sup> suggesting that attributes and prospects are difficult to evaluate independently without a meaningful comparison. Comparative information was proven to be helpful also for the understanding of different risk levels in the case of smoking risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272989X12464433">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a set of 2 experiments, we applied the comparison scenario technique to the prenatal diagnosis domain in order to explore how it could enhance risk comprehension of chromosomal anomalies. We are aware that risk comprehension is a complex concept that entails different aspects, but for the purpose of this study we limited the investigation to the ability of the individual to make qualitative distinctions among different levels of risk. In Experiment 1, we evaluated through an online questionnaire the effect of 2 types of comparison scenario, 1 describing the risk of infection during pregnancy and 1 describing the risk of car accident, on the ability to distinguish between risk levels. In Experiment 2, we replicated the results obtained in Experiment 1 with a standard paper-and-pencil questionnaire and extended the study to investigate the impact of numeracy skills (individual capacity to deal with probabilities) on the technique’s effect on ability to distinguish between risk levels.</p>

<title>Experiment 1</title>
<p>In Experiment 1, we explored the effect of the comparison scenario technique in helping individuals to distinguish the different risks of chromosomal anomaly. Following Kunreuther and others,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272989X12464433">12</xref></sup> we created 2 comparison scenarios (with 2 comparison points each) suitable for the prenatal domain, and we tested their influence in helping participants to distinguish between different risk levels. The 2 scenarios differed in content but not in number. The infection scenario illustrates a risky situation that may arise during pregnancy and for this reason can be considered more semantically related (Note 1) to the target risk (chromosomal anomaly) than to the car accident scenario. The car accident scenario, conversely, illustrates a risky situation in driving, which is part of our everyday experience, and for this reason it is more familiar to participants than the infection scenario. Unlike Kunreuther and others,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272989X12464433">12</xref></sup> we also included a control condition in which no comparison scenario was provided, which allowed us to determine women’s baseline capacity to distinguish between different objective risk levels when the target risk is presented on its own and to allow us control better for the influence of the comparison scenario technique.</p>

<title>Participants and design</title>
<p>Data from 392 users of Italian Web sites dedicated to pregnancy and babies were initially collected through a Web questionnaire. Not all women in the sample were pregnant at the time of the data collection or had been in the past 3 years; we therefore reduced the sample to 279 participants (age, <italic>x</italic> = 32 years, <italic>s</italic> = 4.5 years), keeping those who were currently pregnant (<italic>n</italic> = 181) and/or those who had been pregnant in the last 3 years (<italic>n</italic> = 98). Their education was generally high: 51% had a university degree, 44% had a high school degree, and the remaining 5% had a lower degree. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 9 conditions. The study used a 3 (risk level: 1 in 110, 1 in 770, 1 in 5390) × 3 (scenario: no scenario, infection scenario, car accident scenario) between-subjects design. All participants were given the following description of a hypothetical woman who undergoes a prenatal test (translation from Italian; for the original version see the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0272989X12464433">appendix</xref>):
<disp-quote>
<p>Imagine that Emma, a pregnant woman, undergoes a screening test to determine the risk that her baby will have a chromosomal anomaly. The results of the test indicate a risk of (1 in 110, 1 in 770, 1 in 5390).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The 3 risk levels were defined in order to investigate a high, a medium, and a low risk. One in 110 is the average risk of chromosomal anomaly for a 40-year-old woman and is generally categorized as a high risk. One in 770 and 1 in 5390 are multiples of 1 in 110 and correspond to a medium risk level and a low risk level, respectively. According to the experimental condition, participants either were given no comparison scenario or were randomly presented with the infection scenario or the car accident scenario. The infection scenario was as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>For comparison purposes consider that in Europe, the risk of contracting an infection that can damage the fetus during pregnancy is 1 in 1428, but if the woman does not observe personal hygiene the risk is 1 in 500.</p>
<p>The car accident scenario read as follows:</p>
<p>For comparison purposes consider that the risk of having a car accident between 6:00 and 8:00 AM is 1 in 1428, but the risk between 5:00 and 7:00 PM is 1 in 500.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In both scenarios we presented participants with 2 comparison points: 1 in 500 and 1 in 1428. They were chosen because they were in between the objective risk levels that participants were asked to evaluate and because they represented true values and would provide participants with information as close to reality as possible, suitable for real clinical settings.</p>
<p>The dependent variable was the perceived risk, and it was assessed by asking participants to fill in the following sentence: “In your opinion, the risk that Emma’s child has a chromosomal anomaly is ____” (choosing 1 of 7 labels ranging from “extremely low” to” extremely high”) (Note 2).</p>

<sec id="section4-0272989X12464433">
<title>Analytic Strategy</title>
<p>To examine perceived risk across different risk levels, the effect of comparison scenarios on perceived risk, and whether different comparison scenarios affected perceived risk differently across risk levels, we first ran a 3 (risk levels) × 3 (no scenario, car scenario, infection scenario) factor analysis of variance (ANOVA). Although this strategy can be accurate and useful for capitalizing on the increased power provided by the factorial design, it is not necessarily the clearest way to show how comparison scenarios might influence women’s capacity to discriminate between risk levels. We therefore conducted a second analysis to assess the effect of each comparison scenario separately on the participants’ discrimination of the 3 different risk levels. We ran 3 separate 1-way ANOVAs on perceived risk (1 for each scenario condition), and we quantified the effect size of the differences among risk levels, descriptively comparing the condition with and without comparison scenarios in order to obtain a measure of the helpfulness of the investigated technique.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0272989X12464433">Figure 1</xref> displays the mean values of the perceived risk as a function of the 3 risk levels and the 3 scenario conditions of Experiment 1. Visual inspection of the graphic representation suggests that across the 3 scenario conditions, participants’ risk assessments decreased coherently with the decrease of the objective risk level. A 3 (risk levels: 1 in 110, 1 in 770, 1 in 5390) × 3 (scenario: no scenario, infection scenario, car accident scenario) ANOVA conducted on perceived risk confirmed a main effect of objective risk, <italic>F</italic>(2,270) = 80.9; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; no significant main effect of scenario, <italic>F</italic>(2,270) = 0.9, <italic>P</italic> = 0.4; and no significant interaction effect between the 2 factors, <italic>F</italic>(4,270) = 1.2, <italic>P</italic> = 0.3. Across the 3 scenario conditions, participants’ risk assessments decreased coherently with the decrease of the objective risk level: Participants assessed Emma’s risk of having a child affected by Down syndrome as lower in the 1 in 5390 conditions (<italic>x</italic> = 2.07) than in the 1 in 770 conditions (<italic>x</italic> = 3.67), and the latter lower than in the 1 in 110 conditions (<italic>x</italic> = 4.18). Across the 3 different risk levels, participants did not perceive Emma’s risk differently in the 3 scenario conditions (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05), suggesting that the use of comparison scenarios does not significantly increase or decrease the perception of risk. The absence of a significant interaction between the 2 factors suggests, however, that different comparison scenarios do not affect perceived risk differently across risk levels.</p>

<p>Participants in the no-scenario condition showed a significant effect of risk level on perceived risk, <italic>F</italic>(2,102) = 25.76, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001. Post hoc comparisons (Student-Newman-Keuls) in the no-scenario condition confirmed that participants significantly discriminated between the low and the medium/high risk levels, but they did not discriminate between the medium and the high risk levels. Participants in the infection and in the car accident scenario conditions also showed a significant effect of risk level on perceived risk, respectively, <italic>F</italic>(2,86) = 24.20, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 and <italic>F</italic>(2,82) = 36.01, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001. Whereas participants in the car accident scenario condition showed the same discrimination pattern as participants in the no-scenario condition (i.e., discrimination between the low and the medium/high risk levels and lack of discrimination between the medium and the high risk levels), participants in the infection scenario condition showed significant discrimination for all 3 different risk levels.</p>
<p>As suggested by the graphic representation and by Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc comparisons for statistical significance, whereas participants showed a significant capacity to distinguish between low and medium risk levels independent of the presence or absence of a comparison scenario, participants’ discrimination between the high and the medium risk levels (i.e., 1 in 110 v. 1 in 770) represents a critical point because, according to Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc significance, participants did not distinguish between high and medium risk levels when the risk of chromosomal anomaly was presented on its own. This lack of discrimination in the no-scenario condition was also confirmed by an effect size of <italic>d</italic> = −0.06, but it disappeared when the risk was proposed along with the infection scenario: When the target risk was accompanied by the infection scenario, the effect size between the two means was <italic>d</italic> = 0.65, highlighting the beneficial effect of the communicative intervention. The effect of the car accident scenario turned out to be weaker: Whereas the difference between high and medium risk levels was only close to significance when the target risk was presented along with the car accident scenario, the effect size between the two means was <italic>d</italic> = 0.50. Generally, the larger the effect size, the greater the impact of an intervention, and usually an effect size greater than 0.50 is considered large.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0272989X12464433">20</xref></sup> Moreover, a meta-analysis on the effectiveness of one-to-one risk communication intervention in health care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0272989X12464433">21</xref></sup> indicated a mean effect size of risk communication interventions of 0.38. In this respect we could also consider the car scenario as a good communication technique.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of this first experiment showed that the use of comparison scenarios did not affect women’s perceived risk, neither increasing nor decreasing the perception of the threat, but it did affect women’s capacity to discriminate between risk levels. All in all, both post hoc comparisons and effect size results on perceived risk provided convergent data concerning the beneficial effect of the comparison scenario technique. The no-scenario condition, where the risk of chromosomal anomaly was presented on its own, allowed us to define women’s discrimination baseline among the 3 proposed risk levels, identifying a general lack of discrimination between high and medium risk (1 in 110 v. 1 in 770). The introduction of comparison scenarios enabled women to differentiate among high and medium risk levels, whereas such discrimination was not achieved without the comparison scenarios. Although the helpfulness of the infection scenario was supported both by the statistical significance of post hoc comparisons and by evidence concerning the effect size, the beneficial effect of the car accident scenario was supported by effect size only. We argue, however, that when the meaningfulness and relevance of applied research findings are evaluated, it would be limiting to consider the statistical significance only, which is frequently either inflated or understated by sample size. The use of other metrics, such as estimation of the effect sizes, is particularly recommended for discussion of the relevance and magnitude of a finding. In this respect, as can be seen in the data reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0272989X12464433">Table 1</xref>, the results obtained in Experiment 1 allow us to conclude that whereas participants’ capacity to discriminate among different risk levels was generally good, the use of a comparison scenario (either infection or car accident) allowed participants to perceive the difference between the high and the medium risk levels (i.e., between 1 in 110 and 1 in 770), a difference that was not perceived when the risk was presented on its own. Moreover, perceived difference between risk levels in the comparison scenario conditions showed systematically greater effect sizes than in the no-scenario condition, suggesting a general beneficial effect of the use of comparison scenarios independent of the risk level examined.</p>

<title>Experiment 2</title>
<p>Experiment 2 was intended to replicate the results obtained in Experiment 1 in a face-to-face context in order to avoid possible biases related to the online data collection as well as to introduce a new element: individual numeracy skill. Preliminary studies highlighted that individuals’ capacity to deal with numbers is strictly associated with how people perceive health risks. People with low numeracy skills commonly make mistakes in very simple questions, distort perceptions of risks, and derive differential benefits from communicative formats and interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272989X12464433">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272989X12464433">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0272989X12464433">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0272989X12464433"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0272989X12464433"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0272989X12464433">25</xref></sup> The use of the comparison scenario technique implies that people must evaluate the 2 points provided in the comparison scenario in order to make sense of the risk of chromosomal anomaly, including it on a mental risk scale. Given that this is possible only through a direct numerical comparison between the target risk and the 2 points used as benchmarks, it is reasonable to assume that people who are good at dealing with numbers would benefit considerably from the comparison scenario technique, whereas people who struggle with basic probability concepts would gain no benefit from the comparison scenario technique or, worse, would be more confused by the additional numerical information provided. This second experiment was therefore intended to explore the differential effect of the comparison scenario technique when controlling for people’s numeracy skills.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>A striking result is that those who gained greater benefit from the comparison scenario technique were the high-numerate participants. In the high-numerate group, participants in all 3 scenario conditions (i.e., no-scenario, infection scenario, and car accident scenario conditions) showed a significant effect of risk level on perceived risk, respectively, <italic>F</italic>(2,49) = 4.87, <italic>P</italic> = 0.012, <italic>F</italic>(2,56) = 16.21, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, and <italic>F</italic>(2,48) = 15.95, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001. Post hoc comparisons and effect sizes showed that exactly as in Experiment 1, when no comparison scenarios were presented, high-numerate participants did not discriminate between the high and the medium risk levels. This lack of discrimination disappeared when a comparison scenario was provided independent of the type of scenario used: The Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc comparisons showed a significant difference (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) between each risk level, and the effect sizes in the infection and in the car accident scenario (respectively, <italic>d</italic> = 0.67 and <italic>d</italic> = 1.07) were higher than in the no-scenario condition (<italic>d</italic> = 0.25). Moreover, as can be observed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0272989X12464433">Table 3</xref>, all effect sizes were generally higher in the comparison scenario conditions than in the no-scenario condition.</p>
<p>In contrast, the effect of the comparison scenario technique emerged as somewhat different for the low-numerate group. Low-numerate participants showed a significant effect of risk level on perceived risk in all 3 scenario conditions: that is, no-scenario, <italic>F</italic>(2,49) = 5.95, <italic>P</italic> = 0.005; infection scenario, <italic>F</italic>(2,49) = 4.02, <italic>P</italic> = 0.024; and car accident scenario conditions, <italic>F</italic>(2,44) = 3.71, <italic>P</italic> = 0.032). Post hoc comparisons showed that low-numerate participants in the no-scenario condition significantly discriminated between the high and the medium risk levels and between the high and the low risk level but not between the medium and the low risk levels. Even when these participants were given the infection scenario, they significantly discriminated only between low and high risk levels but not between low and medium and medium and high. Strikingly, when provided with the car accident scenario, less numerate patients did not discriminate among the 3 different risk levels at all. For them, the comparison scenario technique seemed to have no beneficial effects on the ability to discriminate among risk levels. This conclusion is supported by effect size results: Despite a general discrimination capacity (as can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0272989X12464433">Table 3</xref>, the effect sizes of the differences between high and medium risk level, as well as those between high and low risk level, are generally large independent of the scenario conditions), in the low-numerate group all effect sizes were decreased by the presentation of the comparison scenarios, culminating in a complete lack of discrimination between the 2 risk levels 1 in 770 and 1 in 5390, suggesting an absence of beneficial effects of the comparison scenario technique in participants with low numeracy skills.</p>

<title>General Conclusion</title>
<p>In 2 experiments we examined whether providing patients with a comparison scenario helps them to discriminate between medical risk levels presented in a 1-in-<italic>X</italic> format. Previous literature has shown that individuals are not very good at understanding numerical probabilities but that the use of comparative information can help.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272989X12464433">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272989X12464433">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0272989X12464433">21</xref></sup> The usefulness of the comparison scenario technique is ascribable to the fact that the comparative information provides individuals with an evaluative parameter for the target risk that helps them to translate it in a meaningful concept of “high” or “low.”</p>
<p>In our experiments, we tested whether this technique would be useful in improving women’s understanding of the prenatal risk of chromosomal anomalies and the interaction between the technique and individual differences in the degree of numeracy skills. Overall, the obtained results showed that the use of comparison scenarios did not systematically affect risk perception (neither increasing nor decreasing it significantly) but did affect women’s capacity to distinguish between risk levels, introducing a significant difference in perceived risk where this was not previously present. Also, our data showed that the 2 investigated scenarios (i.e., infection and car accident scenario) have comparable beneficial effects. Nevertheless, Experiment 2 showed that although the comparison scenario technique was beneficial for women with high numeracy skills, it had no effect on women with low numeracy skills. These results are consistent with the idea that the comparison scenario technique implies the evaluation of 2 comparison points provided in the comparative information for use as benchmarks and that this evaluation can result in further difficulty for patients who have trouble dealing with numbers (see also Keller and Siegrist<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0272989X12464433">22</xref></sup>). The results obtained in Experiment 1 and those obtained with highly numerate patients in Experiment 2 are strongly comparable, suggesting that the online sample involved in Experiment 1 is partially biased and potentially composed of women with a high ability to deal with numbers.</p>
<p>Consistent with Zikmund-Fisher’s argument for retiring the 1-in-<italic>X</italic> format,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12464433">8</xref></sup> the present research suggests that the use of such formats is open to misinterpretation and should only be adopted if accompanied by appropriate patient-tailored aids. Future research should concentrate on the creation of specific aids that help patients “picture” the meaning of medical risk values, mainly low-numerate patients, who cannot benefit from communicative techniques such as the one explored in the present research. In the risk communication domain, the value of visual aids (e.g., graphic representations) in helping low-numerate people visualize uncertainty is generally recognized,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0272989X12464433">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0272989X12464433"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0272989X12464433">25</xref></sup> and many authors have claimed that specific pictorial representations can facilitate numerical risk understanding (e.g., References <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0272989X12464433">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0272989X12464433"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0272989X12464433">28</xref>). Unfortunately, as mentioned earlier, the use of graphic representations cannot be embedded in certain routine clinical communications that are often conducted under time pressure and in hospital wards. As a consequence, future research should investigate the effectiveness of alternative verbal interventions, such as verbal analogies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0272989X12464433">29</xref></sup> or the use of minimally descriptive comments,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0272989X12464433">30</xref></sup> to overcome low-numerate patients’ number numbness.</p>
<p>The main limitation of the present research is the difficulty of generalizing the obtained results to different contexts and different risk levels. Although we do not see any specific reason why the use of the comparison scenario technique should be affected by the type of risk communication, we recognize that the 2 comparison scenarios provided participants with anchor points that were in between the different risk levels that they had to evaluate. As a consequence, we cannot exclude the possibility that the results obtained in the present research were attributable to a purely numerical anchoring effect and strictly related to the chosen values. Further research should be devoted to answering this question.</p>

<p>The term <italic>semantically related</italic> is used here in its standard meaning, that is, to describe the fact that the comparison and the target risks belong to the same category because they share a high number of features,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272989X12464433">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272989X12464433">17</xref></sup> They are both examples of the category “pregnancy disorders.”</p>

<p>Two additional dependent variables were measured: worry and behavioral intention to carry out amniocentesis. Worry was measured by asking participants the following: “If you were Emma, to what extent would you be worried? (1 = not at all; 7 = extremely)” Behavioral intention was measured by asking participants to decide whether they would carry out amniocentesis (assuming the risk of miscarriage was 1 in 150). Possible answers were “yes” or “no.” Unfortunately, the order of the dependent variables was not randomly manipulated, and these 2 dependent variables (worry and behavioral intentions) always followed the perceived risk question, partially invalidating their possible interpretation. Worry responses turned out to be strictly dependent on and highly correlated with perceived risk responses (<italic>r</italic> = 0.75, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and affected by the use of comparison scenarios in the same way. Women’s behavioral intentions to carry out amniocentesis were substantially unaffected by the use of comparison scenarios. This last result is not surprising at all considering that amniocentesis uptake depends mainly on socioeconomic factors and on individuals’ attitude toward prenatal diagnosis and abortion rather than actual risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272989X12464433">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0272989X12464433">19</xref></sup></p>
