<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The automobile industry requires eco-friendly strategies to reduce carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions because of environmental regulations such as the 2005 Kyoto Protocol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407011430183">1</xref></sup> For this reason, engineering plastics have become very popular because they have been considered a good substitute for conventional heavy stainless steel. Thus, ‘green car’ research is being pursued in many countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954407011430183">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954407011430183"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954407011430183">4</xref></sup> In this study, as part of green car research, a car audio chassis that originally was made of stainless steel was produced using a polycarbonate–(acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene) (PC–ABS) composite to reduce the weight of the car audio and to improve the fuel efficiency.</p>
<p>The PC–ABS composite in this research was obtained by mixing PC–ABS with nickel-coated carbon fibre (NCF). PC–ABS is generally known to have good mouldability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954407011430183">5</xref></sup> and balanced mechanical strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954407011430183">6</xref></sup> Therefore, in 2009, General Motors and Delphi (USA) developed an engineering plastics car audio chassis made of PC–ABS with 16 wt% glass fibre (GF).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954407011430183">7</xref></sup> The plastic chassis satisfied the required electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding effectiveness (SE) because it enclosed the car audio with a mesh Faraday cage. However, their technique requires a complicated insert moulding process as well as a mesh Faraday cage for shielding. The present authors developed a PC–ABS-based composite with metal fibre (MF) and GF to make a new resin for the simple injection moulding of a car audio chassis, and it was confirmed that most of the required physical and electrical properties were satisfied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954407011430183">8</xref></sup> However, the car audio chassis made of this material did not show a stable EMI SE and mechanical strength once it was injection moulded because the material could not be pelletized uniformly owing to the low filler content and unexpected permanent deformation of the MFs, which led to an uneven distribution of the fillers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954407011430183">9</xref></sup> Therefore, instead of MF and GF, carbon fibre (CF) was added to the PC–ABS. Generally, CF has been used in many ways as carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) owing to the high strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios, high damping and good corrosion resistance properties. Thus, CFRP has been thought to be an alternative to stainless steel and other materials. Also, it has been applied in many industrial fields such as aerospace engineering.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954407011430183">10</xref></sup> In this study, NCF was considered to improve the EMI SE since the EMI SE is highly regulated in electronic devices because of electromagnetic wave disturbance and human health problems.</p>
<p>In this paper, a PC–ABS-based composite with NCF was developed, and the application of the composite to a lightweight car audio chassis was studied. The mechanical and electrical properties of the composite were evaluated through various physical tests, i.e. tensile, impact, flexural, rheology and EMI SE tests. In addition, the characteristics of this material were compared with those of a material previously developed by the present authors, i.e. PC–ABS with MF and GF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954407011430183">8</xref></sup> Finally, actual car audio mould chassis were made by injection moulding under various moulding conditions pertaining to the injection speed and the tool temperature to find the optimum injection-moulding conditions. Two required key tests, i.e. a full-scale EMI SE test and vibration analysis, were conducted to confirm the applicability of the PC–ABS–NCF composite as a material for car audio chassis.</p>

<title>Composite materials</title>
<p>Engineering plastic as a material for car audio chassis requires the following conditions: first, superior mechanical properties against external vibration and impact; second, a good EMI SE; third, lightness of weight. In a previous study, two functional fillers, i.e. MF and GF, were selected to meet these requirements. MF was expected to control the mechanical properties and the EMI SE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954407011430183">11</xref></sup> Also, GF was good for enhancing the mechanical strength without increasing the specific gravity too much<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954407011430183">12</xref></sup> and costs less than any other materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954407011430183">13</xref></sup> However, a car audio made of PC–ABS with MF and GF did not satisfy the vibrational stiffness and EMI SE requirements constantly once it was injection moulded. Because the composite material could not be pelletized uniformly owing to a low filler content and unexpected permanent deformation of the MFs, functional fillers were not dispersed well in PC–ABS. Therefore, stable mechanical strength and EMI SE were not guaranteed.</p>
<p>Therefore, in this paper, CF was selected because it can be pelletized with PC–ABS unlike the previous composite material. In other words, CF was expected to show a relatively more even distribution than MF and GF once the car audio chassis was injection moulded, and PC–ABS with CF was assumed to display better mechanical and electrical characteristics. Also, instead of using conventional CF, NCF was considered to further improve the EMI SE. Tzeng and Chang<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954407011430183">14</xref></sup> reported that PC–ABS with NCF has a better EMI SE than PC–ABS with normal CF, and they also reported that the EMI SE of PC–ABS–NCF varied depending on the ABS content. The EMI SE regulatory limit for a car audio is 40 dB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954407011430183">15</xref></sup> Thus, the material of a car audio chassis should have an EMI SE of more than 40 dB.</p>
<p>In this study, two types of composite material were prepared with NCF contents of 10 wt% and 12 wt%, because a small amount of fillers did not yield a higher EMI SE; the EMI SE of PC–ABS with 3 wt% MF was not higher than 40 dB. PC–ABS–10 wt% NCF and PC–ABS–12 wt% NCF are denoted materials A and B respectively. For reference purposes, the basic properties of PC–ABS are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954407011430183">Table 1</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954407011430183">8</xref></sup></p>

<title>Test methods</title>
<p>First of all, basic mechanical tests, i.e. tensile, impact and flexural tests, were conducted. With these test results, the improvements in the mechanical properties of the PC–ABS–NCF composite were evaluated through a comparison with those of the conventional PC–ABS–MF–GF composite. Also, an EMI SE test was conducted to check whether the material could be applied to a car audio chassis by verifying the EMI SE regulation limit that should be higher than 40 dB. In general, the EMI SE is a measure of the material’s ability to attenuate the intensity of EMI waves. The higher the SE value, the better is the attenuation. The EMI SE is expressed in decibels (dB). For electromagnetic radiation of a specific power, the EMI SE is the logarithm of the ratio of the incident power <italic>P</italic><sub>1</sub> to the transmitted power <italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub>, i.e. SE = 10 log(<italic>P</italic><sub>1</sub>/<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub>). The incident power is equal to the transmitted power when there is no shielding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954407011430183">16</xref></sup> Also, in the rheology tests, the glass transition temperature <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> was observed through data from phase difference versus temperature curves and from stored modulus versus temperature curves.</p>
<p>In addition, the car audio chassis was made of the PC–ABS–NCF composite by injection moulding under various conditions relating to the injection temperature, the tool temperature and the injection speed. An analysis of the dispersion of NCF fillers, vibration analysis and the EMI SE test were executed to confirm the PC–ABS–NCF composite as the prospective material for car audio chassis. Injection moulding was performed under four various settings: the reference setting, an increase in the injection speed, an increase in the tool temperature and an increase in the injection temperature. This was to find an optimum injection-moulding condition. A hydraulic catapult was used in this study based on previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954407011430183">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954407011430183">17</xref></sup> Previous studies arrived at the conclusion that the hydraulic catapult generated a better filler distribution than a high-speed catapult.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954407011430183">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954407011430183">17</xref></sup> After the injection moulding, the dispersion of the fillers of the car audio mould chassis was studied. Fifteen specimens from the upper parts of the mould chassis were taken from three regions, namely left, centre and right. Then, nine scanning electron micrographs of each specimen were captured. Using these micrographs, the number of NCFs was counted. Finally, the dispersion of fillers was analysed statistically through matrix contour drawing.</p>
<p>Subsequent to injection moulding and an analysis of the dispersion of fillers, vibration analysis and base excitation tests were executed. Vibration analysis is based on the mode frequencies, and these values check the stability of a car audio (a commercial software package NASTRAN was used for this purpose). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954407011430183">Figure 1</xref> shows a schematic diagram of a car audio. External sweep frequencies of 0–100 Hz were applied to the bracket points; then, the mode frequencies of the decks were extracted (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954407011430183">Figure 1(b)</xref>). The deck is a very important part of a car audio because the CD–DVD player is mounted in the deck; therefore, the deck should be safe from external impact and shocks. The safe first-mode frequency should be higher than 100 Hz because all external frequencies are less than 100 Hz; otherwise, the acceleration in those ranges has to be lower than 5 <italic>g</italic> according to technical reports from LG Electronics and the recommendations of engineers in the relevant industry. As well as this, a base excitation test was conducted on the basis of<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954407011430183">18</xref></sup></p>

<title>Characterization of the PC–ABS–NCF composite material</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954407011430183">Figure 2</xref> shows the results obtained from the tensile tests. The results indicate that the tensile strength and Young’s modulus increase with increasing CF content. Young’s modulus was measured as 2.40 GPa and 2.84 GPa for material A and material B respectively, and the tensile strength was about 80 GPa for both materials. In comparison with the previous PC–ABS–MF–GF composite material (PC–ABS with 3 wt% MF and 7 wt% GF),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954407011430183">8</xref></sup> which had a tensile strength of 58 GPa and Young’s modulus of 1.66 GPa, it can be observed that the mechanical properties improved noticeably. Thus, from this finding, it is expected that the mechanical stiffness and vibrational stability of a car audio chassis made of PC–ABS–NCF composite material will increase in comparison with those of a car audio chassis made of the previous PC–ABS–MF–GF composite material.</p>

<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954407011430183">Table 2</xref>, other key physical and electrical properties of the PC–ABS–NCF composite material are summarized. Generally, the flexural modulus and strength, as well as the impact strength, increase with increasing CF content. In particular, the EMI SE of material B (12 wt% NCF) is satisfactorily above 40 dB for specimens that are at least 2 mm thick. However, material A (10 wt% NCF) does not satisfy the EMI SE regulation (the EMI SE should be higher than 40 dB). From these results, it can be observed that material B is an appropriate material that will be applied for injection-moulded car audio chassis. In addition, EMI SE increases for NCF; therefore, it can be shown that nickel is an effective material for increasing the EMI SE, as Tzeng and Chang<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954407011430183">14</xref></sup> observed.

The injection speed, the tool temperature and the injection temperature were selected as the variables for injection moulding to find the optimal conditions for injection moulding. Injection moulding was carried out for three temperature conditions, i.e. 265 °C, 280 °C and 300 °C. The mould chassis produced at injection temperatures of 280 °C and 300 °C both had a higher average and a higher standard deviation of fillers compared with that produced at 265 °C. In addition to the injection temperature, two other variables, namely the injection speed and the tool temperature, were considered. The selection of the optimum condition should be decided by the dispersion of fillers given that an even distribution of fillers ensures high strength and stable properties.</p>

In the core areas, NCF is generally mixed well with PC–ABS without any specific orientation in the central regions. However, in the surface regions, the fibres were oriented along the PC–ABS material. This is mainly because of the skin-core effect, which produces a morphological difference between the central and surface regions. The fillers in the surface regions were aligned more parallel to the surface than those in the central regions because of the high shear stress during the injection-moulding process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954407011430183">20</xref></sup></p>

<p>To determine a suitable injection-moulding condition, the dispersion of fillers was analysed. An even distribution of fillers is very important because the mechanical strength and the EMI SE are dependent on it. This analysis was conducted by counting the number of fibres of specimens at the top surface of the mould chassis. Then, the average and the standard deviation of the right, centre and left sides of the top surfaces were calculated. Finally, through an overall comparison of the average and the standard deviation of the number of fibres at each injection-moulding condition, the appropriate injection-moulding conditions were evaluated. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954407011430183">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954407011430183">8</xref> show the distribution of fillers in each case through matrix contour drawings. As shown in these figures, an increase in the injection speed (cases A2 and B2) and an increase in the tool temperature (cases A3 and B3) are needed to improve the filler distribution because the density of fillers is higher than in any other condition.</p>

<p>All eight cases of mould chassis that were produced under different injection-moulding conditions were measured for their EMI SEs; further, the reference steel chassis and the normal PC–ABS chassis were measured to yield a comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954407011430183">Figure 11</xref>). In the case of steel chassis, most signals do not exceed the EMI SE limit (red lines) except for some ranges because stainless steel blocks or absorbs electromagnetic signals. However, the result for the normal PC–ABS chassis is concerning since most signals surpass the limit because there are no other conductive materials or fillers. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954407011430183">Figure 12</xref> displays the representative EMI SE test results for mould chassis A3 and B3 among the eight cases. These chassis show the most stable results; most signals are under the EMI SE limit, and their signal magnitudes are lower than for other mould chassis. This supports the theory that nickel is the appropriate conductive coating material on CF and can increase the EMI SE. From these results, chassis B3 (12 wt% NCF with increasing tool temperature) will be selected for the base excitation test because both material B and its mould chassis satisfy the EMI limit and regulation.</p>

<title>Vibration analysis and the base excitation test</title>
<p>Vibration analysis has been considered to be important to check the applicability of a car audio because the performance of the car audio is determined by whether the CD–DVD player operates smoothly. An automobile CD–DVD deck, where the CD player, MP3 player and/or radio are fitted, should be run in a harsh environment because cars are driven sometimes on rugged roads and under bad-weather conditions. In other words, when products are designed, it is essential in a car audio design that the CD–DVD deck runs smoothly in a harsh vibrational environment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954407011430183">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954407011430183">22</xref></sup> Therefore, the first-mode frequency should be as high as possible to avoid resonance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954407011430183">23</xref></sup> during the operation of the car audio. If resonance occurs, the inner and outer components of the car audio may become damaged because of unacceptable levels of vibration, which will cause discontinuous dynamic behaviour.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954407011430183">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>In terms of the vibration standard, the first-mode frequency should be higher than 100 Hz, and the acceleration should be lower than 5 <italic>g</italic>, as mentioned before. The current chassis model made of stainless steel has a first-mode frequency of 147 Hz with 32.5 <italic>g</italic>; hence, this model satisfies the vibration standard. However, the previous mould chassis achieved a first-mode frequency of 87 Hz with 9.5 <italic>g</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954407011430183">25</xref></sup> and this result did not meet the requirement. This is one of the main reasons why NCF was applied for a mould chassis instead of MF and GF. Young’s moduli, obtained from the stress–strain curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954407011430183">Figure 2</xref>), were about 2.32 GPa (material A) and 2.77 GPa (material B) respectively. Given that Young’s modulus of the previous PC–ABS–MF–GF was 1.66 GPa, the improved vibration results could be predicted partially by the improvement in the modulus. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0954407011430183">Figure 13</xref> shows the results for car audio mould chassis with material B; the first-mode frequency was found to be at 72 Hz with 4.50 <italic>g</italic>, which is quite satisfactory compared with the results for the previous PC–ABS–MF–GF composite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954407011430183">9</xref></sup> While the highest acceleration within 100 Hz is 5.66 <italic>g</italic> at 94 Hz, when this result is compared with results from the previous study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954407011430183">9</xref></sup> the vibration response appears to be more stable because the acceleration is significantly lower even though the first-mode frequency is slightly lower than 100 Hz. Therefore, it is concluded that PC–ABS–NCF could be a reasonable substitute for stainless steel.</p>

For the PC–ABS–NCF mould chassis, the first-mode frequency occurs at 92 Hz at approximately 6 <italic>g</italic> for chassis A3, whereas all measurements for chassis B4 are well below the required 5 <italic>g</italic> limit in the range 10–100 Hz. These outcomes prove the findings from vibrational analysis that the addition of NCF has made the mould chassis more rigid, enabling it to withstand vibration in a much more efficient manner than the PC–ABS–MF mould chassis where the peak is at 16 <italic>g</italic> at 95 Hz.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954407011430183">9</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this study, PC–ABS-based composite materials with NCF were developed and pelletized to realize improved dispersion of fillers in the mould chassis. The application of this new material in a car audio chassis was analysed through tests on mechanical properties and morphology, EMI testing and vibration analysis. NCF was used to balance both the mechanical and the electrical properties of the composites. The role of this filler was specifically investigated and compared with the results from previous studies, namely a mould chassis using a PC–ABS composite with 3 wt% MF and 7 wt% GF. The following conclusions are drawn from this study.</p>
<list id="list1-0954407011430183" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>The tensile strength and the impact strength of the test materials are far superior to those in the previous study. Also, 12 wt% NCF is a more appropriate proportion than 10 wt% NCF because the EMI SE of PC–ABS–12 wt% NCF is higher than 40 dB, which is the EMI SE regulation for car audio.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Although the EMI results of this study are not perfectly conclusive as appropriate hardware needs to be developed for the use of moulded chassis, the EMI SE results were very stable under both the sample specimen measurements and the actual car audio chassis measurements owing to the improved dispersion of fillers by the pelletization of the PC–ABS–NCF composite.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Vibration measurements (both computer-aided engineering and actual results) show that the requirement of less than 5 <italic>g</italic> in the 10–100 Hz frequency range is met; hence, the design is appropriate in a general vehicle driving environment.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Considering all the results, the new mould chassis using PC–ABS–NCF has improved mechanical and electrical properties. In other words, the application of this new model in car audio is possible, and only the cost aspect has to be overcome.</p>
