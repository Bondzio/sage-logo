<abstract>
<p>In the latter half of 2008 a still-unidentified hoaxer created a fictional soccer player named Masal Bugduv. Initially the subject of blog forum posts made by the hoaxer, Bugduv climbed the feeding chain of European football media by going from an insertion in a Wikipedia page, to comments in forums, to blog posts, and then – after making the leap to more mainstream media – to a football magazine and finally to the ‘Football’s Top 50 Rising Stars’ list of 2009 in <italic>The Times</italic> (London). This article analyzes the Bugduv hoax as a case study of sources of journalistic authority in blogs. A brief history of the hoax is presented followed by a rhetorical analysis of reasons why the hoax was successful. Although Bugduv eventually jumped journalistic platforms from internet to print, the communications that the hoaxer initiated with the audience were entirely on blogs. By considering the textual dynamics successfully used by the hoaxer in claiming sufficient journalistic authority to sustain the hoax, the sources of journalistic authority in blogs are examined and contrasted with those of traditional media.</p>

<body>
<p>Masal Bugduv, 16-year-old Moldovan soccer star had his dreams fulfilled when <italic>The Times</italic> of London ranked him number 30 among ‘Football’s Top 50 Rising Stars’ and reported that he would likely be signed by the British football club Arsenal. The only difficulty was that Bugduv was not a real person. Now Bugduv was no outrageous Hayden ‘Sidd’ Finch, George Plimpton’s 1985 April Fool’s phantom created for <italic>Sports Illustrated</italic>, who sported a 168 mph fastball. Rather, Bugduv was presented as a legitimate player, resulting in news reports about him that snowballed over time and generated their own momentum. With a bit of help from his creator, Bugduv became the subject of football fan discourse for the next six months, eventually taking his position on the <italic>Times</italic> Top 50 list.</p>
<p>Based on these observations, the Bugduv episode qualifies as a classic media hoax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1461444811420270">Fedler, 1989</xref>). Although a somewhat loose category of rhetorical events, hoaxes are defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461444811420270">Boese (2002)</xref> as intentionally deceptive acts that draw the attention of some public audience. For Boese, the public aspect of the audience is critical; hoaxes don’t occur in private. A hoax typically makes some claim that becomes embodied in a textual representation. The text may take a variety of forms from pictures of seemingly impossible situations (e.g. tall-tale postcards), to literary fabrications (e.g. Clifford Irving’s ‘autobiography’ of Howard Hughes), to journalistic descriptions of events that either don’t exist (the aforementioned Hayden Finch) or have been manipulated or interpreted to appear fantastic or highly unusual (e.g. sightings of extraterrestrials). The textual representation is then shared through some communication channel. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1461444811420270">Secor and Walsh (2004)</xref> point out, hoaxes have a temporal order. After the text is made public, there is some audience reaction; if the hoax is successful, the text will be taken seriously. Then, typically, some doubt will creep in. Or, the hoax may simply become non-salient in the public consciousness. Often, hoaxers will themselves announce their ruse and claim the positive or negative recognition attached to their actions. Alternatively, and with increasing frequency in the age of the internet, the hoax may be revealed by another party.</p>
<p>In order for a hoax to be successful, hoaxers, like all journalists, must be convincing to their audiences. They must present themselves as sufficiently credible to garner a measure of journalistic authority. What makes a hoax credible? Since hoaxes are ultimately works of fiction, factors other than the simple content of a hoax narrative must be involved in claiming credibility. The hoaxer in this case relied on a series of rhetorical and journalistic conventions in order to maintain a position of plausibility and sustain Bugduv as a person. Through the use of these conventions, the hoaxer was able to amass sufficient journalistic authority so that the acceptance of the hoax was nearly inevitable. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1461444811420270">Secor and Walsh (2004)</xref> we use Grice’s Maxims (1975) as organizing principles in understanding these conventions. The maxims are a set of shared expectations in conversation but they may be applied to all forms of cooperative communication. Thus, in a situation where a news story is being communicated, maxims that apply in a journalistic context will be relevant. As the Bugduv hoaxer engaged the maxims effectively, the conventions associated with them augmented his or her journalistic authority to the point that the reporting was seen as true and sufficiently accurate to sustain the hoax.</p>
<p>However, as journalistic authority has been reformulated in online spaces (often manifested in tensions between bloggers and journalists) the ‘natural history’ of journalistic conventions has become open to debate. In particular, gaps in identity information inherent in the internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1461444811420270">Lessig, 2006</xref>: 57) create an environment of uncertainty that requires an elaboration of traditional journalistic conventions. It was chiefly in the gaps between traditional and new media journalistic conventions that the Bugduv hoax gained sufficient authority to be convincing. Although Bugduv eventually jumped journalistic platforms from internet to print, the communications that the hoaxer initiated with the audience were entirely on blogs. The Bugduv hoax is thus a unique lens through which the reformulation of journalistic authority in blogs can be viewed and evaluated.</p>
<sec id="section1-1461444811420270">
<title>The recruitment of journalistic authority</title>
<p>Understanding the ways journalistic authority has traditionally been established and ways the internet has expanded possibilities for establishing authority is critical in explaining why the Bugduv hoaxer was successful. Audience perceptions of the credibility of blogs have been evaluated by a number of investigators using survey methodology. These findings show that blogs are generally seen as credible overall by their readers (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1461444811420270">Johnson et al., 2008</xref>) and are seen as more credible than traditional media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1461444811420270">Johnson and Kaye, 2004</xref>). Further, as audience members increase their reading of blogs, they perceive them as more credible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461444811420270">Banning and Sweetser, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1461444811420270">Sweetser et al., 2008</xref>). This audience-journalist relationship is usefully conceptualized through a consideration of the epistemology of journalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1461444811420270">Matheson, 2004</xref>); the knowledge claims of journalists are communicated to audiences through a series of journalistic conventions that socially construct ‘News’. Such stylistic conventions allow journalists and the institutions they represent to make claims to symbolic power so that the audience is assured that ‘truth is being told’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1461444811420270">Bourdieu (1991)</xref> pointed to the power of ‘authorized language’ in assuring the legitimacy of a wide variety of social endeavors and his framework certainly applies to authority in the media.</p>
<p>An initial group of techniques based on the associations that journalists maintain with already existing sources of credibility apply to both traditional and new media. First, position power engendered by associations with news organizations or past reporting assignments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1461444811420270">Zelizer, 1992</xref>) lends credence to journalists’ reports even before any writing has been done. In this same vein, journalists who have received awards for past work bring a stamp of standing to their work (the Pulitzer Prize-winning author … ). Second, journalists (and many other speakers) use quotations to support their work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1461444811420270">Schudson, 1995</xref>) and thus recruit the credibility of others in making their own truth claims. The more authoritative the source, the greater the authority of the journalist will be.</p>
<p>Third, authors are empowered with credibility through competent manipulation of textual dynamics associated with particular genres of reporting. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1461444811420270">Secor and Walsh (2004)</xref> have analyzed an academic hoax perpetrated by Alan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1461444811420270">Sokal (1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1461444811420270">1996b)</xref> to describe an additional associative source of journalistic credibility. These authors identified a series of characteristics of the academic writing genre associated with cultural studies that Sokal successfully mimicked in submitting an ‘article’ to the cultural studies journal <italic>Social Text.</italic> Secor and Walsh demonstrate how Sokal was able to claim authority for his hoax by writing in a genre that was associated with the area of cultural studies in general and of the journal in particular. Skillfully using the textual dynamics of an established genre associates a writer with particular established journalistic traditions. Performing this set of competencies is an additional way of claiming authority.</p>
<p>Finally there are several studies investigating journalistic authority on the internet that contrast sources of authority in new media and traditional media. As noted above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1461444811420270">Johnson and Kaye, 2004</xref>), blog users judge blogs to be significantly more credible than traditional sources of information. Specifically, in the Johnson and Kaye data, blogs were seen by their users as significantly more credible than broadcast television news, cable television news, newspapers, news magazines, radio news, and talk radio. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1461444811420270">Matheson (2004)</xref> noted that authority in blogs is constructed through being able to deliver a series of recommendations that filter the vast amount of material available on the internet. However, rather than specifying a single account of ‘what happened’ backed by citations of texts or quotations from individuals that confirm a particular line of ‘truth’, blogs rely on breadth of knowledge, putting a particular narrative line into context and discussion. Authority is derived through being able to make the requisite connections to assemble the multiple and inconsistent variations surrounding any given narrative. In contrast, other authors have observed that bloggers assert authority by pointing out differences between themselves and traditional journalists. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1461444811420270">Wall (2005)</xref> performed a genre analysis of the home pages of 30 blogs associated with the Iraq War while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1461444811420270">Park (2009)</xref> reviewed content from four popular political blogs. Both authors found that these blogs gained credibility by being seen as highly personal and opinionated and therefore trustworthy. Interestingly, this source of authority is exactly the inverse of traditional professionalized news presentations that value objective and dispassionate reporting in order to be seen as credible. In addition, both analyses found that audience–blogger relationships fostered trust on the part of audience members.</p>
<p>Following a methodological section that details the design of the case study, the remainder of the article is divided into three narrative sections. The first presents an account of the rise and fall of Masal Bugduv by considering the placement of the hoax narrative in a series of posts in the comment sections of various blogs. We trace how the comments were constructed and placed and then absorbed by the audience in ways that allowed the hoax to proceed convincingly. Second, we analyze how the hoaxer claimed power so that the Bugduv story was vested with sufficient journalistic authority to be convincing. Finally, using the Bugduv hoax as a rhetorical example, we draw conclusions about journalistic authority and the perception of credibility in the blogosphere.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1461444811420270" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Our intent was to develop a working account of the hoax by compiling a comprehensive record of the postings and comments relevant to Bugduv. The timeframe for the study was an approximately six-month period from July 19, 2008 when the first Bugduv reference was made through January 19, 2009 when, after Bugduv had been debunked, the hoaxer attempted two last postings attempting to salvage the story. Blog posts and comments during that period were collected. A Google search using <italic>Bugduv</italic> as the search term was performed. We initially reviewed each of the approximately 847 entries and identified blog postings within the study’s timeframe. We then searched each posting and by cross-referencing were able to assemble a chronological list of links associated with each post. Each post with attached comments was read and chronological notes of the hoaxer’s activities with responses were developed. In all, 36 posts were analyzed in depth from 19 different websites. Eight of the posts were duplicates, posted to different sites under the same or a different pseudonym. Of these, one of the posts was duplicated five times, three were duplicated three times, and the remaining four were duplicated twice. This resulted in 20 unique posts. The hoaxer overwhelmingly communicated on the BBC 606 football platform websites with 21 of the 35 posts being made to nine different team sites within the platform. The website posted to most frequently was the BBC 606 Arsenal team site with nine posts. Each of the BBC 606 posts was made under the pseudonym of Galwaygooner.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1461444811420270">1</xref></sup> The remaining 14 posts were made under a variety of names that were also presumably pseudonyms used by the hoaxer. The average number of comments generated from each of the 36 posts was 3.2 but this varied widely over postings with the number of comments ranging from 0 to 14.</p>
<p>From the chronological listing of posts we developed the narrative account below, designed to communicate the major activities of the hoaxer. A central part of our analysis is in terms of Grice’s Maxims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1461444811420270">Grice, 1975</xref>). A coding form was therefore developed and applied to each post to consider the degree to which each of Grice’s Maxims was adhered to by the hoaxer. These evaluations subsequently informed our analysis of journalistic conventions used to sustain journalistic authority. Ten of the posts included what were ostensibly copies of AP (Associated Press) news stories. Since these were all written by the hoaxer, no distinction in Grician analysis was made between outright posts and the faux newspaper stories except to note that framing the posts as previously published stories was in itself a violation of a maxim.</p>

<sec id="section3-1461444811420270">
<title>Positioning Massi rhetorically: The rise and fall of Masal Bugduv</title>
<p>The construction of Masal Bugduv began on July 19, 2008 when a line was added to the Wikipedia entry for the Moldovan National football team.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1461444811420270">2</xref></sup> The line simply said:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>The great hope of Moldovan football is the teenage sensation Masal Bugduv who has been watched by a host of top clubs around Europe. At just 16 years of age, he has already been named in the country’s provisional squad for the forthcoming World Cup campaign. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1461444811420270">Moldova National Football Team, 2008</xref>)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This relatively inconsequential (and mostly unnoticed) addition became a foundation for future descriptions of Bugduv and formed a basis for confidence in the Bugduv story. Two days later, a short posting on the BBC football discussion boards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1461444811420270">British Broadcasting Company, 2008a</xref>) for the Arsenal and Sunderland football clubs introduced Bugduv to the football world. The hoaxer started Bugduv at the top: both of these clubs are in the Premier League – England’s top football league. The posting stated that Masal (Massi) Bugduv, a 16-year-old football prodigy from Moldova, was being considered for signing by the Arsenal football club. Several comments on the posting expressed excitement but most were skeptical, asking for sources. Then a final comment from the hoaxer: ‘Mates of mine saw him playing in some game against Armenia while on hols (sic) in the Baltics in May. Say he has brilliant shot and shimmie and were shocked that he’s only 16. Set up a goal. Built a bit like Rooney but not as pug ugly.’</p>
<p>Throughout the hoax, the hoaxer’s ear for football talk made for convincing communications. The allusion to a player of Rooney’s caliber and authority is also of particular interest, tantalizing supporters with the prospects of finding an equalizer to Manchester United’s bulldog on the pitch. Despite some initial skepticism, the hoaxer proceeded and several days later posted another message on an Arsenal discussion board celebrating the strength of the next Arsenal squad and citing Bugduv as a possible signee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1461444811420270">British Broadcasting Company, 2008b</xref>). The posting yielded 14 comments ranging from ‘There is no such player as Masal Bugduv’ to discussions of his possible contributions. Following a pattern adhered to throughout the hoax, the hoaxer did not respond to these comments but simply continued to post positive messages about Bugduv. In fact, on the same day as the above post and comments, a similar post appeared on the blog <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1461444811420270">‘caughtoffside.com’ (2008)</xref> posted under a different pseudonym that again described Bugduv’s accomplishments and World Cup prospects. As described in the ‘Method’ section above, although the hoaxer only posted a limited number of messages, a number of these were duplicated on other blogs, thus amplifying their effects.</p>
<p>The Bugduv hoax began during the summer transfer window exchange period for football – a three-month window of time mandated by FIFA (the international federation that regulates football worldwide) – a time where there is wild speculation about possible transfers and signings in the British football press. There is so much activity that teams typically ignore what is written and do not bother to confirm or deny rumors. As a result, a series of rather fantastic alleged AP stories attributed to a Moldovan newspaper <italic>Mo Thon</italic> and posted as comments on various discussion boards went virtually unchallenged. Building on the comments introducing Bugduv posted in the previous month, a first mock AP story indicated that Bugduv would very shortly be signed by Arsenal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461444811420270">British Broadcasting Company, 2008c</xref>). Comments on this posting indicated growing excitement among fans but still significant skepticism. A second story, posted as a comment on the BBC blog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461444811420270">2008d</xref>) chronicled a rather convoluted plan to loan Bugduv to a team in Ireland (Cork City) and then, halfway through the British season, bring him to England to play for Reading in the Premier League. At this point, the hoax seemed to gain broader acceptance with the posting of yet another newspaper story, again purportedly from AP, reporting Bugduv’s agent’s negotiations with the Arsenal club and the result that he could be signed directly to Arsenal. This comment was posted on the blog <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1461444811420270">‘hammyend.com’ (2008)</xref>, a popular blog that covers the Fulham football club in the Premier League. Comments on this posting no longer questioned Bugduv’s existence but rather focused on whether the move was a good one for the Arsenal team. An additional posted newspaper story followed several days later in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1461444811420270">‘thesoccerblog.org’ (2008)</xref>, describing Bugduv’s problems in obtaining a work permit as a reason why his signing had not been completed. The same article also quoted Bugduv as referring to problems with his international clearance from soccer authorities: ‘Because I have played in several internationals at different levels this year, the club needs to clarify if I qualify for immediate clearance or whether I have to wait until January.’</p>
<p>As noted above, these initial postings were done mostly by one Galwaygooner. A Gooner is the nickname for fans of the Arsenal football club and Galway refers to the coastal city in Ireland. Later postings and duplicate ones on alternate sites were supposedly by different individuals but it is also very possible that the hoaxer simply used different pseudonyms. Collectively these postings wove a significant narrative supporting both the existence and quality of Bugduv and his soccer play. By then it was the end of August and the summer transfer window closed. Reviewing the narrative thus far, we have a presentation of Bugduv as a possible new young international player for the Arsenal football club followed by a description of his accomplishments. A wrinkle in the narrative introduced the possibility of Bugduv playing for an Irish team before entering the English Premier League. Finally, the narrative focused on Bugduv’s work permit and clearance problems as a rationale for him not being signed by any club, most notably Arsenal, by the end of the transfer window.</p>
<p>With the end of the transfer window, the hoaxer had somewhat less flexibility since the time of the most rabid speculation had passed. A post on the day after the window closed (again sourced from a Moldovan newspaper) claimed that Bugduv had been signed by the Manchester City team rather than another player (Dimitar Berbatov) with a vaguely similar name (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461444811420270">British Broadcasting Company, 2008e</xref>). Then, on September 4, 2008 the hoax received its first real confirmation in the form of a preview of World Cup Qualifiers that were scheduled to take place the first weekend in September. In their preview of the Latvia–Moldova game, the website <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461444811420270">‘goal.com’ (2008)</xref> pointed to Bugduv and the attention he was attracting. Galwaygooner posted again several days later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1461444811420270">British Broadcasting Company, 2008f</xref>) noting that Bugduv’s contract with his Moldovan team would run out in several days and that he would therefore be considered a free agent and eligible to sign with any team.</p>
<p>The hoaxer then shifted his emphasis from mere descriptions of Bugduv to direct quotations. A post of what ostensibly was an AP story quoted Bugduv as expecting to play for the Moldovan national team in their upcoming game against Luxembourg saying he would ‘rip the soul of the Luxembourg team’ and expressing his continuing interest in joining the Arsenal team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461444811420270">British Broadcasting Company, 2008g</xref>). On November 19, 2008 the Moldova National Team played Lithuania to a 1–1 tie. Moldova’s score was made by Igor Bugaiov – a name close enough for the Galwaygooner to post an AP format story several days later reporting that Massi Igor Bugduv had scored a sensational goal in front of watching scouts. This post also featured extensive quotes from Bugduv, complete with somewhat clumsy English but highly assertive rhetoric claiming that ‘I can save Arsenal’s season’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1461444811420270">British Broadcasting Company, 2008h</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1461444811420270">Phillips, 2009</xref>). Then through December there was a period of quiet until the end of the month when Tottenham Football Club coach Harry Redknapp was quoted in an exchange with the press as saying: ‘Where are you going to find a striker? Who is going to sell them? That is all I do all day. You can find someone from Moldova or wherever– but I’m not taking chances.’ Bugduv took exception to this statement and was quoted in another post as defending Moldovan football in general and his skills in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1461444811420270">British Broadcasting Company, 2008i</xref>).</p>
<p>Then the hoax paid off significantly. The respected soccer publication <italic>When Saturday Comes</italic> featured Bugduv in their ‘Euro View’ column reporting that Moldova’s best, Masal Bugduv, might be moving to the British Premier League (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1461444811420270">Gilbey, 2009</xref>). Then, on January 12, 2009 <italic>The Times</italic> (London) listed Bugduv as number 30 in a story about football’s top 50 rising stars: ‘Moldova’s finest, the 16-year-old attacker has been strongly linked with a move to Arsenal, work permit permitting. And he’s been linked with plenty of other top clubs as well’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1461444811420270">Dart, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Throughout the six months of Bugduv’s ‘existence’, approximately 22 percent of commentators questioned his legitimacy (25 of the 113 comments to the postings), asked for sources, and openly doubted the stories reported. The hoaxer’s strategy of simply ignoring detractors and proceeding with the next posting was generally successful. However, with the attention that <italic>The Times</italic> story generated, bloggers started looking at Bugduv with a more critical eye. One comment from a reader in the Russian Federation cued Neil McDonnell (writing as blogger Fredorrarci) to track the Bugduv story back down the blogosphere feeding chain to the history records of Wikipedia. There he found that Bugduv’s initial insertion into the Moldova National Team page had been made by none other than Masial Bugduv. He wrote an exposé on the blog, ‘<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://soccerlens.com">soccerlens.com</ext-link>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1461444811420270">Fredorrarci, 2009a</xref>), which was widely read, cited, and linked to. The hoaxer attempted one additional post on the BBC 606 web page, again as an AP story, headlined ‘Non-Existent Claims Were Made to Scupper my Dream Move says Elusive Moldovan Bugduv’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1461444811420270">British Broadcasting Company, 2009</xref>) but the hoax’s time had clearly expired and thousands were less interested in the actual hoax than in the prominent media outlets that had been taken in.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1461444811420270">
<title>Claiming credibility: Bugduv sustains himself</title>
<p>Grice’s Maxims are expectations that provide guidance in the interpretation of communication. In this section we seek to document how the hoaxer met many of these expectations, thereby supporting the hoax. Briefly, the four maxims are the expectations of quality (communicate what is true), quantity (communicate an appropriate amount and density of information for a given situation), relevance (communicate only information that is relevant to the topic at hand), and manner (communicate clearly and appropriately). Generally individuals receive communications with the expectation that the communicator is fulfilling the maxims. However, in everyday communication we encounter situations where the maxims intentionally may not be adhered to but where communication is still relatively clear. According to Grice, these are occasions when a maxim is <italic>flouted</italic> – although the conventional expectation is not adhered to, it is done in a public manner that individuals familiar with the communication context will understand. Statements may imply something beyond precisely what was stated, requiring the recipient of the communication to make an interpretation. Grice labeled such statements <italic>implicatures</italic>. Implicatures are a tool for suggesting additional meaning in a communication while not explicitly stating what is implied. For example, a statement such as ‘I really enjoyed the movie,’ delivered sarcastically, flouts the quality maxim (say what is true) and by implication means the opposite of what is actually stated. The sarcasm is delivered publicly and any individual with knowledge of the communication culture should understand the implications of the statement.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the maxim may also be <italic>violated</italic> – a communicator may deliver a statement that is privately untrue but that will be taken at face value. Considering again the movie example, an individual may say ‘I really enjoyed the movie’ delivered in earnest when they did not. The audience will understand precisely the opposite of the communicator’s hidden intention. Again, the maxim has not been adhered to but this time the violation is in a private way that negates the cooperation that implicatures require. Whether a maxim is being adhered to or broken publicly (flouting) may often be determined through a receiver’s sensitivity to the context of the communication (e.g. recognizing sarcasm). More difficult is determining if a maxim is being adhered to or if it is being violated privately. The hoaxer skillfully mixed the three rhetorical situations, constructing a liminal space where different individuals looking at different parts of the hoaxer’s narrative could find truth claims that they could support. The expectations held by individuals and the hoaxer’s skill in fulfilling at least some of those, provided the platform on which the deception was constructed and maintained.</p>
<p>The Bugduv hoax violated the quality maxim (tell the truth) in many ways. The original Wikipedia entry introduced a totally fictional person. He was presented as being named to the Moldovan national team provisional squad – a more difficult appointment to verify than for example a claim that he was being named to the actual team. Although provisional squads are standard in football, from the beginning the hoaxer framed Bugduv in a probabilistic lens, presenting his activities in obscure places that were difficult to verify and fact-check. The possibilities described in subsequent posts that Bugduv would join a number of English football teams, most notably Arsenal, were equally fictional. But, as noted above, so many rumors fly during the transfer window, most clubs and journalists do not bother to confirm or deny. So, Bugduv was given space to live and become more established. The initial narrative focused on the probabilities of different clubs signing him and his subsequent work permit problems. All these issues were likewise fabrications but ones that were reasonably difficult to discredit. As Bugduv became more established during the latter part of the hoax, he was quoted directly in what were represented as AP newspaper stories. Again, all these quotes were complete fabrications, clear violations of the quality maxim.</p>
<p>In pointing to work permit problems as a reason why Bugduv had not been signed, the hoaxer did make a mis-step – players from Moldova are free to play within the European Union. None of the commentators to the postings pointed out this issue so it would seem that this went largely undetected. The same news story citing work permit problems also pointed to clearance issues because Bugduv had supposedly played in several international matches at different levels. This latter excuse for not being signed was both reasonable and difficult to verify.</p>
<p>The hoaxer also built a number of cues into the fabrications, cues that eventually were deciphered as the hoax unwound. Building these cues into the hoax placed it in company with many other classic hoaxers who did the same (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1461444811420270">Fedler, 1989</xref>: xiii) and is an example of at least partially flouting the quality maxim. The first cue was the Masal Bugduv name itself. The name is a phonetic play on the title of a short story by Irish author Padraic O’ Conaire, <italic>M’Asal Beag Dubh</italic>. O’Conaire was from Galway, the presumed home of the Galwaygooner, the name associated with most of the Bugduv discussion board posts. Translated from Irish, <italic>M’Asal Beag Dubh</italic> means My Little Black Donkey, and is the story of a man who was convinced to pay a premium price for a donkey that turns out to be a very stubborn, substandard animal. The parallels to the representation, signing and often subsequent play of football players during the transfer window is unmistakable. Carrying on with the ass imagery, the first newspaper story ostensibly reporting on Bugduv’s high quality play was cited as being published in the Moldovan newspaper <italic>Mo Thon</italic>. In Irish, Mo Thon translates into ‘my arse’. And, of course, the team Bugduv was most associated with was Arsenal. As the hoax unraveled, bloggers deciphered these embedded cues, providing a literary basis for the hoax and supporting the bloggers, claims that a hoax had in fact taken place by stripping away the journalistic authority formerly attributed to the hoaxer.</p>
<p>The maxim of quantity was nearly perfectly adhered to by the hoaxer. In presenting the AP stories, the hoaxer took care to present an amount of information matching a prototypical news story. Research indicates that in general, stories with more details and that contain information that is typical of particular situations are seen as more plausible than those without (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1461444811420270">Shapiro and Chock, 2003</xref>). As a result, when the hoaxer created ‘facts’ that were salient to readers (for example, Massi telling the press that his father always wanted him to play for the Arsenal team) these particulars gave readers confidence that the account they were reading was accurate. Further, the level of detail in the stories was appropriate – they reflected what would be found in a typical AP story so that readers could more easily accept the stories as real.</p>
<p>An additional reason why the Bugduv hoax was so convincing was the hoaxer’s mastery of a sports writing format. After the hoax unraveled, in an anonymous interview with Fredorrarci, the hoaxer described his decade-long experience as a sports writer and noted that such writing is really just ‘a case of joining the clichés’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461444811420270">Fredorrarci, 2009b</xref>) so that the writing has a certain tone and readers simply accept what is given them. Such writing is very consistent with the relevance and manner maxims; labeling the story as an AP story invoked a series of expectations of writing style that were largely met and uncritically accepted. Accepting the stories meant accepting Bugduv. The postings masquerading as AP stories were given greater credence because of the hoaxer’s skill with several discursive strategies. First, the hoaxer often used rather obscure secondary attributions to substantiate claims for Bugduv. For example, the <italic>Mo Thon</italic> newspaper was cited as a source in several of the postings; although the newspaper was presumably an obscure paper in Moldova (so obscure it did not exist!), the hoaxer citation of what seemed to be a legitimate news outlet made the claims more credible. Second, the sham stories used phrasing and vocabulary that were highly familiar to soccer fans. Consider as an example the sentence:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Trailing 2–1 with just 10 minutes left, Moldova seemed set to lose until Bugduv lost his marker on the left wing, shimmied inside two defenders and fired in a shot that could only be parried by Armenian keeper Racif into the path of onrushing Igor Bugaev who equalized. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1461444811420270">‘hammyend.com’, 2008</xref>)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The hoaxer’s use of football-specific vocabulary such as <italic>marker, wing</italic>, <italic>shimmy</italic>, and <italic>equalized</italic> gives this story a level of typicality that in experiments has been shown to increase plausibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1461444811420270">Shapiro and Chock, 2003</xref>). Third, the semantics used in news writing are distinctive – typically straightforward assertions used to present unqualified truth claims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1461444811420270">Fowler, 1991</xref>). An assertively presented account that leaves little room for an alternate version of events claims authority both because it is assertive, but also because it is rhetorically identifiable as ‘news.’ The rhetoric of sports writing is prototypical news writing and the news is by definition authoritative. Over and over, in the Bugduv posts, the hoaxer wrote in ways that convincingly described a unitary version of Bugduv’s attitudes, plans, and actions. The writing was such that it was very difficult not to read it as ‘news’ with all the authority such a designation carries.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The Bugduv case study emphasizes the ongoing negotiation of authority and credibility in any presentation of news whether it is in a traditional or new media format. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1461444811420270">Secor and Walsh (2004)</xref> pointed out in their analysis of the Alan Sokal hoax perpetrated on the editors of the academic journal <italic>Social Text</italic>, a rhetorical understanding of a hoax’s effectiveness allows us to appreciate both the conventions of the genre being aped and the flouting and violation of broader conventions governing communication generally. In the Bugduv hoax, the hoaxer’s mastery of the sports writing genre was essential to the success of the hoax. Seeing through the hoaxer’s deceptions early on would have required explicit attention to the various texts the hoaxer organized. But that didn’t happen in any concerted way. Instead, although questions about Bugduv’s reality were posed by various commenters, the questions were isolated and therefore largely ignored, leaving the hoaxer to post again, strengthening the deception. As a result, the texts were allowed to gestate freely within the conventions of the blogging community until they were ultimately policed by other commenters and bloggers such as Fredoracci. The major success of the Bugduv hoax occurred when traditional media outlets, unaccustomed or unwilling to operate within the conventions of new media, ignored the initial questions of authority that had been posed in the blogosphere and ‘swallowed’ the deception that had been constructed.</p>
<p>Why were these early questions ignored? We all carry the preconceptions articulated by Grice’s Maxims – preconceptions that may blind us to potential chicanery. Ironically, the success of the Bugduv hoax turned on the hoaxer’s ability to marshal journalistic authority, chiefly by mimicking traditional journalistic forms. To this end, quotations, vocabulary, and syntax appropriate to the sports writing genre supported the hoaxer’s quest for legitimacy. The hoaxer linked the postings presented as news stories to the Associated Press. Stories were also the ‘correct’ length and the amount of detail present (neither too much nor too little) was carefully regulated. Because the format of the communication was ‘correct,’ the source was given elite status and the content was given credibility. Finally, the hoaxer’s recruitment of authority through mastery of the sports writing genre is especially impressive given that it was necessary for the hoaxer to give up a number of other associations typically used by journalists to claim authority. Specifically, the use of a credible name and any association with a news organization had to be dropped in the service of the hoaxer’s anonymity.</p>
<p>Rather than relying mainly on associative links to established news institutions, the hoaxer used the participatory journalism of web-based media and social networking. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1461444811420270">Wall (2005)</xref> has pointed out, a major difference between blogs and traditional news reporting is that blogs are not closed texts. Rather than being a prepackaged presentation with meaning already fully inscribed, blogs include opportunities for co-performance between blog authors and audience. As the producer and user become increasingly conjoined in a technosocial framework of collaboration described by Axel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1461444811420270">Bruns (2008)</xref> as <italic>produsage</italic>, the affordances of a network society constantly push for content improvement and construction. Audiences and communities can assume the roles of producers and users (produsers or prosumers), despite lacking the credentials and associations held by traditional journalists. Such participatory journalism has made the presentation of the ‘news’ an interactive process but in these production gaps there lies the susceptibility to hoaxing.</p>
<p>Nowhere is this more true than in sports reporting – the potent brew of statistics, stellar performances (e.g. ‘web gems’), and gossip. In the sports blog environment, audience members commonly present statistics, comment on and contextualize player performances, and share their knowledge of teams and players’ doings beyond the field of play. The sports blogosphere is enabled by technology and the social climate that surrounds sports of various types. This is part of the shift from consumer to auteur or ‘cyber athlete’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1461444811420270">Rowe, 2004</xref>). It was this environment that made Bugduv possible. Without the co-creation of content between blog authors and audience, Bugduv would never have had a hearing.</p>
<p>To what degree are Grice’s Maxims, created 35 years ago, serviceable in the blogosphere? Grice originally devised the maxims to operationalize what he termed the cooperative principle in conversation and theorized that the principle and the maxims were universally applicable. Critiques of this assumption (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1461444811420270">Gazdar, 1979</xref>) suggest instead that the expectations surrounding communication are culturally variable – change the cultural context, change the expectations. In the same way, as we move from face-to-face conversation to more frequent and more deeply mediated communications, we assume that the expectations generated by the maxims will to some degree lose their ‘fit’ with the new cultural and logistical communication environments of the web. Interactions in the blogosphere are decontextualized relative to face-to-face interaction but also relative to traditional journalistic processes of reporting news. With this decontextualization have come changes in our expectations of all web-based communications, including blogs. Efforts to teach information literacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461444811420270">Association of College and Research Libraries, 2000</xref>) bear witness to a general loosening of the quality maxim; now more than ever, questions about authenticity must go hand in hand with data. Likewise, digital technology has compelled changes in the expectations generated by the quantity and relevance maxims. In an environment where the amount and diversity of data is essentially unlimited, maxims constraining quantity and requiring relevance in communication may be less critical. Finally, although precision in writing is still valued on blogs, the potential for anonymity on the web allows communications of widely varying manner (e.g. flaming). Many of these communications would not be cast in the form they are if the mediation of the web did not allow for anonymity. Despite a general loosening of constraints in the expectations associated with the maxims, the present case suggests that the expectations that follow from the traditional maxims still have power and influence. It was by conforming to many of the expectations associated with news production that the hoaxer ultimately was successful. A fruitful avenue of additional inquiry would be to consider additional hoaxes through the lens of the Gricean maxims in order to contrast the power of these expectations over situations and over time.</p>
<p>The present case study is limited to a reading of blog posts and the responses made to them. Despite our efforts to identify the hoaxer, we never really got close and so were forced to rely on the single, limited interview with the hoaxer cited above. The study of journalistic authority in the blogosphere would benefit from triangulating our analysis of archival posts with in-depth interviews with hoaxers and their victims, a process study of the flow of information among participants (including the hoaxer) in football discussion forums, as well as an audience study of the readers of blogs. These diverse perspectives would certainly yield a more complete understanding of the operation of hoaxes and would lead to a more robust understanding of journalistic authority in general. Like all case studies, the generalizablity of the Bugduv hoax to other examples of the construction of journalistic authority must be questioned. Save at the very end of the hoax, this media event occurred exclusively in the blogosphere; many other news stories cross media platforms and therefore must construct authority in different ways. Nonetheless, the analysis presented here allows for a specific focus on authority construction in the blogosphere – an area of continuing change and increasing interest.</p>
<p>Finally, the hoax would have been impossible without the technology that provided the platform for the presentation of the texts used in the hoax. These texts were received through the lens of the maxims described above – maxims that were adhered to, flouted, or outright violated. The hoaxer mixed these conditions to create the liminal space that supported Bugduv. Without the technology that provided for rapid yet anonymous dissemination of the texts in question, the ambiguity required for the hoax would not have been possible. Although in many ways the hoaxer relied on the forms of traditional media to generate credibility, ultimately the tools of the internet, specifically embodied in blogs, broaden the range of tools available to bloggers, journalists and potential hoaxers in their search for authority and credibility.</p>
<p>As we broaden the Bugduv example beyond the context of sports media, we return to Lessig’s gaps in identity information that exist between traditional journalism and the re-articulation (and often the complete reformulation) of journalism online. Within this space of digital fluidity there is a tension present as journalistic authority and credibility becomes a desired trait and often a tool to work through this transitional period in media history. Understanding the conventions then becomes all the more important, not only for new media technologies and traditional media but for the liminal spaces that exist betwixt and between. It is within this space that Bugduv lives and thrives and must be understood.</p>

<p>For some unknown reason, the historical record of the hoaxer’s posts made to the BBC 606 message boards in the name of ‘Galwaygooner’ have recently (as of 11/1/2010) been changed so that the authorship of all of the 21 posts is now attributed to one ‘Ikmar Traubt’.

<p>As noted later in article, the Wikipedia change was made by a user named Masal Bugduv. If the hoaxer was a registered Wikipedia user, he or she could have made the change and remained completely anonymous. Rather, the hoaxer was either not a registered user or was registered and chose to make the change in the name of Bugduv. Remarkably, the Wikipedia entry was taken at face value by readers for the six months of the hoax. The name (Bugduv) associated with the Wikipedia change did not come to light until the hoax unraveled.</p></fn>
