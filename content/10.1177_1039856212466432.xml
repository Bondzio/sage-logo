<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>Universal routine screening and psychosocial assessment in the perinatal period has been introduced in Australia despite a lack of evidence that this affects perinatal maternal morbidity. Furthermore, this approach is not designed to detect maternal illnesses such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, although it is these women and their infants who have the highest rates of morbidity and mortality. We propose that any approach to improving maternal perinatal mental health should be tailored to particular situations and populations, with mental health care (inclusive of <italic>all</italic> mental illness, not just depression) integrated into, and thus a routine aspect of, maternity care provided to <italic>all</italic> women <italic>throughout</italic> the perinatal period.</p></sec>

<body>
<p>The call for universal routine screening and psychosocial assessment (screening) in the maternity setting followed recognition of perinatal (pregnancy and the first 12 months following birth) depression as an important health problem due to its prevalence, possible adverse consequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212466432">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212466432"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856212466432"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856212466432">4</xref></sup> and under-identification in routine clinical practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856212466432">5</xref></sup> Screening involves the use of a validated and reliable tool to detect positive ‘cases’ of a condition of interest. Psychosocial assessment gathers information across a number of relevant domains to inform whether one may, on the balance of probabilities, be ‘at risk’ of developing a condition in the future. For a variety of reasons, this approach has generated great debate in the perinatal mental health arena.</p>
<p>First, what is the aim of screening? Is it to identify women with symptoms, or current mental disorder, or those at risk of future disorder? Is detecting current disorder more or less important than detecting broad psychosocial risk factors such as poverty, homelessness and violence? Which disorders should we aim to detect? Can screening identify those who have a mental disorder that is likely to persist, or to affect the mother-infant interaction and infant development? Can screening identify those who require and are likely to agree to treatment, and/or who will respond to psychological therapies or pharmacotherapy?<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856212466432">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Second, what of the practicalities? Who will do the screening and when will it be done? What is then required to further assess and manage women identified through screening? If urgent issues arise (e.g. reported suicidal ideation), are there available and acceptable resources to provide required further assessment and follow-up and any necessary treatment? What happens if a woman screens negative or ‘low risk’? – is she still monitored for any changes in her mental health for the remainder of her maternity care, or is she assumed to be ‘OK’ and ‘lost’ within the system?</p>
<p>Third, screening for <italic>any</italic> psychiatric illness can be extraordinarily difficult. Unlike screening for some physical disorders, where there is a recognised natural history, validated screening tests with high sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value, effective and acceptable interventions and evidence for the benefit and harms of intervention, this is not the case with screening for psychiatric illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856212466432">7</xref></sup> The natural history of perinatal anxiety and depressive symptoms is not well understood. Psychological symptoms may be transient and self-limiting, are often non-specific and turn out to be associated with different clinical disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856212466432">8</xref></sup> Tools for the detection of anxiety or depressive symptoms cannot be equated with tests, such as Papanicolaou (PAP) smears and faecal occult blood tests, used successfully for screening and early detection of physical illness.</p>
<p>Fourth, available tools for screening have significant limitations. The most commonly used test or identification method for perinatal depression is the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856212466432">9</xref></sup> This self-report questionnaire does not actually provide a diagnosis of depression (elevated scores are, however, generally taken as indicative of either antenatal or postnatal depression (PND)). The EPDS has considerable problems with false positives and false negatives,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856212466432">10</xref></sup> there is significant variation in the EPDS cut-off point used,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856212466432">10</xref></sup> and research has clearly demonstrated inadequate sensitivity and specificity for routine use of the EPDS to predict later onset of PND (as distinct from usage to identify current distress).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856212466432">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Fifth, while a great amount of attention has been directed to developing and implementing universal screening and psychosocial assessment for perinatal <italic>depression</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856212466432">12</xref></sup> it must be highlighted that perinatal mental illness is <italic>not just</italic> depression. Some advocate that the emphasis should be on detection and service provision for those women who suffer from ‘serious mental illness’ (e.g. schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder) in relation to childbirth, as it is these women and their infants who have the highest rates of morbidity and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856212466432">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856212466432"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856212466432">15</xref></sup> The Australian <italic>beyondblue</italic> Clinical Practice Guidelines,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856212466432">16</xref></sup> the NSW Health ‘Safe Start Guidelines: Improving Mental Health Outcomes for Parents and Infants’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1039856212466432">17</xref></sup> and the WA Health ‘Healthy Babies for Mothers with Serious Mental Illness’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856212466432">18</xref></sup> all emphasise the significant and enduring potential negative impact that <italic>any</italic> maternal mental illnesses, not just depression, can have on mother, baby, partner and extended family unit.</p>
<p>A further consideration is that different issues need to be considered for various demographic groups. For example, studies have shown that indigenous Australians<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1039856212466432">19</xref></sup> and adolescent mothers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1039856212466432">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1039856212466432">21</xref></sup> have higher rates of mental health and related problems than other groups of antenatal women. However, we have little information about how best to detect perinatal mental health problems in these groups. It is unlikely that a universal routine screen such as the EPDS will prove the most effective approach. Women of culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1039856212466432">22</xref></sup> not only have higher rates of mental health and related problems than other groups of antenatal women, but often experience and explain symptoms we recognise as anxiety, depression and other mental disorders as something other than mental illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1039856212466432">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1039856212466432">24</xref></sup> Can our routine screening tools and methods be expected to be understood and to be reliable and valid once translated without consideration and understanding of differences in culture and attitudes toward illness?</p>
<p>In addition, how can we judge whether screening is effective? Whilst it has been shown that screening for depression is acceptable to many women,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1039856212466432">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1039856212466432">25</xref></sup> how many then agree to follow-up and treatment? Studies have suggested the rate may be very poor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856212466432">6</xref></sup> Of note, in 2008, a Cochrane review undertaken to evaluate the impact of antenatal psychosocial assessment on perinatal mental health morbidity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856212466432">8</xref></sup> concluded that there was no evidence that routine antenatal psychosocial assessment leads to improved perinatal mental health outcomes.</p>
<p>Finally, the benefits from screening should outweigh any physical or psychological harm related to the screening program. In relation to screening for perinatal depression, potential for harm associated with high false-positive and false-negative rates has been noted, as has the potential for harm if women who do not perceive themselves to be, are labelled as ‘at risk’ or ‘depressed’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1039856212466432">26</xref></sup> Following on from this, the stigma associated with being labelled as having a mental health condition may lead some women to under-report any symptoms or risk factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1039856212466432">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>In summary, the aims and potential benefits of screening remain unclear, and there are a range of unresolved practical issues. Consistent with this summation, in 2010 the United Kingdom National Screening Committee<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856212466432">10</xref></sup> re-evaluated its policy on screening for PND and, as in 2001, did <italic>not</italic> recommend universal screening. In addition, both the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) Antenatal and Postnatal Mental Health guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1039856212466432">28</xref></sup> and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) ‘Management of Perinatal Mood Disorders’ clinical guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1039856212466432">29</xref></sup> state there is little evidence to recommend the use of the EPDS or other tools as having sufficient accuracy for routine use in either the antenatal or postnatal periods.</p>
<sec id="section3-1039856212466432">
<title>The introduction of universal routine screening in Australia</title>
<p>In 2001, <italic>beyondblue</italic>, the national depression initiative, provided nearly 4 million Australian dollars to a multidisciplinary team to evaluate the introduction of routine screening for depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1039856212466432">23</xref></sup> and the introduction of antenatal and postnatal depression screening has been underway in a fragmented fashion in various Australian health centres and services since 2002.</p>
<p>In 2008, the Australian government, together with the state and territory governments, agreed to collaborate on the development of a National Perinatal Depression Initiative. The Australian government committed $55 million funding over five years toward the initiative. The aim of the initiative was to improve the prevention and early detection of antenatal and PND and provide better care, support and treatment for expectant and new mothers experiencing PND. The Australian government pledged to provide ongoing leadership for coordination, implementation and evaluation of this National Perinatal Depression Initiative.</p>
<p>In 2011, the <italic>beyondblue</italic> National Clinical Practice Guidelines: Depression and Related Disorders – Anxiety, Bipolar Disorder and Puerperal Psychosis – in the Perinatal Period were published, making recommendations on key areas of perinatal mental health care for implementation Australia-wide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856212466432">16</xref></sup> As a result, it is expected that routine screening will be undertaken in both the public and private sectors, by a health care professional (midwife, general practitioner, obstetrician, allied health professional, aboriginal health worker), at least once, and preferably twice in the antenatal period and again six to 12 weeks following the birth of the baby using the EPDS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856212466432">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is also recommended that enquiry should be made about ‘certain psychosocial factors of a significant nature’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856212466432">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856212466432">18</xref></sup> at similar time points. It is suggested this could be done using brief questionnaires or a structured psychosocial interview to identify individuals who are at risk for the development of mental illness. Suggested interviews variously ask about the presence and perceived impact of psychosocial risk factors, including personal and family history of mental illness, relationships and social support networks, recent life stressors, history of abuse, personality style, and feelings about pregnancy and parenthood. Examples include the Antenatal Psychosocial Assessment (ALPHA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1039856212466432">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1039856212466432">31</xref></sup> and the Antenatal Risk Questionnaire.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1039856212466432">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>The timing and nature of implementation of these recommendations currently varies across the states and territories.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1039856212466432">
<title>Is there a way other than routine screening?</title>
<p>We propose that routine screening is not <italic>the</italic> answer, or not <italic>the complete</italic> answer to improving maternal perinatal mental health. In particular, we contend that a ‘one size fits all’ approach cannot be appropriate. Rather, we propose that the approach should reflect an understanding of the specific features of perinatal mental disorder (e.g. the importance of issues related to transition to parenthood, attachment issues and past trauma), be tailored to particular situations and populations, with mental health care (inclusive of <italic>all</italic> mental illness, not just depression) integrated into, and thus a routine aspect of, maternity care provided to <italic>all</italic> women <italic>throughout</italic> the perinatal period. This can be achieved by education and support of clinicians involved in perinatal care (e.g. <italic>beyondblue</italic> resources,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1039856212466432">33</xref></sup> Perinatal Psychotropic Medicine Information Service),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1039856212466432">34</xref></sup> system development (e.g. ensuring adequate personnel and resources, planning and co-ordination of care between health care systems and providers, primary and secondary referral pathways) and cultural change. The latter is essential; the culture of maternity care must include mental health as an integral component, not something which can be dealt with (and potentially then regarded as ‘done and dusted’) using a ‘one off’ questionnaire.</p>
<p>In Australia, considerable investment has been made to develop and strengthen primary care psychiatry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1039856212466432">35</xref></sup> General practitioners (GPs) generally know the woman presenting for maternity care, her family and her social network. GPs deal with a broad spectrum of mental health problems, not just depression, and so are ideally placed to detect, manage if appropriate, and/or refer women for specialist mental health care in the perinatal period. A high proportion of women have their antenatal care undertaken by a GP before 20 weeks, undertake shared maternity care with their GP or have their maternity care undertaken in the private setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1039856212466432">36</xref></sup> Thus a major focus of efforts to enhance maternal perinatal mental health should be support for GPs to enable them to more effectively understand, assess and treat women at this time.</p>
<p>A second key focus to enhance maternal perinatal mental health must be maternity settings. Whilst these may vary from small local hospitals staffed by GPs and midwives through to large specialist maternity hospitals with consultation-liaison psychiatry services, the principle underlying care should be the same: to ensure mental health care is integrated into and becomes a <italic>routine aspect</italic> of maternity care rather than something which is ‘prescribed’ using an assessment tool(s) at certain time-points.</p>
<p>Australia has a strong specialist mental health sector with psychologists and psychiatrists in both public and private practice, and systems to enable access to the latter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1039856212466432">37</xref></sup> These clinicians can support GPs as well as midwives, obstetricians and maternal child health nurses through primary or secondary consultation. To do this effectively, clear referral networks and accessible pathways to care must be established. For example, clear stepped-care pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1039856212466432">38</xref></sup> offer a practical way to provide comprehensive mental health assessment and management integrated with maternity care. This approach defines several key roles for the GP which importantly include making the initial diagnosis, initiating treatment in less complex cases and ensuring overall continuity of care. Where needed, specialist providers can provide secondary consultation to the GP, co-manage women with more complex problems and assume primary care of those with the most severe and complex cases. This supports an integrated, holistic approach to care and capacity building.</p>
<p>In addition, targeted rather than universal screening can be used to complement this approach. Targeted approaches can be tailored with respect to the population group as well as the screening tool(s) and the aim of screening. For example, the aim of screening might be to identify the need for face-to-face assessment in high-risk populations. Coupled with clear processes and care pathways, this provides an enriched, integrated approach. For example, we have taken this approach with teenage women seeking maternity care and demonstrated that this led to early intervention, integrated interdisciplinary treatment planning and effective care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1039856212466432">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although yet to be formally evaluated, we propose that comprehensive mental health assessment and management integrated with maternity care, in both primary care and specialist settings, is a more appropriate and effective approach to detection and management of mental health problems in the perinatal period than the routine universal screening being implemented as part of the National Perinatal Depression Initiative. This acknowledges that a woman’s mental health problems and her psychosocial situation are fundamental influences on her, her child and family. Importantly, this approach encompasses the full range of psychiatric illnesses, not just depression and anxiety, and rather than being a ‘one size fits all’ approach, it is tailored to the particular patient population receiving maternity care. Additionally, instead of being an ‘add-on’ screen, this approach aims to provide integrated maternity and mental health care to <italic>all</italic> women <italic>throughout</italic> the perinatal period, making enquiry about mental health as important and as routine as checking blood pressure at each assessment.</p>
