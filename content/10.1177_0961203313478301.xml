<p>Our objective was to determine metabolic syndrome (MS) prevalence in Chinese patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and to investigate the conditions that contribute to its development. 116 patients with SLE classified according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria, and 115 controls were enrolled. MS was defined by the joint interim statement of the International Diabetes Federation Task Force on Epidemiology and Prevention; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; American Heart Association; World Heart Federation; International Atherosclerosis Society; and International Association for the Study of Obesity (IDF/NHLBI/AHA/WHF/IAS/IASO). SLE features and treatment of SLE were assessed. Fasting insulin and cortisol levels of 30 newly diagnosed, untreated patients and 33 age and sex-matched controls were detected. MS prevalence was 34.2% in patients with SLE and 14.8% in controls (<italic>p</italic> = 0.002). Lupus patients with MS had less frequency of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) intake (16.0% vs 45.8%; <italic>p</italic> = 0.012). Untreated patients with SLE had higher levels of fasting insulin (10.92 ± 13.53 vs 5.48 ± 5.43 uU/mL, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and plasma cortisol at 16:00 (257.22 ± 177.98 vs 139.84 ± 63.46 nmol/L, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001), but lower plasma cortisol at 08:00 (195.51 ± 149.84 vs 278.95 ± 136.27 nmol/L, <italic>p</italic> = 0.024). Comparisons regarding steroid therapy, levels of insulin and cortisol were not statistically significant between patients with MS and without MS. The Chinese patients with SLE presented a higher MS prevalence and fasting insulin than controls. MS was not associated with the steroid therapy and plasma cortisol. HCQ use proved to be protective against MS. The circadian rhythm of cortisol may differ in patients with SLE.</p>

<p>Metabolic syndrome (MS) describes a cluster of interrelated metabolic risk factors that confer a proinflammatory and a prothrombotic state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203313478301">1</xref></sup> and are involved in the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203313478301">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313478301">2</xref></sup> The syndrome, manifested by hypertension, disturbed glucose metabolism, dyslipidaemia and central obesity, has been shown to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular morbidity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203313478301">3</xref></sup> and mortality,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203313478301">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203313478301">4</xref></sup> particularly in women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203313478301">3</xref></sup> MS, which is highly prevalent in the United States,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203313478301">4</xref></sup> has an increasing prevalence in young women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203313478301">5</xref></sup> The prevalence of MS is rising in Asian countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203313478301">6</xref></sup> MS shows a signiﬁcant association with inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313478301">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203313478301">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203313478301">8</xref></sup> and haemostasis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313478301">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203313478301">8</xref></sup> which may help to explain its relationship with CVD.</p>
<p>The prevalence of premature atherosclerosis is increased in patients with SLE,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203313478301">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203313478301">10</xref></sup> a chronic inflammatory disease, which is associated with late mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203313478301">11</xref></sup> Although patients with SLE have increased conventional risk factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203313478301">12</xref></sup> for atherosclerosis, there was still a 7- to 17-fold increased risk of cardiovascular events after adjusting for these factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203313478301">13</xref></sup> MS has been proved to be a risk factor for atherosclerosis in SLE,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203313478301">14</xref></sup> along with the contribution of inflammation, complement activation, renal involvement and thrombosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203313478301">10</xref></sup> As is known, the prevalence of MS depends on the age, gender and several socio-economic, ethnic and geographic factors. However, a high prevalence of MS in patients with SLE has been repeatedly established in previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203313478301">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203313478301">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203313478301"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203313478301"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203313478301"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203313478301">19</xref></sup> to detect modifiable and predisposing factors contributing to atherosclerosis. But to date, only a few reports exist on MS in Chinese patients with SLE.</p>
<p>Increasing evidence suggests that more subtle disturbances of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis might be responsible for the pathogenesis of MS. Subjects with these cardiovascular risk factors have an active HPA axis with elevated morning plasma cortisol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961203313478301">20</xref></sup> and abnormal diurnal cortisol secretion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961203313478301">21</xref></sup> However, in chronic inflammatory diseases, for example, SLE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961203313478301">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961203313478301">23</xref></sup> and rheumatoid arthritis (RA),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961203313478301">23</xref></sup> cortisol is decreased according to the extent of systemic inflammation. As far as we know, there has not been any research on the relationship between the prevalence of MS in patients with SLE and the levels of circulating cortisol.</p>
<p>The identification and treatment of MS as well as the recognition of the possible factors involved in its occurrence in patients with lupus could have an impact on the CVD risk in SLE. Our objective was to determine MS prevalence in Chinese patients with SLE and to investigate the conditions that can contribute to its development, mainly established treatments and cortisol levels.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0961203313478301" sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients and controls</title>
<p>A cross-sectional study was carried out in 116 patients with SLE and 115 control subjects. One hundred and sixteen consecutive eligible patients, aged ≥18 years, who met the ACR classification criteria of SLE,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961203313478301">24</xref></sup> were enrolled between April 2010 and October 2010 from the Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University. One hundred and fifteen controls frequency-matched for age, sex and race without a previous history of connective tissue diseases were recruited from the Physical Examination Center of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University. Exclusion criteria for both patients and controls included pregnancy, infections and vital organ failure. All subjects gave written informed consent and the study was approved by the ethical committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University. This study was supported by the Chinese SLE Treatment and Research group (CSTAR).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0961203313478301"><title>Clinical assessment</title>
<p>Both patients and controls were evaluated through a standardized clinical interview and physical examination. Demographic parameters, age and gender were recorded at the study visit. Anthropometric measurements including height, weight, waist circumference (WC) and blood pressure (BP) were measured and the body mass index (BMI, weight (kg)/height (m<sup>2</sup>)) was calculated. WC was measured at the end of a normal expiration, in a horizontal plane around the abdomen at the level of the iliac crest, parallel to the floor, with the subject in the standing position. BP was recorded as the lower one of two measurements obtained 5 min apart in seated subjects after at least 5 min of rest.</p>
<p>The evaluation of clinical domain of patients included duration of SLE (period between SLE diagnosis and recruitment), disease activity assessed by the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961203313478301">25</xref></sup> and renal damage defined as urine protein (&gt;0.5 g/24 h), urinary casts, red blood cells or white blood cells without other disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961203313478301">24</xref></sup> Furthermore, the following therapeutic variables were assessed: duration of the treatment (cumulative time in months), current dosage (mg) and cumulative dosage (g) of prednisone or equivalent medication at enrolment in the study as well as application of methylprednisolone pulse therapy (whether the patient received it or not). Administration (at any time of the disease and at present) of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was also taken into account.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0961203313478301"><title>Laboratory tests</title>
<p>Laboratory analyses were performed in two phases. Firstly, routine laboratory data of biochemical and immunological parameters for patients and biochemical parameters for controls were obtained. As part of the routine laboratory assessment at admission, the following variables were measured in the 75 inpatients after overnight fasting: full blood cell count, casual glucosuria and urine protein, urinary cast, red blood cells or white blood cells, urine protein per 24 hours, glucose, globulin, lipid profile covering total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides (TGs) and lipoprotein (a), C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR – Westergren), serum complements (C3 and C4), anti-double stranded DNA antibodies (ELISA) and antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) (immunoﬂuorescence). These parameters were obtained from their medical records. For the other 41 patients, the aforesaid variables were determined using the same protocol when attending a scheduled follow-up over the period of study. Data of fasting glucose and lipid profile for the controls were attained from the physical examination reports of our hospital by the same clinical laboratory services.</p>
<p>Secondly, the blood samples of 30 newly diagnosed, untreated patients of the 116 and 33 age- and sex-matched controls of the 115 agreeing to have blood drawn for a second time were collected at 08:00 after a 10- to 12-hour overnight fast and at 16:00, respectively, and were processed immediately and stored at −80˚C for subsequent analysis of fasting serum insulin (chemoluminescent immunoassay), and plasma cortisol (electrochemoluminescent immunoassay) of the two aforementioned time intervals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0961203313478301"><title>Metabolic syndrome definitions</title>
<p>MS was defined according to the joint interim statement of the IDF/NHLBI/AHA/WHF/IAS/IASO in 2009.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961203313478301">26</xref></sup> SLE and controls were classified as having MS if three or more of the following five criteria were fulfilled: (1) increased WC: waist ≥85 cm in men and ≥80 cm in women; (2) increased TGs (drug treatment for elevated TGs is alternate indicator): ≥1.7 mmol/L; (3) reduced HDL cholesterol (drug treatment for reduced HDL cholesterol is alternate indicator): &lt;1.0 mmol/L in men and &lt;1.3 mmol/L in women; (4) increased BP (antihypertensive drug treatment in patients with history of hypertension is alternate indicator): systolic ≥130 and/or diastolic ≥85 mm Hg; (5) increased fasting glucose (drug treatment of increased glucose is alternate indicator): &gt;5.5 mmol/L.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0961203313478301"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Differences between continuous variables (expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD)) were tested for significance using the Student's <italic>t</italic>-test or Mann–Whitney test as appropriate. Categorical variables (recorded as percentages) were analysed with the Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. A two-sided <italic>p</italic>-value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant. All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software for Windows (version 13.0, SPSS, Inc, Chicago).</p>

<sec id="sec9-0961203313478301"><title>Differences between patients with SLE and controls</title>
<p>The main differences between this cohort of patients with SLE and controls are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961203313478301">Table 1</xref>. No significant differences in age, gender and BMI between the patients and controls were found. Proportion of female was predominant in both groups (91.80 vs 94.80%, respectively). In total, 34.2% of patients with SLE fulfilled the definition of MS compared with 14.8% of control subjects (<italic>p</italic> = 0.002). In assessing respectively each one of the criteria of MS, the patients with SLE showed significantly higher frequencies of low HDL (50.7 vs 34.8%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.031), hypertriglyceridaemia (56.2 vs 16.5%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and hypertension (46.6 vs 20.0%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The remaining MS components did not show any difference.

<p>When comparing characteristics of patients with SLE according to the presence of MS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0961203313478301">Table 3</xref>), the patients with MS presented higher WC (84.78 ± 7.70 vs 76.68 ± 5.36 cm, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), BMI (23.44 ± 3.77 vs 20.38 ± 2.50 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), systolic BP (SBP; 134.32 ± 17.17 vs 117.64 ± 21.40 mmHg, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001), diastolic BP (DBP; 86.64 ± 10.75 vs 76.52 ± 10.60 mmHg, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and lower HDL (1.12 ± 0.46 vs 1.39 ± 0.56 mmol/L, <italic>p</italic> = 0.035) than the patients without, with the other biochemical parameters not statistically different. No significant differences between both groups were observed regarding clinical and immunological features containing C3, C4, CRP, ESR, disease duration, SLEDAI score and renal damage. As for the therapeutic variables, the only difference discovered was a lower frequency of HCQ use in SLE patients with MS (16.0% vs 45.8%; <italic>p</italic> = 0.012).

<p>This is the first study in Chinese that assesses the prevalence of MS in patients with SLE. Consistent with the previous studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203313478301">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203313478301">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203313478301">17</xref></sup> this study disclosed an increased prevalence of MS in patients with SLE when compared with the general population, which suggested a common aetiological mechanism between inflammation and premature atherosclerosis, both features of SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203313478301">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>There has been controversy in the past decade about the deﬁnition and signiﬁcance of MS in clinical practice, and a number of different classification criteria have been proposed accordingly since 1998. But none of them has been uniformly agreed upon throughout the world. Finally, in 2009, came the global deﬁnition, the joint interim statement of the IDF/NHLBI/AHA/WHF/ IAS/IASO,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961203313478301">26</xref></sup> which was applicative to both Europeans and non-Europeans and equally applicative to the Chinese consequently. This most recent definition, with which few studies on MS in patients with lupus had been carried out to our knowledge, was just the one we used. A high prevalence of MS in patients with SLE has been repeatedly established in previous studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203313478301">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203313478301">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203313478301"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203313478301"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203313478301"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203313478301">19</xref></sup> though with different definitions. For example, in the study of Chung et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203313478301">7</xref></sup> they detected an MS prevalence of 32.4% in patients with SLE using the World Health Organization (WHO) definition and 29.4% according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP) criteria. Furthermore, Bellomio et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203313478301">15</xref></sup> found it to be 28.6% with the criteria by the American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (AHA/NHLBI) Scientific Statement, and Negrón et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203313478301">16</xref></sup> disclosed a 38.2% prevalence using the same definition. Applying the NCEP criteria, MS prevalences detected by El Magadmi et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203313478301">17</xref></sup> Bultink et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203313478301">18</xref></sup> and Sabio et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203313478301">19</xref></sup> were 18%, 16% and 20%, respectively. Differences of age, gender and several socio-economic, ethnic and geographic factors could help explain the different findings.</p>
<p>When comparing MS components, patients with SLE met the criteria for hypertension more often, as proved by foregoing researches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203313478301">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203313478301">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203313478301">19</xref></sup> despite different definitions of MS. We also found the SLE group had a higher frequency of low HDL, as was found by Sabio et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203313478301">19</xref></sup> and more frequently hypertriglyceridaemia. Both of them are the most commonly observed lipid profile abnormalities in SLE, which are aggravated by disease activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961203313478301">27</xref></sup> These all confirmed the points that the prevalence of premature atherosclerosis was increased in patients with SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203313478301">9</xref></sup> Therefore control of dyslipidaemia and hypertension may be an important and protective measure against potential CVD to patients with SLE in addition to immunomodulating treatment.</p>
<p>At present there is not just one possible cause accountable for the increased prevalence of MS in patients with SLE. First, El Magadmi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203313478301">17</xref></sup> disclosed that insulin resistance (IR) and the prevalence of MS were associated with higher levels of oxidized LDL (ox-LDL). Second, IR was related to the elevated level of leptin which played a proinflammatory and proatherosclerotic role. On the contrary, adiponectin acted as an anti-inflammatory and antiatherosclerotic element with the effect of lowering blood glucose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0961203313478301">28</xref></sup> It has been proved that there was a relationship between the hyposecretion of adiponectin and the presence of IR and MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0961203313478301">29</xref></sup> Elevated leptin and decreased adiponectin have both been reported to be involved in the occurrence of IR and MS in patients with SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0961203313478301">30</xref></sup> Third, MS shows signiﬁcant associations with inflammation and haemostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313478301">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203313478301">8</xref></sup> in the general population. Several studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203313478301">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203313478301">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203313478301">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203313478301">19</xref></sup> found the MS in SLE was significantly associated with higher CRP or ESR, which was not observed in our study. Fourth, higher C3 level was related to the presence of MS in SLE in the research by Sabio et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203313478301">19</xref></sup> and Bultink et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203313478301">18</xref></sup> but not Negrón et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203313478301">16</xref></sup> and us. Fifth, disease activity was found to be associated with MS by Negrón et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203313478301">16</xref></sup> but controversially not by others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203313478301">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203313478301">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203313478301">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203313478301">19</xref></sup> Our study approved the latter. Furthermore, there was a study reporting cumulative damage of SLE was associated independently with MS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203313478301">15</xref></sup> which was not approved by others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203313478301">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203313478301">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203313478301">19</xref></sup> either. Therefore, lipid oxidation, adipocytokine, inflammation, haemostasis, abnormal activation of complements and disease features of SLE may all have contributed to the high prevalence of MS in patients with SLE. But the precise relationship between them and the MS prevalence in patients with lupus and the involved mechanisms remain to be clarified.</p>
<p>The finding on the effect of specific SLE treatment on MS was of interest. Glucocorticoid (GC) is described as a rapier in SLE treatment, with suppression of the inflammatory response and decrease of disease activity on the one hand, but predomination of adverse metabolic effects on the other hand, especially at a high dose. In our paper, no association with GC administration was found. Roman et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0961203313478301">31</xref></sup> found that patients with lupus with carotid plaques received lower daily steroid doses. Most of the recent studies on MS and SLE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203313478301">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203313478301">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203313478301">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203313478301">19</xref></sup> found no association with GC administration, but Bultink et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203313478301">18</xref></sup> found an independent relationship between the number of MS components (MS score) and previous methylprednisolone pulse therapy. Moreover, prednisone &gt;10 mg/day was independently associated with MS in another study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203313478301">16</xref></sup> Whether the application of GC promotes the prevalence of the MS in patients with lupus needs to be studied further.</p>
<p>The beneficial effects of HCQ in the therapy of SLE, including increasing bone mineral density and the survival rate and decreasing disease activity, the prevalence of thrombotic events, the cumulative damage and the risk of CVD,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0961203313478301">32</xref></sup> have been exhaustively studied. HCQ could improve the metabolism of lipid and glucose in patients with SLE, such as lowering blood glucose,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0961203313478301">33</xref></sup> TC, LDL and TGs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0961203313478301">34</xref></sup> and elevating HDL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0961203313478301">35</xref></sup> Antimalarial drugs have several effects on insulin metabolism. Dominatingly, they prolong the half-life of the active insulin–receptor complex through inhibiting insulin dissociation from its receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0961203313478301">36</xref></sup> and consequently increasing insulin sensitivity. In our case group, HCQ use appeared to be a protective factor against the presence of MS in accordance with Sabio et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203313478301">19</xref></sup> and Bellomio et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203313478301">15</xref></sup> who found lower frequency of HCQ intake among SLE patients with MS compared to those without. This result was not observed by many other previous authors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203313478301">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203313478301">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203313478301"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203313478301">18</xref></sup> Although it is still unclear how HCQ contributes to reducing the risk of vascular events, the aforesaid impact of treatment with GC and antimalarial drugs on MS in patients with lupus helps to support the established hypothesis that, since atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease, treatment aimed at the SLE would help to improve the abnormal metabolism and consequently lower the risk of cardiovascular events. Further prospective studies are expected to clarify the value of antimalarials in SLE with MS.</p>
<p>Insulin levels were found to be higher in patients with SLE, as reported by others who confirmed that patients with SLE had more severe IR in comparison with the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203313478301">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203313478301">17</xref></sup> Furthermore, GCs, which are the most commonly used drugs for patients with SLE, have adverse effects on insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. Therefore, patients with lupus may suffer from hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia more often than the general population. IR and MS are signiﬁcantly associated with markers of haemostasis and inﬂammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203313478301">8</xref></sup> known to be relevant to their associations with excess risk for CVD, and are consequently related to the increased prevalence of premature atherosclerosis in patients with SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203313478301">9</xref></sup> Therefore inflammation may drive IR directly. IR has been considered to be the foundation of the increased cardiovascular risk in MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0961203313478301">37</xref></sup> The two major pathophysiological mechanisms of type 2 diabetes include IR and pancreatic beta cell dysfunction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0961203313478301">38</xref></sup> It has been shown that diabetes mellitus is one of the most important risk factors for atherosclerosis in patients with SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203313478301">12</xref></sup> Therefore, when hyperglycaemia is detected in a patient taking GCs, in addition to the side effect of GCs, the possibility of type 2 diabetes should also be taken into consideration, especially in older patients.</p>
<p>This paper is the first research on the association between the prevalence of MS in patients with SLE and the levels of circulating cortisol. Patients with SLE had significantly lower fasting levels of cortisol at 08:00, as was concordant with the concept that in chronic inflammatory diseases such as SLE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961203313478301">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961203313478301">23</xref></sup> and RA,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961203313478301">23</xref></sup> cortisol was decreased according to the extent of systemic inflammation, particularly in the case of long disease duration. Another study proved that therapy with an anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antibody directed at RA could increase the serum androstenedione related to cortisol,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0961203313478301">39</xref></sup> indicating that the insufficient production of cortisol was associated with inflammation. Additionally, inadequately low plasma adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) has been described to be related to TNF or interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels in RA and reactive arthritis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0961203313478301">40</xref></sup>; equally, the most important stimulus from the pituitary may weaken during systemic inflammation. It was suggested that reduced adrenal production or increased transition to downstream hormones has most likely caused the inadequately low levels of adrenal hormones in RA and SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0961203313478301">41</xref></sup> Insulin may also affect cortisol metabolism by decreasing the activity of a reductase catalyzing conversion of inactive cortisone to active cortisol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0961203313478301">42</xref></sup> The effect of high insulin level would probably be responsible for the lower plasma cortisol at 08:00 in patients with SLE along with the chronic inflammation and the transition to downstream hormones.</p>
<p>In healthy people, there is a diurnal fall in cortisol secretion, but this is altered in glucose intolerant subjects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0961203313478301">43</xref></sup> and patients with moderately active SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961203313478301">22</xref></sup> The circadian rhythm will also be affected by the effect of oral glucose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0961203313478301">43</xref></sup> and a protein meal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0961203313478301">44</xref></sup> to raise plasma cortisol. Slight disturbances of the HPA axis might contribute to the pathogenesis of MS. Subjects with these cardiovascular risk factors have an active HPA axis with elevated morning plasma cortisol, increased excretion of cortisol metabolites, impaired peripheral inactivation of cortisol,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961203313478301">20</xref></sup> and abnormalities of diurnal cortisol secretion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961203313478301">21</xref></sup> There may be several aspects that had contributed to the elevated plasma cortisol at 16:00 in contrast to 08:00 in the 30 patients, accordingly significantly higher than the 33 controls at 16:00. First, there were 8 hours between the two measurements, and the elevated level of cortisol may be just the manifestation of the altered circadian,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961203313478301">22</xref></sup> as has been stated. Second, the result of cortisol levels may have been affected by the mental status of the patients and the ward environment. Third, their diet could have influenced the levels of cortisol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0961203313478301">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0961203313478301">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although people with MS in the general population have elevated morning plasma cortisol concentrations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961203313478301">20</xref></sup> the comparisons of the plasma cortisol at 08:00 and at 16:00 were not significantly significant between the lupus patients with MS and without MS. This suggests that there could be other mechanisms different from the general population contributing to the variation of the circadian rhythm of cortisol in lupus patients with concomitant MS, although these have not been precisely clarified. However, there was a subtle trend in the way the levels of cortisol increased at 16:00.</p>
<p>MS is an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic disease,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203313478301">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203313478301">4</xref></sup> thus it is important to screen for MS in the course of SLE to identify subgroups of patients who are at high risk to develop CVD and diabetes mellitus. Multicentre randomised prospective studies are needed to address the mechanisms that have established the subtle relationship between SLE and MS, thus providing novel therapeutic approaches.</p>
<p>Some limitations should be considered here. First, the presence of associated CVD was not evaluated, which would have helped to analyse the real significance of detection of MS as promoter of posterior vascular damage in patients with SLE. Second, other factors that were proved to be associated with MS in patients with lupus were not measured, particularly socioeconomic status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203313478301">16</xref></sup> and procoagulant factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203313478301">8</xref></sup> The presence of these factors could have a role in the emergence of MS in patients with lupus. Third, the other adrenal hormones that may help to clarify the mechanism of the circadian variation of cortisol were not determined. Finally, because this was a cross-sectional study, it was possible that some patients had MS before the study visit.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study showed that Chinese patients with SLE presented a higher MS prevalence and higher levels of insulin than controls. MS was not associated with the administration of GCs and plasma cortisol. The cortisol circadian in SLE altered. HCQ use may have a protective effect on MS.</p>
