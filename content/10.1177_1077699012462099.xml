<p>By the time this book review is published, the 2012 presidential election will have been decided. Billions of dollars will have been spent on the campaigns of Barack Obama and Mitt Romney—and much of that online. Data from both candidates’ official websites (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.barackobama.com">www.barackobama.com</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mittromney.com">www.mittromney.com</ext-link>), new smartphone apps, and other media software will help outline one candidate’s victory and the other’s defeat.</p>
<p>Researchers will be busy crunching data, producing detailed analyses of media technology used during the election. They will also compare 2008 to 2012 campaign strategies. Moreover, new information will add to growing insight on the effectiveness of the Internet as a political tool.</p>
<p>In <italic>Communicator-In-Chief: How Barack Obama Used New Media Technology to Win the White House</italic>, editors John Allen Hendricks and Robert E. Denton, Jr., take readers on a fast-paced history lesson in political communication. From Aristotle’s writings in <italic>Politics</italic> to the early roles radio and television played in the campaigns of presidents Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover, readers follow the rise of the Internet.</p>
<p>Hendricks, of Stephen F. Austin State University, and Denton, of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, provide excellent political communication expertise and insight to this work. “Without question, the Internet is becoming one of the defining scientific and social innovations of the 21st century,” they write. “Users can share data, communicate messages, transfer programs, discuss topics, and connect to computer systems all over the world.”</p>
<p>The book’s 171 pages are divided into nine chapters, each written by different authors. Readers learn about key players and their roles in Obama’s 2007 campaign website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://myBO.com">myBO.com</ext-link>) and 2004 MySpace page. The book also covers the use of media technology in campaign strategy and tactics. The editors present a thoughtful collaboration with contributing authors, who are well-versed researchers. By the end of the book, readers will appreciate understanding how Obama’s use of new media compared to former political candidates. They will also learn which candidates were successful using email, social media, and online video games for influencing and fundraising?</p>
<p><italic>Communicator-in-Chief</italic> also explores the role of cell phones and other handheld gadgets in campaigning. It covers the candidates’ use of smart phones and text messaging to create contact lists, supporter databases, and mobilize volunteers. Readers can follow the popularity of YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook, MyFace, and blogs and their impact on the 2008 campaign.</p>
<p>Obama’s embrace of social media and understanding of the power of technology is a recurring theme of the book. In 2008, Obama used Twitter and other social media tools to refine political messages. The book contains coding analyses that show how Twitter served two primary functions for the Obama campaign. First, Twitter was used to announce where the candidate was at any one moment. The second function was to direct followers to the campaign website.</p>
<p>Researchers used data from a year-long national survey of college-aged youth to study the dynamics of social networking websites for mobilizing youth in support of the Obama campaign. Additionally, there is a cautionary note for future political campaigns. “It would be foolish to speculate what the landscape of the Web may look like in 2012, but it is a safe bet that a new venue will present itself,” write Jody Baumgartner and Jonathan Morris of East Carolina University. “And that it will look different than it did in 2008.”</p>
<p>Midway in the book, readers discover the social media and political strategy differences between candidates Barack Obama and John McCain. The “Yes We Can” slogan built brand loyalty for Obama. During a low point in the campaign, Obama went against his advisers and gave a speech about race to respond to a controversial church pastor. Also there was the go-for-broke strategy in summer 2007, when Obama shifted and opted out of public financing. He chose to raise funds to pay for his entire campaign, while McCain, on the other hand, took taxpayer funding for the general election.</p>
<p>YouTube and viral videos such as the “Obama Girl” are also covered in-depth. The book gives readers a better appreciation of the pros and cons of using the Internet as means to reach out to potential voters and citizens. It traces Obama’s transition from a candidate to president and how having the right message and the right media married perfectly with a candidate who embraced technology.</p>
<p><italic>Communicator-In-Chief: How Barack Obama Used New Media Technology to Win the White House</italic> offers valuable information to journalism and mass communication scholars, although the landscape has already evolved further in the 2012 election campaign. As a cross-disciplinary book, it is also particularly useful for educators and students in political science, sociology, public relations, and communication studies.</p>
