<p>Negative ion generators (NIGs) have been efficiently used for the reduction of airborne particulates in indoor environments. The mechanisms of particle removal include particle charging by emitted ions and electro-migration from air to wall surfaces. This study explores the dependence of size on particle removal from air in the presence of an ioniser. The test aerosols used were the combustion particulates generated using mosquito repellent coils that are very often used in urban homes in the Asian and African regions. In addition to the main component allethrin, organic fillers are added to these coils to aid smouldering. This could lead to a heavy airborne particulate loading over a very wide size range, all of which may not be beneficial. Room experiments showed that the particle concentration was reduced by a factor of about 15 for sizes of 40 nm and decreased to about 1.5 for 0.3 µm, thus leading to an increase in the median diameters in the presence of the ioniser. Implications to the deposition of these particles in the human respiratory tract system are discussed and there is a significant reduction in the deposition when the ioniser is operated.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1420326X11424769" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Numerous techniques have been developed over the years for reducing aerosol concentrations in indoor environments. Among indoor air purifiers of different types, corona discharge-based ion emitters have gained increasing attention and are most commonly used for particulate reduction in indoor air. These negative ion generators (NIGs) comprise of sharp metallic needles maintained at a high negative potential (5–15 kV). Given sufficient field strength (due to applied high voltage), air near the needle experiences a breakdown and becomes conductive. In the conductive corona region, accelerated electrons collide with air molecules to create a dense cloud of free electrons and positive ions. When the discharged needle is negatively biased, the positive ions are attracted towards the needle forming a current in the circuit. Simultaneously, the free electrons repulse away from the needle, attaching to molecules of the air to form negative ions. These ions have an average electrical mobility of 1–2 cm<sup>2</sup>V<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11424769">1</xref>]. Studies on their chemical composition, lifetime, concentration and properties have been evolving as an important research thread continuously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1420326X11424769">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1420326X11424769">4</xref>]. These have direct bearing on their attachment to the ambient aerosol particles leading to the removal of these particles from the air phase.</p>
<p>Removal of aerosol particles, by a factor of about two, from typical indoor spaces using NIGs has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X11424769">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11424769">6</xref>]. Several studies have shown dependence of the particle removal rates on characteristic parameters of the ion-aerosol system. Wiedensohler et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X11424769">7</xref>] and Adachi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X11424769">8</xref>] indicated that particle charging efficiency depends on the residence time of the particles in the ion cloud and the ion concentrations. Lee et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1420326X11424769">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1420326X11424769">10</xref>] indicated that the mobility and removal efficiency of aerosol particles increased with an increase in negative air ion emission rates. Unger et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X11424769">11</xref>] and Oh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X11424769">12</xref>] reported that particle charging is also affected by the shape of the particles. Wu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1420326X11424769">13</xref>] studied the influence of wall surface materials on the removal of airborne particles with negative air ions in indoor environments. They estimated that the order of natural decay for 300 and 30 nm particles under different wall surfaces was Cement Paint &gt; PVC ≈ wallpaper ≈ wood &gt; stainless steel, as determined by the roughness of the wall materials. A theoretical study by Mayya et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X11424769">14</xref>] explains the mechanism of ioniser-induced particle concentration reduction via particle charging by emitted ions and their subsequent electro-migration to surfaces. The model predictions of this study have examined the dependence of particle depletion characteristics on particle sizes which have an important bearing on their electro-migration velocities. In addition, particle-particle interactions also affect removal rates, which are size dependent.</p>
<p>In most of the Asian regions, very often encountered indoor aerosols are those generated by the combustion processes, in particular, by daily use of mosquito repellent coils, incense sticks and cigarette smoke. A number of studies have been carried out to measure the particle size distributions of indoor smoke aerosols. Ishizu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1420326X11424769">15</xref>] carried out measurements using photometer to study particle size distribution of cigarette smoke aerosols. They concluded that the increase in the residence time of aerosols leads to increased mean size and decreased particle number concentration. Ueno and Peters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1420326X11424769">16</xref>] analysed cigarettes for particle generation rate and size distribution and evaluated equivalent total particulate matter of side stream smoke using Electrical Aerosol Analyzer and Andersen Cascade Impactors. Keith et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1420326X11424769">17</xref>] observed the mode of cigarette smoke aerosol size distribution to between 0.2 and 0.25 µm. Characterisation of incense smoke was carried out by Cheng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1420326X11424769">18</xref>] and they found the observed Count Median Diameter (CMD) to be about 0.13 µm and the Mass Median Aerodynamic Diameter (MMAD) to be 0.28 µm. The incense aerosol generation rate was found to be between 230 and 280 µg min<sup>–1</sup>. A similar study by Mannix et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1420326X11424769">19</xref>], estimated that burning incense generates particulates more than 45 mg g<sup>−1</sup> of the incense stick burnt. Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1420326X11424769">20</xref>] measured size distributions of sub-micrometer aerosols emitted from cooking. They found that concentrations increased from 15000 to 150,000 cm<sup>−3</sup> during cooking and median diameters were between 40 and 70 nm. The study by Li and Hopke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1420326X11424769">21</xref>] measured the hygroscopic growth of cigarette smoke and incense particles and showed that combustion aerosol particles could grow 10% to 120% depending on their sizes and origins.</p>
<p>The indoor aerosols pose inhalation hazard and several studies have been reported on the deposition of combustion aerosols in the human respiratory tract. Owen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1420326X11424769">22</xref>] collected information on sources, size and concentrations of indoor particles and studied the mechanics of deposition in the lungs and the aerosol dynamics. Morawska et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1420326X11424769">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1420326X11424769">24</xref>] analysed the deposition patterns of combustion aerosols in the human respiratory tract; their results showed that a total number deposition for nasal breathing of environmental tobacco smoke to be 56 ± 15.9%. A study to determine the health risk due to inhalation of most common indoor smoke particles, their size distribution and chemical composition specifically cadmium, zinc and lead was carried out by Roy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1420326X11424769">25</xref>] recently.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1420326X11424769"><title>Research Objectives</title>
<p>The present study aimed to investigate the removal efficiency of NIGs for airborne particles with varying particle size in the presence of ionisers. The test aerosols used in this study were those generated by mosquito repellent coils that are very often used overnight in urban homes in Asia, Africa and South America. The polydispersity of these aerosols has made them an apt contender for studying the effect of size on particle removal with ionisers. They have high burnout rates and persist for a long time contributing significantly to indoor pollution. The main components of mosquito coil are <italic>d-Trans allethrin</italic> (0.1–0.2 wt%), pyrethrin and lindane. The other components are organic fillers such as wood dust and coconut shell flour, binders, dyes and some other additives which aid smouldering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1420326X11424769">26</xref>]. On burning, allethrin and 46 organic compounds like phenol and o-cresol and particulates containing heavy metals such as Cd, Zn and Pb have been detected in the generated smoke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1420326X11424769">27</xref>]. The emission factors (mg g<sup>−1</sup> of burning material) as reported by Lee and Wang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1420326X11424769">28</xref>] are: PM<sub>2.5</sub>: 20.3–47.8; PM<sub>10</sub>: 15.9–50.8; CO: 74.6–89.1; NO: 0.1–0.5; NO<sub>2</sub>: not detectable; NO<sub>x</sub>: 0.1–0.5; CH<sub>4</sub>: not detectable; Non Methane Hydro Carbons (NMHC): 0.1–5.7.</p>
<p>The postulated effect of the mosquito coil smoke on the insects may be described in the following manner. The natural pyrethrins used in the mosquito coils quickly penetrate the nervous system of the insect, and in a short span of time, the insect is “knocked down” and cannot move or fly away [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1420326X11424769">29</xref>]. Allethrin, par se, is of low chronic toxicity to humans. Assuming that even if 99.9% of allethrin in the coil is emitted into the atmosphere, the level would still be below the LD50 limit for mammals, which is 600 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1420326X11424769">30</xref>]. On the other hand, it appears that the copious amounts of sub-micrometer particles emitted from the incomplete combustion of the fillers and other additives may pose a greater hazard to humans as they can reach the lower respiratory tract on inhalation. These particulates may be coated with a variety of organic compounds, which are known to be carcinogenic. Epidemiological studies have shown that long-term exposures to mosquito coil smoke can induce asthma and persistent wheezing in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1420326X11424769">31</xref>]. The observance of anthracosis in rats exposed to fumes of mosquito coils, but not in those exposed to aerosolised sprays, is indicative of the fact that the binding materials and the particulate matter generated has a significant role in causing acute and chronic health effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1420326X11424769">32</xref>]. Liu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1420326X11424769">26</xref>] estimated that people who use mosquito coils for a large fraction of their lifetimes may have an enhanced respiratory health risk. Studies carried out by Liu and Wong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1420326X11424769">33</xref>] on albino rats concluded that smoke-exposed animals had a lower body weight than the controls. Histopathological lesions, inflammation of tracheal epithelium and increase of alveolar macrophages were also observed in the exposed groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1420326X11424769">34</xref>].</p>
<p>The options then are: (1) to replace the smoke generating mosquito coils with non-smoke mosquito controlling economical methods (such as liquid vaporisers); and (2) remove the unwanted combustion particles generated by the fillers used in coils so as to make the coil a “cleaner” option to reduce exposure and respiratory health risks. The present study focused on the second option and assessed the feasibility of using unipolar ionisers in mitigating the hazardous particulates without affecting the vapour-bound insecticide compounds in the mosquito coils. As the ionisers reduce only the unnecessary filler particulates, the efficacy of mosquito coil would not be compromised due to ioniser operation. In this context, understanding the size dependency of the particulate reduction is important in order to strengthen the studies on ioniser induced particle reduction. The objectives of this work are:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Understanding the mosquito coil aerosol emissions in terms of size segregated aerosol concentration profiles;</p></list-item>

<p>For the last objective, total particle depositions in the human respiratory tract have been estimated so as to interpret inhalation risk changes qualitatively.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec4-1420326X11424769"><title>Experimental Set-up and Measurement Systems</title>
<p>All experiments were carried out in a closed room of 48 m<sup>3</sup> volume; the layout of the room is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X11424769">Figure 1</xref>.
<fig id="fig1-1420326X11424769" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of experimental set up in the room.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11424769-fig1.tif"/></fig>
</p>
<p>A fan was used to homogenise the source aerosols and ions in the room. Humidity in the room monitored using Cole–Parmer humidity sensor was 50–60% during all the experiments. Ioniser assembly comprising of five NIGs with needles pointing in all the directions were placed in the centre of the room at a height of 130 cm from the ground as indicated so as to achieve uniform ion spray. Ion concentrations were measured using Medion Ion Analyzer that consists of a parallel plate type arrangement used to measure airborne ion concentrations. Ions were drawn in by a pump and were deflected in the electric field applied between the plates. The ions collected on the plate would be used to determine the airborne ion concentrations.</p>
<p>The particle number concentrations were recorded at a distance of 1 m from the ioniser assembly, using two on-line aerosol measuring instruments namely, the GRIMM Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS) and GRIMM Aerosol Spectrometer. The SMPS works on the principle of electrostatic classification of particles depending on their mobility in an electric field followed by counting in a Condensation Nucleus Counter. The aerosol inlet sampling flow rate was 0.3 L/min and particle numbers were distributed over 44 size classes ranging from 9.8 to 875 nm.</p>
<p>The GRIMM Aerosol Spectrometer utilises light scattering technique to evolve the particle number size distribution in 15 size channels ranging from 0.3 to 20 µm and has an aerosol suction flow rate of 1.2 L/min. The equipment was used to supplement the data produced by the SMPS by analysing a higher range of particle sizes. Between each set of experiments (e.g. natural and ioniser-aided removal), the room environment was brought to ambient conditions by opening the window and allowing time for mixing of room aerosols with outdoor aerosols, sufficiently. The ambient conditions were verified before every experimental measurement with SMPS readings.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-1420326X11424769"><title>Mosquito Coil Burn-out Characteristics</title>
<p>A popular brand of mosquito coil commercially available in the market was used for all the experiments in this study. The burn rate of the coil was about 2 g h<sup>−1</sup> and each coil lasted for about 8 h. The aerosol emission rate was estimated to be 1 mg min<sup>−1</sup>. Similar emission rates in the range of 0.85–1.95 mg min<sup>−1</sup> have been reported for Chinese brands by Liu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1420326X11424769">24</xref>]. Incidentally, this is five times higher than that reported by Cheng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1420326X11424769">18</xref>] for incense stick aerosols. The specific coil output, that is, the amount of particulate matter generated per gram weight of the coil, was found to be 31.4 mg g<sup>−1</sup>.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-1420326X11424769"><title>Ioniser Characteristics</title>
<p>The ionisers used in the study were “Prayag Ionisers” commercially available in Indian market operating at 230 V (AC), 50 Hz electrical supply. One unit of the ioniser consists of four sharp needles connected to a compact high voltage power supply. The ionisers developed approximately 5.5 kV at the tip of the needle. Background negative ion concentration in the room was found to be about 1500 ions cm<sup>−3</sup>. To see the effect of ventilation on the ion concentrations, the domestic type room air-conditioner (power consumption 1.5 kW) was kept on. Measurements with and without Air Conditioner (AC) showed that these background ions cleared away with ventilation and dropped to an average of about 1000 ions cm<sup>−3</sup>. However, at high ion concentrations, as in the case with all the ionisers switched on, the ions sprayed into the room were unaffected by AC and no relative significant fall in the levels was seen. This is possibly because of high rate of ion generation from the ionisers and the reduced effect of air circulation on the removal of ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1420326X11424769">35</xref>]. To study the dispersal of ions in the room in the presence of the ionisers, ion concentrations at points (1–8), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X11424769">Figure 1</xref>, were measured at a vertical distance of 1.5 m from the floor level. The results of the measurements are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1420326X11424769">Table 1</xref>.

<p>At the far corners (e.g. points 1, 2), measured negative ion concentrations were of the order of 10<sup>3</sup> ions cm<sup>−3</sup>. The region in the vicinity of the ionisers, that is, point 5, showed maximum concentration of about 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> ions cm<sup>−3</sup> and at other points nearby the concentration was 10<sup>4</sup> ions cm<sup>−3</sup>. To get a spatial distribution around the ion source, ion concentrations were also measured at 1 m, 1.5 m and 2 m radial distances from the ionisers. Results showed that with this arrangement of ionisers, a uniform ion concentration of 2.3 × 10<sup>5</sup> ions cm<sup>−3</sup> was achieved within a radial distance of 1.5 m; with increasing distance, ion concentrations dropped to 9 × 10<sup>4</sup> ions cm<sup>−3</sup>. These measurements indicated that the sphere of influence of the ions to initiate particle removal could be taken as about 1.5–2.0 m. To estimate the extent of vertical transport of ions, the vertical profile of ion concentrations from the ioniser assembly in the room was recorded within a height of 200 cm from the ground. The ions appeared to be concentrated in the plane of the ioniser and the concentrations sharply fell at heights above and below the source as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X11424769">Figure 2</xref>.

<p>Initially, the mosquito coils were lit for 25 min and during the burning period, fan was kept on so as to homogenise the aerosols in the room. The number concentrations as measured by SMPS were found to increase from background level of 10<sup>4</sup> particles cm<sup>−3</sup>. To study the size-dependent removal of particles using ionisers, the coil was put off after about 25 min, when the concentration reached to about 10<sup>5</sup> particles cm<sup>−3</sup>; the normal depletion of the total particles in the size range of 10 nm to about 1 µm was then studied using the SMPS. This is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1420326X11424769">Figure 3</xref>.
<fig id="fig3-1420326X11424769" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Variation in the number concentration of source aerosols.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11424769-fig3.tif"/></fig>
</p>
<p>At this time, the CMD was observed to be 81.5 nm with a Geometric Standard deviation (GSD) of 2.03. It was observed that on insertion of smoke aerosols generated by the coil, all size classes did not show a rise in the particle concentrations in the time duration when the coil was burning. In fact, as can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1420326X11424769">Figure 4(a)</xref>, concentrations of particles&lt;37.4 nm showed only a transient marginal increase over the background levels during the initial phase and an immediate fall in the concentration to values even lower than the background levels. For example, the particles in the size group 9.8–10.7 nm fell from a value of about 6000 cm<sup>−3</sup> to about 1000 cm<sup>−3</sup> when the source was on. Li and Hopke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1420326X11424769">21</xref>] studied particle size distribution for cigarette smoke (mainstream and sidestream) and incense smoke and they obtained particles above 30 nm for cigarette smoke and 50 nm for incense smoke particles. The results of present study also point to the fact that the mosquito coil did not produce particles below 37.4 nm. However, above 37.4 nm size, the particle concentrations were seen to increase during the burning of the source as seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1420326X11424769">Figure 4(b)</xref>–(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1420326X11424769">d</xref>). With respect to the results depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1420326X11424769">Figure 4(a)</xref>, the fall in the concentrations of the particles smaller than 37.4 nm during the particle generation phase could be attributed to the scavenging of smaller particles by smoke aerosols.

<p>As the burning of the mosquito coil was stopped, the generation of particles was discontinued. The subsequent depletion of particles was studied for two types of removal mechanisms namely the natural depletion due to various aerosol processes and an added removal due to the effect of the ioniser. The results for both these cases are summarised below.</p>
<sec id="sec10-1420326X11424769"><title>Natural Removal of Aerosols</title>
<p>As the coil burning was stopped, the particle concentrations in all size groups began to fall. The various mechanisms resulting in this natural removal of aerosols from airspace are wall deposition, gravitational settling and diffusion. To obtain the depletion constants in each size range, the concentration profiles, distributed over the sizes as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1420326X11424769">Figure 4(a)</xref>–(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1420326X11424769">d</xref>) were fitted to an exponential fit. In each case, the concentrations were normalised with respect to the peak value (which corresponds to time <italic>t</italic> = 0, indicating the switching off of the source).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec11-1420326X11424769"><title>Ioniser-Aided Removal</title>
<p>To study the effect of ionisers on particle removal, a second set of experiment was performed in which the ionisers were switched on simultaneously when the mosquito coil source was put off. With the operation of the ioniser, a rapid fall in the total aerosol concentration was observed and at the same time the ion concentration was found to increase. When the total particle concentration dropped to the background level of 10<sup>4</sup> particles cm<sup>−3</sup>, the ion concentration reached its initial value of 2.3 × 10<sup>5</sup> ions cm<sup>−3</sup> as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1420326X11424769">Figure 5</xref>. This was expected because as the particles were removed from the airborne phase, the ion–particle attachment was inhibited which raised the concentration of ions in the room.

</p>
<p>The depletion in aerosol concentration was faster with ioniser with a mean lifetime (characteristic depletion time) of 27.85 min than without it wherein the mean lifetime was 48.3 min as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1420326X11424769">Figure 6</xref>.

<sec id="sec12-1420326X11424769"><title>Size Dependence of Ioniser-Aided Removal</title>
<p>Size-separated aerosol concentration profiles (normalised to the steady-state values prevalent just before switching on the ioniser) as recorded by SMPS and Aerosol Spectrometer are shown in Figures 7 and 8, respectively.</p>
<p>With the use of ionisers, smaller particles showed an increase in their concentrations and the particles in the intermittent size classes of 37.4–49.4 nm were found to have the same depletion rate as natural. Explanation for this could be as follows: significant numbers of atmospheric particles were found in the sizes smaller than 37.4 nm while the smoke generated particles were all greater than about 37.4 nm, reflecting a more than unity normalised concentration. Also, the use of ionisers would be more effective in depleting the larger particles thus leading to a relative increase in the fine particle concentration. The size dependence of removal was also illustrated by Joshi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1420326X11424769">36</xref>] in their study on ioniser effect on thoron decay product aerosols, which showed that, the fine particle concentration would increase during the ioniser action due to curtailing of their attachment to coarse particles as they are depleted rapidly. Higher removal rate was shown of the particles in the higher size groups over the natural depletion with the operation of ioniser case for particle sizes greater than about 50 nm, a definite reduction was found in the concentrations with the ioniser on.</p>
<p>To quantify the observed depletion of the aerosols, the normalised concentrations were fitted to a first order exponential decay and the depletion constants were evaluated. The Concentration Reduction Factor (CRF) for each size group was then evaluated as the ratio of depletion constants with NIG to without NIG.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1420326X11424769">Figure 9</xref> shows the variation of CRFs as a function of particle size. The CRF decreased from a value of 15 for 37 nm particles to a steady value of 1–1.5 for particle size greater than 1 µm. Efficacy of removal due to ioniser action was thus higher for smaller particles (above the lower limit of 10 nm for SMPS), which decreased with increasing particle size and finally remained constant for larger particles. An interesting observation is that the Aerosol Spectrometer observations maintained the continuity trend as shown by the SMPS.

<p>The CMDs for the particle size distributions at varying times as measured by the SMPS are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1420326X11424769">Figure 10</xref>. During the source injection period, the CMD increased from 70 to 100 nm in the two sets of experiments, one conducted for natural depletion and the other for ioniser-aided depletion. After switching off the source, there was a steady decrease in the CMD under natural depletion conditions, while with the use of the ioniser, a shift towards the higher sizes was observed. This was as expected because the CRFs for the fine sizes particles were higher leading to their faster removal from airspace so that as time progressed, larger median sizes particles were recorded in the presence of ionisers.

<sec id="sec13-1420326X11424769"><title>Implications to Lung Deposition</title>
<p>It is almost certain that the particles generated during the process of the mosquito coil burning would remain in the room environment at significant levels and will cause an unwanted deposition in the human respiratory tract system. Using the experimental data obtained, an attempt was made to estimate the fractional deposition in different compartments of the human lung for both the cases of natural depletion of particle concentrations and ioniser-aided deposition. The lung deposition model LUDEP based on International Commission of Radiation Protection (ICRP-66) was used for the computations. This model was used by Schollnberser [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1420326X11424769">37</xref>] for a similar kind of estimation for smoke release due to forest fire. As per this model, the human lung is divided into five regions based on biological considerations and also taking into account the differences in respiratory functions, deposition and clearance. The five regions are:
<list list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Extra Thoracic region-1 (ET1) comprising of anterior nasal passage.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Extra Thoracic region-2 (ET2) comprising of posterior nasal passage, larynx, pharynx and mouth.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Bronchial Region (BB) consisting of Trachea and Bronchi from which deposited material could be cleared by ciliary action.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Bronchiolar Region (bb) consisting of the bronchioles and terminal bronchioles.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Alveolar Interstitial Region (AI), wherein the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between inhaled air and blood occurs.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The input parameters required for the LUDEP computer program are the Mass Median Aerodynamic Diameter (MMAD), Geometric Standard Deviation (GSD) of the size distribution, density of the particles and the breathing type (to be specified as mouth breathing or nose breathing). For the present study, the MMAD was estimated from the CMD by using the standard relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1420326X11424769">38</xref>].

<p>After about 20 min of operation of the ioniser, the percentage deposition in the lung slightly increased owing to an increase in the median diameter. However, this increase was greatly offset by the fact that the particle concentration in the room fell more rapidly in the presence of the ioniser so that as time progresses, the airborne particles available for deposition in the lungs would be greatly reduced.</p>

<p>For a comparative analysis, the particles deposited in the lung with and without the ioniser was normalised with respect to the value at <italic>t</italic> = 0 and plotted against time since start of the ioniser as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1420326X11424769">Figure 12</xref>. The fall in the number of particles that deposit in the lungs was much more pronounced with the operation of the ioniser. In the case of natural decay, after about 30 min of switching off the source of particles the lung deposition was reduced to 50% of its value at <italic>t</italic> = 0 while with the operation of the ioniser, this would be as low as 20%.

<sec id="sec14-1420326X11424769" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The study presented here systematically highlighted the effectiveness of the operation of ionisers in reducing particle concentrations in indoor environments. For a typical combustion source such as the mosquito repellent coils which are very often used in the Asian and African homes, the mean life time of the particles was found to reduce from 48 min for natural depletion of the particles to about 27 min for the ioniser-aided depletion. The effect of the ioniser is pronounced at about 40 nm wherein the CRF is about 15. However, the effectiveness gradually decreases to about 1.5 for particles of size 1000 nm.</p>
<p>The estimates of particle deposition in the lungs showed that significant reductions could be achieved with the operation of the ioniser. This presents a possibility of reducing the risks due to toxic particulate emissions from the fillers and binders used in mosquito coils without having a significant effect on the action of vapour phase insecticide components. In fact, to avoid the risk due to inhalation of the coil generated combustion aerosols, the liquid repellents or vaporisers could be safer options as their particle generating capabilities are minimised.</p></sec>
