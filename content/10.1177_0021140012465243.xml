<p>It is a delight to read a book that leads the reader into a careful study of a topic that is of great interest to a wide array of scholars, both inside and outside of liturgical studies. Neil Xavier O’Donoghue lectures at Redemptoris Mater Seminary in New Jersey, where he currently serves as Prefect of Studies. He has made available to a wider readership what was, in effect, his doctorate thesis from St Patrick’s College, Maynooth, under the supervision of Professor Liam Tracey. When his research required, he was able to avail himself of the expertise of Dr Colmán Etchingham (NUIM) in relation to matters outside of liturgical studies that touched upon early Irish studies. Unlike the majority of doctorate theses which, despite their valuable contribution to research, tend to supply pretty turgid reading, this reads extremely well, and carries the reader along without losing anything of the sharpness and scholarly care rightly expected of a serious piece of writing. This is an important piece of research. While individual studies on specific aspects of the topic have been carried out in recent decades, this is the first major work to analyse the Eucharist in pre-Norman Ireland since the late 19th century. That fact alone signals its importance.</p>
<p>O’Donoghue begins with a survey of the historical background to his topic, from the advent of Christianity to Ireland to the end of the pre-Norman era. The second part of this chapter surveys briefly the development of the Eucharist in the West until the 12th century (the cut-off point in this study). This is accomplished with a critical awareness of the current state of scholarship on the question, and he creates the necessary background for situating Irish Eucharistic and liturgical practices. Although he may not have wished to communicate this, his constant reference to the ‘Gallican rite,’ his acknowledgement that it was probably never celebrated in a ‘“pure” form’ (p. 43) and the attempt to offer an outline of the structure of the Eucharist (following Smyth), could give to the casual reader the false sense that such a ‘rite’ existed. While he does make more nuanced statements concerning this, his stance on the question might have been more clearly indicated. He occasionally, and, in my opinion, more correctly, refers to ‘Gallican liturgies’ thus reflecting the complexity of the small amount of material available in relation to Gallican sources. The research of Matthieu Smyth on Gallican liturgies (which includes a consideration of Irish material) acted as a guide for him here.</p>
<p>Leaving this small but important point aside, O’Donoghue sets the scene for his later affirmations concerning the Gallican nature of much of Irish liturgical practice, allowing at all times, as he does, for the prevalence of local (Irish) practices. In later chapters he presents an accurate and much more historically nuanced sense of the complex relationships of liturgical forms and texts in Christian Europe of the period which he treats. He correctly, I think, posits early Irish liturgical practice in that wider continental sweep of liturgical influences which variously filtered and expanded local mores, appropriating for itself that which was deemed to be pastorally useful. The ‘uniqueness’ of Irish sources can at times be more attributable to the sheer richness of references to liturgy therein, compared to what is found in other geographical regions of the era.</p>
<p>The second, and longest, chapter deals with written sources, firstly those of a strictly liturgical nature, followed by a study of other written material. Working from sources in Latin and early Irish, he surveys his material with a clear sense of the importance of the texts and is meticulous in how he deals with them, never attributing to the written evidence what these sources might not be able to bear. This is refreshing in a field of research (early Irish liturgical practices) which often has texts support reconstructions that owe more to a healthy imagination than scholarly exegesis of sources. So, in this regard his methodology is a model of a type of scholarship that ought to inform the study of early Irish liturgical sources. However, I do have a question. Can we assume that the <italic>Antiphonary of Bangor</italic> is itself Irish (p. 86) without examining the possibility that, while the majority of the texts it contains have Irish origins (and relate directly to the monastery at Bangor), the extant manuscript itself could have been written in Bobbio in the seventh century? If this were the case, the existence of texts not related to the Office or proven Irish origins might be explained and would need to be re-evaluated. Also to be noted: Michael Curran’s study, important as it is, is just a study and not a critical edition (p. 266, n. 99) as Curran relies on Warren’s edition of the manuscript (of 1893–95).</p>
<p>The third chapter examines extra-textual material, firstly architectural settings for the Eucharist, and then objects associated with the celebration of the Eucharist in pre-Norman Ireland (chalices, plates, wine, bread, chrismals, the <italic>flabella</italic>, High Cross iconography, and the illuminated art of the <italic>Book of Kells</italic>). The importance of this extra-textual material becomes evident as O’Donoghue examines each in turn, bringing to bear his admirable scholarly caution which allows him to arrive at carefully considered conclusions.</p>
<p>O’Donoghue never tries to artificially privilege early Irish liturgies. On the contrary, he lodges them within the broader continental tradition, especially those which are associated with Spain and Gaul, while isolating those elements of Eucharistic liturgical practice which are peculiar to Ireland. Thanks to his meticulous and forensic scholarly approach to a huge variety of sources (textual and otherwise), he refuses to allow unbridled speculation and yet succeeds in producing a sense of how the Eucharist was celebrated and understood in the pre-Norman period. He helps to debunk a few hard-held positions relating to the supposedly unique contribution of Irish practice to the wider Western church, such as Frederick Paxton’s proposal that Irish missionaries were basically responsible for spreading the practice of offering Mass for the dead (pp. 97–98). Unless sources permit otherwise, he prefers the nuanced statement to the bold declaration. He shows just how mainstream the Irish church of this era was, and how well the Irish contributed to a wider continental practice through the integration of practices or expressions which originated on the island.</p>
<p>This text does not aspire to produce a liturgical theology of the Eucharist of the period under discussion, but rather to lay out carefully whatever data can be posited with some degree of confidence, as well as offer a few cautiously framed propositions. It is another task for somebody to take O’Donoghue’s work and re-examine sources for a possible articulation of elements of a Eucharistic theology.</p>
<p>It will be a while before this study is surpassed in its scope and extent. The author admits that not everyone will accept all of his conclusions and invites others to engage with the material so that we can continue to plumb the depths of the evidence that is given by a paucity of sources (p. 202). Individual studies have been carried out over the recent decades, but have never been contextualized in the way that happens in this writing. And this is probably where the principal learning resides for the reader.</p>
<p>The book contains photographs, some taken by the author himself, of buildings and artefacts referred to in the second chapter (unfortunately reproduced in black and white). An Appendix supplies, in both the original early Irish and in English translation (based on Bartholomew MacCarthy’s 1886 version, which is still highly regarded), an Old Irish Tract on the Mass in its earlier Stowe Missal version, as well as that found in the 13th-century manuscript, the <italic>Leabhar Breac</italic>. There is an extensive bibliography. Missing from this are two relevant articles by Hugh Kennedy (early Irish Eucharistic Prayers), and Balthasar Fischer (<italic>Oratio periculosa</italic>) from the 2005 study, <italic>Prex Eucharistica</italic> vol. III. Although the masterful work by Richard Pfaff on the liturgy in medieval England is mentioned in the bibliography, its influence is missing from the body of the text. A short but functional index completes the publication.</p>
<p>This is an important book that should have been brought out by an Irish publisher. University of Notre Dame Press, reflecting the fact that this University is the third largest centre for Irish studies in the world, has once again performed a valuable service by making this text available to scholars. It will become a key text, not just for students of early Irish studies, or even pre-Norman insular Eucharistic theology and practice, but also to the wider network of scholars of early liturgical practices as well as for those engaging with medieval studies.</p>
