<p>New implants, techniques, and instrumentation for total ankle arthroplasty have made it possible to avoid the potential for increased adjacent hindfoot arthritis that can develop with ankle fusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712464355">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1071100712464355"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712464355"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712464355">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712464355">6</xref></sup> The anatomy of the ankle makes prosthesis insertion from an anterior approach logical, but visualization of posterior structures is very limited, placing these structures at risk during the procedure. Most surgeons are wary of the tibial artery and nerve medially, and most implant instrumentation systems help protect these structures with pins and the recommended direction of saw cuts. However, the flexor hallucis longus (FHL) tendon lies directly against the posterior medial edge of the talus and may be held there by a retinacular band. The saw cut of the talus places the tendon at risk in all implant systems currently in use in the United States.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 45-year-old woman who had previously undergone triple arthrodesis presented with persistent ankle symptoms for total ankle arthroplasty. This patient had limited ambulation and felt strongly about avoiding an ankle fusion. She had no signs of inflammatory arthropathy and had responded well to ankle injections in the past.</p>
<p>During surgery, careful inspection of the posterior ankle joint immediately after the bone cuts during Inbone II (Wright Medical, Memphis, TN) implantation revealed a complete laceration of the FHL tendon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1071100712464355">Figure 1</xref>). Care was taken to look for this injury because a previous patient complained of limited hallux flexion at her 8-week postoperative visit, and clinical examination suggested FHL insufficiency, which we assumed resulted from the total ankle implantation. A primary repair of the tendon was performed through a transarticular approach. The hallux was plantar flexed to improve visualization and allow for reapproximation. The space is tight, and grasping of the tendon with suture is difficult. The repair was secured using a 3-0 nonabsorbable suture in standard fashion, and the case progressed unremarkably. Care was taken in the postoperative period to limit dorsiflexion of the hallux while healing progressed. The patient followed standard recovery protocol of splint in neutral for 10 days, walker boot non-weight-bearing for the next month, and weight-bearing as tolerated in the boot for the next 2 to 3 weeks, followed by weaning out of the boot to an Aircast Airsport ankle brace (Aircast, Inc, Vista, CA) for another month. The patient had normal FHL function postoperatively.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Iatrogenic injury to the FHL tendon can occur during implantation of a total ankle prosthesis. Due to its anatomic location in a groove on the posterior aspect of the talus, the FHL is not easily protected during joint preparation using an anterior approach. Acknowledging that an injury can occur during ankle replacement with any system and performing routine evaluation of the tendon prior to prosthesis implantation will allow the surgeon to address the injury during the index procedure. This process may prevent further patient morbidity and, most important, should prevent reoperation. If a deficit from FHL injury is noted postoperatively, nonoperative treatment with supportive care is recommended. As is seen after FHL transfer procedures, a deficient FHL is usually asymptomatic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712464355">5</xref></sup> In the rare circumstance that the patient has persistent symptoms, first metatarsal interphalangeal joint fusion might be indicated. However, we do not recommend this routinely and emphasize that it should rarely be performed for this purpose.</p>
<p>Several factors may contribute to tendon injury during implantation. The Inbone procedure uses an external guide with a large foot plate and constrained saw cuts. The foot is placed in neutral position, which places the FHL in tension across the posterior ankle. This position is unavoidable because of the importance of creating a neutral talar cut. It may be possible to obtain the desired neutral talar cut while also protecting the FHL tendon by not completely finishing the talar cut through the guide and instead finishing the last 5% to 10% with an osteotome. Additionally, when using the Inbone external guide, the surgeon should confirm that the Achilles tendon rest is completely released to minimize any anteriorly directed force on the posterior ankle soft tissue envelope, which includes the FHL.</p>
<p>Patient size might also contribute to the complication. The current patient and the patient with limited hallux flexion after surgery were small females in whom a size 2 implant was used. The cutting guide for this size implant is small and highly constrained. The instrumentation may limit the surgeon’s normal tactile response while making saw cuts, which is already compromised by the sclerotic bone of the arthritic talar dome.</p>
<p>Assessing the normal resting tension of the FHL tendon when the foot is placed into the guide should assist in recognition of injury. After securing the hindfoot, the physician should assess tension on the first metatarsophalangeal joint and then secure the forefoot with elastic wrap. This locks the foot into position and may help plantar flex the metatarsophalangeal joint, reducing the tension on the FHL. After the cuts are made, prior to removal of the external guide, the physician should remove the wrap and confirm metatarsophalangeal joint position and tension. Increased dorsiflexion should lead to suspicion of FHL injury. When other ankle joint replacement instrumentation is used, plantar flexion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint during the talar cut should help to reduce FHL tension and may reduce risk of injury.</p>
<p>If FHL injury occurs, primary intraoperative repair is performed through the anterior incision with nonabsorbable suture before component implantation. The standard postoperative course is not substantially altered after repair. If tendon injury is suspected during postoperative rehabilitation, we recommend offering secondary reconstruction to the patient but favoring nonoperative treatment.</p>
<p>In summary, the FHL tendon is at risk of injury during joint preparation for total ankle replacement. Finishing the talar dome cut with an osteotome may help to avoid the injury, and close inspection during posterior capsular debridement allows for direct repair if needed.</p>
