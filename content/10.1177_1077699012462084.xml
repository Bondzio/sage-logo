<p>Two experienced scholars of the world of political media turn a classic journalism theory on its head with <italic>After Broadcast News</italic>. Most people assume that professional journalists are the legitimate source for political information, and that the role of “good” citizens is to watch, read, or listen to the news—and act accordingly.</p>
<p>But these authors show that this model is but one among several that have helped to explain American journalism. While it has valuable aspects, it also has very narrow notions of politically relevant information and the role of citizens. The new (and fast-changing) information environment, from the Internet to <italic>The Daily Show</italic>, makes these strengths and limitations all too clear.</p>
<p>The blurring of news and entertainment is one obvious failing, as the authors discuss as they wonder, “Is there a difference between Tina Fey and Katie Couric?” But there are more serious concerns than whether Stephen Colbert can or should run for president. The bottom line, report these authors: the rise of Web and video alternatives to traditional (“analog”) news media are changing public habits in following the political scene. Old media still play a part—look at AM radio-based talk programs, nearly all from the right-wing viewpoint—but it is the ready availability of “other” ways of following news that is so changing what people know (or think they know), and how they learn it. The book provides countless examples.</p>
<p>The authors, Bruce A. Williams, who teaches in the media studies program at the University of Virginia, and Michael X. Delli Carpini, dean of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, have worked over their argument for a number of years. Their chapters review the dissolving boundaries between news and entertainment, the rise and fall of broadcast (chiefly television) news, political power and relevance amidst the changing media environment, the Clinton scandal as an (aging) example of politics in the emerging new media age, coverage of the environment, and the coverage of 9/11 and its aftermath.</p>
<p>Their final chapter discusses the shaping of a new media regime, including how opinion and reporting are melding the formerly separate editorial and journalism processes in new ways. This important book also offers a very insightful assessment of why many despise the news media, and why they are looking elsewhere.</p>
