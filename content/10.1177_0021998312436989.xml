<p>The flexural properties of carbon/vinylester composites under free corrosion and varying degrees of cathodic polarization in seawater were investigated at three different temperatures. It was determined that both the flexural modulus and flexural strength decreased with the increase in cathodic polarization. Also, flexural properties were slightly higher at 40°C than at either 20°C or 60°C. Scanning electron micrographs showed that the polymer matrix was locally removed and some carbon fibers released from the specimens under cathodic potential.</p>

<p>Carbon fiber (CF) reinforced composites are being used as structural materials in many corrosive environments, e.g. seawater, due to their light weight, high specific strength, and corrosion resistant properties. Currently, cathodic protection is widely used on ocean vessels and metal structures. When in contact with a metal which is being cathodically protected, a CF composite may receive cathodic current which has degrading effects on the composite due to its conductive component (CF) and formation of high pH at the fiber cathode. Relatedly, structural interaction with metallic materials will result in galvanic couples because of the noble electrochemical character of CFs. In this case, anodic polarization of a metallic component in the couple may cause it to corrode, and the high pH associated with cathodic polarization at the fiber/matrix interface may also damage the polymer matrix resin and reduce mechanical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312436989">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998312436989">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Tucker and Brown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998312436989">4</xref></sup> reported that a carbon/vinyl ester (VE) composite exhibited blister formation when galvanically coupled to steel in seawater, and the galvanic corrosion process played a major role in the formation of blisters. Alias and Brown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312436989">1</xref></sup> studied damage to a carbon/VE composite in seawater and indicated that both blistering and dissolution occurred due to galvanic interactions resulting from seawater exposure. Sloan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312436989">2</xref></sup> reported degradation of a carbon/epoxy composite galvanically coupled to magnesium in seawater, and indicated that after 140 days, the apparent shear strength was reduced by approximately 30% due to localized attack of the matrix at the fiber/matrix interface compared to specimens exposed in seawater with no galvanic coupling. The most probable damage mechanism was nucleophilic attack by hydroxyl and perhydroxyl ions, which form as a result of the oxygen reduction reaction on carbon. Kootsookos and Mouritz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998312436989">5</xref></sup> compared durability properties of carbon/polyester and carbon/VE in seawater and pointed out that, with increasing amounts of water absorption, some chemical degradation occurred to VE-based composites, but to a much lesser extent than polyester matrix laminates. Kaushik et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998312436989">6</xref></sup> studied the degradation of carbon/VE composites in 3.5% NaCl by impedance spectroscopy and concluded that the VE dissolved initially at the CF interface and subsequently propagated to the external surface. Agrawal and Prasad<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998312436989">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998312436989">8</xref></sup> investigated the interlaminar mechanical properties of a carbon/epoxy composite in 3.5% NaCl solution and reported a 20% reduction in interlaminar shear strength and a corresponding increase in interlaminar fracture toughness after 96 h of cathodic exposure. These effects were primarily due to failure at the interface and to matrix degradation caused by cathodic electrochemical reactions.</p>
<p>Because of the high cost of epoxy resin, carbon/polyester and carbon/VE composites have been used in marine structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998312436989">5</xref></sup> However, information regarding long-term durability in seawater is incomplete, and there has been inadequate understanding of the interactions between these composite materials and cathodic protection applied to structures in seawater. Because VE has superior chemical stability in seawater, a carbon/VE composite was selected as the study material with the objective being to understand the effect of applied cathodic potentials, temperature, and immersion time upon marine exposure on flexural properties.</p>

<p>The material studied was a CF/VE composite. A VE resin (Derakane Momentum 411-350, Ashland Chemical Co.) containing 45 wt% styrene was used as the matrix. CFs (T700, F sizing, Toray) with a unidirectional architecture were used as reinforcement. The composite was fabricated at room temperature using the vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding process. The resulting plates were post-cured at 120°C for 2 h and then cut into 140 × 20 × 1 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998312436989">3</xref></sup> specimens for four-point bend testing. In the case of specimens that were to be cathodically polarized, electrical connection to the CF was made using a nickel print coating (GC Electronics #22-207) to connect a copper wire to a side of the composite with exposed fiber ends. After 24 h, an epoxy resin was used to seal the otherwise exposed electrical connection. Epoxy resin was also used to seal the other three edges of specimens and was allowed to cure for 24 h prior to immersion in slowly flowing, once-through seawater from the Atlantic Ocean. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312436989">Figure 1</xref> shows the specimen with electrical connections.

<p>Specimens were exposed to three different seawater tanks with the respective temperatures maintained at 20°C, 40°C, and 60°C under both freely corroding open-circuit potential (OCP) and cathodically polarized to either −0.60 or −1.20 <italic>V</italic><sub>SCE</sub> using a potentiostat for times up to 227 days.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998312436989">Figure 4</xref> shows the mean and range of flexural modulus for unpolarized specimens immersed in seawater at 20°C after three different immersion times. It can be seen that compared with the dry test data (immersion 0 day), the flexural modulus of specimen of 61 days of immersion showed no big difference, but as the immersion time increased, flexural modulus decreased. Specifically, from 61 to 129 days, the flexural modulus decreased by 80%, while from 129 to 227 days, the decrease was by an additional 6%. This relatively high loss of flexural properties during the initial exposure period is in agreement with other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998312436989">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998312436989">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998312436989">11</xref></sup> Specifically, Kootsookos and Mouritz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998312436989">5</xref></sup> reported that the flexural properties rapidly decreased with the increase in immersion time in seawater, such that when the composite became saturated, the flexural modulus was reduced to 30% of the original value. This is consistent with deterioration in the matrix and at the fiber/matrix interface. The effect of absorption on the resin matrix is primarily through hydrolysis and plasticization. Consequently, some low molecular weight VE from the matrix is released into the seawater with time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998312436989">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998312436989">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998312436989">13</xref></sup>

These data show that, after different immersion periods under cathodic polarization, the flexural moduli are all smaller than those at OCP. At the same polarization condition, the flexural modulus decreased with the increase in immersion time with the greater change occurring between the first two measurement times compared to the latter two. Kootstookos pointed out that the mass of carbon/VE composites rapidly increased when first immersed in seawater due to relatively fast moisture absorption, but when the material began to saturate, the mass gain was much slower.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998312436989">11</xref></sup> After a certain time, the composites were fully saturated, and the flexural properties of both OCP and cathodically polarized specimens did not decrease significantly. Because the rate of moisture uptake and ion diffusion into the matrix can be accelerated by polarization, flexural modulus and strength of cathodically polarized specimens can degrade to a greater extent than ones at OCP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998312436989">6</xref></sup>

<p>White deposits were present on cathodically polarized specimens after completion of the exposures; however, such deposits were modest for ones at OCP. Specimens polarized to −1.20 <italic>V</italic><sub>SCE</sub> had the largest amount of deposits. Analyses by energy dispersive spectroscopy showed the deposits to be predominantly comprised of Ca, O, Cl, and Na with a small amount of Mg. This is in agreement with the results of Sloan’s,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312436989">2</xref></sup> who reported greater amounts of deposits on galvanically coupled specimens, while very thin films formed on the specimens exposed at OCP.</p>
<p>Polished transverse cross-sections of specimens were examined by environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) subsequent to exposure, and photographs were taken from different regions with results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312436989">Figure 7</xref>. Thus, a view of an unpolarized specimen that was immersed in seawater for 30 days is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312436989">Figure 7(a)</xref>. Here, the fibers are straight and uniform, and the fiber/matrix interface is intact and without damage. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312436989">Figure 7(b)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312436989">c</xref>) are micrographs of a composite cross-section which was polarized to −1.20 <italic>V</italic><sub>SCE</sub> for 17 days.

Comparison with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312436989">Figure 7(a)</xref> indicates that cathodic polarization apparently caused enhanced damage to the graphite fiber/VE composite compared to what transpires at OCP.

<p>Applying a negative potential to the composite promotes cathodic reactions at the CF sites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312436989">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998312436989">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998312436989">15</xref></sup> Upon application of cathodic polarization, oxygen is reduced to form hydroxyl species at the fibers, and local areas of the elevated pH develop near the fiber/matrix interface. If the fiber sizing applied to enhance fiber/matrix bond strength is unstable in an alkaline environment, it could dissolve in a matter of hours. This, in turn, should lead to breakdown of the fiber/matrix bond. In addition, reduction of oxygen also produces peroxide and superoxide radical intermediates. These species adsorb to the fibers, interact with certain polymer bonds, and degrade the polymer nearest the interface, thus breaking down the fiber/matrix interface bond.</p>
<p>It is projected that localized matrix dissolution occurred first near the specimen surface, then with time progressed inward, which caused a reduction in the effective specimen width. This would explain the greater decrease in flexural properties of the polarized specimens compared to OCP ones. Also, at −1.20 <italic>V</italic><sub>SCE</sub> hydrogen production occurs rapidly and is not mass-transport limited, and this could further enhance the polymer dissolution rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312436989">1</xref></sup></p>

<p>A carbon/VE composites was exposed in seawater under free corrosion and cathodic polarization to either −0.60 or −1.20 V<sub>SCE</sub> at 20°C, 40°C, and 60°C for as long as 227 days. Flexural modulus decreased with increase in exposure time with most change occurring prior to 129 days. The decrease was greater the more negative the potential. Scanning electron microscopy revealed localized dissolution of the matrix phase which presumably caused the modulus reduction. Seawater temperature within the range investigated (20–60°C) had no significant influence on flexural properties.</p>
