<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Though the majority of leadership studies consider the context of the business enterprise or organizations in general, there is a substantial body of work on leadership in education some of which is specific to learning and teaching (L&amp;T) within the higher education (HE) sector. Leadership for learning in HE is the focus of this article. A major distinguishing feature between school-based educational leaders and HE academics is that for the former teaching is core and central to the whole institution and every activity must further that goal. In the case of the latter, teaching is only one of the university’s core businesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1741143211420617">Middlehurst, 1993</xref>) and only one of the ways in which scholarship is exercised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741143211420617">Boyer, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Teaching involves numerous stakeholders. Studies that have considered leaders in L&amp;T have tended to focus on two main leadership roles: head of department (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1741143211420617">Knight and Trowler, 2001</xref>) or department chair (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1741143211420617">Wolverton et al., 2005</xref>), particularly for providing a culture in which good teaching is valued and rewarded; and chief executive such as the vice chancellor (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741143211420617">Bargh et al., 2000</xref>) also for setting the vision and environment in which teaching improvements can occur. A predominance of studies concerning these two particular roles begs the question of whether leadership for learning can be said to exist outside of these formal roles and, if so, how can it be identified and nurtured for the benefit of all. Some studies have sought to understand leadership for learning from the wider academic perspective (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1741143211420617">Ramsden, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1741143211420617">Scott et al., 2008</xref>). Others (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1741143211420617">Lizzio et al., 2002</xref>) have considered how students’ perceptions of the learning environment impacted their learning. However, I could not find any studies in which students expressed their attitudes on L&amp;T leadership and how it may affect their learning. Consideration of the academic viewpoint within the literature is understandable as leaders for learning would be expected to be leaders of other teachers. However, it is also reasonable to consider whether leaders for learning are leaders of learners, that is, the students. When it comes to leadership for learning the viewpoint of the student has not been considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1741143211420617">Marshall et al., 2007</xref>). This study seeks to address this gap.</p>
<p>The key aim of the study is to define what leadership in learning constitutes from the student viewpoint. The student perspective is gained via an online survey containing questions based on the leadership and HE literature. The survey seeks to explore how student attitudes compare to those of academics concerning what defines a leader for learning and what competencies and capabilities are relevant for L&amp;T leaders. Given that only 2 of the 54 respondents did not agree that seeing their teacher as a leader improved their learning and increased their engagement, understanding leadership for learning from the student viewpoint is more than an academic exercise; it is a student-centred teaching strategy.</p>

<title>The Approach—Introducing and Testing the Theory</title>
<p>It is common in studies found in the HE leadership literature to use data gathering techniques such as interviews, focus groups and surveys. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses. Individual interviews are time-consuming and require considerable cost and effort to transcribe and analyse. Focus groups are even more difficult to coordinate due to time constraints of the participants. Both interviews and focus groups tend to produce qualitative data and while highly valuable for initial understanding of the cohort’s issues on which to base survey questions, this was not our goal. Given that a body of work existed on leadership for learning in HE this study seeks to determine how well the attitudes and experiences of academics and/or leaders in HE as expressed in the literature resonated with students, the followers you might say. To reach a larger number of potential subjects and provide an easily accessible means of participation, we chose to develop an online survey. Within our survey, we also sought to include an alternative and occasionally used approach (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741143211420617">Anderson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741143211420617">Aziz et al., 2005</xref>) asking participants to identify a ‘critical’ event that they considered to be something significant in their experience of L&amp;T leadership to-date.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as an exploratory study the survey seeks to compare student views of leadership for learning with what the general leadership literature has to say. For the purposes of this article to facilitate analysis, minimize randomization and self-selection bias, the data presented in the third section belongs to a coherent cohort of students, namely 54 Year 3 computing students engaged in a year-long, group-based project unit. While the unit undertaken by the students is not directly related to the analysis of the results, a description of the unit obtained via discussion with the convenor in charge is provided to enrich the context for the reader.</p>
<p>In the following subsections I first consider the importance of leadership in general and then within the HE context. A number of viewpoints and positions expressed in the literature are put forward. It is the goal to determine the extent to which the surveyed students agreed with these positions. Where a concept maps to a question in the survey it is given in brackets in the format (section<italic>n</italic>-Q<italic>n</italic>) indicating the section of the survey and the question number.</p></sec>

<title>Importance of Leadership for Higher Education and Learning</title>
<p>Leadership in organizations is viewed as so intrinsically fundamental that ‘the absence of leadership is often seen as the absence of organization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1741143211420617">Smircich and Morgan, 1982</xref>: 257). The role of leaders to frame, create reality and find meaning for individuals willing to follow highlights the dependency society has on the existence of leaders and motivates the emergence of formal leadership roles within organizations to strategically direct focus, guide interpretation and manage action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1741143211420617">Smircich and Morgan, 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>Universities must go beyond the facilitation of learning in their students via teaching, learning in their academics via research and learning in the wider community via outreach and service. They need to be <italic>learning organizations</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741143211420617">Argyris and Schoen, 1978</xref>) in which what is said and written as policy (<italic>espoused theory</italic>) is aligned with what is done and thought in practice (<italic>theory-in-action</italic>) through a process of <italic>double-loop learning.</italic> A process in which feedback mechanisms involving students, teachers and administrators are integral and are allowed to challenge the original goals and ways of thinking. Furthermore, universities must be learning communities working together with appropriate partners, such as industry, other HE institutions, schools and government. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1741143211420617">Senge (2000</xref>: 23) goes further to state ‘real learning gets at the heart of what it means to be human’; equating learning (doing what we could not do before and recreating ourselves) with hunger and the sex drive. How important then is the need for leaders to ensure that learning is taking place and to guide the learning process.</p>
<p>Changing environmental conditions are forcing many organizations to evolve from a traditional bureaucratic structure to a more organic network structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1741143211420617">Morgan, 1989</xref>) and adaptable organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1741143211420617">Miller, 1997</xref>) to gain the benefits of innovation and efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1741143211420617">Stace and Dunphy, 2001</xref>). The HE sector has been undergoing change since the 1960s owing to: massification of education (replacing previous elitism); information technology advances; significant growth in knowledge leading to greater diversification; and both internal and external changes in attitudes, values and culture related to academic work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741143211420617">Clark, 1996</xref>). Universities have been characterized as professional bureaucracies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741143211420617">Bolman and Deal, 1997</xref>) following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1741143211420617">Mintzberg’s (1979)</xref> organizational types. Perhaps a more precise representation would be <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1741143211420617">Morgan’s (1989)</xref> ‘Model 3: The bureaucracy with project teams and task forces’. As many universities are currently finding, to be effective there is a need for constant re-examination and realignment of strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1741143211420617">Stace and Dunphy, 2001</xref>). Leaders are needed to envision and enable these transitions.</p>
<p>The shift from viewing teaching as an interruption to research activity to the recognition of the importance of good teaching to the current focus on student-centred and flexible learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1741143211420617">Laurillard, 1995</xref>) (S2-Q27), together with a move from collegial to corporate style cultures and views of leadership in universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1741143211420617">McNay, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1741143211420617">Middlehurst 2004</xref>) have had major ramifications for academics. The corporatization of HE is reflected in the <italic>student as consumer</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1741143211420617">Scott et al., 2008</xref>) attitude in which students see the relationship with their teachers as being contractual rather than pedagogical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741143211420617">Blackmore and Sachs, 2007</xref>) (S2-Q20&amp;21). At the institutional level, teaching performance and student satisfaction have become important agenda items with impacts on the bottom line. As part of the changes in teaching foci, academics are being required not only to balance teaching and research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1741143211420617">Wasser, 1999</xref>) but to conduct research-driven or scholarly teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1741143211420617">Trigwell et al., 2000</xref>). In the survey I seek to ascertain how students view the research of their teachers as it influences their perception of teaching leadership (S2-Q3,10,11). </p>
<p>To the wider community, academics may be viewed as leaders at least within their field of research and leaders of their students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1741143211420617">Marshall et al., 2007</xref>) (S2-Q1&amp;2). Within the university environment, teaching leadership tends to be restricted to those in formal roles such as heads of department, directors of teaching or L&amp;T associate deans. Leadership in L&amp;T has also been considered in the contexts of contribution to curriculum development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1741143211420617">Knight and Trowler, 2001</xref>) (S2-Q25), teaching achievements (S2-Q23&amp;24) and positional power (for example, departmental director of teaching, heads of department, associate deans of learning and teaching, provost, vice chancellor and/or academic senate). Just as ‘the size of the effects that [school] principals indirectly contribute toward student learning, though statistically significant is also quite small’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741143211420617">Hallinger, 2005</xref>: 229), university students have little direct involvement with L&amp;T leaders in these HE roles. Thus, rather than look at students experiences with leadership in these roles we will explore more generally students’ concept of teaching leadership.</p>
<p>The role that ICT plays in teaching leadership is particularly uncertain (S2-Q26). On the one hand, ICT allows any adventurous academic to lead the way. In support of this view, the ISTE (http://www.iste.org/) National Educational Technology Standards (NETS•T) and Performance Indicators for Teachers considers leadership to be exhibited by ‘demonstrating a vision of technology infusion, participating in shared decision making and community building, and developing the leadership and technology skills of others’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741143211420617">Gourley (2007)</xref> sees that embracing ‘the global technology-fuelled society is a key strategy for surviving the “seismic shift in higher education”’. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741143211420617">Gould (2006)</xref> notes that ICT enables teaching to be done by ‘knowledge workers’ who tend to be sessional or adjunct staff rather than academics/professors, where the latter tend to lead the former. This change in the nature of teaching to one of facilitation outsourced to others could result in a return to an academic focus on research over teaching.</p>
<p>A number of studies have been conducted to understand leadership for learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741143211420617">Martin et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1741143211420617">Ramsden, 1998</xref>). In the Australian context two noteworthy studies include <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1741143211420617">Marshall et al. (2001)</xref> and an ACER study involving 513 academics active in various teaching related roles from 20 Australian universities by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1741143211420617">Scott et al. (2008)</xref>. The approaches used in these studies include surveys, focus groups and critical incidents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741143211420617">Burgum and Bridge, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1741143211420617">Tripp, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>The leadership study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1741143211420617">Marshall et al. (2001)</xref> is particularly interesting because it involved focus groups with two different cohorts: professors and senior lecturers. The senior lecturer cohort identified the following teaching-related leadership behaviours.<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Introducing students to the scholarship of academic work.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Coordinating a large course unit, building community among lecturers and tutors.</p>
</list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Additionally, but not specific to L&amp;T leadership they included:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>taking an active interest in people, giving advice and support to help them achieve their academic goals (S2-Q18);</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>leading by example—being effective in their work;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>being available (S2-Q19);</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>being generous with their time and expertise (S2-Q19).</p>
</list-item>
</list>It is interesting that this group could not clearly identify individuals who fitted this model and felt that the university did not provide a culture to support such leaders partly due to the individualistic culture and the lack of consideration of the role of leader.</p>
<p>Many studies consider leadership related issues facing the HE sector, HE leaders and academics such as the aging workforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741143211420617">Hugo, 2005</xref>) compounded by lack of succession planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741143211420617">Bradley, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1741143211420617">Marshall et al., 2007</xref>). But what about the student? If leadership is contingent upon willingness of at least some to be led, either through formal power structures or charismatic qualities of the leader, then the viewpoint of those following the leader should be relevant and inform what it means to be a leader and how to become such a person.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1741143211420617">
<title>Leadership Theory</title>
<p>Research to define and understand leadership has been ongoing since the 1920s. Over that time numerous theories have been proposed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741143211420617">Foster (1986)</xref> speaks in terms of generations of leadership theory models. Generation one involved identification of leadership traits that were found not to be generalizable; followed by a move to identify leadership behaviours and the use of two factors (consideration/relationship-orientation or task/goal-orientation), which blurred managerial and leadership activities and behaviours and ignored cultural and follower differences. Generation two included <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741143211420617">Fiedler’s (1967)</xref> contingency model and the use of the least-preferred coworker (LPC) method, which took into account member-leader relationships, task and position power and the Vroom/Yetton decision tree model that identified five decision-making styles each appropriate for certain types of decisions. Both approaches produced mixed-results due to shortcomings with self-reporting approaches and discrepancies between manager and subordinate observations. Foster identifies a third generation, which includes attribution theory, reinforcement theory, exchange theory and the multiple influence model of leadership which he also sees as theories more concerned with how organizations use management to get subordinates to carry out tasks rather than the notions of leadership and learning.</p>
<p>These generations of leadership theory are encompassed in a number of questions in the survey. The survey seeks to tease out whether students believe that leaders for learning have certain traits or personality factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741143211420617">House, 1988</xref>) (S2-Q6) and behaviours or styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1741143211420617">Schreisheim and Stogdill, 1975</xref>) (S2-Q7), specifically asking students to identify what those traits and behaviours might be. S2-Q8 was posed to determine whether the context seems to affect the attribution of leadership, in line with contingency theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741143211420617">Fiedler, 1967</xref>). Relevant to considerations of leadership is the debate led by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741143211420617">Kotter (1990)</xref> of management versus leadership. Management is often seen as planning and budgeting, organizing and staffing, controlling and problem solving; resulting in order and predictable outcomes. Leadership involves establishing direction, aligning people, motivating and inspiring; resulting in change and increased competitiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741143211420617">Kotter, 1990</xref>). The HE literature generally concludes that leadership and management are both essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1741143211420617">Middlehurst and Elton, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1741143211420617">Ramsden, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1741143211420617">Wolverton et al., 2005</xref>). Whether students agree with this is the goal of (S2-Q9).</p>
<p>The distinction between management and leadership is similar to the distinction between transactional versus transformational leadership, respectively. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741143211420617">Flanagan and Thompson (1993)</xref>, transformational leadership skills can be summarized as: creates vision, communicates meaning, inspires, empowers, takes risks, stirs (that is, breaks the status quo); while transactional management skills include: agrees objectives, communicates information, motivates, bargains, promotes security, stabilizes (that is, fair and consistent with existing arrangements). Transactional leadership tends to be equated with managerial tasks and activities. Transformational leadership occurs ‘when one or more persons engage with others in such a way that leaders and followers raise one another to higher levels of motivation and morality’ (Burns, 1978, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741143211420617">Flanagan and Thompson, 1993</xref>). Burns (1978) considers both leadership and management to be essential as leaders need sensitivity to the situation, defined as an ability to scan the organization, read job and understand self. In a university context where shared responsibility is the norm transactional leadership can be seen as fulfilling follower expectations and transformational leadership as reshaping follower expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1741143211420617">Middlehurst, 1993</xref>). Also related from the educational literature, is the notion of instructional leaders that arose to distinguish leaders who not only focused on administrative responsibilities but also on the effective instruction of students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1741143211420617">Robinson et al. (2008)</xref>, however, have observed that in the recent literature on educational leadership, instructional leadership and transactional leadership have begun to integrate. Rather than asking if L&amp;T leadership can be described as one or the other or both via agreement with statements in the survey, these distinctions have been largely left to emerge via some open-ended questions seeking to capture critical incidents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741143211420617">Burgum and Bridge, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1741143211420617">Tripp, 1993</xref>) of good leadership, bad leadership and a definition of leadership in section 3 of the survey.</p>
<p>Another important concept in the leadership literature is the notion of power. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741143211420617">House (1988)</xref> the use of power will be affected by one’s personality, specifically the need or motivation for power and control. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1741143211420617">Middlehurst (1993</xref>: 29) notes the connection between power, influence and authority where power holders are able to give orders and ensure they are enforced. Influence is weaker than power but can be exercised to persuade and bring about change. Authority is defined in terms of legitimacy. Social power may be based on traditional, rational-legal or charismatic authority and power itself can exist in the form of legitimate, reward, coercive, expert or referent power. In the HE environment, all academics are in a position to influence others. The extent to which they do so will be affected by the individual’s need for power, perspective of the target and the history with that target. Regarding power, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741143211420617">Bennis (2006)</xref> notes that in comparison to company CEOs, university leaders have little power but face the challenge of leading ‘extraordinarily talented, self-absorbed “abdicrats” who don’t want to lead—and don’t want to be led’. Only one question considers legitimate power by asking the role that title/rank plays in the perception of leadership status (S2-Q22). Theories relating to relationships with followers/members are not directly evaluated except perhaps via questions that seek to understand how students perceive the teacher-student relationship (S2-Q20&amp;21). Given the Australian context of the study in which according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1741143211420617">Wearing (1996</xref>: ix) gender differences in contemporary Australia are all pervasive and explicit ‘at all levels of society from individual perceptions [micro-level] to macrosocial structures [society as a whole]’, the ICT context which is significantly underrepresented by women and characterized as <italic>hegemonically masculine</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741143211420617">Faulkner, 2001</xref>), the HE context in which women are underrepresented in leadership roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1741143211420617">Martínez Alemán, 2000</xref>), and Australia’s highly multicultural society we were also interested to see if gender, age or language-background impacted student attitudes (S2-Q12–17).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>As an ultimate goal I am interested to know the relationship between perceiving your teacher as an L&amp;T leader and student learning. In the longer term, I would like to be able to demonstrate how recognized leaders for learning achieve better student learning outcomes. However, such a grand aim is beyond the scope of this study. As an initial study into the student perspective, the overarching research questions being explored are:<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>What is the perceived impact of being taught by leaders for learning?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>What makes a leader for learning from the student viewpoint?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How does the student viewpoint differ from the academic viewpoint?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How do the academic and student viewpoints align?</p>
</list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Question 1 is important because if seeing your teacher as a leader makes little or no difference, then answering the other questions is of minor interest. Question 2 allows us to consider what students expect from L&amp;T leaders, with the implication that HE teachers should strive to be such a person. Questions 3 and 4 allow us to build on existing research in this area from the academic viewpoint and also potentially suggest further research directions. For example, if we find that students have the same view of leadership as academics, then we can draw on the existing research on leadership for learning. If the views are different, then investigations need to be made to revise what is needed in a leader for learning and how to achieve and measure that.</p>
<p>As part of answering the research questions presented above, a number of questions have been formulated based on the existing HE and leadership literature. These questions have been grouped into a number of sections that explore these questions by (1) requiring levels of agreement with statements about leadership, (2) seeking examples of experiences of good or poor academic leadership for learning and (3) through comparison with previous reported responses from academics to a number of leadership capabilities and competencies. We next outline the sections of the survey, followed by a description of the participants involved in this study.</p>
<sec id="section6-1741143211420617">
<title>The Survey</title>
<p>The survey and study were approved by Macquarie University Human Ethics Committee and consisted of four sections as follows:<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>Section 1: gathered biographic details including gender, age, degree type (undergraduate, postgraduate coursework, postgraduate research), educational institution attended, main disciplinary background, languages other than English spoken at home and length of residence in Australia.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Section 2: contained Likert-scale responses to 27 statements about leadership based on the literature.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Section 3: sought to elicit a critical incident and leadership definitions as follows:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Try to think of a situation where you thought to yourself ‘this person is truly a leader in teaching’ and describe it in the box below.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>If you can think of an incident which demonstrates the failure to exhibit teaching leadership please describe that in the box below.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Please provide a definition of what you think a leader in teaching is.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Section 4: consisted of 54 Likert-scale competency and capability questions from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1741143211420617">Scott, Coates and Anderson (2008)</xref> survey instrument to allow comparison with the results of the 513 academics.</p>
</list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The motivation for the questions in section 2 of the survey have been provided in the second section of this article. Each question has been introduced within the previous section with the exception of (S2-Q4&amp;5) which aim to answer the first research question by seeking the level of agreement with the statements S2-Q4: ‘I learn better if I see my lecturer as a leader in teaching’ and S2-Q5 ‘I am more engaged if I see my lecturer as a leader in teaching’. These questions have not been asked or answered in the literature previously. The actual 27 questions can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741143211420617">Table 2</xref> next to their number. For the purpose of meaningful presentation and minimization of repetition the section 2 questions appear in order of level of agreement rather than numeric order.</p>
<p>The questions in section 3 are provided above. Note that we used the term <italic>Leader in Teaching</italic> in our questions to students because we did not think they would understand the concept of <italic>Leader for Learning</italic> but might interpret that to mean who in their class was a leading student. Despite the current focus on student-centred learning rather than teaching-centred teaching, students do not necessarily understand this focus and often expect teachers to deliver learning.</p>
<p>Section 4 of the survey can be found in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1741143211420617">Appendix A</xref>. The questions are grouped in the same order and categories as in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1741143211420617">Scott et al. (2008)</xref> and as used in our survey. For the purposes of reporting we have added shading and a legend (not provided to participants) which indicate the scales within each of the competencies and capabilities defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1741143211420617">Scott et al. (2008)</xref>. There are 13 <italic>personal capabilities</italic> questions covering three scales: decisiveness, self regulation and commitment. <italic>Interpersonal capabilities</italic> include 12 questions for the two scales: empathizing, and influencing. The 13 <italic>intellectual capabilities</italic> questions are divided into the three scales of diagnosis, strategy, and flexibility and responsiveness. Finally competencies concerning <italic>skills and knowledge</italic> are considered in 16 questions encompassing the three scales: learning and teaching, university operations, and self-organization skills.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>To reduce the randomness and variability in the population sample and to provide a coherent dataset for analysis leading to possible modification of the survey and further recruitment, the participants in the study reported in this article are a cohort of final year Computing students enrolled in a final year capstone project unit. Capstone units are aimed to tie together student’s previous learning and prepare them to enter the workforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741143211420617">Clear et al. 2001</xref>). Students are observed to have high interest and level of engagement with the unit.</p>
<p>The students were spread across 16 groups comprising 4 and 5 members. Approximately half of the respondents were involved in an industry project hosted by an external sponsor. The other half were involved in an internal project in which the unit convenor acted as the client. The industry students had been with the same team members all year and according to the unit design, most if not all team members had already had a (roughly equal) turn at the leadership role. The leadership role was restricted to one individual for the internal project students and chosen by the team at the start of the semester. The composition of internal teams were completely changed in semester 2 to optimize the opportunity to utilize the team skills they learnt in first semester. Both industry and internal teams underwent a two-hour team training session in week 3 of semester 1, which included consideration of the leadership role. All teams were required in their project plan to define the role of each team member and explicitly the responsibilities of the leader together with clear identification of how the team would manage communication, resources, risk and change.</p>
<p>The learning activities are built around a single project which becomes both the learning vehicle as well as the assessed outcome for the units. The teams take on the role of a software development team to design and build a computer-based solution for their industry or internal (hypothetical) client. The team activity involved gathering user requirements, developing models, choosing and implementing a solution from among the range of possible solutions that they have identified. At the end of the activity, the group is expected to deliver the final tested software product and all project documentation, which are marked. The groups were formed by the lecturer at the beginning of the semester based on their grade point average (GPA), gender distribution, time availability, personality type, planned time commitment and grade expectations.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>Only a subset of the data acquired and analysis performed is included in this article. Detailed comments from participants regarding their definitions of leadership and examples of poor leadership can be obtained from the author.

<sec id="section9-1741143211420617">
<title>Section 1—Biographical Data</title>
<p>As explained above, we invited a coherent cohort of Computing Department students at Macquarie University enrolled in a year-long, group-based project that forms the capstone unit for their respective degrees to participate in our study. The data was collected in week 10 of second semester 2009. Of the 85 students invited to participate, 54 responses were received. A summary of the demographics of the students can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741143211420617">Table 1</xref>. It is noted that while there is a gender imbalance, that imbalance is consistent with student and industry percentages in Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1741143211420617">Trauth et al., 2003</xref>). It can be seen that the class is multi-cultural reflecting Australian society as a whole and showing a predominance of Asian cultures in the ICT field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1741143211420617">Trauth et al., 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Section 2—Student Attitudes to Leadership Statements</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741143211420617">Table 2</xref> presents a summary ordered by the average score for each question. The question is provided in full in this table along with the result. Starting at the top, note the importance of seeing one’s teacher as a leader on student learning and engagement and the importance placed on flexible delivery. In agreement with the findings of the focus groups reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1741143211420617">Marshall et al. (2001)</xref>, being accessible and (less so) caring is important. In keeping with some key theories in the general leadership literature and the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741143211420617">Bensimon et al. (1989)</xref> for leadership in HE, being (viewed as) a leader was contingent on the situation and certain traits and behaviours are characteristic of leaders. In contrast to the general view of the community regarding academics as expressed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1741143211420617">Marshall et al. (2007)</xref>, all academics are not seen by their students as leaders. Despite the pressures on universities to be more like customer-focused businesses and the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741143211420617">Blackmore and Sachs, (2007)</xref>; students see they are in a pedagogical rather than a contractual relationship. While the HE literature generally concludes that management and leadership skills are both essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1741143211420617">Middlehurst and Elton, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1741143211420617">Ramsden, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1741143211420617">Wolverton et al., 2005</xref>), students do not see good management skills as essential for leaders. Furthermore, while universities are encouraging academics to obtain teaching qualifications and to pursue both increased research outputs and research-based learning, from the student’s viewpoint being recognized as a leader in research or even in teaching (via an award) are not major determinants of leadership in L&amp;T. </p>

Perhaps a little more surprising is the expectation for leaders to demonstrate willingness to learn themselves and to ‘follow through with opinion and accept others’. Ability to communicate was echoed in a number of responses going so far as to recommend the need for ‘engaging stage presence’.</p>

<title>Section 3—Critical Incident and Leadership Definition</title>
<p>The study attempted to capture a critical incident as an alternative method within the survey to identify views about leadership and leadership practices. Eliciting a critical incident following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1741143211420617">Tripp’s (1993)</xref> technique involves providing a consistent frame to the participants as a way to guide responses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741143211420617">Anderson et al. (2004)</xref> created such a frame by asking their participants to reflect on ‘The what?’ ‘So what?’ and ‘Now what?’ of their incident. Given the additional time and cognitive effort involved, only 31/54 students chose to provide some input in this section. While there were 11 specific responses (for example, ‘lecturer on leave mid semester as unit convenor’; ‘a situation where a lecturer had no idea about the non theory part’, ‘losing the class discipline and reduced to tears—getting personal towards students’, ‘a lecturer who came to fill in and covered so much information in a understandable manner’, ‘lecturer was disorganized in providing lecture notes’, and so forth) most comments lacked detail and were generic descriptions of trait and behavioural characteristics. Note that nine specific negative incidents were described in comparison to only two specific positive examples. Obviously negative experiences leave a stronger impression.</p>
<p>To identify the key ideas in the free text input, we used a qualitative text-analysis approach similar to thematic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741143211420617">Boyatzis, 1998</xref>) which uses <italic>recurrence</italic> (same thread of meaning), <italic>repetition</italic> (of keywords, phrases or sentences) and <italic>forcefulness</italic> (volume, inflection, emphatic language) to identify, analyse, describe and report patterns (themes) across qualitative data.</p>
<p>To compare the representativeness of this cohort with a more general population, we conducted the same textual analysis on another 16 students who had completed the survey by the time of this analysis from across the university. Given that these students had responded to a general, non-personalized invitation via their student email account, it is assumed that these students have greater interest in the issue of leadership for learning. Also their responses in section 3 show some evidence of awareness of the leadership literature (for example, notion of followership). Furthermore, they provided more detailed text input using 314 (average 19.6) words compared to 237 (average 7.6 words for the 31 respondents or 4.3 words for the full cohort of 54) words to describe leadership traits and behaviours. These students include 11 females, 5 males; 7 aged in their 20s, the rest were aged 31–52 (average age 42); 6 postgraduate, 10 undergraduates; enrolled in Management and Commerce (2), Society and Culture (1), Information Technology (2), Engineering and Technology (2), Education (4), Natural and Physical Sciences (2), Medicine/Health (1), Other (2), only 3 spoke another language (Urdu, Cantonese and Japanese), 9 were born in Australia and only 1 had lived in Australia less than 7 years. Their responses to questions in section 2 on traits and behaviours are available in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app3-1741143211420617">Appendix C</xref>.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1741143211420617">Table 5</xref> provides a comparative summary of the responses from the two cohorts to section 3, which seeks to gain a definition and example of leadership. While the <italic>Other</italic> cohort represents a wide range of backgrounds, it is interesting to note the strong similarities with the undergraduate Year 3 information technology cohort in their views regarding leadership for learning. In keeping with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741143211420617">Brungardt (1998)</xref> who notes that effective teachers use transactional and transformational approaches to learning, we see that while both cohorts use terms that would be associated with transactional leaders such as ‘organized’ far more of the terms are representative of transformational leaders such as ‘inspiring’, ‘passionate’ and ‘enthusiasm’. We see some evidence of students demonstrating a number of GenY tendencies as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1741143211420617">Nimon (2006)</xref>. For example, the expectation that L&amp;T leaders will ‘give’ them things, such as course notes (rather than taking responsibility for making their own notes) or that the lecture(r) will not be boring. However, it is interesting to note that being knowledgeable was still the most repeated theme.</p>

<title>Section 4—Comparison with Academic Viewpoint</title>
<p>The 148-page report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1741143211420617">Scott et al. (2008)</xref> did not include numerical data except in the form of summarized tables and graphs (for example, see their Table 19 and Figure 5 reproduced here <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1741143211420617">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1741143211420617">3</xref>, respectively). Thus to enable comparison, we have created a similar version of both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1741143211420617">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1741143211420617">4</xref>). To achieve this we needed to regroup the questions into the scales provided in the report, as shown in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1741143211420617">Appendix A</xref>. Furthermore, due to lack of data access, we were not able to perform comparative analysis involving ANOVA, correlation or rank testing. Comparing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1741143211420617">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1741143211420617">2</xref>, we can however see that 3 of the 5 personal capabilities in the top 10 for the academics matched with 3 of 4 personal capabilities in the top 8 for the students. One cognitive capability (making sense of and learning from experience) which was the top ranked leadership capability for the students matched with the nineth ranked capability for the academics. There was no overlap for interpersonal capabilities or skills and knowledge. </p>

<p>Grouping the individual items (that is, questions) into the scales used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1741143211420617">Scott et al. (2008)</xref>, we see in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1741143211420617">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1741143211420617">4</xref> that students and academics considered <italic>empathizing</italic> to be the most critical leadership skill. Empathy is one component of emotional intelligence, and additionally includes self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation and social skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741143211420617">Goleman, 1998</xref>). The importance of emotional intelligence for educational leadership has been supported in many studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741143211420617">Aziz et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741143211420617">Martin et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1741143211420617">Montez, 2003</xref>) and includes a leader’s personal and interpersonal capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1741143211420617">Scott et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In each category students and academics agreed on the most important leadership scale, namely <italic>self-organization skills, flexibility and responsiveness, empathizing </italic>and<italic> self regulation</italic>. Note that for the academics all scales, bar one, scored at least 4/5 for ‘important for effective performance’. Students were (slightly) more reserved in their responses, which is typical of novice behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741143211420617">Busch et al., 2008</xref>). It is interesting to contemplate why <italic>decisiveness</italic> was seen as less important by the students when <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741143211420617">Bryman (2007)</xref> found that decisiveness was an important aspect of academic leadership. I conjecture that students, particularly the young cohort surveyed, may be less decisive because they are generally less committed to study or the workplace as found in other studies involving Gen Ys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1741143211420617">Richards and Busch, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, they may not have had the experience or opportunity that permits them to make or take final and firm decisions. It is surprising that the <italic>learning and teaching</italic> scale was also perceived as less important, but perhaps the concept was too general as to lack clear meaning or so obvious that it was not seen as a distinguishing feature.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1741143211420617">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study has a number of limitations. As a survey the study is subject to biases such as self selection and social desirability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741143211420617">Fisher, 1993</xref>). As noted, females were grossly underrepresented in this study. However, the 9 per cent female representation is greater than the class representation of 6 per cent. The critical incident in section 3 was not guided using the framing technique and it did not, in general, yield detailed descriptions of specific leadership incidents. However, time is seen as the main factor affecting the lack of rich data since section 2 did provide the opportunity for participants to orient their thinking about leadership and their experiences prior to being asked to provide a critical incident and leadership definition.</p>
<p>For this study we have concentrated on a single cohort, with some comparison with another small cohort as described above to avoid the problem of randomness or skew in respondents. However, as a result the data and analysis has been restricted primarily to one cohort and thus it is difficult to generalize the findings to the general population of higher education students who may vary by demographic, discipline and degree type.</p>
<p>Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1741143211420617">Hunt (1991)</xref> notes the shortcomings of pen and paper tests, which also applies to paper- and online-based surveys, when it comes to measuring or defining leadership due to the cognitive complexity of leadership and the need for a multilevel model that ‘gets inside’ the leader’s head or in this case, inside the student’s head.</p>
<p>In spite of these limitations, this article provides a first and early study to determine the student view of leadership for learning by using a survey that is grounded in the existing HE and leadership literature and closely aligned to the recent and extensive study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1741143211420617">Scott et al. (2008)</xref>. Their study and instrument not only draws on the current body of educational and general leadership literature, it employs a framework that had been validated in a detailed study of 322 effective school leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1741143211420617">Scott, 2003</xref>) and in studies of successful early career graduates in nine professions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1741143211420617">Vescio, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to define leadership for learning from the student viewpoint and to see how it compared to the academic viewpoint. In answer to the first research question, we see that students believe that seeing their teacher as a leader has a positive impact on their learning. In answer to the second research question, in section 2 of the survey we have the open-ended responses regarding the traits and behaviours of leaders and in section 3 of the survey we have solicited examples of good and poor leadership and a definition of leadership. Addressing research questions 2, 3 and 4, we sought to gain the students’ agreement with the set of capabilities and competencies used in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1741143211420617">Scott et al. (2008)</xref> study with 513 Australian academics. Further comparison of the student view with the academic view, research questions 3 and 4, was also performed via analysis of the students’ responses to statements about leadership expressed in the HE and leadership literature in section 2.</p>
<p>In summary, section 2 of the survey identified some agreement and some disagreement and revealed the importance of flexible delivery and use of technology as a measure of leadership. In section 3 of the survey students saw teachers who are passionate, organized, knowledgeable and accessible as leaders for learning. The section 4 survey results found that self-organization skills and the interpersonal skill of empathizing were the most important leadership capabilities, followed by flexibility and self-regulation, in close alignment with the academic view. These attributes are commonly identified by academics as relevant for L&amp;T leaders and for leaders in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741143211420617">Debowski and Blake, 2004</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741143211420617">Debowski and Blake (2004)</xref> noted specific capabilities and competencies for L&amp;T leaders which showed a commitment to pedagogy and student learning including involvement in curriculum and course design and university structure and policy. In contrast to the responses from academics, student responses to section 4 indicated that factors relating to L&amp;T and university operations are less important for leadership from their perspective.</p>
<p>Clearly, the issue of leadership is important but we must not confuse it with the issue of organizational effectiveness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741143211420617">Bowers and Seashore (1966</xref>: 249) question the validity of ‘a commonly accepted theorem that leadership (if not a unitary characteristic, then a limited roster of closely related ones) is always salutary in its effect and that it always enhances effectiveness’. Students in this study have voiced a similar assumption—’L&amp;T leadership improves learning and engagement’. While numerous studies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1741143211420617">Prosser and Trigwell, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1741143211420617">Ramsden, 2003</xref>, for a summary) have shown that the learning and assessment context influences the learning approach chosen by a student which in turn impacts on their level of achievement of the learning outcomes, the role that leadership plays in learning in HE has been little studied. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1741143211420617">Ramsden et al. (2007)</xref> were more focused on the impact of leadership on teaching, rather than learning, in their study investigating how university teachers may adapt their teaching approach according to their own experience of academic leadership. The meta-study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1741143211420617">Robinson et al. (2008</xref>: 636) could find only 27 educational leadership studies that investigated the link between leadership research and student outcomes and concluded that to significantly improve student outcomes educational leaders should adopt an instructional leadership approach by ‘focus[ing] their relationships, their work, and their learning on the core business of teaching and learning’. In that spirit, the focal point of this study is on the student who is surely at the heart of that core business. As future work, it would be interesting to design and conduct a new study which tested if better learning outcomes were achieved if the teacher(s) were seen as leaders which might also look at the use of and relationship with learning, teaching and leadership styles.</p>
<p>Perhaps looking at the student view is not so different to looking at the academic view if we believe that ‘everyone is both a teacher and a learner at the same time’. The notion of leaders as learners and facilitators of other learners is a theme found in the educational literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1741143211420617">Ramsden, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1741143211420617">Scott, 2003</xref>). Increasingly, programs to assist learning about oneself in relation to others and training in emotional intelligence can be found in leadership frameworks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741143211420617">Drew, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1741143211420617">Montez, 2003</xref>). The need to manage change has been a key driver of such initiatives. Bowers and Seashore(1966: 247) , recognized long ago that ‘If a program of organizational learning and change is to be successful … leaders [need] to become deep-structure learners themselves’ willing to challenge and change the core foundations of their own behaviour. Isn’t this is what we want from our students? In line with invitational leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1741143211420617">Novak, 2005</xref>) that is founded on the assumptions of respect, trust, caring, optimism and intentionality to be inviting with oneself and others, leaders need to fundamentally understand and value those they wish to lead. Perhaps what this study reveals is that student-centred learning requires leadership and that to be a leader for learning you don’t need to be a hero but the type of teacher you would want to have if you were the student.</p>
