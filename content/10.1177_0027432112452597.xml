<abstract>
<p>Developmental dyslexia (DD) is more prevalent as an “umbrella” disorder than many educators realize. The music educator can play a particularly useful role in helping children in the general or choral classroom cope with DD, given the temporal nature of cognitive issues inherent in the disorder. The purposes of this article are to provide a brief overview of DD and to offer teaching strategies for music educators to assist students with DD in the music classroom. Melodic and rhythmic activities are described and suggested as ways to engage children with DD as part of inclusive general music classrooms.</p>

<p>A teacher with a little knowledge about dyslexia can make a positive difference in young people’s lives. Check out these strategies to start educating yourself and helping your students.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The International Dyslexia Association (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.interdys.org">www.interdys.org</ext-link>) suggests that 15 to 20 percent of the world’s population has some form of dyslexia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0027432112452597">1</xref></sup> The three main forms of dyslexia in children include developmental (the focus of this article), primary, and trauma dyslexia. While trauma and primary dyslexia are significant barriers that are caused by brain trauma and dysfunction to the cerebral cortex, respectively, developmental dyslexia (DD) is most often seen in inclusive classroom environments and is more likely overcome with proper treatment and educational accommodations. Subtypes of dyslexia are based on the function of the person, which means the dyslexia manifests itself aurally (phonological), via writing (dysgraphia), or in motor development (dyspraxia).</p>
<p>One common myth about dyslexia is that it is a specific disorder that results in reading English words right to left or <italic>solely</italic> as a temporary jumbling of letters in a word that leads to confusion. Dyslexia may also be misunderstood as a global delay in literacy skills, or it may be a “scapegoat” diagnosis for children who are seen as “less intelligent” than average. Educators need to be aware of such incorrect information in order to provide the least restrictive environment for all students. “Least restrictive environment” is part of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and means that all students with special needs should be educated with their peers to the greatest extent possible.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0027432112452597">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Music educators are in a unique position to be of great help to those students who exhibit dyslexic characteristics, because music is a unique sensory stimulus.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0027432112452597">3</xref></sup> Particular accommodations in music education classrooms and lesson plans could be very helpful to this population but may not be widely understood or used. There are several reasons music educators may feel unprepared or lack the knowledge to teach this group of students, although most students with DD are in inclusive classrooms for classes such as music, art, and physical education. College curricula may be limited in the amount of special education training included in an undergraduate program. Once graduated, music educators may not be involved or invited to attend in- services or conferences that address special needs or may choose to attend sessions that focus more on general classroom or music-specific issues. Some music educators might work with special educators or music therapists who can work with a particular student or group of students in or out of the music education classroom, thus sparing the music educator from having to work in isolation on how to accommodate students with DD.</p>
<p>Another issue for all professionals working with children with DD is difficulty parsing out practical implications from high-quality research and subsequent dissemination. Recent research about the relationship between music and DD may be confusing and seem inapplicable to music education, specifically.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0027432112452597">4</xref></sup> Furthermore, few articles specific to music and dyslexia refer to high-level meta-analyses or content analyses, which would help to better form consensus opinion on issues around DD. Katie Overy, a music cognition researcher at University of Edinburgh in Scotland, published two studies that indicate musical training can benefit children with dyslexia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0027432112452597">5</xref></sup> A year of vocal-based music lessons helped six-year-olds increase scores on phonologic and spelling tasks, and fifteen weeks of similar instruction aided eight-year-olds in rhythm copying, rapid auditory processing, phonological skills, and spelling.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0027432112452597">6</xref></sup> Furthermore, a team from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School suggested that improved pitch and rhythmic auditory processing “may be successful at remediating some of the behavioral and neural correlates of developmental dyslexia.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0027432112452597">7</xref></sup> Given these results, implications for music educators, while not spelled out, merit further consideration as to the importance of music education for children with DD.</p>
<p>Neither of the above articles found specific improvements from musical intervention on reading skills. One recent article by Jose Morais and colleagues attempted to discredit music therapy as a plausible intervention for reading skills.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0027432112452597">8</xref></sup> Music therapy and music education share the unique sensory stimulus of music, so one might wonder how therapy may not serve the child as well as musical instruction. However, the authors conflated music therapy with musical instruction. This conclusion might lead a music therapist or music educator confused as far as implications for helping children with DD in a variety of ways despite previous research that shows promising connections between music and dyslexic cognitive processing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0027432112452597">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>While efficacy of specific interventions using music to improve the lives of people with dyslexia are not yet confirmed by the research, it is clear that music educators will have many children with DD in the classroom and need to learn how to teach them with best practice. The purposes of this article are to better describe children with DD and offer teaching strategies for music educators to assist students with DD in the music classroom. Please note the use of person-first language throughout this article in describing disabilities and disorders, and try to practice this in your daily work. Also consider mentioning the disability in students’ Individual Education Program (IEP) meetings as opposed to in the classroom. The students, not their conditions, should be the focus.</p>

<title>Dyslexia, the “Hidden Disability”</title>
<p>Dyslexia has traditionally been an umbrella term for people who process cognitive information differently. Thomas Richard Miles pioneered the effort, especially in the 1960s and 1970s in the United Kingdom, to have administrators recognize DD as a disability that requires full special education accommodation. His work as a psychologist led to the founding of the journal <italic>Dyslexia</italic> and pinpointed several areas for screening children with learning difficulties.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0027432112452597">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>More recent neurobiological research has found several symptom areas to look for, depending on the age of the child.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0027432112452597">11</xref></sup> (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0027432112452597">Table 1</xref>.) Preschool-age children are not typically diagnosed with DD, but speech delays, language difficulties, and reverse (or “mirror”) writing can be early signs of DD. Elementary/primary school–age children may exhibit a longer list of more diverse symptoms, including sound and written/reading issues. Sound issues include difficulty differentiating sound parts in words, such as “yurgot” for yogurt, and matching words that rhyme by sound. Other evidence of DD may include difficulty reading and spelling, and general disorder of expressive communication skills, sometimes termed <italic>auditory processing disorder</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0027432112452597">12</xref></sup></p>

<p>Children with DD may also experience temporal processing disruption.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0027432112452597">13</xref></sup> This neural aberrancy may manifest itself in a variety of symptoms that can range from mild to severe and often include issues with single-word decoding, short-term memory, and motor skills and sometimes auditory and visual perception deficits. Nina Kraus and Bharath Chandrasekaran, researchers in communication and auditory processing, posit musical training/education and typical speech-language pathology treatment as side-by-side components to assist children to overcome any learning disabilities due to DD.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0027432112452597">14</xref></sup> People with musical training can better distinguish conversation from background noise (the confusion of the two is a particular symptom of DD). At the least, they suggest that music is a “value-added proposition” that links training of the neural mechanisms through listening and movement with an activity that provides enjoyment. DD is as much a language and timing issue as it is a visual issue, and likely even more. The disability manifests not only in students’ and adults’ language and reading skills but also in reading music symbols, which may be considered another kind of “language” that requires interpretation. This transference may be due to the abstract nature of music symbols along with the need for reading skills, such as tracking left to right. Another effect might be short-term memory difficulties, which could, for example, impair students’ abilities to memorize lyrics for a choral concert.</p>
<p>Gavin Reid refers to DD as the “hidden disability,” as it is not always recognized until children are put in a situation that requires literacy skills or processing certain kinds of information.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0027432112452597">15</xref></sup> In the book <italic>Dyslexia and Inclusion: Classroom Approaches for Assessment, Teaching, and Learning</italic>, Reid warns against educators prejudging a student’s behaviors as laziness instead of as a masked disability.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0027432112452597">16</xref></sup> Due to its concealed nature, DD may result in psychological symptoms, such as low self-esteem, high anxiety, and learned helplessness in the classroom. Educators need to be aware of each child’s abilities to ensure that children with DD are provided assistance from an early age, as early intervention will help our students be more successful.</p>

<title>Music Classroom Inclusion</title>
<sec id="section3-0027432112452597">
<title>Placement</title>
<p>Once a child has been diagnosed with or believed to have DD, there are several inclusive teaching strategies to help the individual experience more success within a music classroom. Understanding that the brain of a child with DD processes information differently allows educators to make modifications in both teaching and classroom arrangement. Since a child with DD may struggle with concentration, placement within a classroom should be planned carefully. Situate the student in the front of the class away from distractions, such as talkative students or classroom decorations. In a general music environment, place the child next to a strong and helpful singer. Through this minor adjustment, the musically strong child can assist his or her peer with musical activities, lyric memorization, classroom procedures, and instrument care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0027432112452597">
<title>Written Materials</title>
<p>When using printed music and/or lyrics, there are several steps you can take to ensure a higher level of success for all students without singling out those with DD. The following suggestions are offered with an elementary/middle school general music or chorus class in mind. First, make certain the text is clearly visible, and enlarge it for added legibility. Print the lyrics on light-colored pastel paper; black against white is more difficult to read due to glare. For added comprehension and readability, involve students in coloring lyric sheets by highlighting verses and refrains very lightly to maintain word legibility. Ask children to use the same colors for marking these things to avoid confusion—you might make this an inclusive part of preparing for a concert. After they have done the coloring, walk the students through the “road map” of the piece by following the colors. Subsequently, musical form can be discussed by applying the same colors in every piece and by locating patterns.</p>
<p>The recent addition of interactive whiteboards in many classrooms provides educators with a unique and exciting way to augment their lessons. Interactive or electronic whiteboards were first used in office settings, but are becoming more common in classrooms in the United States and United Kingdom.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0027432112452597">17</xref></sup> Reading music from the same visual source (and therefore combining correct aural and visual input) is a teaching technique to help all students focus their attention and understand the concept being presented. Music educators can rehearse left-to-right visual tracking with the lyrics or notes on the board to improve tracking behaviors or use musical programs that highlight the notes and verses as they occur within the music.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0027432112452597">18</xref></sup> Magnetic notes also make a good addition for teaching pitch relationships and contour. Using large versions of notes (with or without rhythm “flags,” depending on the objective of the lesson) can be used with an interactive whiteboard, with a regular (slate) chalkboard, or even on a floor for students to manipulate and physically move their bodies left to right to simulate reading in this manner. In other instances, the staff might be introduced as a series of colored steps, perhaps with milk crates or even in a stairwell, to mimic a verticality of thought. To better support learners with DD, introduce only one staff line and corresponding space at a time.</p>

<title>Multisensory Teaching</title>
<sec id="section6-0027432112452597">
<title>Rhythm and Rhythmic Dictation</title>
<p>Teaching rhythm to children can be very difficult, yet even more challenging to children who have DD, due to inherent temporal issues. However, through multisensory strategies, such concepts may be learned more easily. The first step is learning to feel the beat. Many children will naturally approximate the beat of a song, but if a child is having difficulty, try using pieces with a very strong beat, such as a march. You may also place a child next to children who already can demonstrate the beat on their lap or instrument. One useful strategy is to use poetry as spoken chant. Begin by having students use the rhythm of a popular poem or make one up using their group creativity. Have them clap the strong beats while you recite a poem in time and then out of time to have them feel the differences in the two versions. A more difficult adaptation for older children might include clapping the rhythm of the words with the group’s chanting and then out of time. Show them how a correct rhythm may still not sound right with differing tempi. This also reinforces terminology that is often confused (e.g., tempo, pulse, rhythm).</p>
<p>The following activity teaches note values and how they relate to the beat by addressing the needs of visual, aural, and kinesthetic learners. Although many music educators have used this type of a “chair game,” these tweaks have produced good results and are examples of using existing strategies that are not too complicated and do not single out students with DD but instead offer inclusive learning methods.</p>
<p>Begin with four chairs. Place them in a straight line, side by side, leaving a little space between each chair. Each chair represents one beat in a measure containing four beats. Draw the number <italic>4</italic> on the board followed by four horizontal lines. End the measure with a double-bar line. The <italic>4</italic> visually signifies the number of beats in the measure, while the four lines symbolize the four beats, as shown below:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>4 _ _ _ _ ‖</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Next, use the four <italic>large</italic> chairs, lined up side to side, as beats. Clap a four-beat rhythm behind the chairs, making certain to move your body behind each chair as the beat occurs. For instance, “one, two and three and four,” means one clap behind chairs one and four, and two eighth-note claps behind chairs two and three as you walk behind them in a given tempo. Count yourself off so they hear the tempo before your claps. Beginning with only quarter notes and eighth notes is sufficient. You might want to make a quick game between you and the class to ensure that most of the group understand the pattern of claps per chair. After clapping twice or more over the chairs alone, invite the children to join you. When the pattern is established, ask a child to tell how many sounds occurred behind the first chair. Once the correct answer is offered, have the child sit in the chair to physically represent the sound. If eighth notes were used, have two children share the chair (hence, the “large” chairs). After all chairs are filled, have all students clap the pattern again, noticing how each person signifies a sound. Then transfer the sounds onto a chalkboard or whiteboard with your choice of notation. Finally, clap the pattern again while moving your hand below the notes as they occur. By teaching rhythm using this method, all children are simultaneously taught visually, aurally, and kinesthetically.</p>

<sec id="section7-0027432112452597">
<title>Rhythmic and Melodic Ostinati</title>
<p>Assisting children with DD and their classmates can be done using multisensory instructional methods. If you have considered differentiated instruction within your classroom, adding these instructional methods might aid you in teaching your entire class. Differentiated instruction refers to using several methods of teaching within a curricular lesson or even a class period and may include considering levels of ability of the students in a particular classroom environment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0027432112452597">19</xref></sup> Students with DD may have trouble associating a sound as being “higher” or “lower” due to the abstract nature of this concept.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0027432112452597">20</xref></sup> One strategy that may help teach this vertical “feel” of pitch is to project the notes on an overhead or whiteboard. Have the children use their hands to follow the motion of the notes as you point and sing at the same time. The “higher” you climb on the staff, the higher your hand moves, and the higher your voice sings. Children learning to associate written notes and pitches with physical height on their body may help them “feel” the vertical distances of different notes easier. Once students are comfortable associating pitches with varying heights on their body, begin teaching the concept of notes on the staff. This is an example of emphasizing proprioception, which may be understood as a person’s sense of his or her body movements in space as they relate to a fixed point. This use of proprioception may be considered a third stimulus (in addition to auditory and visual) and can help overcome the physical barriers of children with DD.</p>
<p>When your students are ready to learn longer melodies and/or melodic ostinati, utilizing the same method may aid in their understanding as well. For instance, when teaching a melodic ostinato, start by notating the rhythm of the ostinato and clapping it. For the rest of this concept, consider “Hot Cross Buns” in the following example. Once the class has a solid rhythmic understanding of the ostinato, indicate pitches by placing the notes of the rhythm at different heights on the board. Assign each pitch to a different part on their body according to the written pitches. Then have the children tap the correct area on their body, in rhythm, while singing the name of the associated body part. For example, if your ostinato consists of the notes G, A, and B, every time they sing a B, have them pat their head and sing the word <italic>head</italic>; for an A, tap their arms and sing <italic>arm</italic>; and for a G, touch their lap. Informal, real-time assessment of the group as a whole is critical to using this technique. Educators must develop a feel for ensuring a “rhythmic consensus” with few or no students who need a few more repetitions until accuracy. Using physical motions helps us assess this. Next, practice the ostinato along with the accompanying music (without pitches). In following lessons, place the notes on different levels and model singing the correct pitches, singing the corresponding body part and moving your hands either higher or lower on your body (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0027432112452597">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig1-0027432112452597" position="float">

<caption><p>Example using “Hot Cross Buns”</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0027432112452597-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0027432112452597">Figure 1</xref> would be read aloud as “head, arm, lap” | “head, arm, lap” | “lap, lap, lap, lap, arm, arm, arm, arm” | “head, arm, lap” ‖. Next, add (or swap, depending on your assessment of how the group is responding to this method) the note name to the appropriate rhythmic designation.</p>
<p>Again (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0027432112452597">Figure 2</xref>), speaking the rhythm with notes instead of rhythmic designations would sound like “B, A, G” | “B, A, G” | “G, G, G, G, A, A, A, A” | “B, A, G” ‖. Staff lines may be added after this step is practiced. Finally, transfer to available instruments in your classroom, such as the glockenspiel or keyboard. This final step is key to ensuring carryover from the abstract concepts to the concrete performance aspect of the lesson.</p>

</fig>
<p>While it might seem like a lot of layers of information to put to children, this breakdown of tasks might help them analyze the cognitive tasks before them in a more structured way. Even if the child does not fully understand one layer, it is likely that success at a later step will clarify the concept as a whole by the end. Specifically, we have found this method to be helpful with students with a variety of abilities, including DD, Down syndrome, and hearing and vision loss. Using this process will likely help all students feel the verticality of the notes, experience the rhythm in their hands, improve their motor skills, add to their understanding of the music, and allow you to create smoother transitions to pitched instruments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0027432112452597">
<title>Color Staff</title>
<p>Since children with DD tend to have difficulties tracking from left to right without their gaze shifting, music educator Margaret Hubicki created the <italic>color staff</italic>, which includes a method and materials.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0027432112452597">21</xref></sup> Her goal through using the color staff was to help people read music by connecting a color to each space or line of the grand staff. Hubicki’s concept is based on a student seeing where a sound “belongs” and feeling the location of the note by using movable symbols and raised staff printing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0027432112452597">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>For educators who may not have Hubicki’s color staff, there are alternative ways to use her idea. For example, begin with the five-line staff or a piece of music and color the spaces using various crayons. Ask the students to color very lightly and use the same color on each space to avoid confusion. When presenting a melodic line on the treble clef, four colors are sufficient if the melody does not use ledger lines. Modifications can be made to include ledger lines when needed.</p>
<p>Another approach to helping children remember letter names for notes, besides using the mnemonic device “every good boy does fine,” is based on using the color staff. For instance, have children begin coloring the staff by starting on first space, F, using green. Then in succession, instruct students to work their way up the staff using red, blue, and, finally, yellow on the top space. One of the authors created this mnemonic device with her students for each color or note as follows: F symbolized “field” green; G stands for the “Grinch” who stole Christmas, as G touches both green and red; A is “apple” red; B can be “beautiful” America, as it touches red and blue; C may be phonetic for “sea” blue; and so on. Use your imagination, and remember to involve your class in the process as it sparks enthusiasm, ownership, class discussion, and retention.</p>

<p>All students can use this method of coloring the music staff until all lines and spaces have been mastered. On the other hand, once children understand the lines and spaces well enough, they may discontinue coloring their music and/or begin subtracting the colors slowly, called fading. As their teacher, you may also choose to remove the colors for your students when you feel they are ready; just remember that students with DD may always prefer to color their music.</p>

<title>Finding Success</title>
<p>To make the greatest use of our time assisting children diagnosed with DD, it is essential to understand the condition and methods that may help these students find success. As music educators, gaining more understanding and knowledge of DD can assist us in providing differentiated instruction in our classrooms. In some ways, differentiated instruction might be compared to the therapeutic approach of a music therapist or audiology/speech professional. Both take a very individualized approach to instruction, but in different physical environments with different professional-to-student ratios. The necessity of gaining additional adaptive teaching skills and a greater familiarity with DD is essential due to the high prevalence and nature of the condition. Moreover, using alternative music teaching strategies may not only help students with DD understand and enjoy music but also provide all children with a comprehensive music education. Additional awareness, education, and effective lesson plans may be the key that opens the door for improved creativity, musicality, and literacy in children with developmental dyslexia.</p>
