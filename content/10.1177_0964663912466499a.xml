<p>It is both surprising to me that it is 14 years since the first of the <italic>Feminist Perspectives</italic> on the law school curriculum was published and that it is only now that we see a volume on tort. Given the focus of tort law on duty and responsibility, its centrality to a common law education, and the significant body of explicitly feminist scholarship in the field, tort law would seem to lend itself to an intervention. In any event, the publication of this volume is a welcome addition to a subject that remains too often dominated by academics wedded either to a corrective justice model or to economic analysis. One of the challenges for the editors has been to impose some conceptual unity on what is inevitably a wide ranging set of contributions. In this regard, they have sensibly described the chapters as operating on three levels: ensuring fair treatment within the tort system, altering the system, and opening up wider conceptual debates. This strikes me as a reasonable way of characterising what is a uniformly high quality collection of 10 original essays.</p>
<p>With respect to fair treatment within the system, some of the contributors embark on a broadly reformist agenda, pointing out how tort law has failed to live up to its own internal promise, because of its inability (or unwillingness) to recognise gender implications. In this regard, two essays provide a very interesting ‘update’ on earlier feminist analysis. Reg Graycar, a long-standing feminist critic of the judicial determination of damages in personal injuries cases, returns to the issue, underscoring how assessment of damages continues to disadvantage women. She points to three issues – measuring lost earning capacity, valuation of loss of capacity to work in the home, and damages for cost of care – and powerfully demonstrates how the judiciary (as well as legislatures) systematically rely on stereotypes and gendered assumptions in undervaluing women’s labour. The other ‘update’ is provided by José Miola who returns to a contribution by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0964663912466499a">Sally Sheldon (1998</xref>) in the first volume of the series, in which she provided a highly critical interpretation of the application of the <italic>Bolam </italic>test in medical negligence (<italic>Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee </italic>[1957] 1 WLR 582). The test’s highly deferential approach to medical practices was modified by <italic>Bolitho</italic>, in which the House of Lords recognised that medical evidence was open to judicial challenge on the grounds of reasonableness (<italic>Bolitho v City and Hackney Health Authority </italic>[1998] AC 232). Miola asks how much has changed as a result, and he finds that Sheldon’s feminist critique remains relevant today. He suggests that one of the problems is that the determination of the standard of care remains a subjective one – only now it is determined by the trial judge’s notion of reasonableness. Although I am sympathetic to this critique of objectivity, I was left wondering what the solution might be in the determination of the standard of care. The contributions of Graycar and Miola show that while we can find moments in which to be optimistic in assessing developments in tort jurisprudence, much of the critique originally made some years ago remains highly pertinent. In turn, this raises a broader question about the efficacy of feminist legal theory in law reform.</p>
<p>The second aim concerns alteration to the system of torts in recognition of the gender-related adverse impact. Several chapters pursue this objective. Kirsty Horsey argues in favour of abolishing the immunity of the police from negligence claims in the United Kingdom. She demonstrates that police immunity ‘has negative practical implications on society as a whole as well as for already vulnerable or disadvantaged individuals or groups’ (p. 81). In particular, Horsey persuasively shows how many of the cases concerning police immunity can be connected to assumptions held by the police centring upon the race, gender and sexuality of the victim. Potential liability could help to alter those attitudes and change police practices. Patricia Peppin’s chapter is on product liability actions and women’s health. She demonstrates how the rules on clinical trials have led to a ‘knowledge gap’ concerning the impact on women (p. 114) and have hindered the patient’s right to make informed decisions. This is combined with the role of pharmaceutical advertising and promotion in undermining warnings and medicalising conditions, which again has a disproportionate impact on women patients. By contrast, one field in which tort law has shown some strategic usefulness for women concerns the trespass to the person torts in relation to rape. Nikki Godden demonstrates that, in this area, tort law has offered some potential (possibly when criminal law has failed) to provide redress for rape survivors. There are distinct reasons why tort law can be advantageous, namely, that the claimant need not prove that the defendant held no belief in consent and the lower standard of proof (although some civil courts do seem to raise it somewhat in civil rape cases). Despite the use of prior sexual history evidence, claimants have had some success in utilising the tort of battery.</p>
<p>One theme that runs through several contributions is the way in which ‘harm’ is constructed in tort law and the gender implications that flow from this. Dayna Nadine Scott provides a fascinating analysis of the impact of petrochemical pollution on the Aamjiwnaang First Nation in Canada, which has resulted in endocrine disruption leading to a ‘skewed sex ratio’ in children born in the community (p. 61). Tort law’s conception of ‘harm’ and ‘injury’ do not readily apply to what seems an obvious case in which damage has been caused. This is because the individualised character of tort fails to capture ‘the collective loss of a viable future’ (p. 55) and the political and historical context that has rendered First Nations particularly vulnerable. Elizabeth Adjin-Tettey also looks at tort law’s understanding of ‘harm’, but in the context of sexual wrongdoing. Because ‘compensation for intangible losses do not easily fit within the corrective justice justification of tort liability’ (p. 183), many claimants who have suffered sexual wrongdoing do not obtain adequate compensation for losses that are categorised as ‘intangible’. Adjin-Tettey skilfully connects this insight to her broader claim that this reveals something about the ideological basis of tort law, which privileges tangible and public injuries, and marginalises and mistrusts what it characterises as intangible and subjective. She advocates a ‘non-commodified approach to compensation for intangible injuries’ (p. 189) in order to ‘vindicate the victim’s dignity and personal autonomy’ (p. 187). Although I have much sympathy with that goal, I am sceptical whether tort law – as we understand it – is <italic>capable</italic> of advancing a non-commodified approach to damages. Finally, Nicky Priaulx stands back and takes a broader view of tort damages and asks the fundamental question of ‘the extent to which the law of negligence <italic>should </italic>expand to accommodate our human experience of personal harm and injury’ (p. 36). Priaulx’s chapter focuses on the assumed distinction between physical and psychiatric harms. She asks important questions about the social impact of categorising events as causing ‘damage’ and forces us to think about why we assume that physical injuries are particularly harmful as opposed to psychiatric damage. As Priaulx astutely notes, ‘the manner and extent to which events prove harmful to us depend upon the biographical detail of our individual lives’ (p. 51). Of course, how the law of negligence could act upon that observation in assessing harm and damage is a question that remains difficult to answer.</p>
<p>The chapters also, in various ways, open up debates about fundamental aspects of tort law theory. In particular, the chapters by Jenny Steele and Janice Richardson are the highlights in this regard. The focus of Richardson’s analysis is ‘sexual disclosure cases’ that raise privacy issues. In quite an optimistic contribution, Richardson explores how the courts – unlike liberal legal theorists – have proven ready to advance a more nuanced conception of autonomy as the basis for the violation of privacy rights. Some courts, for example, have ‘moved beyond the traditional image of an atomistic individual . . . to considering us as embedded in relationships, which can themselves be harmed’ by invasions of privacy (p. 153). Richardson recognises the complexity of the issue for feminists, as she questions the claims made by (a few) women that sexual relationships can be understood as property belonging to them, which can be sold to the press. But I think Richardson herself would recognise that the gender politics of the ‘super-injunction’ are multi-faceted, as we witness wealthy and privileged men trying to silence women’s voices.</p>
<p>Finally, Jenny Steele takes us right to the fundamentals of negligence law and the duty of care. Steele’s chapter is a highly significant contribution to tort law theory, in which she argues that despite the language of responsibility and care in the duty inquiry, ‘the <italic>Donoghue </italic>instantiation of the neighbour principle is not relational in a contextual sense, but seeks to be definitive of rights and duties arising between parties conceived of essentially as strangers’ (p. 22). This has led to highly individualistic rhetoric in the modern law of negligence, which restricts the duty of care. Steele’s analysis forces us to recognise the limitations of negligence law and provides an important cautionary tale for those – myself included – who remain of the view that there is potential in negligence for a shift away from abstract rights towards a more contextual approach.</p>
<p>In sum, this is a diverse and original as well as uniformly well-written collection. The international scope – with contributions from the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada – is to be welcomed (although, like most collections, the geography remains limited). However, this also requires some caution on the part of the reader, given that tort law has evolved in some quite divergent directions across the common law world, making comparisons sometimes tricky. In addition, the collection embraces both moments of optimism and pessimism concerning the extent to which tort law is capable of reform. Finally, the authors demonstrate awareness that tort may well not be the arena in which the issues raised can best be solved, and the inadequacies (as well as the potential) of tort law remain firmly in view throughout.</p>
