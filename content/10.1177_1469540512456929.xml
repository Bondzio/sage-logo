<abstract>
<p>This article analyses correspondence and legal documents pertaining to William Donahey’s efforts to merchandize his <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> comic strip in the 1920s, with particular emphasis on Donahey’s negotiations with toy distributor Geo. Borgfeldt &amp; Company. I argue that neither the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic>’ value as intellectual property, nor Donahey’s creative authority as licensor nor Borgfeldt’s as licensee preceded the negotiations between these two parties, but rather, that they were created through the tactical discursive exchange of what John Caldwell labels ‘trade stories’ designed to establish each party’s ‘career capital’. These trade stories were, in turn, inspired by the particular socio-historical and industrial contexts in which they were told; in this case the post-First World War pre-Depression era children’s market and its construction of an imaginary child consumer. Moreover, I argue that the interactions between Donahey and Borgfeldt reveal how the concept of ‘goodwill’ was understood and given meaning through discourse in an era prior to the codification of secondary meaning into trademark law. Early debates over what constituted ‘goodwill’ would have profound effects on Donahey’s authority over the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> as a brand as well as on how managerial stewardship would come to be understood as essential to establishing and maintaining brand equity. Rather than view correspondence between Donahey and Borgfeldt as evidencing particular industrial norms, I argue that it reveals as much about the uncertainties of extending character brands as it does about the tenuous positions held by both licensor and licensee at an historical moment where the value of intellectual property – and, more precisely, who was responsible for ensuring that value – was in flux.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1469540512456929" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>On 28 January 1921, in the midst of negotiating a merchandizing license for toys based on his popular <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> newspaper cartoon with Geo. Borgfeldt &amp; Company, William Donahey requested that in addition to the 5 percent royalty he had already been promised on all net profits the licensee earned, the toy distributor also pay an advance sum for the exclusive rights to use the property, explaining ‘with the particular subject that has originated with me and the status which the same has now attained in the popular mind, there is something more passing to you than the mere right to manufacture, sell and distribute the particular lines of commodities which you have in mind. I refer to what might be considered a certain <italic>good will</italic> attached to this subject of the Teenie Weenie characters as well as the term itself’ (Box 1: Folder 2; emphasis added).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1469540512456929">1</xref></sup> In other words, Donahey reasoned that since Borgfeldt would benefit by associating its toy lines with the positive reputation already established by the cartoon with would-be consumers, the right to exploit that ‘goodwill’ could be assigned a dollar value separate from the right to use the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> logo and character likenesses on various products. Borgfeldt saw it differently.</p>
<p>Though the cartoonist and toy distributor had been in nearly daily contact leading up to Donahey’s request, Borgfeldt not only took six weeks to respond, but when it did, Assistant Treasurer Geo. Pfeiffer bluntly dismissed Donahey’s notion that ‘goodwill’ could be assigned compensatory value, stating, ‘we would not, under any circumstances … pay any general flat consideration in advance or otherwise for the mere right to use Teenie Weenies, or their presumptive value and any goodwill connected therewith. The only reason they interest us at all, as a commercial proposition, is the fact that they have some publicity, on the strength of which we hope, with hard work, to get some business’ (11 March 1921; Box 1: Folder 2). While Pfeiffer admitted that the cartoon’s existing popularity was attractive, he essentially reframed the concept of ‘goodwill’ as derived from Borgfeldt’s labor in producing and distributing quality merchandise bearing the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> name, not from the property’s established reputation. Since Borgfeldt would be doing all the work in extending the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> beyond the newspaper page – a misnomer, as Donahey was expected to do all the design work gratis as part of the arrangement – Pfeiffer reasoned that it was really the licensee who was helping Donahey by associating the property with established product lines already popular with children.</p>
<p>The exchange I’ve just recounted is indicative of how uncertainties amongst licensors and licensees in the early part of the 20th century over the value of character brands – and perhaps more importantly, who was responsible for ensuring consumer goodwill for merchandise based on these properties – influenced negotiations over the transformation of intellectual property (IP) into cultural commodities and raised questions about whose creative authority ultimately warranted an investment of monetary and cultural capital. Donahey’s struggles point to the significant – and often unsuccessful – discursive labor that went into cultivating investment amongst potential clients in the supposed value-added possessed by entertainment-based character licenses and the struggles IP owners had in asserting creative authority over licensees at a historical juncture prior to ‘the brand’ eclipsing ‘the product’ as the ultimate source of value. Indeed, correspondence between Donahey and Pfeiffer almost suggests an inversion of contemporary dynamics between IP owners and clients when it comes to establishing authority over and value in cultural commodities. Borgfeldt treated Donahey as an ‘artist-client’ – a literal designation the company included in all of its contracts – rather than submitting to the now taken-for-granted notion that licensees should be beholden to the creative and economic stipulations of IP owners.</p>
<p>My goal, however, is not to suggest that somehow the world of the 1920s was topsy-turvy. Rather, Michel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1469540512456929">Foucault (1972)</xref> reminds us that discontinued practices open up counter-historical possibilities that reveal points of historical rupture rather than natural progression. In recognizing a reversal of roles between Donahey and Borgfeldt, my hope is to denaturalize assumptions about how IP accrues value and where the locus of authority resides by pointing to alternate configurations that were equally plausible.</p>
<p>The exchange between Donahey and Pfeiffer reveals the tentative and tactical discursive processes through which the occupational purviews and functions of licensors and licensees were defined and refined, promulgated and challenged during the first two decades of the 20th century. Much as Carolyn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1469540512456929">Marvin (1990)</xref> and Lisa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1469540512456929">Gitelman (2006)</xref> have argued that all technologies were not only once new, but also that their dominant meanings and usages crystallized only through discursive struggles amongst various actors vying for definitional power, I posit that job categories do not simply get created, but rather, that occupational purviews and functions are negotiated in relation to the material conditions of their practice. Similarly, Paul <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1469540512456929">Du Gay and Michael Pryke (2002</xref>: 8) assert that ‘techniques of “economic management” do not come ready-made. They have to be invented, stabilized, refined and reproduced.’ In other words, I argue that discursive exchanges such as the ones between Donahey and Pfeiffer not only produced a particular set of understandings about the value of IP in the 1920s, but they also served as means of ‘cultural sense-making and self-ethnography’ through which licensors and licensees struggled to assert and define their occupational purviews and identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1469540512456929">Caldwell, 2009</xref>: 201).</p>
<p>Ultimately, I argue that neither the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic>’ value as IP, nor Donahey’s creative authority as licensor nor Borgfeldt’s as licensee preceded the negotiations between these two parties, but rather, that they were established through the tactical discursive exchange of what John <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1469540512456929">Caldwell (2008)</xref> labels ‘trade stories’ designed to establish each party’s ‘career capital’. These trade stories were, in turn, inspired by the particular socio-historical and industrial contexts in which they were told; in this case the post-First World War pre-Depression era children’s market and its construction of an imaginary child consumer. These trade stories provided the fodder through which industry lore about what sort of children’s culture ought to be produced and how best to monetize it were established and also whose vision for generating cultural commodities ought to be adhered to. Whereas historians of consumer culture have repeatedly focused on how the social construction of the imaginary child consumer has shaped particular marketing and production practices (and vice versa) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1469540512456929">Kline, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1469540512456929">Seiter, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1469540512456929">Cross, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1469540512456929">Jacobson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1469540512456929">Sammond, 2005</xref>), very little scholarship has focused on how such discourses have been instrumental to the internal negotiations amongst those jockeying for control over the circulation of cultural commodities targeting children (licensors and licensees; creators, manufacturers, distributors and retailers), legitimating certain forms of cultural and creative authority over others while also helping to establish a lingua franca amongst different occupational communities.</p>
<p>Paul <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1469540512456929">Du Gay (1998</xref>: 7) has suggested that scholars must pay closer attention to the ‘culturalization of economic life’, wherein ‘Processes of production are themselves cultural phenomena in that they are assemblages of meaningful practices that construct certain ways for people to conceive and conduct themselves in an organizational context.’ Celia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469540512456929">Lury (1996)</xref>, Keith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469540512456929">Negus (1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1469540512456929">1999</xref>) and Liz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1469540512456929">McFall (2004)</xref> have all emphasized the mutually constitutive relationship between culture and economics in determining media products and practices, whereby commonsense notions of profit and compensation (not only how to attain them but also what gives one the right to earn them) are repeatedly (re)shaped by ever-shifting social values as much as by changing structural conditions. While most of these scholars have focused on contemporary ‘culturalization’ processes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1469540512456929">McFall (2002)</xref> has challenged the field to investigate how advertising personnel and other cultural intermediaries understood their roles as participants in the popularization of cultural commodities at earlier junctures. In part, this article seeks to answer McFall’s call for more historical work on the early negotiation and formation of occupational roles and identities amongst cultural workers by focusing on those involved in developing the children’s toy market in the late 1910s and early 1920s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1469540512456929">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, the interactions between Donahey and Borgfeldt reveal how the concept of ‘goodwill’ was understood and given meaning through discourse in an era prior to the codification of secondary meaning into trademark law. Secondary meaning, which would recognize that consumers associate trademarked brand names, images and logos with a particular producer rather than its underlying products (i.e. that the brand name ‘Coca Cola’ is associated with the Coca Cola Company, not just the soft drink produced by it), only gained legal standing in 1946 with the passing of the Lanham Trademark Law revision. In practice, this would lead to the popular acceptance amongst licensors and licensees that brands maintain their ‘goodwill’ with consumers across product lines. Early debates over what constituted ‘goodwill’ would not only have profound effects on Donahey’s legal authority over the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> as a brand, but also on how the courts and corporations would eventually come to recognize managerial stewardship – not creative or artisan labor – as essential to establishing and maintaining brand equity. As such, the interactions between Donahey and Pfeiffer not only reveal a great deal about the industrial and legal roadblocks that IP owners encountered in the first two decades of the 20th century in trying to manage the extension of character brands across media and merchandising platforms, they also demonstrate how the production of knowledge about ‘goodwill’ through discourse profoundly influenced how juridical and corporate power would be exercised.</p>
<p>Following a brief elaboration on the key players involved in merchandizing the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic>, I turn to analyzing correspondence between Donahey and Pfeiffer in which the brand’s value as well as the authority of both licensor and licensee were negotiated. I read these documents symptomatically, situating their exchange of discourse within its particular socio-historical context while also identifying tensions and struggles over definitional power when it came to managing how the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> were to be extended. In the last third of the article, I assess how ambiguities surrounding the concept of ‘goodwill’ contributed to Donahey’s legal and business misfortunes. In the conclusion, I return to the question of role reversal in managing the extension of character brands in the early 20th century in order to gesture at how licensors eventually gained the upper hand over licensees when it comes to claiming authority over the ‘goodwill’ invested in character brands.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1469540512456929"><title>The key players</title>
<p>William Donahey’s <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> was a newspaper cartoon published by the <italic>Chicago Tribune</italic> from 1914–70 (though with a near 17-year hiatus from 1925–41). Partly inspired by Palmer Cox’s <italic>The Brownies</italic> (1881–1918), Donahey’s creation featured a village filled with Lilliputian-sized characters and derived much of its humor from their interactions with everyday objects such as boots and thimbles significantly larger than themselves. Until 1923, the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> appeared as a single panel half-page cartoon first published in the <italic>Tribune</italic>’s women’s section and then in its ‘magazine’ section. The cartoon was very consciously promoted to mothers as gentler than the more violent and tawdry <italic>Katzenjammer Kids</italic>. Indeed, Donahey went to great lengths to distance his creation from the supposedly lowbrow comic strip format, going so far as to cancel his contract with the <italic>Tribune</italic> when the publisher insisted that he permanently convert the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> into a multi-paneled strip in 1924.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1469540512456929">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>In spite of the fact that the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> have largely been forgotten today, its value to the <italic>Tribune</italic> can be evidenced by the 1919 contract Donahey signed, which not only paid him $75 a week, but also allowed him to work from home and exclusively on the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic>, all in exchange for one weekly half-page cartoon. By 1923, Donahey’s salary had doubled, though his workload remained the same, and he was guaranteed 50 percent of the gross receipts the <italic>Tribune</italic> received for syndicating the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic>. Donahey also retained the non-publishing rights to his creation (though he was expected to share profits earned from merchandizing with his publisher), and by special agreement with the <italic>Tribune</italic>, was also allowed to create original published works featuring the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> so long as these did not appear in rival newspapers or magazines.</p>
<p>Controlling the rights to the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> allowed Donahey to selectively pursue licensing and merchandizing opportunities, which included a series of school primers and illustrated short stories, a <italic>Teenie Weenies Music Book for Piano</italic>, the performance rights to create a ‘<italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> Walz’, a children’s clothing line featuring embroidered <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> characters, and a very lucrative promotional sponsorship with Reid, Murdoch &amp; Co. that featured the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> in advertisements and on container labels for its Monarch canned food lines. Donahey also entered into a long-term relationship with the Borgfeldt toy distribution company, which he believed would eventually pave the way for a series of <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> moving pictures based on an anticipated line of dolls and other children’s playthings. As Donahey explained to <italic>Tribune</italic> editor James Medill Patterson, ‘it is through the dolls that I expect to make the moving picture end pay, as I have a scheme for picturing them which I have been told can be easily handled’ (30 June 1917, Box 1: Folder 1).</p>
<p>Though Donahey never revealed the details of his grand scheme (and, indeed, he also never successfully optioned the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> as a motion picture), what is evident is that he saw toys and other children’s ephemera as gateways to other media extension opportunities precisely because they helped establish the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> as a habitual part of children’s lived daily experiences, building sustained interest in the property in ways that the ephemeral newspaper cartoons alone could not. While comic strip historian Ian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1469540512456929">Gordon (1998)</xref> notes that the popularity of many early 20th-century characters such as Buster Brown, Little Nemo in Slumberland, and The Gumps resulted in their quick adaptation as toys, motion pictures and stage plays, Donahey’s ambitions reveal the extent to which such product extensions might be understood as part of an interwoven strategy for building cross-media brands and managing nascent brand communities that might follow their favorite characters across platforms long before the advent of media conglomeration and cultural/economic convergence.</p>
<p>Geo. Borgfeldt &amp; Company first began operating out of New York City in 1881 and by the turn of the Century had already established a solid reputation as an importer/distributor of high-end children’s dolls, mostly from Europe. In the 1910’s, the company also began to sublicense merchandise to European manufacturers, meaning that it acquired both the manufacturing and distribution rights to certain products and properties, but commissioned other companies to produce the actual merchandise, acting as an intermediary between creator/artist and manufacturer. Though the company would experience its greatest success in the early 1930s when it became the exclusive distributor of Disney bisque dolls and mechanical toys, by the time Pfeiffer began negotiating with Donahey, the company had already been phenomenally successful at merchandizing Kewpie dolls, toys and novelties based on Rose O’Neill’s creations, for which they held an exclusive all-encompassing license. Significantly, Geo. Borgfeldt &amp; Company would experience a radical shift to its business model in the late teens and early 1920s as the European manufacturing industry it relied so heavily upon recovered from the physical destruction and ensuing economic inflation that followed the end of the First World War. Meanwhile, the newly established Toy Manufacturer’s Association of America exploited anti-German sentiments to lobby the US government to impose a 75 percent tariff on all German imports. All this necessitated that Borgfeldt invest resources into US manufacturing as well as into distributing inexpensive children’s toys that still appealed to middle-class sensibilities and tastes.</p>
<p>According to Gary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1469540512456929">Cross (1997)</xref> and Lisa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1469540512456929">Jacobson (2004)</xref>, the first decades of the 20th century saw the emergence of two seemingly contradictory yet interwoven ideas about children’s play culture. on the one hand, the arrival of name brand fantasy toys that indulged both children’s imaginations as well as parent’s newfound sentimentality toward children; on the other hand, a virulent child-improvement ethos that advocated for educational toys that taught creativity and skill-development and would help bring the classroom into the playroom, in the process providing a proactive parental prophylactic against the perceived insidiousness and moral bankruptcy of mass culture.</p>
<p>Lisa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1469540512456929">Jacobson (2004)</xref> and Nicholas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1469540512456929">Sammond (2005)</xref> both demonstrate how producers of children’s culture repeatedly asserted that, with the right guidance, commercial products could prove beneficial to childhood development. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1469540512456929">Jacobson (2004: 10)</xref> notes, although the emerging consumer culture was often lamented as destroying Victorian notions of childhood innocence and upsetting traditional family hierarchies, some experts believed that its ‘ethos of salesmanship and enticement’ could also be harnessed by parents and educators to prepare children for successful integration into modernity. These experts also believed that media and other forms of popular culture could, in the right hands, be valuable character-building tools for teaching children how to imaginatively navigate consumer culture without sacrificing their moral compass. Or, as Nicholas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1469540512456929">Sammond (2005: 2)</xref> asserts, ‘arguments about regulating harmful media gave rise to arguments for media beneficial for the development of children into socially productive adults’.</p>
<p>Citing cultural historian Warren Susman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1469540512456929">Ian Gordon (1998)</xref> argues that the early 20th century was characterized by an ongoing cultural struggle between notions of character-building and a growing fascination with a celebrity culture built on personality, with comic strip characters serving as bridging agents from the former to the latter. The successful toy manufacturer was one who could draw from popular cultural forms such as comic strips while tempering their harmful effects by channeling their personalities in order to sell character-building playthings. Toy manufacturers often looked to license properties that already had positive reputations with both parents and their children in order to align their wares with prevailing child-rearing discourses of the day. Within this environment, a partnership between Donahey and Bordfeldt seemed like a surefire success.</p>
<p>But the forms this collaboration would take, as well as the mutual investment in one another’s contribution to this process, first had to be established through a series of tactical exchanges designed to establish both the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic>’ value as a cultural commodity as well as Donahey and Borgfeldt’s career capital. The back and forth between Donahey and Pfeiffer often produced tangled understandings of what the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic>’ value was as well as how to monetize it, which were in turn inseparable from one another.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1469540512456929"><title>Establishing and authorizing the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> value</title>
<sec id="sec4-1469540512456929"><title>Donahey’s position</title>
<p>Much like its agricultural cousin, cultivating investment in the business world first requires planting seeds. For Donahey, establishing the value of his creation often took the form of keeping Pfeiffer abreast of any outside interest the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> garnered from potential licensees, especially in non-competitive fields. For example, on 20 August 1921, Donahey wrote:<disp-quote>
<p>I believe I mentioned in one of my letters that a candy man wanted to use the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> in a line of candies. This man came to see me yesterday and he would like to get busy, so I’m writing to you in order to find out just whether that line of merchandise will conflict with your business … does anything in the perishable line, such as cakes, cigars, cookies and such interest you? (Box 1: Folder 2)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>While presented as a courtesy to make sure that Borgfeldt was not intending on exploiting that same market, the desired outcome was to demonstrate the cartoon’s popularity and market reach, which in turn encouraged Borgfeldt to invest in the possibilities of both tying its products in with existing publicity and, more importantly, expanding categories of merchandise it was interested in securing for itself. Indeed, the ‘courtesy’ of keeping Borgfeldt informed resulted in the company clarifying that it was interested in distributing <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> decorated toy containers and that Donahey should be careful not to arbitrarily give away those rights when permitting the candy manufacturer to use specially designed <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> candy boxes.</p>
<p>Donahey also sought to assert his career capital by foregrounding his investment in the property’s imagined consumer. Donahey regularly pointed to the cartoon’s popularity with children as proof that he understood the child psyche, which he then used to advocate for certain forms of <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> merchandise. For example, responding to Pfeiffer’s suggestion that they first release a line of inexpensive <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> decals, Donahey reasoned:<disp-quote>
<p>Possibly I am wrong, but it seems to me it would not be wise to bring the Teenie Weenies out first in a cheap toy, but to be patient, wait and conserve the idea until it is possible to bring out the doll villages and so forth, in order not to disappoint the children, who will expect to see the dolls exactly as they are in the pictures. You’ve got to be square with children and you can’t fool them either. (17 February 1917; Box 1: Folder 1)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Donahey also foreground how his work in cultivating investment amongst child consumers went well beyond drawing the cartoon and demonstrated a symbiotic relationship between creator and child readers. Recounting the thousands of letters he received from children, Donahey exclaimed to Constance Smith Whitman of Whitman Publishing, ‘they made a lot of work for me, for I always answered every letter, but they gave me a lot of help, too, in developing the feature’ (12 March 1936; Box 1: Folder 5).</p>
<p>Donahey also repeatedly told potential investors of how he conceived the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> when he was still a child of six or seven while playing with a set of old screws and imagining them as real people. ‘I played with this imaginative group until I was about twelve years old and these characters still remain more clearly fixed in my mind than the human associates of that period’ (12 March 1936; Box 1: Folder 5). The veracity of Donahey’s origin story for the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> is ultimately less important than the function the story served, namely to foreground the artist’s ability to see the world through the eyes of a child, accounting for both the appeal of his creation and his own expertise in knowing how best to market it to children. Of course, in linking the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> origins with his own childhood, Donahey was also able to evoke nostalgia for a supposedly more innocent and less materialistic era (after all, he played with old screws, not the miniature dolls he now sought to produce) as a means of differentiating his creation from contemporary forms of entertainment aimed at children.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1469540512456929">4</xref></sup> As such, Donahey was also quick to assert that his childish vision was one that resonated with mothers’ desires to shield their children from supposedly inappropriate material: ‘Most of the letters that came to me were from parents and they complained of the low character of the comics and that my feature was the only one they cared to have their children read’ (12 March 1936; Box 1: Folder 5).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1469540512456929">5</xref></sup></p>

<p>For his part, Pfeiffer sought to shape Donahey’s perceptions on how to merchandize the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> and why the cartoonist should follow Borgfeldt’s suggestions by offering free advice based on the company’s extensive experience and by appealing to a shared identification with Donahey on what what forms of popular culture were good for children. Pfeiffer often reframed discussions about children in order to cast Borgfeldt as the best resource for creating products that could realize these aspirations.</p>
<p>Almost every letter Pfeiffer wrote to Donahey contained ‘unsolicited’ advice on how to properly trademark the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> name or on the pitfalls of entering into particular merchandizing arrangements that might harm its overall value. On 7 April 1921, responding to Donahey’s initial report that he had been approached about licensing the rights to <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> candies, Pfeiffer counseled<disp-quote>
<p>It will be wise no doubt to restrict this party to the use of Teenie Weenies in candy form only, and to insist upon the right to approve the models of the Teenie Weenie candies and the general style of package and propaganda … You will understand that I am not trying to butt in upon these affairs of yours, but merely feel that having had very much experience, we are perhaps in a position to be of some help. (Box 1: Folder 2)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Of course, this advice was not entirely altruistic, as Pfeiffer bluntly admitted, ‘we have no interest in controlling goods of this kind, but we do have, naturally, some interest in their being brought out, if they are brought out in such a style as not to injure the general Teenie Weenie quality and campaign, in which we would naturally play a prominent part’ (24 November 1921; Box 1: Folder 2).</p>
<p>Even as Pfeiffer warned Donahey about the dangers of releasing poor quality <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> merchandise, Pfeiffer also sought to sell Donahey on why distributing low-quality inexpensive merchandise through Borgfeldt was a worthwhile proposition. Pfeiffer did so by offsetting concerns about poor quality through an appeal to their shared concern for and appreciation of children’s culture. Agreeing with Donahey’s assessment that children appreciate high quality items and that if not for the ‘abnormal’ market conditions making the manufacture of better class goods in Europe cost prohibitive Borgfeldt would be pursuing this route instead of proposing cheaper items, Pfeiffer reframed the value that Borgfeldt would bring to their potential partnership in terms of his own experiences as a parent and the need to safeguard children against the ill effects of mass culture while simultaneously indulging their imaginations:<disp-quote>
<p>My opinion as a father entirely agrees with the one you particularly mention as having impressed you some years ago. Whenever the Sunday papers arrive at my house, the first thing I have always done – always felt obliged to do – is to remove the comic supplement and throw it into the waste-paper basket or the fire, so that it might not contaminate the atmosphere of my home. I am sure there are many others that do precisely the same thing, in fact, I know it … Children are wonderfully imaginative, and it has always been one of my convictions that the reason grown-ups are not equally imaginative, or as more so as they might be by proper development, is solely due to the fact that their original, divinely-given imagination is ruined by the corruption of our so-called civilization and business (though I am in it myself) exclusively pursued … it is only by becoming again (if not remaining) as little children that we can truly enter into the kingdom of heaven. (23 February 1917; Box 1: Folder 1)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In situating his comments within dominant discourses on children’s culture of the day that bemoaned mass culture’s failure to properly and productively stimulate children’s imaginations, Pfeiffer established through these statements a shared cultural sensibility with Donahey that flattered the cartoonist’s ego while assuring him that Borgfeldt understood the importance of aligning the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic>’ economic and social value even as it pursued more popular merchandizing fare.</p>
<p>In so doing, Pfeiffer sought to both manage Donahey’s expectations so that they conformed to market conditions most beneficial for Borgfeldt while also continuing to assuage the artist’s anxieties over the constant delays in merchandizing the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> – the two first began corresponding in 1917 and the first <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> item released, a set of handkerchiefs, did not reach market until 1922 – by assuring him that the two men were kindred spirits.</p>
<p>Pfeiffer would later invoke his parental disgust for mass culture – as well as for the masses that embraced it – as a framing device in explaining Borgfeldt’s failure to generate interest in <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> paper dolls amongst toy retailers, exclaiming ‘I consider the lack of interest of people with children in such delightful material as yours, as decidedly marking a lack of understanding of what children ought to have … I’m afraid it’s largely this low state of the general public taste and the natural catering to it of store buyers that explains the lack of interest in the Teenie Weenies’ (2 August 1923; Box 1: Folder 3).</p>
<p>Though Pfeiffer would also utilize this disappointing turn of events to advocate for changes in how Donahey told <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> stories (more below), such efforts to alter the brand were always couched in rhetoric that stressed the two men’s shared affinity for wholesome material. Arguably, Pfeiffer’s embodiment of Donahey’s imagined parental advocate is what kept the cartoonist invested in Borgfeldt through tough times, not to mention other merchandising opportunities. Of course, Pfeiffer also repeatedly emphasized Borgfeldt’s prior success in merchandizing popular properties.</p>
<p>In fact, beyond appealing to their shared investment in children’s culture, the most common refrain in Pfeiffer’s letters to Donahey was about how fabulously successful a merchandizing machine <italic>The Kewpies</italic> were. Nearly every piece of unsolicited advice, possible promotional or merchandizing strategy, even potential setback was framed in terms of the success Borgfeldt had with <italic>The Kewpies</italic>. In advocating that Borgfeldt be granted the right of first refusal for all proposed <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> products, Pfeiffer boasted:<disp-quote>
<p>It has certainly worked wonderfully with the Kewpies …Our arrangement with Mrs. Rose O’Neill Wilson has always been that we get the first option on any new idea whether it is our own or is suggested or offered by anybody else … Our relations are so friendly that Mrs. Wilson would always be governed by our advice, even if we should say that some particular use of the Kewpies would not be to the advantage of the Kewpie business and propaganda as a whole. (14 December 1920; Box 1: Folder 1).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1469540512456929">6</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The tactic of repeatedly evoking <italic>The Kewpies</italic> served several intersecting purposes: first, it established Pfeiffer’s career capital by recounting trade stories that placed Borgfeldt at the epicenter of <italic>The Kewpies</italic> success; second, it indirectly encouraged Donahey to heed Pfeiffer’s advice and trust in Borgfeldt’s business plan for the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> by foregrounding how the company had made the same suggestions to O’Neill and had encountered similar obstacles that were subsequently overcome, in effect establishing a paternalistic pattern of behavior that granted the licensee greater authority than the licensor. Third, it provided Pfeiffer with a useful counter example that he would repeatedly use in managing Donahey’s creative labor when designing material for <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> merchandise. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1469540512456929">Cross (1997: 94)</xref> points out, in merchandizing <italic>The Kewpies</italic>, Borgfeldt watered down the more politicized and ambiguous elements of O’Neill work: ‘In magazine stories Kewpie was an androgynous figure who came to the relief of slum dwellers and the exploited. She took on the character of a progressivist reformer. But as a licensed image Kewpie abandoned her reforming spirit and reflected popular images of gender.’</p>
<p>Pfeiffer similarly attempted to regulate and reshape Donahey’s creative output to better fit Borgfeldt’s business interests through what John <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1469540512456929">Caldwell (2009)</xref> identifies as the managerial act of ‘giving notes’. Notably, Pfeiffer’s attempts often came in the form of helpful suggestions that either appeared to be inspired by Donahey’s creative vision (even as he attempted to restrict it) or played upon his and Donahey’s shared artistic and cultural sensibilities, especially as those aligned with Borgfeldt’s bottom line. In one letter, Pfeiffer offered four pages-worth of suggestions for possible <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> handkerchief scenarios, couching these proposed ideas as inspired by Borgfeldt and Donahey’s mutual investment in the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic>:<disp-quote>
<p>I am well aware that it is not necessary to submit what has gone through our minds to so competent a gentleman as yourself, but we take so lively an interest in your work and are so anxious to contribute as much as we can to the Teenie Weenies handkerchief venture, that I feel you will welcome this contribution and use or not use anything just as you see fit. (23 November 1920; Box 1: Folder 1)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Of course, Pfeiffer was also quick to foreground how he had previously put his own artistic knowledge to use in creating successful toy lines, a move designed to imbue his creative guidance with symbolic capital that both validated and presaged the accrual of actual capital:<disp-quote>
<p>I have studied and practiced the fine arts quite a little in years past, spending several winters in Italy and Greece before I went into business. I cultivate them still, very assiduously and lovingly, when time permits, and I believe that my constant endeavor in business to apply care &amp; artistic principles to the production of such of our novelties and advertising of them as permit it, has contributed largely to the eminent place and success our house has won in these respects. (29 November 1920; Box 1: Folder 1)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Finally, Pfeiffer also framed his creative guidance as itself guided by Borgfeldt’s deep felt understanding of children’s desires rather than potential sales. Advocating for the elimination of one of Donahey’s more prominently featured characters, a retired military man with a wooden peg for a leg, Pfeiffer reasoned that especially in the aftermath of the First World War: ‘A crippled soldier, it has been pointed out, is not an object of joy for children to see on a pretty and merry handkerchief picture … the soldier could be left out altogether. (29 March 1921; Box 1: Folder 2)</p>

<sec id="sec6-1469540512456929"><title>Marketing the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> brand</title>
<p>Pfeiffer also argued that any sales difficulties Borgfeldt encountered were partly the result of the poor publicity the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> cartoon received. Pfeiffer’s concern over how the cartoon was publicized point to the contractual limitations of Donahey’s working relationship with the <italic>Chicago Tribune</italic>. They also point to the discursive ambiguity over how ‘goodwill’ was established for entertainment brands during this period.</p>
<p>Throughout their correspondence, Pfeiffer repeatedly stressed to Donahey that ‘publicity through every available channel is your cue’ (19 February 1917; Box 1: Folder 1). And, indeed, Donahey repeatedly sought to convince would-be licensees to work together to cross-promote <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> products. But in key ways, Donahey’s ability to publicize the cartoon was hampered by the <italic>Chicago Tribune</italic>’s business model during this era. Unlike many New York-based newspapers, which had invested in developing syndication operations in order to sell their comic strips nationally, transforming certain strips into ‘shared national cultural artifact[s]’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1469540512456929">Gordon, 1998</xref>: 41), the <italic>Chicago Tribune</italic> was primarily interested in generating publicity for its own publications. Comic strips and cartoons were an essential part of the <italic>Tribune</italic>’s marketing, but they were largely intended to increase sales of <italic>Chicago Tribune</italic> newspapers, not provide an ancillary market for <italic>Tribune</italic> content.</p>
<p>Indeed, Donahey’s 1920 contract explicitly forbade him from publishing his cartoons in other newspapers or print publications, including magazines (an exception was made for the school primers). He was also forbidden from using his <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> characters as sales agents in product advertising that might appear in non-<italic>Tribune</italic> publications. As such, the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> were not widely known in the USA outside of the Midwest, whereas many East Coast cartoons were nationally recognized and, in turn, more easily marketable as branded toys and other merchandise. Lamenting the lack of a sustained East Coast presence for the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> cartoon, Pfeiffer exclaimed:<disp-quote>
<p>I am sorry … that we will not yet have you in the East, where I hope you will still some day find a wider and perhaps more profitable field for your ability … The East reaches out over our entire country toward the West, but the West and the Middle West do not seem to take so kindly to the Eastern ways. (20 June 1923; Box 1: Folder 3)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Since the <italic>Chicago Tribune</italic> also owned a sister newspaper in New York City, <italic>The New York Daily News</italic>, with which it shared resources, many <italic>Tribune</italic> strips did find readership in the New York City market. Yet Pfeiffer also saw the sensationalistic and tawdry reputation of the <italic>Daily News</italic> as contributing to the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> image troubles with the right class of consumer: ‘You may suffer … from the Teenie Weenies coming out in The Daily News, because frankly, the general tone and subject matter of its illustrations are too much like Police Gazette [a popular and lurid tabloid published from 1842–1977] sensationalism to find ready access to the homes you would like to have reached by the Teenie Weenies’ (8 February 1923; Box 1: Folder 3). Pfeiffer lamented that toy dealers catering to the types of consumers that read <italic>The Daily News</italic> ‘sniff contemptuously at such high-brow stuff as the charming Teenie Weenies’ and that Donahey therefore needed to find ways to present his characters to concerned parents through other venues, such as <italic>Good Housekeeping</italic> and <italic>Ladies Home Journal</italic>, which were at the time off-limits to him (8 February 1923; Box 1: Folder 3).</p>
<p>Though Donahey’s situation would change in 1925 (see next section), Pfeiffer’s dual concerns that the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> received neither enough publicity nor enough of the right kinds of publicity touches upon the paradoxical understanding of ‘goodwill’ that shaped early brand extension strategies (and arguably continue to do so today); namely that building brand reputation amongst consumers required striking a difficult balance between gaining widespread recognition through selective partnerships with licensees. While Pfeiffer regularly warned Donahey not to recklessly hand out licenses that might diminish the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic>’ reputation, the distributor also repeatedly pushed Donahey to promote the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> brand as widely as possible. This definitional tension would carry over into the legal arena, where Donahey’s efforts to protect the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> brand from trademark infringement and keep control over how the property was extended across merchandizing platforms hinged upon juridical application of ‘goodwill’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1469540512456929"><title>Defining and defending ‘goodwill’</title>
<p>In 1925, Donahey’s fortunes seemed to turn around. The publicity he had been seeking for his <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> characters was dramatically expanded through a lucrative promotional partnership with Reid-Murdock &amp; Company (R-M&amp;C), a national manufacturer of canned goods, who licensed the rights to use the characters on their packaging and in a national ad campaign featured in respected journals such as <italic>Good Housekeeping</italic>, <italic>Ladies Home Journal</italic> and <italic>The Saturday Evening Post</italic>. Donahey was also hired by R-M&amp;C to draw all the artwork for the campaign.</p>
<p>Donahey’s situation was partly altered by changes to the <italic>Chicago Tribune</italic>’s business strategy beginning in 1924. As Michele <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1469540512456929">Hilmes (1990)</xref> notes, in 1924, the Chicago <italic>Tribune</italic> would begin diversifying its media operations by purchasing a radio station and rechristening it WGN. The radio station was originally intended to promote newspaper sales by showcasing adaptations of <italic>Tribune</italic> columns and comic strips, but its success in procuring sponsorship for programs such as <italic>Little Orphan Annie</italic>, and the desires of said sponsors to extend the reach of these programs into new markets contributed to a shift in the <italic>Tribune</italic>’s operating model, especially in syndicating comic strips, because radio sponsors felt it was imperative that the comic strips first be published in local papers in order to ensure broadcast success.</p>
<p>From 1925 to 1928, the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> were featured on a wide array of R-M&amp;C products, ranging from pickles and canned vegetables to peanut butter and sardines, and Donahey was compensated $48,276.07 for the use of his characters as well as his services as a commercial artist. Importantly, the campaign reinvigorated merchandising interest in the property, including Pfeiffer’s, who wrote, ‘I immediately have thought, therefore, of also capitalizing [on R-M&amp;C’s] advertising for a revival of some Teenie Weenie items by [Borgfeldt]’ (12 November 1926; Box 1: Folder 3).</p>
<p>The success was short lived, however. On 22 May 1925, R-M&amp;C and Donahey would file a suit against the Oconomowoc Canning Company, a Wisconsin-based manufacturer that for several years had been running an ad campaign in which elf-like characters named ‘the Teenie Weenies’ promoted the company’s canned pea product. Donahey claimed that Oconomowoc was infringing on his rights by using the name and likeness of his <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> characters without permission and moreover, that they were profiting from the ‘goodwill’ that Donahey had built up in the trade name ‘<italic>Teenie Weenies</italic>’, leading consumers to assume that it was in fact the comic strip characters Donahey created who were endorsing Oconomowoc’s product. In turn, Oconomowoc counter-sued, arguing that Donahey had no claim to the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> trademark in the area of canned goods and that, in fact, it was R-M&amp;C who was seeking to profit from Oconomowoc’s ‘goodwill’ by passing off their products as the latter’s.</p>
<p>The case hinged on shifting definitions of trademark law and the significance of secondary meaning as an indicator of ‘goodwill’. Briefly, trademark law is intended to protect consumers against confusion and deception created when competing businesses use similar marks, logos, and insignias and, as such, is designed to promote competition by facilitating comparison-shopping. While trademarks must be distinctive in order to be granted legal standing (one can trademark the name ‘Pepsi’ but not the word ‘soda’), the law will often recognize how combinations of common words can take on distinctive meanings for consumers (hence, while the words ‘super’ and ‘man’ are both too common to be granted protection, ‘Superman’ is a recognizable trademark).</p>
<p>Trademark is also intended to preserve the ‘goodwill’ that trademark owners have accrued from consumers by preventing another entity from using the same mark to perpetuate a fraud on the public. Prior to 1947, when the Lanham Trademark Revision was passed by Congress, competing businesses were defined as those engaged in the sale of similar products and ‘goodwill’ was usually correlated with the quality of a particular product. Accordingly, while R-M&amp;C and Oconomowoc were regarded as like-businesses in the canned goods market, Donahey’s <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> occupied an ambiguous space, because it was unlikely that consumers would confuse a comic strip with a can of peas. As Donahey would explain the situation to Constance Smith Whitman in 1936, ‘there is no law recognizing or extending literary rights to commercial uses … a literary person cannot protect the “goodwill” and advertising value he might create, unless he manufactures and continues an interstate trade in each article he might want to protect. Of course it is plain to see that all the crooks take advantage of this condition’ (12 March 1936; Box 1: Folder 5).</p>
<p>It was only after Lanham that secondary meaning became the primary means of legally recognizing that particular brand names were capable of carrying meaning for consumers across product lines and that ‘goodwill’ was invested in brand management as much as quality control. Of course, even before the Lanham revision, precedent existed for recognizing popular characters as trademarks. Cartoonists Bud Fisher and Frank King had both already successfully defended their rights to the names of their respective characters, ‘Mutt and Jeff’ and ‘Skeezix’ against unauthorized use in other media and merchandizing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1469540512456929">7</xref></sup> In the latter case, King was awarded an injunction against a candy manufacturer already selling ‘Skeezix’ candy bars, which then allowed the cartoonist to license his characters to a rival manufacturer. Donahey felt confident that he would be awarded similar rights.</p>
<p>Quite the opposite occurred though. In April 1928, the State Court of Wisconsin ruled in favor of Oconomowoc’s trademark claim, denying Donahey and R-M&amp;C the right to use either the ‘<italic>Teenie Weenies</italic>’ label or character-likenesses on their canned good products. While, in part, the court’s verdict was predicated on a narrow definition of trademark that neither took secondary meaning into account nor recognized the ‘<italic>Teenie Weenies</italic>’ title, logo or characters as sufficiently unique to qualify for common law protection (aside from arguing that the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> title and characters were first created by their client for its canned peas campaign, Oconomowoc’s attorneys also argued that Donahey’s characters were merely generic variations on elves and therefore were not entitled to trademark protection), the trial also revealed the indeterminacy of ‘goodwill’ amongst legal and business interests.</p>
<p>Though it was perhaps plainly obvious that Oconomowoc’s attorneys would argue that ‘goodwill’ resided in the work done by the canning company in producing a high quality product that had gained consumer recognition, Donahey’s testimony and the testimony of the witnesses called to support his claims, including Pfeiffer’s, put forward a variation of ‘goodwill’ that sought to equate artistic reputation and moral stewardship with consumer recognition. In effect, Donahey employed a variation on quality control in claiming that ‘goodwill’ for the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> could be directly correlated with the selectivity he employed in licensing the property. As he would write to a potential witness at the trial, Mr Crawford, ‘I seldom availed myself of the opportunity [to merchandise the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic>], due to the fact that many of the schemes were not compatible with the good name of my little folks’ (3 April 1928; Box 1: Folder 4). At the trial, Donahey further testified:<disp-quote>
<p>One of the main objects of the thing was to keep it clean and wholesome … For the simple reason that from the letters I received from the fathers and mothers and children they appreciated the wholesomeness of it. The feature was built with the idea of giving wholesome entertainment to small children … From the period of 1914 I had close to two hundred requests for the use of the name Teenie Weenie in commercial enterprises. Almost all of those requests were refused on the ground that I did not like the quality of the article they proposed to turn out under the name Teenie Weenie, or the character of the firm, and refused to do business with them. (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1469540512456929">Gerlach, 1929</xref>: 10–11; Box 6: Folder 2)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>While Donahey’s argument that he purposely limited how the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> were extended conflicted with trademark requirements of the day that a trade name already be established in any given market to be eligible for protection, it also positioned Donahey as employing a moral filter that aligned the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic>’ virtues with middle-class parenting sensibilities. Elsewhere, I have noted that only a decade later (and still prior to the Lanham revision), the Lone Ranger, Incorporated (LRI) would successfully defend its rights to the Lone Ranger across trade markets by making a similar appeal to the value of corporate stewardship in overseeing brand extension as essential to the accrual of ‘goodwill’. To some extent, Donahey’s troubles were less about ‘management’ than they were about misidentifying the source of the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> value.</p>
<p>Repeatedly, witnesses called forward spoke effusively about Donahey’s artistic talent and reputation, seemingly arguing that the cartoonist was the true source of the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic>’ value. Addressing the appeal of <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> branded merchandise, Pfeiffer testified:<disp-quote>
<p>because the ultimate purchaser knows Mr. Donahey to be an author and an artist … The consuming public buy these goods because they are familiar … with Mr. Donahey’s literary and artistic work and when his pictures and name appear on any merchandise [they] immediately buy it on account of its obvious connection with the writings and pictures of Mr. Donahey, which they and their children know. (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1469540512456929">Gerlach, 1929</xref>: 18; Box 6: Folder 2)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This rhetorical maneuver seemed to confuse copyright, which protects authorial rights, and trademark, and arguably undermined Donahey’s case: Oconomowoc was not accused of pretending to pass off its <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> as work done or inspired by Donahey. If anything, it feigned ignorance of who Donahey even was.</p>
<p>Yet, this recognition of Donahey instead of the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> as the ultimate source of value was also perfectly in line with prevailing business practices of the day. Donahey’s contracts for the <italic>Chicago Tribune</italic> regularly recognized that ‘the ARTIST possesses a unique style and peculiar talent, and agrees that his services are of a unique, peculiar and unusual value’ (1923; Box 6: Folder 1), while omitting any specific mention of the actual materials Donahey produced, which in turn implied their interchangeability. As a laborer, Donahey’s value was identifiable in his cartooning style, not his actual cartoons. This allowed the <italic>Tribune</italic> the ability to reassign cartoonists to different projects while also obscuring the cartoon’s value to the syndicate.</p>
<p>Similarly, manufacturers such as Borgfeldt carefully distinguished between ‘goodwill’ and ‘recognition’ when it came to licensed goods as a means of controlling creative and economic interactions with their ‘artist-clients’. In assigning value to Donahey rather than the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> per se, Borgfeldt could flatter the former’s ego without recognizing the intangible value that the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> brand added to their product lines, which might have required additional compensation. It also allowed Borgfeldt to insist that ‘goodwill’ resided in the care it took in producing quality merchandise, which in turn justified its decision-making authority over product lines. Finally, in recognizing Donahey’s artistic talents, such assertions also denied him the status of brand manager, which might seem like a lessor role, but in the context of IP extension, rhetorically undercut his claims to ‘managerial acumen’ as a form of authorial control (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1469540512456929">Santo, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, throughout most of their interactions, Pfeiffer repeatedly positioned Borgfeldt – not Donahey – as the entity best capable of making sound brand extension decisions for the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic>, and therefore, also the entity most entitled to profit from the work performed in managing the property’s merchandizing campaign:<disp-quote>
<p>We take it for granted that you are letting us feel our way in different directions and will give us the general option to utilize the Teenie Weenies in any of the various lines we are interested in … We feel in dealing with all our artist clients that it is for the common benefit to cooperate as much as possible and not scatter the giving of privileges and rights. There is great advantage in a unified campaign, and as to its results, we naturally feel that we should in a business way get whatever benefit we can from our campaigning, adding any desirable new lines that we could handle in time and not let them go to outsiders who would not have the same interest as ourselves in the whole scheme and will not have spent any labor, time and money like ourselves, in the pioneer work. (14 February 1917; Box 1: Folder 1)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Pfeiffer’s assessment clearly links Borgfeldt’s right to profit from the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> with the distributor’s – not the creator’s – ‘pioneering’ work in popularizing it. Pfeiffer essentially repositions Borgfeldt as the entity cultivating ‘goodwill’ in the property, rather than the entity benefiting from it.</p>
<p>Thus, in denying Donahey’s trademark rights to the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic>, the courts upheld a selective interpretation of ‘goodwill’ that preceded the case and had hampered Donahey’s negotiating position with potential licensees throughout this period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1469540512456929" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>While the partnership with R-M&amp;C offered great possibilities for Donahey to finally attain the publicity necessary for extending the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> into new markets, the denial of his trademark had greater repercussions. Donahey would never again come close to merchandizing the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic>. The combination of legal troubles and a decade-long absence from the comic strip pages contributed to the property’s obsolescence, as too did the cultural shift toward favoring brash, spunkier and more ‘realistic’ child protagonists such as Little Orphan Annie, Jack Armstrong, and Terry and the Pirates (not to mention Shirley Temple). By the early 1940s, Donahey would return to drawing the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> for the <italic>Chicago Tribune</italic> Syndicate, this time in multi-panel form. The strip would be syndicated until 1970, the year Donahey died. Donahey’s struggles to extend the <italic>Teenie Weenies</italic> brand had little to do with the actual cartoon’s popularity either with consumers or licensees. Rather, Donahey’s difficulties were largely the result of industrial and legal discourses that undermined his creative authority as licensor and narrowly equated consumer ‘goodwill’ with particular products, not brands. While Donahey’s attempts to challenge these prevailing discourses were unsuccessful, they would provide rhetorical ammunition for corporate IP owners in the decades to come.</p>
<p>Though motivated by the particular economic and industrial climate of the early 1920s, Borgfeldt’s efforts to push Donahey in the direction of cheaper toy products would prove fortuitous as by decade’s end inexpensive radio premiums and other giveaway items connected to sponsored children’s programs would dominate the toy industry. In spite of Pfeiffer’s apparent dislike for mass culture, the discursive labor he performed in promoting Borgfeldt’s ability to maintain cultural standards while still distributing disposable branded toys presaged the marketing strategies radio sponsors and marketers would similarly embrace – i.e. that in responsible hands, mass culture could serve positive and productive roles in engaging children’s imaginations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1469540512456929">Santo, 2011</xref>). Borgfeldt’s greatest success would come in 1930, when the company briefly became the primary toy distributor for the Walt Disney Corporation, primarily selling bisque figurines and mechanical toys. Ironically, Roy Disney detested the poor quality of Borgfeldt’s merchandise (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1469540512456929">Gabler, 2007</xref>). He also complained about Borgfeldt’s suspect accounting practices and the interminably long time it took the company to move from product conception to marketing, describing it as ‘great hands to do a lot of talking’ (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1469540512456929">Gabler, 2007</xref>: 196). Disney’s dissatisfaction with Borgfeldt would lead it to hire Herman ‘Kay’ Kamen as its licensing agent in 1931.</p>
<p>Far from a trivial part of this story, Disney’s shift from Borgfeldt to Kamen points to a significant change in the distribution of power between licensors and licensees. As I suggested at the beginning of this article, in many ways Borgfeldt took on the characteristics of a licensing agent in its dealings with Donahey, whom it treated as an ‘artist-client’ rather than an IP owner to whom it was contractually beholden. Licensing agents such as Kamen would offer their clients similar advice for extending IP as Pfeiffer did with Donahey, but since their earnings came from a small royalty percentage (usually 5-8 percent) from every gross wholesale license they procured (rather than the difference between the manufacturing and the retail price), their interests lay in promoting the brand over the products bearing its image. Ultimately, Kamen’s reputation and career capital depended on how well he promoted the Mickey Mouse brand, whereas Borgfeldt’s was based on the quality of toy bearing its imprimatur.</p>
<p>As such, figures such as Kamen were far more invested in advancing a conceptualization of ‘goodwill’ that resided in the brand as well as in the work done in managing its reputation across product lines. To this end, I (2012) have argued that the work performed throughout the 1930s by licensing entities such as LRI in foregrounding the relationship between managerial acumen and ‘goodwill’ would have significant impact on legal interpretations of trademark law.</p>
<p>In the end, the significance of this case study can be understood at multiple levels. At the micro level, it reveals how Donahey’s efforts to capitalize on his cartoon creation and extend its reach across media and merchandizing platforms were stymied by early 20th-century industrial and legal conceptualizations of where authority over IP resided. It also demonstrates how Borgfeldt &amp; Company sought to manage cultural and industrial changes that required it to rethink its approach to the children’s market. At the macro level, the case study identifies and assesses the industrial and legal barriers to generating cross-media and merchandizing initiatives built around character brands that first needed to be overcome in order for properties such as Superman and Little Orphan Annie to circulate widely in the following decades and become iconic cultural commodities; changes that ultimately led to corporate IP owners displacing artists and authors as brand stewards even as these changes also lessened licensee authority over how IP circulates.</p>
<p>The article also traced the discursive labor involved in challenging and upholding industrial and legal barriers, while arguing that the occupational purviews and functions of licensors and licensees were produced through these discursive exchanges. In focusing on a historical moment prior to the presumptive power of IP becoming conventional industry knowledge, I have simultaneously sought to de-familiarize taken-for-granted assumptions about branding while actively tracing how quotidian exchanges between cultural workers helped shape future conceptualizations of brand management and character licensing.</p>
<p>Thus, at the broadest level, this article has explored how tactical discursive exchanges give meaning to industrial practices taking place within particular socio-historical and institutional contexts and legitimate – or fail to legitimate – the creative authority of different professional communities when it comes establishing the value – both cultural and economic – of branded properties. While prior work has traced the uneasy alignment of cultural and economic logics within industrial settings, their impact on consumer culture and, in particular, popular imaginings of child consumers, I have sought to demonstrate how such discourses are appropriated by cultural workers as part of their negotiation of their positions within the field of cultural production and their assertion of their career capital within a reputation-based system. Though there can be little doubt that Donahey and Pfeiffer’s attempts to legitimate their cultural authority to one another – to cultivate investment in each other’s vision of the children’s market – were rooted in the particular discourses of their day, these types of interactions continue to play essential roles in determining how cultural commodities circulate amongst IP owners, licensing agents, licensees, manufacturers, distributors, retailers and marketers long before they reach actual consumers.</p>
