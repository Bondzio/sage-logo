<p>In a symposium at the 2012 National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education annual conference, Claremont Graduate University Professor Daryl G. Smith, a pioneer in the study of diversity in postsecondary educational contexts, critiqued the disproportionate framing of diversity-related research around past, present, and future U.S. Supreme Court cases. She rightly argued that such a narrow orientation, though critical for shaping access to highly selective institutions, has overlooked a wider range of issues that continually affect student bodies, irrespective of Court rulings. Now that AERA and other scholarly groups have weighed in on the most recent affirmative action case to reach the Supreme Court, it is time to refocus the body of research on diversity in higher education.</p>
<p>U.S. Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell presented in his <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013189X13486764">1978</xref> opinion on the <italic>Regents of the University of California v. Bakke</italic> case a set of arguments concerning the educational benefits of diversity. Powell’s opinion has since been central in deciding the constitutionality of race-conscious admissions practices. When I conducted the literature review for my <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013189X13486764">1996</xref> dissertation study, “Racial Diversity in Higher Education: Does a Racially Mixed Student Population Affect Educational Outcomes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013189X13486764">Chang, 1996</xref>), I was surprised to find an absence of empirical research that either supported or refuted Powell’s claims. This was especially astonishing to me given that a race-conscious admissions case (<italic>Hopwood v. Texas</italic>) appeared to be headed for the Supreme Court. Today, there is no shortage of research, thanks in large part to the attention received by <italic>The Shape of the River</italic>, written by two former Ivy League presidents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013189X13486764">Bowen &amp; Bok, 1998</xref>), and the efforts of several working groups (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013189X13486764">Chang, Witt, Jones, &amp; Hakuta, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013189X13486764">Gurin, Dey, Hurtado, &amp; Gurin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013189X13486764">Orfield, &amp; Kurlaender, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The Ohio State University Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity recently commissioned from me a report on research concerning the range of educational benefits associated with attending racially diverse institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013189X13486764">Chang, 2011</xref>). This report responded to charges that the growing body of research refuted, rather than support assumptions held by affirmative action advocates. I found the research was developing in a relatively steady and systematic manner, with each new study building on previously published scholarship. Even studies that did not share the same position were helpful for understanding the knowledge base in totality and its implications on educational policy and practice. Although landmark Court decisions may have inspired much of this inquiry, there is now a mature and flourishing body of literature that is uniquely situated in educational research. Indeed, the Kirwan Institute report clearly shows that the breadth and scope of research has increased significantly since I completed my 1996 dissertation study.</p>
<p>One well-established pattern that has emerged from the research is that the impact of undergraduate education is appreciably enhanced by diversity-related efforts on college and university campuses. Increasingly, the research has shifted away from questions about whether students benefit from diversity to questions about conditions that maximize and hinder those benefits. Another consistent pattern is that “encounters” with people of different races contribute to undergraduate learning. Studies show that both the substance of the interactions and quality of the educational context that shape those interactions moderate the educational benefits. Decades of research concerning how college affects students (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013189X13486764">Astin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013189X13486764">Dey, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013189X13486764">Pascarella &amp; Terenzini, 2005</xref>) have conclusively shown that the relationship between students and the college environment is both reciprocal and dynamic. In other words, one of the fundamental principles in higher education research is what is referred to as an ecological perspective, which posits that there are tight interconnections between individual change, institutional change, and social change.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013189X13486764">Hurtado, Milem, Clayton-Pedersen, and Allen (1998)</xref> applied this ecological perspective more specifically to understanding campus diversity, offering a more nuanced and contextual understanding of the relationship between racial diversity and educational benefits. Their framework suggests there are many key internal and external factors that potentially facilitate or undermine the impact of diverse educational settings on students’ learning and experiences. Thus, in order to achieve those benefits, campuses (and scholars who study them) must account for many different, but interrelated, moving parts shaped by multiple forces that affect student outcomes, learning, and sense of belonging.</p>
<p>Although the research is clear on <italic>if</italic> diversity contributes to educational benefits, we are only beginning to uncover <italic>how</italic> or <italic>which</italic> processes and conditions promote those benefits. Ironically, the potential of improving this understanding has been limited in several ways by a strong orientation toward informing decisions on pending court cases. First, this court-focused orientation has favored research that is generalizable, which privileges certain kinds of quantitative studies, disregarding important qualitative contributions. Yet, qualitative studies are critical for uncovering key details and processes among other critical findings, which inform practice. Second, this orientation has also focused mainly on race, while ignoring other forms of diversity (class, sexual orientation, gender, religion, etc.) that may also contribute to learning and students’ experiences. Thus, integrating complex understandings of other forms of difference and examining how they intersect in ways that subsequently contribute to the educational context and institutional dynamics can further improve practice. Lastly, under the cloud of impending court rulings, researchers have failed to better understand potential negative effects associated with compositional shifts in the student body, including but not limited to increased incidents of antipathy, conflict, and balkanization. Yet, more closely examining those negative outcomes would complement efforts to enhance benefits, helping institutions both minimize the negative effects and maximize the added value of being educated in a diverse environment.</p>
<p>Clearly, there are still many promising approaches and areas for future research that inform educational policy and practice, which can add value to students’ learning and experiences. Although the imperative for advancing scholarship on the educational benefits of diversity in higher education may have begun with key U.S. Supreme Court cases, this imperative should not be dictated solely by legal deliberations. Questions surrounding diversity have produced a rigorous and systematic body of research that extends beyond informing Court decisions. Shifting our gaze more squarely on broader practice and more sophisticated questions stands to make the existing body of research more relevant to a wider range of institutions that are undergoing significant demographic shifts. This orientation will also force researchers to account for and pursue the many overlooked areas and approaches that can inform the existing literature base. If one overarching goal of this line of inquiry is to improve educational opportunities and subsequently how education is more broadly delivered for a wider range of students on different types of institutions, then there is indeed unfinished business that will still be highly relevant for educational researchers regardless of how the Court rules in future cases.</p>
