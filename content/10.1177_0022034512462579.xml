<p>At first appearance, peoples’ thoughts and actions regarding their health can appear irrational. A smoker, seemingly unperturbed by the harmful effects of tobacco, displays extreme fear prior to a dental injection. A patient declines repeated recommendations for treatment of chronic periodontitis, insisting instead that the dentist repair a small defect in the enamel of an incisor. A child refuses to adopt simple oral hygiene habits explained carefully during health education classes, yet is duped by advertisements asserting that sugary junk foods will make him happy and popular among his peers.</p>
<p>We might be left pondering, “What a piece of work is man.” But rather than despairing as does Shakespeare’s Hamlet, we would do well to heed research of psychologists and social scientists into health beliefs and health behaviors. For example, researchers have begun to untangle the etiology of dental fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034512462579">Armfield <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). There is a wealth of knowledge about perceived oral health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512462579">Locker <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>), its relationship to clinical oral status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034512462579">Dahlstrom and Carlsson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034512462579">Gerritsen <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>), and how it is affected by dental treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512462579">Emami <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Improving oral health by altering behaviors is a different matter. A systematic review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034512462579">Kay and Locker, 1996</xref>) of 143 studies published between 1982 and 1994 found that, by and large, conventional methods of dental health education failed to reduce levels of dental disease. And while intensive efforts at behavior change through motivational interviewing were effective in controlling dental caries in some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512462579">Yevlahova and Satur, 2009</xref>), a more feasible, brief motivational interview was not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034512462579">Ismail <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>More promising are behavioral interventions based on sound psychological models and theoretical frameworks. In one systematic review of clinical trials to promote oral hygiene in adults with periodontitis, interventions that used psychological theories of operant and classic conditioning were found to lower plaque scores and reduce gingival bleeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034512462579">Renz <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). A social-psychological approach that framed dental health messages according to patients’ motivational orientation found that the intervention improved adults’ flossing behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034512462579">Sherman <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>As with all experimental studies, the nature of the endpoint for the evaluation of behavioral interventions is critical when the merit of the intervention is being judged. Historically, dental researchers placed greatest emphasis on clinically determined endpoints of disease, such as indices of periodontal disease and dental caries. Secondary emphasis is given to surrogate endpoints, such as plaque accumulation. Yet, in many instances, clinical indices themselves are merely surrogates for outcomes that are meaningful to patients, such as function, discomfort, and quality of life. Indeed, Hujoel and colleagues argue that indices of periodontal disease are “surrogate endpoints that have largely failed for more than 20 years to provide reliable answers to certain controversial issues regarding treatment efficacy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034512462579">Hujoel <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Patient-based outcomes of function, discomfort, and quality of life sometimes reveal effects of interventions that are not apparent with clinically defined endpoints. For example, clinical trials of adults’ oral rehabilitation have shown substantial advantages of implant-retained dentures compared with conventional dentures when evaluated by patient-based endpoints of oral-health-related quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034512462579">Awad <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). In contrast, implant treatment had no added benefit when the endpoints were clinicians’ evaluations of oral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034512462579">Heydecke <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>) or biomarkers of nutritional status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512462579">Awad <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). Meanwhile, in clinical trials of oncology drugs, it is noteworthy that regulatory agencies in the United States and Europe require that studies evaluate efficacy by patient-based endpoints, such as quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512462579">Hao, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>There are additional reasons to evaluate patient-based outcomes in behavioral health interventions. In some instances, the theoretical basis for adopting the behavior might, itself, be dependent on patients’ perception of the salience of the condition being studied. In many instances, patients are unlikely to initiate or maintain health behaviors if they cannot perceive tangible benefits, such as less pain, improved function, or better quality of life, even if the intervention is successful in reducing clinical disease. Patient-based assessments therefore have considerable potential to influence the adoption and sustainability of behavioral interventions.</p>
<p>For these reasons, studies that evaluate behavioral health interventions must be especially rigorous. Not only should they evaluate the effects of the intervention within the target population in an unbiased manner based on patient-relevant endpoints, but also they should be designed and analyzed in ways that reveal which behaviors created the effect, in whom, and how. Benchmarks for studies of behavioral interventions in oral health have been established in a series of papers commissioned by the US National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034512462579">Martino, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>This issue of the <italic>Journal of Dental Research</italic> reports findings from a new study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034512462579">Nammontri <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>) that illustrates this level of rigor. The investigators designed an intervention for Thai schoolchildren that sought to enhance their sense of coherence—a psychological construct referring to people’s tendency to approach life as a challenge, taking advantage of opportunities and coping with stressors. According to the behavioral theory underlying the intervention, children who developed a greater sense of coherence would adopt more favorable beliefs about oral health, perform healthier dental behaviors, and thereby enjoy better clinical oral health and quality of life. The intervention was randomized to groups, not individuals, in part because sense of coherence was promoted through school-wide projects to create a healthier school environment. The researchers used a cluster-randomized, controlled, parallel group design, comparing intervention and control groups using oral-health-related quality of life as the primary endpoint. Compared with the control group, the intervention group had a significantly better oral-health-related quality of life 3 months after the intervention. The intervention group also had a significantly greater sense of coherence, and there were small, though statistically significant, improvements in oral health behaviors and gingival health. One implication is that children’s gingival health and oral-health-related quality of life can be improved by a school-based intervention that targets the psychosocial determinants of oral health rather than oral health behaviors themselves.</p>
<p>Findings were strengthened by mediation analysis, a powerful statistical method used to identify factors responsible for benefits observed in the primary endpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034512462579">MacKinnon and Luecken, 2011</xref>). Specifically, the investigators evaluated intermediate endpoints to determine which were responsible for observed improvements in four aspects of oral-health-related quality of life: oral symptoms, functional limitations, emotional well-being, and social well-being (Nammontri <italic>et al</italic>., 2012). They found that improvements in perceived oral health function were attributable to the effects of the intervention on sense of coherence and oral health symptoms, but not to the effects of the intervention on oral health behaviors or gingival health. In other words, children’s health behaviors and oral function benefited from the intervention, although the latter was not a consequence of the former. In a biomedical model, this might represent another instance where patients are contrary, but when viewed as a manifestation of their sense of coherence, it starts to look rational.</p>
<p>As with the findings from any single clinical trial, the results from this study require verification in other settings before the interventions can be recommended for wider implementation. Studies of longer duration will be necessary to determine whether the intervention needs to be repeated, its health benefits persist, or other health benefits accrue. This intervention targeted groups, so additional research is needed if it is to be adapted for individual patients. Future investigations will do well if they apply the same theoretical and methodologic rigor demonstrated in the study conducted by Nammontri and colleagues.</p>
