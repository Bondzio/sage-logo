<title>The Problem.</title>
<p>Empirical evidence shows that corporations struggle with managing their progressive societal involvement in a global and transparent marketplace. The field of organization development (OD) has so far mostly neglected to acknowledge these struggles, despite being ideally positioned for developing the missing corporate citizenship (CC) management capacity of corporations. This is problematic, as OD fails to address a problem that has detrimental effects on both corporate functioning and society, therewith also defaulting on an opportunity to position itself as continuously relevant in the future.</p>

<title>Statement of the Problem</title>
<p>Empirical evidence shows that multinational corporations in particular have considerably increased their investments in corporate citizenship (CC). For example, public–private partnerships have grown 50-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1523422312446056">Arevalo &amp; Fallon, 2008</xref>), the involvement in multistakeholder partnerships has increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1523422312446056">Rochlin, Zadek, &amp; Forstater, 2008</xref>), and voluntary regulatory bodies have been established, such as the Forest Stewardship Council, the Marine Stewardship Council, and the Global Business Coalition on HIV and AIDS. Also, many multinational corporations have made themselves accountable to voluntary standards as put forward by the Global Reporting Initiative and the International Organization for Standardization.</p>
<p>At the same time, evidence exists that corporations increasingly struggle with managing their progressive societal involvement in a global and transparent marketplace. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1523422312446056">Lougee and Wallace (2008)</xref> benchmarked the Standard &amp; Poor’s (S&amp;P) 500 and Domini 400 companies using the KLD Research &amp; Analytics database. The authors showed that corporations weakened in their overall ability to manage their responsiveness to the ever-growing responsibilities emerging in a global market place, despite the fact that the same corporations have been increasingly willing to adopt CC programs and policies for augmenting this level of responsiveness. The reason for this lack of responsiveness has been framed as a gap between intentions to adopt CC programs and policies and “management tools for practically realizing such intentions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1523422312446056">Porter, 2008</xref>, p. 397). Therefore, neither a clear strategic understanding nor a tool set for managing CC has emerged yet. Interestingly, this gap exists despite the increased prominence of discussions in the management literature of how to best manage CC.</p>

<title>Organization Development (OD) as an (Untapped) Solution</title>
<p>This article proposes that OD expertise is needed for filling the gap between intentions and realization, thereby increasing the responsiveness of corporations to societal trends, demands, and responsibilities that emerge globally. Unfortunately, OD so far has mostly neglected to position itself in this realm. As a response, the purpose of this article is to argumentatively align OD expertise and CC goals. Thereby, the article answers the question of how the field of OD can support corporate stakeholders and OD professionals to tackle the important issue of CC. Such an immediate relationship with CC is proposed as essential for OD, as ever more corporations face issues of societal responsiveness in an increasingly global and transparent marketplace.</p>
<p>The alignment between OD expertise and CC goals is undertaken in three argumentative steps. First, ontological consentaneity between OD and CC is identified, making the pursuit of core values and core goals possible. This consentaneity has been obscured by the persistent reference in human resource development (HRD) and OD literature to traditional notions of corporate social responsibility (in this article, OD is considered a “component of HRD”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1523422312446056">Swanson &amp; Holton III, 2001</xref>, p. 257). Rather, the conceptualization of corporations as <italic>citizens</italic> being involved in society is more congruent with governance in a global marketplace. This particular conceptualization is a prerequisite to unleashing OD expertise for the positive development of CC. After this first argumentative step, the second step becomes possible which is to identify large areas of conceptual overlap between OD and CC. This identification again leads to the third step which is a concrete assessment of OD relative to the timely and important topic of CC. Hereby, examples are offered through which OD researchers and practitioners can become active in the realms of CC. Finally, implications for research, theory, and practice are discussed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1523422312446056">
<title>Context and Definitions</title>
<p>The argumentative steps are especially relevant due to the consequences of a global marketplace on corporate functioning. Hereby, leaning on the understanding of transnationality as developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1523422312446056">Bartlett and Ghoshal (1992)</xref>, a global marketplace is understood as having the following two characteristics: (a) corporations need to build and legitimize “multiple diverse internal perspectives able to sense the complex environmental demands and opportunities” (p. 522) on a global scale, in order to then (b) frame and establish management processes “by function, across businesses, among geographic units, and over time” (p. 525) that accommodate these demands and opportunities. Therefore, corporations have to be globally integrative and locally responsive, making them “intertwined with global political, social, and environmental issues that will force them to redefine their role” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1523422312446056">Tichy, McGill, &amp; St. Clair, 1997</xref>, p. 4). The proceeding sections will discuss what this interconnection with global political, social, and environmental issues entails for corporations as well as for OD.</p>
<p>The following definitions are important to make explicit before investing in the three argumentative steps. Hereby, CC is defined as a
<disp-quote><p>process of identifying, analyzing, and responding to the company’s social, political, and economic responsibilities as defined through law and public policy, stakeholder expectations, and voluntary acts flowing from corporate values and business strategies. Corporate citizenship involves actual results (what corporations DO) and the processes through which they are achieved (HOW they do it). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1523422312446056">Post, 2000</xref>, p. 29)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The particular character of this definition, and implications for corporations, CC management, and OD, are more thoroughly discussed while discussing the second argumentative step, which also applies for the following definition of OD:
<disp-quote><p>any process or activity, based on the behavioral sciences, that, either initially or over the long-term, has the potential to develop in an organizational setting enhanced knowledge, expertise, productivity, satisfaction, income, interpersonal relationships, and other desired outcomes, whether for personal or group/team gain, or the benefit of an organization, community, nation, region, or, ultimately, the whole of humanity. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1523422312446056">McLean, 2006</xref>, p. 9)</p></disp-quote>

<title>Argumentative Step 1: The Becoming Ontology of OD Work for CC</title>
<p>The first argumentative step identifies the ontological consentaneity between OD and CC. When analyzing ethical codes of OD and HRD, as well as recent theoretical discussions in the field, ontological foundations become obvious that are well in congruence with those that underlie CC. This consentaneity calls for the pursuit of CC visions through OD work, thus creating one combined <italic>becoming</italic> ontology as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1523422312446056">Lee (2001)</xref>. In this case, becoming ontology means that the two ontological foundations of OD and CC in fact describe just one phenomenon, the being of which “is constituted by its becoming” (p. 330). Unfortunately, references made in the field of HRD and OD to traditional notions of corporate social responsibility have prevented the creation of such a becoming ontology. This again has led to an absence of much needed OD expertise when developing the CC management capacity of corporations.</p>
<p>Ethical codes in the field of OD have long referenced the social responsibility of OD work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1523422312446056">Human Systems Development Consortium, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1523422312446056">Organization Development Institute, 1991</xref>), encompassing human rights, environmental preservation, social justice, and the “quality of life in human society at large” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1523422312446056">Human Systems Development Consortium, 2005</xref>, p. 70). Similarly, the Academy of Human Resource Development highlighted HRD professionals’ “responsibilities to the community, the society in which they work and live, and the planet” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1523422312446056">Academy of Human Resource Development, 1999</xref>, p. 1229). Beyond such ethical reasoning, adopting a societal responsibility view has also been described as being in the self-interest of the field: “If we don’t add societal value along with client satisfaction, we will be replaced by others who will” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1523422312446056">Kaufman &amp; Guerra, 2002</xref>, p. 110). Consequentially, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1523422312446056">Hatcher (1997)</xref> called for improving corporations’ social performance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1523422312446056">Packer and Sharrar (2003)</xref> conceptually linked the notion of lifelong learning and corporate social responsibility. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1523422312446056">Bierema and D’Abundo (2004)</xref> argued that “HRD has a unique opportunity to educate organizations about social responsibility” (p. 444). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1523422312446056">Wirtenberg, Abrams, and Ott (2004)</xref> stated that “OD can play a key role in identifying best practices in socially responsible business behavior” (p. 477). Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1523422312446056">Fenwick and Bierema (2008)</xref> saw HRD units “well positioned to help develop understanding and implementation” (p. 25) of CC initiatives.</p>
<p>However, balancing such commitment to societal goals with the performance needs of employees and organizations has been identified as a key challenge to OD and HRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1523422312446056">McGuire &amp; Cseh, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1523422312446056">Ruona, 2000</xref>). This has meant that discussions about achieving societal goals have remained deadlocked in the more general ontological discussion about whether to adopt a performance or development/learning perspective for HRD and OD. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1523422312446056">McLean and McLean (2001)</xref> as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1523422312446056">McLean (2006)</xref> stressed that HRD and OD should benefit not only individuals and organizations but also communities, nations, and humanity in general. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1523422312446056">Bierema (2009)</xref> saw the pivotal role of HRD in “humanistically facilitating development and change” (p. 69). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1523422312446056">Kuchinke (2010)</xref> proposed that human flourishing should be a guiding value of HRD. More cautiously, however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1523422312446056">Fenwick (2011)</xref> asked “just what particular purposes of human development can be advanced by workplace educators-cum-HRD practitioners within capitalist work relations” (p. 87). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1523422312446056">McGuire, Cross, and O’Donnell (2005)</xref> stated more explicitly that “intrinsic demands of the performance paradigm are not compatible with humanistic approaches in HRD” (p. 135). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1523422312446056">Swanson (1999)</xref> saw HRD as limited to “the purpose of improving performance at the organizational, process and individual/group level” (p. 3). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1523422312446056">Wang (2008)</xref> argued for not overstretching the boundaries of the field of OD by including societal development as an explicit goal.</p>
<p>Proponents of corporate social responsibility within the field of HRD have tried to bridge the performance versus development/learning perspectives by proposing that HRD should pursue both economic performance and societal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1523422312446056">Garavan &amp; McGuire, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422312446056">Hatcher, 1999</xref>). Work of bridging is usually commendable but not necessarily so regarding the issue of OD and CC because bridging implicitly means accepting the existence of two entities that need to be bridged, in this case performance versus development/learning. This acceptance also means that discussions about CC within the field of OD will remain deadlocked in these discussions about performance versus development/learning. The current ontology of CC, however, is not any more affixed to this distinction. Conceptualizations of CC have moved away from distinguishing between distinct levels of responsibilities of corporations, that is, economic/legal versus ethical/discretionary responsibilities, as categorized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1523422312446056">Carroll (1979)</xref>. Rather, CC has been merged strategically with core purposes of the business and as a consequence has left behind the relevance of the distinction performance versus development/learning. A new ontology is emerging, not as a result of bridging but rather as the result of a synthesis of the ontological essence of OD and CC.</p>
<p>This synthesis is best described by looking at the four distinct goal categories inherent in definitions of HRD and OD, as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1523422312446056">Hamlin and Stewart (2011)</xref>. First, the goal of improving individual and group effectiveness can very well be analyzed from a CC perspective. Research has shown that CC increases the organizational commitment of employees to their organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1523422312446056">Peterson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1523422312446056">Turker, 2009</xref>) and reduces turnover rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1523422312446056">Vitaliano, 2010</xref>). This phenomenon might be due to the fact that the opportunity to grant support “strengthens affective organizational commitment through a ‘prosocial sense making’ process in which employees interpret personal and company actions and identities as caring” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1523422312446056">Grant, Dutton, &amp; Rosso, 2008</xref>, p. 898). As a result, when strengthening the CC management capacity of an organization, OD might very well strengthen the effectiveness of employees and employee groups at the same time, so that the distinction between performance versus development and learning ultimately becomes less vital. Regarding the second goal of increasing organizational performance, research documented the positive relationship between CC and organizational performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1523422312446056">Orlitzky, Schmidt, &amp; Rynes, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1523422312446056">van Beurden &amp; Gössling, 2008</xref>). Therefore, OD work undertaken with the goal of advancing the CC management capacity of an organization might directly contribute to organizational performance. Third, the goal of developing knowledge, skills, and competencies is also vital for CC so that OD expertise developing these assets is crucially relevant for building CC management capacity (this argument is discussed in greater detail in the following two sections). Fourth, the goal of enhancing human potential and personal growth is rather easily relatable to CC, as CC can be seen as a great vehicle for sense making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1523422312446056">Peterson, 2004</xref>), work satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1523422312446056">The Aspen Institute, 2008</xref>), and empowerment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1523422312446056">Kjonstad &amp; Willmott, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on these arguments, a becoming ontology of OD work for CC emerges that does not look any more for compromises between performance versus development and learning by delicately balancing societal needs within capitalist constraints. Rather, the becoming ontology is built on new threads of arguments that organically synthesize the essence of the seemingly separate ontological foundations of performance versus development and learning. This new becoming ontology hereby is by no means built on the naïve notion that win-win situations that simultaneously benefit both the economic and social bottom line are always possible. Rather, this is a <italic>becoming</italic> ontology just for the fact that new ways of rationalizing performance and learning and development are required to adequately assess business’ role in society today. Hereby, rationalizing occurs less in dichotomies than in synthesizing processes. With its expertise in synthesis and processes, OD is well positioned to contribute to this kind of rationalizing toward a new becoming ontology. This ultimately promises to unleash OD expertise for the purpose of developing the much needed CC management capacity of business organizations. Based on this notion of a becoming ontology, the next section offers insights into how synthesizing processes and the unleashing of OD expertise for the positive development of organizations’ CC management capacity might be conceptualized.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1523422312446056">
<title>Argumentative Step 2: Conceptualizing OD Work for CC</title>
<p>In a global marketplace, characterized by retreating nation states and governments, with business paradigms omnipresent as models of governance at all levels, and political authority shifting to the corporate sphere, the corporate involvement into global and societal governance becomes an issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1523422312446056">Moon, Crane, &amp; Matten, 2005</xref>). The phenomenon of this corporate involvement is analyzed by using the term <italic>corporate citizenship</italic>, rather than the more common <italic>corporate social responsibility</italic>, because the focus shifts away from responsibilities toward citizenship behaviors, such as participating within a process. CC has therefore been defined by emphasizing the process (see section Context and Definitions), which again directly brings OD expertise into play.</p>
<p>The emphasis on the process, as the means through which relevant CC outcomes are achieved, has appeared as a rather new emphasis in the literature. Previously, the literature has described the results of corporations’ involvement in societal governance with notions of corporate social responsibility. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1523422312446056">Waddock (2006)</xref> highlighted that it is not enough anymore to ask corporations to perform good social responsibility deeds (i.e., philanthropy), which are often not affiliated with the core business. Rather, this involvement should be more broadly and organically understood as the general “impacts that a company’s strategies and operating practices have on its stakeholders and the natural environment” (p. 5), both globally and locally. As a consequence, Waddock asked for focusing on the infrastructure that “has evolved to pressure companies to change how they implement their business models, not just to get them to ‘do good for society’” (p. 7). The notion of CC therefore moves away from circumscribing mainly philanthropic roles and responsibilities that a corporation would (voluntarily) have. Rather, a particular CC profile of a corporation has now begun to be understood as <italic>becoming</italic> into existence as a direct consequence of experiencing and investing in a <italic>process</italic> of societal involvement in a global marketplace. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1523422312446056">Logsdon and Wood (2002)</xref> suggested that employing a process perspective for the phenomenon of corporations’ societal involvement promises to “illuminate the structural and moral ties among business organizations, human beings, and social institutions, and to offer guidance on the rights and responsibilities accruing to each type of actor in the global socio-politico-economic environment” (p. 160). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1523422312446056">Crane and Matten (2008)</xref> supported this view because such a perspective “helps us understand this new empirical reality” (p. 30) of corporations’ involvement in global and societal governance.</p>
<p>The increased emphasis on processes regarding the issue of CC has broad implications on corporations. The notion of corporate social responsibility has demanded corporations take on responsibilities for the larger benefit of society. The notion of CC, however, includes not only responsibility but also membership. Alluding to above, this means that corporations have increasingly become structurally tied to global and societal governance, as active actors that directly shape such governance through their resources and their large set of behaviors. Therefore, the focus is not on responsibility anymore but on the impacts that a corporate actor generally has on society, by being a deliberate and active member of society.</p>
<p>The consequence of seeing corporations as deliberate and active members is rather significant, mainly because it includes intellectual, behavioral, and attitudinal challenges. This as a first step becomes clear if one consults the larger body of literature on citizenship. Therein, it has been stated that active membership involves active and reflective cooperation, critical thinking, creative thinking, reflective thinking, comparative thinking, systems thinking, problem solving, cooperative and collaborative skills, integrating new knowledge in existing knowledge structures, identity shifting, relating to the environment without losing identity and values, deliberate dialogue and questioning, and being able to read signals within an unfamiliar situation.</p>
<p>Translated to an organizational entity, corporations have to have the capabilities for proactive and participatory consideration of collective responsibilities, to connect the notions of private and public work inside the organizational life, to operationalize its relationship with stakeholders and their environment, and to find systematic approaches of internal learning. Therefore, the organizational capacities that are needed to implement and sustain a process-based approach to CC within an organizational setting are understood as
<disp-quote><p>the ability to nurture, develop and frame processes that continuously create, evaluate, and verify corporate citizenship practices inside the organization, thus finding ways for proactive, participatory, and vigilant considerations of collective responsibilities and systematic approaches of internal learning, which are continuously influenced by external experiences. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1523422312446056">Stolz &amp; McLean, 2009</xref>, p. 175)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This identification of the organizational capacities needed in a next step directly points to the expertise OD is able to bring to bear for the positive development of these capacities. OD is familiar with effecting change in complex global systems, thereby applying a system worldview to understand how organizations (should) behave within their larger environment. This familiarity with organizational behavior within complex global systems fits closely with the new behavioral challenges posed for organizations as the result of a process and membership-oriented approach to CC. Therefore, OD is well suited for helping organizations understand and process external influences and for translating external influences to internal organizational development needs. This bridging-function across organizational boundaries, and the expertise to effect relevant internal change, is complemented by the strong expertise of shaping change holistically and sustainably. The field possesses the appropriate skills to effect change that is deeply and continuously supported because the establishment of participatory involvement, trust, systematic learning, feedback, and continuous evaluation is paramount. Such deep and continuous support is crucially important when developing corporations’ CC management capacity in the ways highlighted in this section.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, research has identified a structural distance between a firm’s CC mandate and the HRD or OD units. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1523422312446056">Fenwick and Bierema (2008)</xref> showed that professionals within these units often do not perceive themselves as connected to such a mandate. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1523422312446056">Zappala (2004)</xref> found these units as not influential regarding CC and rather finds the corporate public affairs department gaining in importance in this realm. The purpose of the next section is to discuss the scope and role of OD when developing corporations’ CC management capacity, thus enabling a process and membership-oriented approach to CC.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1523422312446056">
<title>Argumentative Step 3: OD for Developing CC Management Capacity</title>
<p>With a field as versatile as OD, it would go beyond the scope of this article to highlight the breadth of tools available for theoretically and practically developing the CC management capacity of corporations. Yet this section intends to provide an impression that developing CC through OD is not only possible but also warranted because OD positions itself as crucially important for theoretically and practically advancing the CC agenda.</p>
<p>From a theoretical perspective, an understanding of the role of OD and of OD practitioners theoretically links the ontological foundations of CC to developmental actions that are enacted with the goal to bring about positive CC outcomes. Therefore, OD has more to offer than just being a nucleus of change for developing CC management capacity. OD could also be a field within which future CC policy as well as CC outcomes become envisioned in a particular way, before actual development occurs. This means that OD might be able to shape not only the development of the CC management capacity of a particular organization but also how the general issue of CC might become manifest, visible, and actionable to stakeholders internal and external to the organization. This might crucially influence how corporations behave regarding the issue of CC and which CC outcomes they achieve. It is about time for OD to assume this kind of responsibility.</p>
<p>From a practical perspective, the involvement of OD in CC promises to bring about better initiatives for developing corporations in their increased involvement in global and societal governance. Hereby, three possible areas have been emphasized in recent research literature, all of which require core OD expertise: structure, leadership, and employees. First, research has shown that exemplary CC management occurs in a diversified network structure with decentralized nodes that constantly feedback information and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1523422312446056">Appels, van Duin, &amp; Hamann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1523422312446056">Fenwick, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1523422312446056">Stolz &amp; McLean, 2009</xref>). These findings are in congruence with notions of decentralization, diversity, network structures, and feedback as raised in the broader literature of OD. Therefore, given the structural characteristics seemingly inherent in effective CC management, employing OD expertise for developing these characteristics is promising. Second, leadership traits for effective CC management have been found conducive that are familiar to the OD literature. For example, the studies of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1523422312446056">Hind, Wilson, and Lenssen (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1523422312446056">Kakabadse, Kakabadse, and Lee-Davis (2009)</xref> identified the following leadership traits to be effective when managing CC: systems thinking, reflective thinking, long-term vision, embracing diversity and ambiguity, balancing global and local perspectives, engaging in meaningful dialogue, making the business case for CC, and gaining personal and emotional awareness. These research findings directly point to core OD and HRD expertise, namely, to knowledge as created in the literature about leadership development. Therefore, OD is already well suited for developing leadership traits that are conducive for effective CC management. Third, developing employee involvement is equally important for CC management and OD. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1523422312446056">Appels et al. (2006)</xref> as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1523422312446056">Howard-Grenville, Nash, and Coglianese (2006)</xref> found high degree of employee involvement an important component when managing CC. OD has the expertise to develop the high levels of employee involvement needed.</p>

<title>Implications for Research, Theory, and Practice</title>
<p>The possible roles of OD from a theoretical and practical perspective directly lead to the discussion of possible research, theoretical, and practical implications. In the realm of research, prospective studies might look at the reasons why many HRD units and/or OD professionals have so far mostly refrained from taking on responsibility in the realms of CC. By gaining understanding in this realm, internal and/or external obstacles facing these functions and OD professionals can be tackled in the future. Possible solutions might be found in the areas of (a) how the next generation of OD professionals should be educated to reflect the growing global and societal demands on their profession; (b) the scope of objectives to be pursued by OD professionals; (c) task designs of OD positions, as well as competency-sets needed for performing these tasks; and (d) the development of intrapersonal skills such as the capability to proactively and persistently drive processes in complex and ambiguous global contexts. Furthermore, researching best practices that already exist in leading organizations might result in a better understanding of how OD tools can be applied for developing CC management capacity. Arguably, the management literature is prolific about best practices of CC management. However, analyses are lacking about best practices of <italic>developing</italic> CC management capacity of both individuals and organizations. Hereby, thick qualitative descriptions of how “avant-garde” OD professionals concretely go about this task of development might provide the foundational practical knowledge needed for enriching the discussion of how OD can concretely become involved with CC.</p>
<p>In the realms of theory, the field of OD will have to continue to locate itself within today’s world. This means, among other things, defining the general role of OD within society and a global and transparent market place. A plethora of aspects are important to discuss in this regard, and the larger field of HRD has invested in such discussion, sometimes contentiously, for example when discussing National HRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1523422312446056">McLean, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1523422312446056">Wang, 2008</xref>). It would go beyond the scope of this article to reflect on all these aspects. Yet tackling CC is definitely part of the important task of defining OD’s role today. This entails the need for establishing OD models that reflect the becoming ontology of OD work for CC, thereby identifying concrete opportunities for synergistically merging performance and development and learning, for merging financial and social bottom line. Future theoretical discussions might want to build on the arguments made in this article when creating such synergy around the four goal categories of HRD and OD as established by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1523422312446056">Hamlin and Stewart (2011)</xref>. In addition, given the global context within which these discussions are located, it will be vital to theoretically understand the divergent CC management practices and development patterns in different regions of the world.</p>
<p>In the realms of practice, OD needs to offer best practices for building structures that are conducive for effective CC management, for developing leadership skills that are needed for advancing the CC agenda within these structures, and for creating proactive buy-in by employees, so that CC truly can become part of an organization. Other areas of relevance for developing best practices might be strategy development, design of measurement and reward systems, organizational change and/or culture change, task structures, awareness programs, and stakeholder engagement. These additional areas of OD expertise should be analyzed from a CC perspective, as already undertaken from a corporate social responsibility perspective by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1523422312446056">Garavan, Heraty, Rock, and Dalton (2010)</xref>.</p>
<p>Offering research knowledge, theoretical foundations, and practical expertise would be beneficial for at least seven stakeholder groups: (a) senior management, who might think about how to best structure CC within their organizational context; (b) internal corporate offices that have received the mandate, or have taken on the task, of advancing the CC agenda within their organization; (c) line management when ultimately implementing a development plan with the purpose of increasing the responsiveness of the organization to demands and opportunities in global and societal governance; (d) individual change agents within corporations who pursue a similar agenda without yet having a formal mandate, but who strive to build enough support for the CC agenda within their organization; (e) stakeholders in charge of internal corporate learning functions who might integrate the development of the necessary leadership skills in existing leadership-development programs or build new programs around CC; (f) external consultants who advise corporations regarding best practices of how to increase their CC management capacity; and (g) educators in OD and/or management education institutions who prepare the next generation of leaders for prospective leadership and management challenges.</p>
<p>When refraining from pursuing research, theory development, and best-practice-development in the area of CC, OD might fall behind on three fronts: (a) locating OD within a global and transparent marketplace, by not considering the demands and opportunities resulting from an increased corporate involvement in global and societal governance; (b) shaping the timely topic of CC, by not offering crucial OD expertise for advancing the CC agenda; and (c) serving the stakeholder groups outlined above, by not offering them the best practices they need. By falling behind on these three fronts, OD might lose one great opportunity: staying relevant in the future.</p>
