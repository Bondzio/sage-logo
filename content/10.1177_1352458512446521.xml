<p>Never underestimate the pervasive, powerful influence of constructive chaos in medical progress</p>
</abstract>

<body>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) has been known about for a century and a half, give or take. It has been impressively studied at a pathological and clinical level for 100 years, immunologically explored for a staggering eight decades,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512446521">1</xref></sup> and for the last 50 years, research on virtually every front – genetic, epidemiological, neurobiological, imaging, therapeutic, molecular, whatever – has been exhaustively intensive.</p>
<p>And yet, at present, we have so little clue as to the cause that entirely novel concepts, with no previous research background, defying all current logic, cannot just appear from left field, but can dominate and consume both patient group interest, press coverage and research funds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512446521">2</xref></sup> We still have almost no idea.</p>
<p>So a good part of this debating point – that we will remain, 10 years hence, ignorant of the cause of MS – is more than easy to believe. And, given that virtually every commentator, certainly including your current correspondent, has emphatically declared at some point or other (usually a grant application) that a ‘rational treatment must depend on a better understanding of the underlying basis of MS’, surely the absence of a known cause must preclude the emergence of a cure?</p>
<p>Well, only up to a point. For let us not exaggerate the achievements of ordered, rational scientific method in advancing medicine – important, obviously, but in practice very far from enjoying a complete monopoly. Constructive scientific and medical chaos – spotting the unexpected, getting the right result for the wrong reason and by doing the wrong experiment, productive errors, serendipity: all have played, and will always play, huge and vital roles in progress.</p>
<p>Consider the recent history of multiple sclerosis. Concerning genetic research, it might be argued that it was only when the hypothesis-led ‘rational’ strategy, aka the candidate gene approach, was abandoned, and broader, blind sweep screening techniques – GWAS and its sub-types – adopted, that the genetic analysis of MS emerged blinking into the light.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512446521">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>And what of environmental influences? Here, probably the single most important body of knowledge we have, the effect of latitude,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512446521">4</xref></sup> again did not emerge as a result of the prospective, methodical pursuit of an a priori hypothesis. Rather, simple information gathering, then inspired spotting of unexpected patterns, more recently linked to an equally unexpected and hitherto rather bony vitamin, has yielded a most dramatically novel theory concerning the origins of multiple sclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512446521">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>And who might have predicted a decade ago that a long-recognised variant of inflammatory demyelination, Devic’s disease, would turn out to be mediated not just by antibodies to water pores, but to water pores expressed on <italic>astrocytes</italic> of all cells? Science is not predictable.</p>
<p>As for understanding MS, so for treatment. Yes, of course, rational, strategically coherent research has yielded important treatment advances – witness glatiramer, and perhaps most notably in natalizumab.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512446521">6</xref></sup> But so have mistakes and serendipity. Consider β-interferon. We may recognise now its limitations and modest impact, but remember, it was, 20 years ago,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512446521">7</xref></sup> the first <italic>ever</italic> disease-modifying treatment for MS; and still the global combined sales of the β-interferons (which currently command around 75% of the MS market) amount to some $5 <italic>billion</italic> or more. And how did we get to this? Arguably, through an extraordinary series of scientific mistake after scientific mistake. So, thinking MS was caused by a virus (<italic>one</italic>), and that γ-interferon would prove a clinically useful anti-viral agent (<italic>two</italic>), a trial was done.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512446521">8</xref></sup> This appeared to increase disease activity (but was seriously underpowered for this interpretation – <italic>three</italic>). And then, thinking that the principal function of β-interferon was to antagonise γ-interferon (<italic>four</italic>), the former was trialled extensively and far more successfully (though also initially widely interpreted as having clinically valuable effects in preventing the progression of disability: <italic>five</italic>!). Accidents yielding major progress.</p>
<p>So where are we now? No cure, of course – but consider the informative case of alemtuzumab. Again, the scientific rationale for exploring Campath-1H (as it was then) in MS was surely profoundly limited: it was known to deplete lymphocytes, and lymphocytes had to do with MS. (If this seems not a bad rationale, recall how little influence depleting CD4+ve lymphocyte-depleting antibodies had, or indeed antibodies targeting lymphocyte products, such as tumour necrosis factor…). Campath-1H had none of the molecular ‘golden bullet’ feel of natalizumab – and yet it now looks extremely promising. In a recent analysis of the phase 2 trial, just on 75% of 215 patients treated with alemtuzumab were free of clinical disease activity three <italic>years</italic> after treatment – no relapses, no progression. Fifty per cent of interferon-treated patients were likewise free, so again this is no miracle. But even so, these are patients with relatively active or aggressive MS: what might we have given three decades ago to have had a therapeutic weapon such as this? But my point is, might we have <italic>predicted</italic> this?</p>
<p>And so unforeseeability is the key. Even the golden bullet success of natalizumab, whose therapeutic success followed a more rational approach, illustrates the hideous strength of chaos in science, for who could remotely have predicted the emergence of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) (and yet no other infections)? We understand less than we think. Rational, logical science proceeds predictably, but in secure, small steps. Quantum leaps are tales of the unexpected, the unplanned and unanticipated. The restless, frenetic energy of scientists and science itself constantly throws out dazzling meteors of progress. Sometimes these must appear as backward steps, crucial though they may be to any ultimate advance – the re-discovery and re-emphasis on neuron-axon loss in MS might be an example of this. But game-changing progress nonetheless.</p>
<p>So there we have it. We delude ourselves if we believe that strategic, hypothesis-led research means we can foresee scientific progress. Some, yes, but only some: all we can truly predict is that major surprises will occur. Personally I doubt that the surprises will include finding the cause of MS within a decade – though I would not put money even on this. But the absence of a cause by no means implies that no cure will become available in 2022. Current therapeutic research in MS is intense, furiously active and splendidly, uncontrollably diverse – the perfect conditions for accidental discoveries. Who could say this will not include a cure? Watch this space, hang on to your hats and do not dare predict that this disease will not be sorted by 2022.</p>
