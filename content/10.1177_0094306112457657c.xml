<p>Until not too long ago, the racial separation of bathrooms was an important civil rights issue in the United States. Since there were unlikely to be four separate bathrooms, only white women and men could depend on having someplace to pee when traveling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094306112457657">Cooper and Ruth 1999</xref>). Twenty years ago, the gendering of bathrooms became a contentious feminist issue. It was part of the fight for gender equality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094306112457657">Edwards and McKie 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094306112457657">Molotch 1988</xref>). Gendered bathrooms perpetuated gender inequality because there were never enough ladies’ rooms to match their greater need. Arguing for unisex bathrooms, feminists put their bodies on the line by liberating men’s rooms.</p>
<p>Today, the battle has been taken up by transitioning transgenders and by genderqueers who do not identify as male or female, especially on college campuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094306112457657">Brown 2005</xref>). Now, gender-neutral bathrooms are part of the battle for recognition of the rights of people with all sorts of bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094306112457657">Lucal 1999</xref>). Racial desegregation and mandated wheelchair-accessible bathrooms are taken for granted in the United States, but except for single-user bathrooms, gender-neutral public bathrooms are practically non-existent. They would be a radical innovation because they violate the gender order itself, as feminists were doing when we used our “cis-gendered privilege” of clearly identifiable womanhood to breach the “enemy’s” space. The fight for the recognition of ambiguously gendered bodies in shared public places goes further in that it challenges a two-gender social order based on a seemingly bed-rock biological binary.</p>
<p>In <italic>Queering Bathrooms</italic>, Sheila L. Cavanagh invokes Freudian theories of bodily ego and psychosexual development, and Foucaultian theories of discipline or public management of messy bodies, excrement, and other manifestations of biological excrescences to contextualize the reactions to trans and queer breaches of the gender binary represented by toilets. Cavanagh argues that from a public perspective, challenges to the binary organization of who goes where to pee and shit disrupts the successful organization of hygienic public spaces. From a private perspective, being confronted with someone who doesn’t “belong” invokes panic by disrupting the psyche’s carefully developed gender identity, achieved in great part through toilet training. In addition, Cavanagh uses the queer theory concept of heteronormativity to further explain the shocked reactions to the entrance of someone who is read as in the wrong place. However, as Cavanagh points out, it is not an issue of assuming heterosexuality that is at stake—homosexuals and lesbians can be transphobic and trans people can be homophobic—but of assuming the irrefutable normality of the binary gender, sex, and sexuality categories.</p>
<p>Cavanagh’s book is based on 100 in-depth interviews with mostly white, able-bodied, middle- to upper-class graduate students and others aged 18 to 59 who identify as transsexual or transgender, as genderqueer, and as gay, lesbian, and bisexual. There were three self-identified intersex people. They had multicultural backgrounds but were living in Canada or the United States, so their experiences with bathroom access were a Western phenomenon. Many of the interviewees were activists, so they were not naïve subjects.</p>
<p>The results of gender misreadings reported by interviewees range from double takes and verbal challenges to the person’s right to be in that bathroom, to calling security guards and even arrests. Cavanagh says that public safety narratives are the frequent rationale for hostile responses, but the real reason, she speculates, is probably “gender panic”—so-called normals’ disorientation and confusion about their own identities. It may even be a fear of contagion: “Gender non-conformity and/or trans identities are, irrationally, felt to be contagious or, at the very least, disorienting to many non-trans people” (p. 63), but she cites no proof. At that point, it occurred to me that it would have made for a stronger piece of research to have also interviewed 100 cis-gendered (by birth) people about their reactions to encounters with ambiguously gendered people in public bathrooms.</p>
<p>Most of <italic>Queering Bathrooms</italic> is not based on the interviews but on extended descriptions using Foucault, Lacan, and Freud of the ways bathrooms monitor gender. Quotes from interviewees illustrate their experiences of all these forms of monitoring. Cavanagh’s analysis is not derived from them but from queer and psychoanalytic theory. Visual monitoring takes place through panoptic mirrors and “mirrorical returns” of looks between the cis-gendered and the anomalously gendered. Acoustical monitoring adds feminine and masculine voices to appearances to legitimize the use of the proper gendered bathroom. Cavanagh also claims that “urinary acoustics,” the different sounds made by peeing standing or sitting is another form of monitoring, but again, do the cis-gendered really listen for proper peeing?</p>
<p>In the chapter on touching gender and the hygienic imagination, Cavanagh leaps from nineteenth-century Western public health measures to sanitize drinking water and to contain bodily sewage, to the modern gender policing of bathrooms, arguing that “gender impurity” is “sometimes <italic>felt</italic> to be a matter of life and death. Gender incoherence, or, rather, what is taken to be an incongruence between gender identity, the sex of the body, and the insignia on the bathroom door, is metonymically associated with disease” (p. 135). What can be caught indirectly through “cultural infection” or directly through contamination with “abject body fluids” is a compromise to one’s own “gender integrity” (p. 142). The psychoanalytic speculations around blood and menstruation are brought down to earth by a practical problem for still-menstruating trans men—how to get rid of menstrual products in men’s bathrooms, where there are no special receptacles in the stalls as there are in women’s bathrooms.</p>
<p>The chapter on sex in bathrooms, “Sexing Gender: The Homoerotics of the Water Closet,” is particularly dense with queer theory language. Statements like: “queer sex in toilets is an affront to the normative gender identifications that are sanctioned by Western modernity, Christianity, capitalism, and the white nuclear family as a national and colonial icon” (p. 173) seem over the top, until one recalls the explosive public response to Senator Larry Craig’s solicitation of a police officer in an airport bathroom. Not necessarily tied to gender, gay sex in bathrooms is part of the transgressiveness that is the book’s main theme. Ironically, though, as some of the interviewees point out, non-gendered bathrooms would do away with the opportunities for soliciting homosexual partners.</p>
<p>Cavanagh’s intent is to “theorize <italic>how</italic> and <italic>why</italic> the public washroom is a site for gender-based hostility, anxiety, fear, desire, and unease in the present day…” (p. 5). Her main argument is that in bathroom confrontations with gay men, lesbian women, transitioning transgenders and others whose gender identifications cross the binary plumb line, cis-gendered people are confronting the tenuousness of their own gender identifications: “we become gendered around the same time as we learn to use the potty” (p. 213). Gendered bathrooms help to suppress and contain these upsetting emotions. Then how to achieve “the institutionalization of gender-neutral toilet designs …to ensure access for all who depart from conventional sex/gender body politics” (p. 5) without arousing gender panic in the cis-gendered? Cavanagh says that “we need pedagogically thoughtful lavatory designs that will gently guide unsuspecting patrons through non-normative spatial maps. People must not feel as if they are in danger of being undone…“ (p. 218). She offers no further details of these designs other than that they should be “curious and new, physically appealing, and thought-provoking” (p. 218).</p>
<p>Since gendered bathrooms uphold the binary and are part of its regulation, gender-neutral bathrooms would be part of its “resignification” (pp. 54–55). Cavanagh focuses on the interactional confrontations and the psychic and sometimes physical violations oddly-gendered people suffer daily, but the larger issue is not only psycho-cultural but legal. As long as a society has a system of legal gender classification, there is no official mandate for non-gendered bathrooms, the way legal racial desegregation and later, laws governing access for the disabled in public places altered access to bathrooms.</p>
<p>The subject is treated more broadly, albeit with less depth, in <italic>Toilet: Public Restrooms and the Politics of Sharing</italic>, a compilation of eleven essays edited by Harvey Molotch and Laura Norén. Originally presented at “Outing the Watercloset,” a conference held in 2007 at the NYU Center for Architecture, the essays cover a wide range: the authors are from sociology, anthropology, law, architecture, archaeology, history, gender studies, and cultural studies.</p>
<p>In his introduction, “Learning from the Loo,” Molotch says that toilets show “how person and artifact combine in the world” (p. 20). The themes around which the essays are grouped are the “material practicalities” of use, “Living in the Loo;” the gendered, class, ethnic, age, and disability aspects of access, “Who Gets to Go?;” and a rather dispirited prediction of the continued status quo in “Building the Future.” Although gender is not the focus of <italic>Toilet</italic>, Molotch says that “gender runs through it.” Each chapter is illustrated by an amusing “rest stop”: signposts with directional arrows and page distances lead to depictions of all sorts of toilets.</p>
<p>Ruth Barcan, in “Dirty Spaces,” describes the metaphors of boundaries and dirt that abound in the architecture of shared public toilets. She would like to see more sensually pleasing, more practical, and more equal public toilets, but doubts they can be achieved since the boundaries are what contain dirt (of all sorts) and allay the fear of contamination. Following Barcan is a picture of the Harvard Science Center and Bryan Reynold’s brief ironic disquisition on “erotics at Harvard.” He notes that the removal of doors to the stalls in the men’s room to eliminate gay sexual activity increases the homoerotic atmosphere since it enhances opportunities for sensual visibility. In contrast, the presence of doors in the women’s room, which can facilitate lesbian sexuality, are evidence of “Harvard’s complicity in the invisibilizing of lesbianism” (p. 46).</p>
<p>The idea of “looking” is given an historic turn in Zena Kamash’s essay on latrine use in Roman times. Without physical boundaries between users, Kamash describes norms that must have developed to govern “civilized” latrine use in Rome, much like the norms of not looking at the penis of the guy in the next urinal. The latrines were quite large, usually able to accommodate 12 to 15 users, while one had space for 80 to 90. There is no clear evidence of gender-segregated usage. Kamash notes that dim lighting and voluminous clothing probably afforded a certain amount of physical privacy, but a wall mural of seven philosophers chatting about body control while using the latrine (the mural includes text) indicate that chat and conversation were part of the communal experience. Of course, unpleasant smells, sounds, and tactile sensations were also part of the experience, as were potentials for contamination.</p>
<p>“Potty Training,” by Irus Braverman, is a description of the various ways that toilet facilities are standardized, regulated, and automated—the design, planning, and execution are of course done by humans, but the goal is to produce standardized human usage to match automated flushers, faucets, soap dispensers, and hand dryers. There is a bit of a discussion of cultural variation (squat vs. seat toilets) and some complaining internet talk-back from users at being “potty trained” by automation, but for the most part humans are left out.</p>
<p>The next set of essays, “Who Gets to Go,” brings human bodies back. Laura Norén writes an apt essay on the plight of taxi drivers in New York City, who can be fined or at the least, embarrassed, if they pee or defecate in public. She compares their social and physical constraints with the relative freedom of dogs. The problem of the absence of public toilets is followed by Clara Greed’s “Creating a Nonsexist Bathroom,” which is actually about the unequal distribution of facilities that do not match women’s different travel and activity patterns and thus are not gender-equal. She’d like “fabulous, glamorous toilet architecture,” but would settle for toilet provision that made cities and suburbs more livable (p. 131).</p>
<p>Terry Kogan, in “Sex Separation,” goes back to the nineteenth century for the source of one solution to women’s physical needs as they moved out of the home into the public sphere: the provision of separate home-like spaces for them. These were created in “railroad cars, commercial photography studios, hotels, restaurants, banks, post offices, public parks, and libraries” (p. 150). Separate toilets in workplaces were a late addition. “Pissing without Pity,” David Serlin’s account of the mandated changes to public toilets brought about by the Americans with Disabilities Act, also documents the continued lack of accommodation to people with different disabilities, for example, blindness versus wheelchair use.</p>
<p>Separate physical spaces for women also meant men-only spaces, which were breached in the twentieth century in favor of gender-integrated public life; but separate toilets are so embedded in architecture, building codes, and public usage that gender-neutral bathrooms seem utopian or outrageous. Despite the title of the last section, “Building in the Future,” the concluding essays describe little that is new.</p>
<p>“Gender division is sacred” was the politically conservative response to the “Restroom Revolution,” the University of Massachusetts’ Amherst campus effort ten years ago to get some of the residents’ bathrooms and showers designated “unisex.” According to Olga Gershenson, the clinching argument, harking back to the era of women’s protected spaces, was invariably the safety of women students vulnerable to inevitable male violence. Another argument for continued “urinary segregation,” Mary Anne Case notes in her essay, is the opportunity to bond with “one’s own.” She concludes that men will lose that patriarchal privilege as women gain power, run for high-level political office, and congregate in their own VIP bathrooms. Barbara Penner discusses the toilet and art—modernism, post-modernism, and aesthetic transformation. Most of her essay, “Entangled with a User,” is about Alexander Kira’s book, <italic>The Bathroom</italic>, and Peter Greenaway’s film, <italic>26 Bathrooms</italic>.</p>
<p>“On Not Making History” is Harvey Molotch’s account of the unisex bathroom that never got built at NYU’s new facilities for the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis. He says, “It was a lost opportunity to inscribe social change into architectural form and to use form to facilitate intellectual growth” (p. 264). But it did not have enough supporters who were willing to fight for it. He and Norén produced sketches of large and smaller unisex bathrooms of the future that I thought were terrific. But then, I have been promulgating gender-neutral bathrooms for 35 years.</p>
<p>Both <italic>Toilet</italic> and <italic>Queering Bathrooms</italic> serve as an introduction to the importance of toilets for studies of the body, gender, and sexuality. Cavanagh’s extensive usage of psychoanalytic and queer theory language and analysis could prove heavy going for those unfamiliar with them, so it is a more likely text for advanced students. <italic>Toilet</italic> would be interesting supplementary reading at any level. Both should generate lively class discussions of personal experiences and responses to the revolutionary possibilities of the material degendering of our everyday world.</p>
