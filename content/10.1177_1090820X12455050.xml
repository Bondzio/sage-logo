<p><italic>Aesthetic and Reconstructive Surgery of the Breast</italic>, edited by Drs Elizabeth Hall-Findlay and Gregory Evans, covers the gamut of reconstructive and aesthetic breast procedures in 664 pages. The editors gathered input from 66 internationally known contributors, many of whom are well regarded as thought leaders in the field. The breadth of input from these contributors has yielded a truly international summary of the most current techniques in breast surgery, making this volume a great reference for the beginning and seasoned plastic surgeon.</p>
<p>The 42 chapters are arranged into the following categories: Breast Reconstruction, Breast Reduction, Augmentation, Mastopexy and Mastopexy-Augmentation, Developmental Breast Deformities, and Breast Reshaping After Massive Weight Loss. Each chapter has an easy-to-follow format, with sections highlighting Key Points/Terms, Introduction of the Procedure, Patient Selection, and Indications, followed by details of the Operative Technique, Pitfalls, and “How to Correct” them. The advice at the end of each chapter summarizes the personal experience of the author(s), which is helpful. The illustrations and photographs are high quality, offering the reader deeper insight into each technique and allowing him or her to properly prepare prior to embarking on a new technique in his or her practice.</p>
<p>The main book is accompanied by a DVD with 19 videos demonstrating various aspects of the more popular procedures. The quality of these videos varies, but many of them are good and help to further clarify the written volume. The contents of the DVD, as well as the entire text, can be found online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ExpertConsult.com">www.ExpertConsult.com</ext-link>, a website where the purchaser of the text can register and search the text or refer to illustrations. This modern tool is a great adjunct that adds a great deal of convenience for the reader.</p>
<p>The editors and authors of this book have succeeded in providing a reference that focuses on all aspects of breast surgery, drawing on the experience and knowledge of the international authors. The techniques are clearly outlined in text, images, and DVD videos. I would recommend <italic>Aesthetic and Reconstructive Surgery of the Breast</italic> to both the accomplished plastic surgeon and also the newly-graduated resident—essentially, to all readers seeking an accessible “how to” text on breast surgery. The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ExpertConsult.com">ExpertConsult.com</ext-link> feature is an impressive addition that likely represents the future in textbook publishing.</p>
