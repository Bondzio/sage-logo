<p>Using a method based on historical narrative, we argue that the structure of governance regimes impacts the effectiveness of the marketing systems associated with protected geographic indicators (PGIs). A PGI is a form of communal intellectual property that is combined with privately held resources to enable the exclusive production and marketing of traditional specialty food and beverage products. We use two factors to differentiate governance regimes: the heterogeneity of producer interests and capabilities and the level of communal control over production and marketing. Together these factors determine how committed producers are to participation and how strongly they coordinate their actions. Commitment and coordination in turn influence the quality and consistency of production, the effectiveness of promotion, the kinds of placement the product can achieve, and the availability of price premiums.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This study examines the impacts of different forms of governance on protected geographic indicator (PGI) systems. These systems market food and beverage products made using traditional local methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0276146712473116">Barham 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0276146712473116">Paxson 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0276146712473116">Vandecandelaere et al. 2009</xref>). The modern PGI is descended from the <italic>Appellation d’Origin Contrôlée</italic> system used for centuries to control the labeling of French wines. In contemporary usage, a PGI designation is an internationally recognized form of intellectual property that limits the use of specific place of origin names and labels to producers located in that place and producing the specified traditional products. A PGI designation converts previously unclaimed resources (place of origin names) into communal property. A community controlling a PGI designation can exclude unqualified producers who try to use the name in any country that subscribes to the relevant international conventions. In addition to enabling the enforcement of rights, the implementation of a PGI designation imposes formal structure on the systems used to bring these products to market. The formal structure of PGI governance systems determines their effectiveness in delivering the outcomes intended by the agencies and communities that create them.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0276146712473116">Layton (2009)</xref> defines a marketing system as a network of individuals, groups, and/or entities, embedded in a social matrix, linked directly or indirectly through sequential or shared participation in voluntary exchange of value, which jointly creates, assembles, transforms, and makes available assortments of products, services, experiences, and ideas, provided in response to customer demand. The implementation of a PGI designation alters the marketing system by limiting the type and number of actors in the network, defining products and production processes, and limiting the assortment produced. For convenience, we call the resulting marketing systems PGI systems. PGI systems represent an alternative to marketing systems based on product and producer proliferation, anonymous sourcing, mass production, mass marketing, and mass consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0276146712473116">Layton and Grossbart 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0276146712473116">Mitchell, Wooliscroft, and Higham 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0276146712473116">Varey 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Over the last three decades, more than forty nations have completed PGI legislation to take advantage of international intellectual property rights frameworks. This trend has been facilitated by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Intellectual Property Rights Organization (WIPO) of the United Nations, by the World Trade Organization (WTO), by the European Union (EU), and by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) such as the Slow Food Foundation and OriGIn, a Swiss-based NGO that represents PGI producers. This support has been forthcoming because, in theory, PGI systems can help less favored rural communities overcome sustainable development challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0276146712473116">Parrot, Wilson, and Murdoch 2002</xref>). They do this by supporting local producers who are otherwise excluded from or exploited by global supply chains controlled by distant retailers or distributors. PGI systems have been established to help rural populations retain control over local resources, protect biodiversity, stem the flight of young people to cities, support sustainable production systems, and establish traditional products in a wider range of markets, creating a more reliable income stream that is more equitably distributed within communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0276146712473116">Bowen and Zapata 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0276146712473116">Brunori and Rossi 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0276146712473116">El Benni and Reviron 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0276146712473116">Kizos and Vakufaris 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0276146712473116">Tregear et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0276146712473116">Vandecandelaere et al. 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Our principal argument is that the effectiveness of PGI systems depends to a large extent on the formal governance regimes deployed to control them. We define governance regimes in terms of the heterogeneity of producer interests and capabilities that the PGI organization accommodates and the level of communal control that the organization exerts over product and market decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0276146712473116">Perrier-Cornet and Sylvander 2000</xref>). Some governance regimes are relatively inclusive, encompassing producers with a wide variety of interests and capabilities, while others are more exclusive, recognizing as qualified only limited numbers or kinds of producers. Governance regimes also vary in the level of communal control applied to marketing mix variables such as product, pricing, promotion, and placement. Weak communal control leaves decisions concerning the marketing mix mostly to individual producers, while strong communal control governs these decisions collectively. The heterogeneity of interests and capabilities and the strength of communal control have opposing effects on the level of producer coordination and commitment, which in turn influences the effectiveness of the PGI system.</p>
<p>We argue that producer coordination and commitment mediates the relationship between the structure of the governance regime and market outcomes because, in a PGI system, productive resources are private property. To benefit from the communal property created by a PGI designation, owners of private property need to commit resources to producing a reliable, high-quality product and bring those products to market in a coordinated manner. This is easier when producers are fewer and more alike, but being too exclusive makes it difficult to establish a PGI system in the first place, as we describe in greater detail below. Because heterogeneity makes achieving high levels of producer commitment and coordination more difficult, the level of communal control is a concern. Even when producers are more alike, greater communal control may be desirable in order to improve producer commitment and coordination, and thus ensure product quality that can generate benefits in the long run (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0276146712473116">Aubard 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0276146712473116">Barham 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0276146712473116">Kruijssen, Keizer, and Giuliani 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0276146712473116">Ostrom 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0276146712473116">Vandecandelaere et al 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Our method is a form of historical narration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0276146712473116">Abbott 2004</xref>) in which we describe the general structure of PGI systems, how governance regimes differ, and how they function. Our approach is pragmatic because our intention is to develop a narrative of how PGI systems get to be the way they are. From that point we develop propositions about how the structure of governance alters the effectiveness of marketing systems used to implement them. In keeping with this approach, we describe our methods and sources before describing the past and current state of PGIs.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>This study is possible because there are numerous case studies of PGI systems in publications and commissioned reports on rural development, sustainable food systems, and food quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0276146712473116">Aubard 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0276146712473116">Bowen and Zapata 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0276146712473116">El Benni and Reviron 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0276146712473116">Gay 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0276146712473116">Kruijssen, Keizer, and Giuliani 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0276146712473116">Lindkvist and Sanchez 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0276146712473116">Vandecandelaere et al, 2009</xref>).

<p>Our goal is to articulate a relatively simple theory that can be applied widely, and which may inspire new discussions and directions for further research. As a review of existing studies, our method for this article has been reading, analyzing, and organizing primary and secondary documents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0276146712473116">Abbott 2004</xref>), rather than acquiring data through archives, surveys, interviews, or observation. This method is appropriate because the study’s focus is on the ideas and patterns found in the literature, rather than the details of specific local action.</p>
<p>The majority of the cases listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0276146712473116">Table 1</xref> represent products that benefit from PGI status. Some of the non-EU cases have been accorded PGI status under the EU regulations. In at least one case (<italic>Ciliega di Lari</italic> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0276146712473116">Tregear et al. 2007</xref>), the development process ended with the producers declining to pursue protected status. Three of the products in the table have chosen to secure trademarks rather than GI status. In two cases, the PGI designation has been contested in developed markets (Blue Mountain and Ethiopian coffee marks).</p>
<p>Most of these cases are published in reports to development agencies, in training materials, or in scholarly articles seeking to influence policy. We have tended to emphasize cases reported by more than one source, but all of the cases listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0276146712473116">Table 1</xref> have contributed to our understanding of these issues. By identifying themes that repeat across cases, we develop a generalized view of the structures, actors, and institutions that connect PGI to marketing systems and their efficacy. This allows us to gain insights into how governance systems help PGI systems become economically self-sustaining and supportive of environmental and social justice.</p>

<title>A Primer on PGIs</title>
<p>Several different geographic indicator marks are in use, affording different levels of protection, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0276146712473116">Figure 1</xref>. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0276146712473116">Table 2</xref> lists the categories defined by the EU, variants of which are used worldwide. The weakest designation is Traditional Specialty Guaranteed (TSG). Relatively few products have been registered as TSG, since its protections are minimal. Two examples are <italic>Jamon Serrano</italic>, a traditional ham produced in Spain from “white footed hogs,” and recently Neapolitan Pizza, which now can be applied only to a specific style of pizza. Products using a TSG label can be produced anywhere, as long as they conform to the specification underlying the name. Protected Geographical Indicators (PGI) are designations that identify a good originating in the territory of a WTO TRIPs (Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) signatory that has a given quality, reputation, or other characteristic of the good essentially attributable to its geographical origin. A PGI designation creates an enforceable right under TRIPs. The product has to originate (be produced) in the territory, but does not have to be uniquely linked to the territory. Two examples are <italic>Turrón de Alicante</italic>, a honey almond nougat typical of the Alicante region in Spain, and Beacon Fell Traditional Lancashire Cheese, a traditional cheese from Lancashire, England. Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) marks correspond to the highly restrictive historical <italic>Appellation d’ Origin Contrôlée</italic>. PDO designations are limited to products whose quality and characteristics are due exclusively or essentially to the geographical environment, including both natural and human resources. Many appellation wines that draw their character from a limited <italic>terroir</italic>, such as Médoc, fall into this category, as do other unique products such as Native Shetland Wool and <italic>Guanxi mi you</italic>, the pomelo fruit peculiar to Pinghe County in Fujian province, China.</p>

<p>Because the TSG mark affords little or no protection, when we refer to PGI designations we mean both PDO and PGI marks. PGI marks are less restrictive than PDO marks. They represent the minimum conditions for creating an enforceable right, and thus are the more general class.</p>
<p>PGI designations are intellectual property, supported by a specific type of marketing system. PGI designations are communal property resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0276146712473116">Hess and Ostrom 2007</xref>) and are thus managed under a different logic than private property. A PGI designation is created on the basis of a specified territory, for the benefit of the community, region, and nation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0276146712473116">Barham 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0276146712473116">Grote 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0276146712473116">Paxson 2010</xref>). Place of origin is linked to the choice of what to produce and how to produce it. The creation of value is bound up with community by the fixed nature of agricultural production. More than other production, farming is tied to place. We discuss three aspects of PGI labels and systems before discussing governance regimes: PGI systems as marketing systems, PGI designations as intellectual property, and the functions of PGI designations.</p>
<sec id="section4-0276146712473116">
<title>PGI Systems as Marketing Systems</title>
<p>Two kinds of constraint make PGI systems distinct from conventional marketing systems. First and most obvious is the emphasis on geographic location, traditional ingredients, and traditional methods. This excludes most potential entrants from joining the system. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0276146712473116">Layton (2007</xref>, 230) observes that “Deciding which entities (individuals, groups, businesses, and networks) are to be included is an essential step in system specification or modeling, where the choices made define system boundaries and identify inputs and outputs.” Marketing system designers also have to make this decision although in organically developed marketing systems, it is usually emergent. The decision of whom to include must be explicitly considered when establishing a PGI because it is a requirement for acquiring the property right. Geography determines which communities and institutions provide infrastructure to and derive benefit from PGI systems. As shown in the map below, which depicts a set of PGIs in the Cognac region, the distinctions between regions are often fine grained.</p>
<p>The second constraint limits the designation to specialty products, produced in traditional ways. The assortments offered by PGI systems are severely restricted, a limitation that is typically justified as a trade-off for the exclusive rights granted to the label. Any PGI system is essentially a legalized marketing cartel, whose reach is limited to a single highly specified product category. The intention is that producers will excel within these narrow limits. This is both a requirement of the logic of valuing traditional production and a way to accommodate the anticompetitive nature of PGI designations within the open competition that characterizes broader consumer markets.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0276146712473116">
<title>PGI Designations as Intellectual Property</title>
<p>International law only recognizes PGI labels that are created and administered as communal property under national law. National PGI legislation establishes rules for determining the boundaries of the protected region and establishes authorities charged with developing and monitoring the codes of practice that complete the connection between production and environment. The organization that holds controlling authority can be a government agency or a parastatal organization, such as a regional collective. The controlling organization alone has the right to take action to exclude or qualify producers, although third-party certifiers are often used to verify qualifications. Rights to access and use the communal resource are not alienable by either the controlling organization or the members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0276146712473116">Hess and Ostrom 2007</xref>). The right to use a PGI designation cannot be sold or transferred, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0276146712473116">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>PGIs differ from ordinary trademarks and labels. Trademarks are defined as names and symbols owned and protected by single-entity producers to identify, differentiate, and market their goods and services. Trademarks are intellectual property. Labels (as the term applies in this study) are mandatory or voluntary certifying marks controlled by third parties that do not produce the products being certified. Examples of labels include the marks associated with ISO standards, California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF) organic production marks, and the EU’s Certification of Compliance registry for passenger cars. Many environmental labels have also acquired trademark status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0276146712473116">Grote 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0276146712473116">Henson and Humphrey 2010</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0276146712473116">Figure 3</xref>, PGI products often carry additional labels that reinforce the quality proposition. Scottish Salmon, for example, carries both the PGI label and a Label Rouge quality guarantee mark.</p>
<fig id="fig3-0276146712473116" position="float">

</fig>
<p>Geographic indicators are similar to trademarks because they are marks used by producers to identify and differentiate goods. Unlike trademarks created by firms, however, they are applied to traditional products that were not originally identified with a single producer. In effect, a PGI designation changes an unprotected name, appropriable by any producer, to a communal resource accessible only to qualified participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0276146712473116">Hess and Ostrom 2007</xref>). This is why geographic labels that have already been appropriated into common use (such as Greek yogurt or Cheddar cheese) are difficult to convert into PGI designations. Geographic indicators are also like quality assurance labels because they indicate traditional, “typically” higher quality products. This dual character has led to the development of separate treatment for PGIs under international law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0276146712473116">Grote 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0276146712473116">Josling 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0276146712473116">Parrot, Wilson, and Murdoch 2002</xref>). </p>

<title>Functions of PGI Labels</title>
<p>PGI labels serve two functions: property rights protection and quality assurance. The first function is to establish intellectual property rights that give PGI organizations, and through them communities, greater control over their traditional products by excluding nonqualified producers from using the label. The effectiveness of the organization in defending and developing a PGI label is critical to the development of market systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0276146712473116">Layton 2009</xref>) that connect specialized traditional production to global consumer markets. Without defensible property rights in the indicator, communities find it hard to justify investment in development of marketing system infrastructure (supply chain, promotion, placement, pricing, and protection) that preserves local control of economic, social, and environmental benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0276146712473116">Aubard 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0276146712473116">Barjolle and Sylvander 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0276146712473116">Belletti et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0276146712473116">Brunori and Rossi 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0276146712473116">El Benni and Reviron 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0276146712473116">Kruijssen, Keizer, and Giuliani 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0276146712473116">Vandecandelaere et al. 2009</xref>). This intellectual property rights function is explicitly codified in the international frameworks governing geographic indicators.</p>
<p>How enforceable this right is depends to a large degree on the level of development of a nation’s institutional infrastructure. We define institutional infrastructure in terms of the political, economic, and social matrix in which the system is embedded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0276146712473116">Layton 2009</xref>). Institutional infrastructure is more highly developed when an economy enjoys political and social stability; transparency of government (particularly as concerns equitable arbitration for contract resolution and property rights); and economic and cultural systems that support markets, innovation, and distribution of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0276146712473116">Khanna, Palepu, and Bullock 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0276146712473116">Lundvall et al. 2002</xref>). Institutional infrastructure also reflects the existence of related and supporting industries that facilitate particular kinds of economic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0276146712473116">Porter 2000</xref>). A more highly developed infrastructure makes it less costly to exercise property rights, and less costly to deploy more complex forms of governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0276146712473116">Khanna, Palepu, and Bullock 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The second function of PGI labels is to serve as a quality assurance mark that helps consumers outside traditional market areas make decisions about purchases of experience goods like wines or traditional foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0276146712473116">Gay 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0276146712473116">Grote 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0276146712473116">Henson and Humphrey 2010</xref>). This function, which is as necessary for the success of a PGI system as the property rights function, is not part of international law. Instead, this function depends on product, promotion, and placement. It is often assumed that to create benefits, a PGI product needs to be marketed outside the region of origin. In recent years, this placement process has been facilitated by the recognition that some consumers in global markets put a premium on provenance and the social construction of the meaning of a product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0276146712473116">Gamble and Taddei 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0276146712473116">Jacobsen 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0276146712473116">Josling 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0276146712473116">Marsden, Banks, and Bristow 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0276146712473116">Moschini, Menapace, and Pick 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0276146712473116">Parrot, Wilson, and Murdoch 2002</xref>). The quality assurance function of a PGI label benefits from this broad social movement that values developing sustainable agriculture and rural economies through market-oriented action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0276146712473116">Mitchell, Wooliscroft, and Higham 2010</xref>). PGI products are similar to fair trade products in that they appeal on the basis of experience qualities <italic>and</italic> because they help better the lives of producers. The idea that purchasing PGI products allows consumers to support less favored producers, whether they are from France, Benin, or Thailand, connects with what Varey calls welfare marketing (2010), a system in which the development of quality of life for producers and consumers is paramount.</p>
<p>From a policy perspective, one way to make this function more effective is to create more PGI marketing systems. More systems mean that more PGI products will be placed in global markets. This creates potential for positive spillover effects between products bearing PGI labels. As more PGI products are created and widely distributed, consumers will become more familiar with the PGI concept. If their experiences are positive, consumers may begin to value PGI labels more. A second policy goal is therefore to encourage higher quality PGI products, in order to create network effects that make all PGI designations more valuable.</p>
<p>The prospect of protection from industrial competition while benefiting from a potentially valuable quality assurance mark is often sufficient incentive for the creation of a PGI designation. Once a designation is acquired, getting producers to fully commit to integrating their operations into the PGI system is an ongoing challenge. Failing to overcome this challenge can undermine the quality assurance function. If producers hold out resources or production, the system may never achieve sufficient scale to penetrate global markets and return benefits to the community. If producers do not coordinate their production and marketing activities, the quality assurance mark will be less reliable, reducing the benefits to all producers. As we discuss in the following sections, producer coordination and commitment depend on the incentives created by governance regimes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0276146712473116">
<title>Governance Regimes for PGI Systems</title>
<p>We define governance regimes in terms of the heterogeneity of capabilities and interests among participating producers on one hand and the level of communal control over production and marketing decisions granted to the PGI organization on the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0276146712473116">Brunori and Rossi 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0276146712473116">Tregear et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0276146712473116">Vandecandelaere et al. 2009</xref>). The membership of a PGI system can be homogenous or heterogeneous, depending on how inclusive is the qualification specification implemented by the organization. The level of communal control adopted by the organization is also the result of a negotiated process. Negotiation over who qualifies and the level of communal control sometimes continues beyond the initiation of the system. Stronger communal control appears to be more common in economies where institutional infrastructure is more highly developed, since this makes it less costly to resolve tensions between private property and communal rights.</p>
<p>We should also note that PGI systems depend on formal governance mechanisms such as legislation, charters, and contracts. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0276146712473116">Weber and Mayer (2011)</xref>, we acknowledge that formal systems often displace informal systems of relations. Many PGI systems are established in settings where informal governance mechanisms based on trust and familiarity have long been dominant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0276146712473116">Hammin and Marrucci 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0276146712473116">Lindkvist and Sanchez 2008</xref>). When existing informal systems are disrupted by new entrants or new interactions between local institutions and global markets, formal governance can restore balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0276146712473116">Ostrom 1990</xref>). The introduction of formal governance does not mean that informal, relational governance mechanisms play no role in the success of PGI systems. Indeed, much of the argument that follows is based on the idea that formal governance mechanisms can support the emergence of trust and commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0276146712473116">Ostrom 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0276146712473116">Weber and Mayer 2011</xref>). Because PGI systems are defined by formal governance structures, we focus on formal attributes that determine the effectiveness of each structure.</p>
<p>Identifying the product and qualifying producers are essential steps in the PGI application and implementation processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0276146712473116">Vandecandelaere et al. 2009</xref>). Defining the product, its geographical boundaries, the controlling authority, and the code of practice that constitute a PGI system is a contentious process in nearly every case. The legal requirements for granting a protected indication demand that the effects of place, practice, and material must be specifically and uniquely identified, without substantial objection from interested actors. In the reality of the application process, place, practice, and material are seldom so well defined as to produce easy consensus. Producers with a variety of interests and widely different capabilities may insist on being included. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0276146712473116">Tregear et al. (2007)</xref> discuss the case of <italic>Culatello di Zibello</italic> (salumi or cured meat), in which tension between industrial and artisanal producers leads to a dual specification. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0276146712473116">Brunori and Rossi (2007)</xref> trace the history of competing interests and capability sets in the definition of the Chianti region (wine) that led to a pair of designations, Chianti and Chianti Classico. As a practical matter, while community members might wish to strongly restrict participation because of narrow local economic interest or a desire for self-determination, the fact that local, regional, or external resistance can undermine the success of an application process requires most creation processes, and thus the resulting organization, to be widely inclusive. As these examples suggest, a variety of interests must be accommodated through side deals or co-opted if the PGI is to become a reality. The more inclusive the initial processes are, the greater heterogeneity of interests and capabilities there will be among qualified producers.</p>
<p>Products requiring more processing steps are also more likely to have heterogeneous membership. Perrier-Cornet and Sylvander (2000) frame product-based differences in terms of whether a PGI is sectoral or territorial. Territorial forms of governance have also been called a supply chain approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0276146712473116">Marsden, Banks, and Bristow 2000</xref>). Collective organizations in territorial regimes distribute power among a mix of producers from different stages of the supply chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0276146712473116">Brunori and Rossi 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0276146712473116">Tregear et al. 2007</xref>). The organization that controls a territorial regime is called an “inter-professional organization” in EU administrative codes and specifies qualifications at every stage of production. The purpose of territorial governance regimes is to maintain or develop multistage local activity systems which are of necessity heterogeneous. Examples of products produced under territorial governance include many animal products (e.g., Parmigiano–Reggiano cheese) or highly processed vegetable products such as olive oil because these require the involvement of farmers, processors, and packers.</p>
<p>In contrast, a sectoral governance regime focuses on a single stage of the value chain, and centralizes power among producers at that stage. A good example of sectoral PGI governance comes from the Café de Colombia PGI. The controlling organization is the <italic>Federación Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia</italic>, which is controlled by coffee growers, although some independent processors and shippers are also members. Another example is the winemaker syndicates that control most French and Italian wine PDOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0276146712473116">Brunori and Rossi 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0276146712473116">Perrier-Cornet and Sylvander 2000</xref>). Growers who are not winemakers are represented, but usually have little voice because the PGI regulates winemaking rather than viticulture. Grapes have to be certified as coming from the protected region and being the right varietals but farm practices (e.g., tillage, fertilizer) are not regulated. In sectoral PGI systems, producers tend to be more homogenous in what they do, but are still likely to have differences in capabilities and interests among them.</p>
<p>PGI governance regimes can involve strong communal control, with formal collective determination of the distribution of benefits following from coordinated decisions about production volumes, pricing, promotion, and placement. Communal control can also be weak, exerting little control over any aspect of the marketing system except in limiting the use of the label to qualified products. When communal control is weak, informal governance mechanisms will tend to play a more important role. Because the level of communal control is the result of a negotiated process, it is relatively independent of the heterogeneity of producer interests and capabilities. Although greater coordination along the supply chain would appear to be desirable in territorial PGI systems, weak governance is not uncommon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0276146712473116">Arfini et al. 2003</xref>). In sectoral PGIs, communal control is often weaker when producers actively compete. The only examples of strong communal control in sectoral governance we found occur when producers pool their output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0276146712473116">Deshpande and De Royere 2004</xref>). Weak communal control is by far more common than strong communal control in all types of PGI systems.</p>

<title>Propositions: The Impact of Governance Regimes on PGI Marketing Systems</title>
<p>We are now in a position to develop propositions about the impact of governance regimes on PGI marketing systems. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0276146712473116">Figure 4</xref>, we propose that two elements define governance regimes: the strength of communal control and the heterogeneity of producer interests and capabilities, and that both influence producer coordination and commitment. These in turn influence the PGI marketing system and the development outcomes that are the <italic>raison d’être</italic> for most new PGI systems. Our model has this form because, as said in the introduction, a PGI system marries communal property in the form of the PGI designation to the private property that must actually be deployed for the system to work. For the combination of communal and private resources to create value, producers must be willing to coordinate their operations to some degree, and to commit those resources to production within the PGI system. It is important to recognize that participating in a communal scheme may expose producers’ returns from private resources to opportunism, additional administrative costs, and requirements for new investments. Participation may also limit a producer’s ability to make independent decisions, and thus limit producers’ ability to act in their own self-interest. We first discuss the relationships between the two factors that constitute governance regimes and producer coordination and commitment, and then detail the ways that producer coordination and commitment enable the creation of value in the PGI system.</p>

</fig>
<p>When the interests and capabilities of producers vary widely, on average producers will be less willing to tie themselves to each other or fully commit to working within the PGI system. This heterogeneity may be found within stages of the value chain, where producers may compete directly, and between stages, where incentives may vary from grower to processor to packer. In both cases, producers have to be aware of and guard against opportunism and the risk that other participants will appropriate returns to the producer’s private resources.</p>
<p>Opportunism based on differences between producers within a sector can take several forms. Producers who generate higher volumes may use the PGI as a means of protecting themselves from down cycles in commodity prices, but divert production into commodity markets when prices are up. Producers with lower capabilities may divert lower quality product into PGI systems, in hopes of free riding on the label, especially if higher quality producers are fully committed. Producers who improve quality and reliability are able to combat this by building their own brands on the backs of the collective, as seems to have been the case in the Beacon Fell cheese PGI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0276146712473116">Tregear et al. 2007</xref>) and is often the case in wine PGIs (e.g., a single producer dominates a protected region). When one producer improves quality more than others, the product can carry the PGI label but the estate label creates more value and is difficult to free ride on. The benefits of the PGI become private. When producers have differing capabilities and interests, they have an incentive to compete with each other. Over time, individualization of brand concentrates benefits in the hands of producers who are most likely to succeed anyway, making less capable producers more likely to opt out of participation.</p>
<p>Heterogeneity of producer capabilities and interests across supply chain stages also creates problems with coordination and commitment. The scale of production can vary greatly across different stages of the supply chain. Typically, the downstream players of the supply chain, such as processors and retailers, have more power because they consolidate inputs from smaller upstream suppliers. In some new PGI systems, value creation depends on the goodwill of a single processor or distributor, or is appropriated by producers with more effective methods or resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0276146712473116">Aubard 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0276146712473116">Barjolle and Sylvander 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0276146712473116">Belletti et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0276146712473116">El Benni and Reviron 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0276146712473116">Lybbert, Barret, and Narjisse 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0276146712473116">Kizos and Vakufaris (2011)</xref> discuss the Greek case of Lesvos Island olive oil and show how most of the value is appropriated by smaller bottlers who control access to high margin distribution. This often leads to producers becoming price takers who see no benefit from the additional costs of coordination and commitment.</p>
<p>This problem can be exacerbated by the expansion of a PGI to incorporate larger geographic regions. The result of a large geographic footprint has often been the industrialization of PGI production. The geographic limits of PGIs are often more inclusive than the name indicates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0276146712473116">Guieu 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0276146712473116">Perrier-Cornet and Sylvander 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0276146712473116">Vandecandelaere et al. 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0276146712473116">Melo (2010)</xref> shows how expanding the geographic footprint undermined the exclusiveness of the Cacao Arriba PGI system in Ecuador. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0276146712473116">Bowen and Zapata (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0276146712473116">El Benni and Reviron (2009)</xref> discuss the case of the Mexican PGI for mezcal. The area of the mezcal PGI is very large (all or part of five states). The code of practice addresses only the source and percentage of agave, aging requirements, and location of production. Because the PGI covers only the distillation process and not growing, this is a sectoral governance system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0276146712473116">El Benni and Reviron 2009</xref>). Because the whole supply chain is not part of the PGI system, traditional methods have been squeezed out as large distillers acquire real estate that gives them the right to the label. The large region and differing capabilities of agave producers expose many small growers to a boom and bust cycle that leaves them at the mercy of distillers.</p>
<p>While these same effects can be felt in a small homogenous group of producers, the intimacy and proximity of similar producers in small regions makes informal social control of opportunism and appropriation more effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0276146712473116">Ostrom 1990</xref>). This is seen most clearly in small PGIs where individual producers compete directly with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0276146712473116">Tregear et al. 2007</xref>). For example, most French PGI wines are labeled by appellation and producer estate. This provides a strong element of traceability that reduces the risk of free riding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0276146712473116">Raynaud and Valeschini 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0276146712473116">Stearns 2010</xref>). Proximity creates an environment where participants have means to monitor each other closely. Even in large PGIs with multiple processing stages, PGI organizations can be designed to increase the homogeneity and proximity of producers. The cheese PGI systems <italic>Formaggio Parmagiano-Reggiano</italic> and <italic>Gruyère de Comté</italic> have a consortium form in which producers at each stage belong to local cooperatives and interact mostly with neighbors. This structure reduces the effects of the heterogeneity of producer interests and capabilities.</p>
<p>As Lindkvist and Sanchez (2008) point out, “excessive social proximity” lends itself to increased reporting on and shaming of neighbors who cheat (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0276146712473116">Ostrom 1990</xref>). This enables small, self-contained, relatively homogenous communities to rein in opportunism and appropriation without a formal commitment of rights to a collective organization. In many societies, traditional communal control is an effective mechanism for regulating communal and common pool resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0276146712473116">Ostrom 1990</xref>). We should point out that Ostrom demonstrates that traditional mechanisms are often highly formal and that formality tends to increase as the heterogeneity of the community increases. The common threads in these cases lead us to conclude that designing a PGI system to include a wide variety of producers will make it less likely that producers will fully coordinate operations or commit fully to PGI production. Thus, our first proposition is as follows:
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Proposition 1</italic>: The heterogeneity of producer capabilities and interests will be negatively related to the average level of producer coordination and commitment to the PGI system.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>Designing PGI systems for greater communal control of production and marketing decisions is a means to offset these problems and increase producer coordination and commitment, and thereby improve system outcomes. Although it seems self-evident that qualification standards that favor heterogeneity in producer interests and capabilities are likely to increase the difficulty of establishing strong communal control mechanisms, some of the most heterogeneous PGI systems have strong communal control while some very homogenous ones present very weak communal control mechanisms. The two constructs are thus relatively independent in practice as well as concept.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0276146712473116">Figure 4</xref>, we think there are two paths through which strong communal control influences coordination and commitment. First we expect positive but diminishing returns on communal control: while very low levels of communal control do little to encourage coordination and commitment, overbearing control may lead producers to withdraw resources as their self-interests are supplanted by collective decisions. In most systems, producers become strongly committed when communal control is moderate—the grazier commits the whole herd, the grower delivers the whole crop for processing. When this occurs, additional mechanisms for control cannot have effects except to add costs. For any PGI system, we would therefore expect the strength of communal control to have optimal effects at levels short of full collectivization. This proposition is speculative because it is based in large part on the absence of cases where control over PGI production and marketing is fully centralized. No PGI system is a full hierarchy in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0276146712473116">Williamson’s (1985)</xref> sense or a centrally planned collective in the totalitarian sense. In some French PGI systems that use a <italic>Label Rouge</italic> quality assurance mark, production and marketing are highly coordinated by means of negotiated contracts, but these leave producers free to keep some qualifying resources out of the PGI system.</p>
<p>Considerable evidence exists among our cases showing that where communal control is weak, producers are much more likely to withdraw resources from the PGI system. Weak communal control can lead to overproduction and the intrusion of industrial practices into the PGI that drive down prices to a level where the costs of participating in the PGI are greater than the benefits. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0276146712473116">Brunori and Rossi (2007)</xref> describe the case of the Chianti wine PGI, where the absence of communal control led first to mass production, followed by quality degradation and eventually by falling prices and producer exit. They contrast this with the more rigorously controlled Chianti Classico, which retained both its value and the commitment of its producers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0276146712473116">Melo (2010)</xref> describes a similar process in the case of Cacao Arriba, which originally created a price premium through coordinated production and marketing. The price premium attracted the interest of unqualified large-scale producers, who negotiated the expansion of the geographic footprint and thus weakened communal control. This was followed by a reduction in coordination and product quality, the erosion of the price premium, and the diversion of qualifying resources into other crops. In the case of Lesvos Island olive oil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0276146712473116">Kizos and Vakufaris 2011</xref>), many qualifying producers prefer to avoid the costs of participation. They sell to large cooperative processors that have not adjusted operations to meet quality requirements in the higher-margin markets in which PGI oils compete. To induce higher levels of processor coordination, the PGI organization would have to orchestrate production and marketing throughout the value chain. Where strong communal control of production and marketing exists, as in many French poultry and meat PGIs, coordination along the value chain has resulted in high levels of producer coordination and commitment and contributed to market success. This leads us to our second proposition.
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Proposition 2</italic>: The strength of communal control over production and marketing decisions will have a positive but diminishing relationship to the level of producer coordination and commitment to the PGI system.</p>
</list-item>
</list>

<p>The strength of communal control can reduce the negative effects of producer heterogeneity on producer coordination and commitment. As we have already argued, when producer interests and capabilities are homogenous, producer coordination and commitment will be comparatively high. Adding stronger communal control over production and marketing to a homogenous system may not produce sufficient benefits to justify the additional costs of organizing. Stronger communal control might reduce some abuses of free-riding and appropriation by strong competitors, but this would tend to drive these stronger producers out of the system rather than help them conform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0276146712473116">Guieu 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The argan oil PGI in Morocco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0276146712473116">El Benni and Reviron 2009</xref>) provides further illustration of ways that communal control alters the effects of producer heterogeneity. The PGI organization includes Moroccan distributors, mechanized cooperatives that produce standardized higher quality oil for international channels, and the artisanal women’s cooperatives based in Berber clans that were the original object of the development process. The difference in interests and capabilities between the two types of processor has produced an imbalance in participation and benefits. The artisanal cooperatives are mostly reduced to supplying limited quantities of hand-processed oil to traditional markets. The mechanized cooperatives and distributors serve global markets through bulk exports that do not capture added value. The value of artisanal PGI products is diminished and small producers pushed out when industrial producers dominate. In addition, the argan oil system depends almost entirely on common pool resource rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0276146712473116">Ostrom 1990</xref>). The women of the Berber clans have traditional rights to gather fruit from trees that grow mostly on public lands. Because access by other harvesters is also possible, and because there is little monitoring of the remote locations where harvest occurs, no central control governs resource extraction. This increases the threat that the resource will be overexploited. There is also no central control of quality or promotion.</p>
<p>As Lybbert and his coauthors (2002) demonstrate, these factors limit the capacity of the project to generate sustainable development, because they concentrate power in the hands of buyers. Because the major buyers of argan oil are outside the system, they have little incentive to limit their purchases, which is likely to accelerate degradation of the basic resource as collection and extraction efforts intensify to meet global demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0276146712473116">El Benni and Reviron 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0276146712473116">Lybbert, Barret, and Narjisse 2002</xref>). Stronger communal control of extraction, processing, and distribution would provide for more effective management of the resource. The organization that controls the argan PGI is moving toward the incorporation of some of these activities. A similar case can be made for the Mexican mezcal PGI, where the lack of communal control minimally constrains the behavior of distillers in their relationships with growers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0276146712473116">Bowen and Zapata 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, strong communal control has induced high levels of commitment in PGIs where producers are very heterogeneous. The consortium form of European cheese PGI systems accommodates differences in scale, time horizons, and capabilities by organizing producers at each stage of the value chain and giving each stage effective representation in the governing body. These organizations gain local control over opportunism and practice while giving up local control of marketing decisions. French multistage poultry PGIs have solved the problem of coordinating production and marketing across the supply chain by placing decisions in the hands of a central council that sets volumes and prices, and controls promotion and placement. These systems combine small-scale local producers into cooperatives that match the scale of much larger processors and distributors, without handing the power to the larger partner. Café<italic> de Colombia</italic> achieves similar levels of control by pooling output, although this PGI system has recently begun to allow some locations and estates to market even more specialized premium products because benefits from this distinction are shared with the community at large. The social cohesiveness of members, supported by PGI rules that accommodate adaptation to local conditions, contributes to the efficacy of this PGI.

</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0276146712473116">Figure 4</xref> shows, we expect producer coordination and commitment to mediate the relationship between the factors that define the governance regime and the outcomes of marketing and production activities. This mediation is part of our model because, as indicated previously, the governance regime can have little effect on outcomes if it does not influence producer commitment and coordination. While governance regime factors might directly affect outcomes, we would expect these effects to be suppressed by the inclusion of producer commitment and coordination, and difficult to interpret if we left the mediating effect of producer commitment and coordination out of the model. This is partly because our model is presented as static for the sake of clarity. If we made the model dynamic, we would expect feedback from the outcome variables to influence producer commitment and coordination even if the governance regime were static. More success would lead to more commitment and even more success, thus obscuring the relationship between governance regime factors and outcomes, especially in a cross sectional look at the population of PGI systems.

</list-item>

</p>
<p>We expect producer coordination and commitment to positively influence the effectiveness of PGI marketing system activities. High levels of producer participation have three effects: they help ensure that joint promotion efforts are supported by reliable product quality; they should increase the scale of production, facilitating wider placement and acceptance of PGI products in global markets; and they should lead to more uniform pricing and a more uniform limited assortment. While a limited assortment reduces consumer choice, it would also reduce uncertainty about the product experience. The global success of PGI products like <italic>Parmigiano-Reggiano</italic> and Café<italic> de Colombia</italic> provide positive illustrations of this claim. Prices are high and stable, the assortment is small and uniform and branding is effective. The cases of Chianti (and many wines produced under weak sectoral governance), argan oil, and <italic>Cacao Arriba</italic> provide counterexamples. Where commitment and coordination are low, quality varies considerably, prices vary, and promotion efforts are fragmented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0276146712473116">Vandecandelaere et al. 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>As noted earlier, these results occur because the quality assurance function of a PGI label depends on reliable high quality and coordinated promotion, as well as consistent placement and pricing that reduce consumer uncertainty before and after the initial experience. The quality assurance function will also be more effective if consumers motivated by the impact of their consumption on producer welfare see that producers are more committed to and fully coordinated within the PGI system, since this is a powerful indication that the system is delivering benefits to producers and their communities.

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>Our analysis suggests that for PGI systems to be effective, designers have two options. They can create systems based on compact regions, populated by producers whose qualifications, capabilities and interests are relatively homogenous, or create systems in which the level of communal control is sufficient to overcome the adverse effects of participant heterogeneity but still offer a degree of flexibility to producers. These factors influence the level of producer commitment and coordination, which in turn change the effectiveness of the marketing system by supporting collective promotion efforts, increasing the consistency of the assortment, and making it possible to place the product more widely in consumer markets. We think that this would tend to make pricing more uniform, and price differentials more directly attributable to quality. Under “lemon” pricing logic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0276146712473116">Akerlof 1970</xref>), if consumers lack the information to differentiate between products but know that some PGI goods are inferior, prices overall are likely to be constrained. It should be more effective to have uniform quality and pricing.</p>
<p>We have argued that the design of governance regimes indirectly influences the outcomes of the marketing system. PGI systems combine communal intellectual property with the private resources of producers. The exercise of communal control and the variety of producers influence the willingness of producers to commit resources to PGI production and coordinate that production with competitors, buyers, or suppliers. Producer commitment and coordination create benefits in part because consumers who value producer welfare may be persuaded by the involvement of producers in the governance of the system. They also create value by facilitating consistent promotion and placement and by changing the scale and reliability of production. Producer participation in PGI systems also produces social and environmental benefits. It keeps small-scale producers, including family farms, on the land, using methods that are less damaging than those of industrial food systems. Participation helps channel benefits to producers fairly, and through them to the community. Commitment and coordination enable self-determination of how the local economy functions.</p>
<p>If a PGI system is intended to produce benefits for producers participating in regional supply chains, or for regions where producers have varying interests and capabilities, stronger communal control becomes essential. If a PGI system is intended to protect small-scale homogenous artisanal production, low levels of communal control may be appropriate. Producers who are close together and similar are more able to monitor each other and to coordinate their offerings informally. The PGI organization becomes a third-party arbiter in the enforcement of rights with little role in the effectiveness of the system. The products of some homogenous small-scale systems have historically been effective in markets. The wine PGI systems where this form is prevalent have traditionally enjoyed significant market share in global markets. However, their dominance is being challenged by non-PGI products that emphasize winemaker’s skills and varietals rather than the protected region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0276146712473116">Gamble and Taddei 2007</xref>). This trend may be exacerbated by PGI producers who “produce to rule,” meeting only the minimum qualifications of the system. These producers free ride in safety and enjoy the benefit of the label without producing a superior product.</p>
<p>Other actors play a role in establishing PGI systems and the actions they take can influence the choice of governance regime. Agencies that help develop PGI systems often do so to support sustainable rural development. These agencies tend to favor weak governance and heterogeneous producer bases because doing so facilitates the co-optation of actors whose objections might prevent the system from being established. Since most agency-supported PGI projects aspire to do more than simply protect a place of origin name—they create access to global markets, create incentives for environmental stewardship and maintain, and enhance rural communities—it may be impossible to avoid being inclusive of producers with widely varying interests and capabilities. If this is the case, the implication is that development agencies must find a way to establish systems with higher levels of communal control. Up to the present, creating systems with heterogeneous producer bases and low levels of communal control has not delivered the desired results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0276146712473116">Arfini et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0276146712473116">Aubard 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0276146712473116">Melo 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In some projects, it may be possible to facilitate the creation of consortium style governance by bringing together local producers within each of the sectors concerned with the PGI. Establishing local sectoral cooperatives within a PGI that covers multiple stages of processing would lead to stronger communal control, because the sector cooperatives, rather than each producer, would participate in negotiating volumes, prices, practices, and promotions. This would require the explicit resolution of competing interests within each sector and their subordination to the interests of the whole. For example, in the argan oil PGI system resolving the differences of interest and capability that separate different kinds of cooperatives might lead to better conservation of the resource, a coordinated effort to recapture value added activities from outside buyers, and a more equitable distribution of benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0276146712473116">El Benni and Reviron 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0276146712473116">Lybbert, Barret, and Narjisse 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Actors other than development agencies can influence the level of commitment and coordination producers exhibit. If a single entity controls any stage of the supply network, the willingness of producers to commit and coordinate depends on that entity’s goodwill. When Starbucks is the major purchaser of single origin coffee or a firm like Honest Tea or Aveda is the only buyer of a community’s unique product, then conflict arises between the rights of the community and power of the purchaser. The purchaser’s brand and the PGI mark come into conflict, and unless the PGI system presents a strong coordinated response, the buyer is likely to come out on top.</p>
<p>Every scenario we have discussed leads to the conclusion that appropriate levels of communal control are essential to the functioning of PGI systems. Greater communal control is also consistent with the goals of development agencies and other advocates for environmental and social justice. Higher levels of communal control impinge on the property rights of individual producers, but since the intellectual property is managed collectively, the important norm of community self-determination is not violated. Producers surrender control because the collective can do what most producers cannot—develop the product, circumvent opportunistic behavior, and manage the brand. The advantage of communal control is that when it is matched with collective intellectual property rights and managed within the framework of national and international law, PGI systems may have a greater potential for creating sustainable rural development than do individual rights resulting from private property. When each producer is free to act as they will within the limits of the code of practice, quality will be uneven and benefits will flow primarily to intermediaries or producers who would be competitive anyway. Only by bringing a mix of stakeholders together within a strong governance regime can a project guarantee equitable distribution of benefits within a community. Paradoxically, this means that although PGI products are tied to place, the crucial issue is not place but collective action and cocreation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0276146712473116">Lusch and Webster 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0276146712473116">Varey 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Most of what we advocate here is not feasible under United States trademark law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0276146712473116">Barham 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0276146712473116">Josling 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0276146712473116">Stearns 2010</xref>). The United States is not a Lisbon signatory and has largely opted out of the applicable parts of TRIPs. The United States Patent and Trademark Office is nominally open to granting geographic trademarks to collectives, such as 100% Florida orange juice or Tennessee Whiskey, but the ease with which such applications are objected to means that few marks that grant exclusive use of origin names are actually registered. The nearest thing to recognized PGI designations in the United States are the American Viticultural Area designations administered by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the Treasury Department rather than the Patent and Trademark Office.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, an active and growing movement promotes place of origin food products in North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0276146712473116">Barham and Chazoule 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0276146712473116">Hammin and Marrucci 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0276146712473116">Jacobsen 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0276146712473116">Paxson 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0276146712473116">Slow Food Foundation 2011</xref>). Although many products are sold only in local markets, a drive toward coproduction can lead to something approaching a strong territorial model. The Caves at Jasper Hill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0276146712473116">Jacobsen 2010</xref>) represents a cocreation model in which producers cooperate with a processor in a way that ensures equitable allocation of the benefits of selling into national markets. Local Vermont cheese makers can develop their own brands and benefit from being associated with the Jasper Hill Farm brand. The emergence of craft malt producers using locally grown heritage grains may provide the basis for regional coproduction of beer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0276146712473116">Smith 2012</xref>). More generally, “new generation” cooperatives such as Country Natural Beef and Land O’Lakes have begun to vertically integrate into value added processing to create greater benefits to their members. Because this integration often means opening cooperatives to partners in different parts of the supply chain, the question of who benefits from this expansion of activity is also relevant. An important direction for future research in this area is to examine the question of whether any homologue of a PGI system is actually feasible under United States law. We think the best practices of PGI governance have already begun to inform the management of a variety of cooperatives in the United States.</p>
<p>This study has several limitations, each of which represents an opportunity for future research. First, our proposition concerning diminishing returns to producer commitment from increasing communal control is based on an absence of evidence rather than examples of overly strong communal control. It makes sense to us that producers would commit strongly once some threshold of control is passed, since this would allow them to operate within a single system rather than trying to keep some operations separate. Cases showing how increased control leads producers to withdraw would make this a much stronger argument. We also passed over the opportunity to discuss the effects of scale imbalances between supply chain stages. In olive oil, Label Rouge poultry and many cheese PGIs, organizers need to develop systems for disposing of excess production or processing capacity. Both cases deserve further study. Finally, we do not discuss the dysfunctional outcomes that might emerge from PGI systems, although in the mezcal, argan oil, and Cacao Arriba cases we have examples where this happens. A more specific focus on dysfunctions could produce an interesting extension of our theory.</p>
<p>This study has described PGI systems and derived propositions concerning the ways that the design of governance regimes alters the elements and outcomes of the associated marketing systems. A marketing system is a “network of individuals, groups and/or entities, embedded in a social matrix, linked directly or indirectly through sequential or shared participation in voluntary exchange of value, which jointly creates, assembles, transforms, and makes available assortments of products, services, experiences, and ideas, provided in response to customer demand” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0276146712473116">Layton 2009</xref>). What our theory proposes is that the composition of the upstream network of individuals groups and entities that produce PGI products, and the organization of linkages between them can change the nature of participation and the effectiveness of downstream activities. These relationships depend on outside actors such as consumers, development agencies, and intermediate buyers, and on the institutional infrastructure each system is embedded in. Each of these helps determine how willing individual producers are to commit resources to PGI production and coordinate activities under communal control. The extent and coordination of participation determine what is possible in terms of delivering PGI products to consumer markets.</p>

<p>Label Rouge is a French quality assurance label that is awarded to products whose “unique conditions of production or manufacture provide reliably superior quality.” It is often acquired in conjunction with a PGI designation, and by definition involves high levels of communal control and coordination between many types of producer. It has been most effective in the provision of poultry products.</p>
