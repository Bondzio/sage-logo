<body>
<p>In a number of recent issues of <italic>Australasian Psychiatry</italic>, there have been articles on suicide prediction and prevention, often written with passion. Regrettably, using lists of risk factors, suicide is not predictable in individuals in any practical sense.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213487236">1</xref></sup> In medicine, with a view to prevention, we have a long history of seeking to predict the onset of illnesses or adverse health outcomes, and thus the inability to accurately identify those who will complete suicide is both unwelcome and frustrating.</p>
<p>We have sought a similitude, another act which could not be confidently predicted by due consideration of risk factors. A good example is women who kill their mates (in Quebec, at least). A 20-year study in Quebec identified 42 females who killed their male partner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213487236">2</xref></sup> Contrary to expectations, only 28% of these females had previously been subjected to violence by their victims, and most did not suffer from mental illness. Twenty percent were intoxicated at the time of the killing. These women rarely gave a warning before killing their mate and the study investigators suggested that ’the homicides were not predictable’ (p. 611).</p>
<p>The failure to predict suicide, or homicide, is consistent with the observation that volitional behavior is internally generated and, from the third person perspective, actions are always unpredictable to some extent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213487236">3</xref></sup> Importantly, however, failing to predict an event does not mean that every effort should not be made to prevent it—in both individuals and groups—and we suspect that this misunderstanding is where much of the heat of the current debate about suicide lies. It so happens that, as clinicians, our best efforts will not always be rewarded and that, at a population level, a broad public health approach offers the best prospect of reducing suicide rates.</p>
