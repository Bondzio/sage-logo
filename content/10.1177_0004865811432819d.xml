<sec id="sec1-0004865811432819d"><title>Andrew Woolford, <italic>The Politics of Restorative Justice: A Critical Introduction</italic>, Fernwood Publishing: Black Point, NS, 2009, 175pp.: 9781552663165 (pbk)</title>
<p>Over the past decade, a huge amount of literature has been published on restorative justice; so much so that some authors have gone as far as to argue that there has been more written about restorative justice than about any other criminological topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0004865811432819d">Cunneen and Hoyle, 2010</xref>). Be that as it may, the truth is that it becomes harder and harder to find innovative books or articles in the field. As a doctoral student, whose thesis has a focus on restorative practices, I must admit that I feel quite anxious at this arguable ‘literature saturation’.</p>
<p>It is particularly when I come across books like Woolford’s that I remember why (on earth!) I have decided to write a thesis on restorative justice: because despite the large volume of literature surrounding the topic, there are still many facets of restorative justice theory and practice left to be further explored. Indeed, there are still no coherent answers to such questions as: which practices can be called restorative? Can/should restorative and criminal justice coexist? To what extent is the community actually involved in restorative practices? Is restorative justice a practice in search of a theory or rather a theory still not fully practised? To name but a few unresolved issues in the field.</p>
<p>Woolford may not answer any of the above questions (and he does not really attempt to), but through a very thought-provoking discourse, he demonstrates that the boundaries of restorative justice are not firmly set and that there is still plenty of room for critical investigations of restorative concepts. Besides, probably contributing more to the field than some ‘maximalist’ advocates of restorative justice would do, Woolford succeeds in his, apparently conflicting, intentions to challenge and make the case for restorative justice, through an allegedly introductory (although rather ‘thick’) theoretical investigation of its political context and political meanings.</p>
<p>Unlike most authors that criticise but end up sticking to Tony <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0004865811432819d">Marshall’s (1999)</xref> famous definition of restorative justice, Woolford does <italic>not</italic> spend time fixing an ‘ideal’ working definition which he could use to further develop his arguments. He also does not try to create (or recreate) a universal restorative justice theory, but instead, chooses to highlight some ‘guiding beliefs’ of the restorative justice movement so as to delineate what he names ‘a restorative ethos’. In this context, he identifies some of restorative justice’s ‘ideal traits’ as a means of presenting a basic framework with which one could generally assess the restorative nature of a given programme (e.g. that restorative is open and actively participatory); he acknowledges some limits to this basic framework by alerting us to the malleability and innate uncertainty of restorative justice (e.g. that restorative justice must adapt its practice to specific harm contexts rather than applying a ‘one size fits all’ approach); and then he argues that restorative justice, as a social movement, has its meaning negotiated (and thus influenced) by a wide range of actors (e.g. state agencies who provide the resources that make the practices of restorative justice possible, practitioners responsible for implementing restorative programmes on the ground, people who attend conferences or write books on restorative justice, and so on).</p>
<p>Furthermore, Woolford clearly expresses his preference for a <italic>transformative</italic> notion of restorative justice that reaches towards social change. In this way, adding colour to his definitional landscape, he advocates that restorative justice should be concerned with more than just the event that triggers the restorative encounter; that it should be about fostering opportunities for individuals and collectives to change their worlds; and, ultimately, that restorative justice should be directed towards addressing injustices and improving people’s lives. Because he adheres to a transformative notion of restorative justice – which also entails the restorative justice need to rethink basic criminal justice assumptions upon which traditional forms of justice are based – Woolford ends up gifting the reader with an in-depth discussion regarding the meaning of injustice (which he sees as the ‘preferable’ trigger event leading to restorative justice). In effect, drawing on the works of philosophers such as Kant, Rawls, Habermas and Derrida, Woolford’s book definitively innovates in the field of restorative justice by spending more time on the question of what it means to be ‘just’, as opposed to on what it means to be ‘restorative’.</p>
<p>Based on this transformative premise, the central argument of the book is then launched: ‘for restorative justice to live up to its transformative potential, there needs to be a deeper understanding of the political contexts in which restorative justice is situated and through which it operates’ (p.18). From then on, the book receives maybe its most creative ‘touch’, precisely through Woolford’s efforts to politicise, in the sense of making something politically aware, the debate around restorative justice. Indeed, claims that restorative justice is ‘transformative’ often sounds to me like a naïve appeal to a ‘restorative miracle’ (a promise that restorative justice will be able to ‘solve all problems’) – and what is worse, a ‘miracle’ extracted from a sort of ‘political limbo’. Contrastingly, Woolford builds his arguments through a careful examination of the current dominant political discourses and their influence on criminal justice thinking in contemporary societies, and his claims are coherently set out around the need for restorativists to mobilise a politics of restorative justice in order to refrain from the political misuse of restorative practices. That is, at the end of the day, in order to avoid conservative approaches to restorative justice theory and the resulting ‘death’ of restorative justice’s transformative potentials.</p>
<p>Along these lines, the book places emphasis on neoliberal politics and its threats to restorative justice’s goal of transformation. In so doing, on the one hand, it raises awareness about the possibility of state actors supporting and adopting the use of restorative justice solely for minor offences – which would otherwise be ignored by the criminal justice system. On the other hand, considering restorative justice agencies’ dependency on government resources (e.g. in the form of funding and/or case referrals), Woolford acknowledges the importance of such agencies speaking ‘in a language that makes sense to, and appeals to, those in power’ (p.129), but draws attention to the related risk of restorativists focusing ‘less on the idealist aspects of their philosophy and more on how to market themselves in terms that will appeal to the neoliberal palate’ (pp.129–130). In other words, Woolford demonstrates the risks of restorative justice being used to foster policies of punitive populism, when in fact it should be about transforming such a contemporary criminal justice ‘plague’.</p>
<p>In the concluding chapter, Woolford recommends some strategic political actions that he believes should <italic>help</italic> to protect the restorative movement against such ‘neoliberal risks’ and enable a <italic>transformative</italic> model of restorative justice. In this way, he suggests that restorative justice should comprise broader deliberative processes (to allow for discussions to go beyond the restorative meeting’s trigger event reaching problems of poverty, racism, inequality, etc.). Also, it should try to change ‘not only thought, but deeply embedded habits’ (which entails encouraging participatory and deliberative practices in day-to-day life and not just within criminal justice settings). Further, he suggests that restorative justice groups should ‘network beyond the realm of criminal justice’, that is, network with other social justice movements, ‘taking into consideration their common goals with community economic development, anti-poverty, anti-racism, feminist, and other such groups’ – to name but a few of his proposals (p.161).</p>
<p>The book adds voice to what I perceive as a recent more critical turn in the academic work around restorative justice. It therefore deserves to be read widely by those who work with, believe in or do not see the point of restorative justice. After all, Woolford’s bottom-line message, delivered in an extremely inspiring tone, is that restorative justice is – and should remain – an evolving concept, always open to debate and critique. I am definitively inspired to discuss this further.</p>
