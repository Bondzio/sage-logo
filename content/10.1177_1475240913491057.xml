<p>In <italic>Global Education under Attack</italic>, Tristan Bunnell presents a wide-ranging and provocative account of how the ideals and expressions of the International Baccalaureate (IB) are being framed and used by a more conservative ‘American’ public that (still) perceives internationalism in the educational domain as unpatriotic, ‘unnatural’ and even dangerous. As Bunnell emphasizes, attacks on international or global education are neither new nor exclusive to the context of the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1475240913491057">Heater, 1980</xref>). What is new, however, is the growing salience of international education under intensifying processes of globalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1475240913491057">Tarc, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1475240913491057">Tarc, 2013</xref>: 1–19). Accordingly, what Bunnell’s analysis makes clear is that with the growing reception of international education as exemplified by IB’s remarkable growth and presence in the USA, comes a more pronounced and quite trenchant opposition.</p>
<p>Bunnell’s introduction (Part A) provides the broad brushstrokes of the text’s overall thesis. It describes the growth and success of IB globally but, more particularly, charts the disproportionately high growth and impact of IB in the USA. According to Bunnell, this uneven growth and success of IB, which includes the three IB programmes across the K–12 spectrum (Primary Years Programme, Middle Years Programme and Diploma Programme), has produced a set of ‘tensions’, such as how to manage growth and retool purpose as attuned to a changing world. The key tension engaged in this text, however, is the under-studied ‘paleoconservative’ (<italic>old</italic> conservative)–informed attack on the IB in the US context. As Bunnell states:<disp-quote>
<p>This book explores an under-looked ‘side effect’ of growth and ‘impact,’ involving a vitriolic and potentially damaging ‘attack’ on the IB in America, the new ‘home’ of the three main programmes. (p. 10)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>To awake the reader to the scope and intensity of the attack, Bunnell shares a number of dramatic quotes labelling the IB as ‘anti-American’, ‘anti-Christian’, ‘secret’, ‘Marxist’, a ‘U.N. scam’, poisonous, and part of a federalist or global conspiracy to remove local control of schooling. Although Bunnell admits that such an attack may seem bizarre to many of us, he presses readers to consider the consequence of the rising paleoconservative mobilization in the USA both for the world generally and particularly – given IB’s success in the USA – for IB. He closes this introduction by pointing to a set of factors that may be in play in the increasingly vocal attack on IB as: the intensification of globalization (read: loss of national/local control), the thinning out of the middle class and attendant anxieties, rapid shifts in (centralized) educational reform, and the more IB-specific aspects of who is included/excluded in IB and with what effects. Although Bunnell suggests that an ‘American’ researcher might take the baton, I am not sure that one’s geographic/cultural location is as important as is committing to the intellectual labour of disentangling the multiple layers constituting and mobilizing conservative imaginaries in the contemporary US context. Bunnell’s book (including his bibliographic sources) represents a very good entry.</p>
<p>The main book chapters provide the background context of global education and the IB, and then detail the nature and implications of the attack. Part B discusses the mainstreaming of global education and the IB, and the emergence of the attack on IB with reference to the key criticisms and their exaggerated claims. It then shifts to the more recent developments of the attack since Bunnell’s (2009) earlier account. In reaction to President Obama and his more liberal/cosmopolitan orientation, rightist factions and movements as the ‘Tea Party Movement’ have become more radical and active and, in this context, the IB has become even more of a ‘lightning rod’. Part C of the book focuses more on the creation and development of the IB, and its evolved relation to the USA, and provides a brief timeline of the more recent critique of the IB. Part D represents perhaps the core of Bunnell’s analysis, where he expounds on the ‘complex nature of the attack’ (p. 71). Here Bunnell attempts to unpack the culture wars or ‘values divide’ between conservatives and liberals along longer historical trajectories and with the more recent impacts of globalization. Most informing are the links made to the writings of paleoconservatives, such as Russell Kirk, advocating for ‘tradition’, natural order and limited intervention by government. Also in the mix are the more recent pressures of globalization that in some way threaten tradition, protectionism, middle-class security and ultimately US (economic) domination. The second half of Part D delineates the ‘main threads of the attack’ (p. 83) that include centralized control of education, politicization of education (read: students as change agents), ‘global’ citizenship as contrary to patriotism and any inkling of the subversion of US sovereignty (as invoked by terms such as United Nations or ‘world government’). Into these threads, Bunnell weaves the problem of how the IB is being used by some middle class parents to gain advantage in the schooling-career nexus, and how this in turn may be threatening to others. To my mind, uneven access to a programme that is, at least partially, supported by government funding does represent a more real tension for IB than the exaggerations or fictions projected on the IB in the context of the culture wars. Part E, ‘Conclusions about the Attack’ (p. 99), provides a space for Bunnell to further expound on the threads he identifies in Part D. Appropriately, Bunnell includes a section where he explains the un-reality of the attack. Finally, in Parts F and G, Bunnell discusses ‘the broader implications of the attack’ (p. 121) and ‘research and analysis required about the attack’ (p. 129).</p>
<p>Given my own scholarly focus on the more liberal and neoliberal supporters and advocates of international education and such exemplary models as IB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1475240913491057">Tarc, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1475240913491057">2011</xref>), for me, Bunnell’s book acts as an important caution and reminder that a significant and increasingly vocal minority do not see international education as a necessary or positive educational trend in a globalizing world, and that even today there are some groups mobilizing strongly against the values and expressions of international education. I argued in <italic>Global Dreams, Enduring Tension</italic>s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1475240913491057">2009</xref>) that the <italic>citizenship tension</italic> had dissipated or transformed in the post-Cold War era. In the early days of IB, ‘international understanding’ was a term most carefully deployed and even downplayed by IB spokespersons so that IB was not deemed to be in conflict with ‘national understanding’. However, beginning in the 1990s, terms as ‘world citizens’, ‘international mindedness’ and ‘global citizens’ began to circulate more frequently in IB discourse and the IB became more explicitly focused on internationalizing the curriculum. In contrast, Bunnell illustrates that the citizenship tension continues to be in play in the context of IB in the USA. Our differing accounts well illustrate how globalization produces opposing pressures and outcomes as ‘integration <italic>and</italic> disintegration’ and ‘cosmopolitanisms <italic>and</italic> reactive, more enclaved nationalisms’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1475240913491057">Appadurai, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1475240913491057">Lingard, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>A key strength of Bunnell’s text emerges from its motivation to take seriously the ‘attack’ on IB as more than mere echoes of the historical ebbs and flows of anti-internationalism, and not simply to dismiss the emergent assemblage of IB’s ‘attackers’ as a unified group of conservative American ideologues or wackos. Notable is Bunnell’s stitching together of the wider shifting conditions (for example of middle class insecurity), US exceptionalism, specific historical trajectories of conservatism, and the actual content of critique being expressed by parents, political pundits, news media and conservative think tanks. Bunnell provides a set of direct quotes from various sources, such as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://truthaboutib.com/">http://truthaboutib.com/</ext-link>, that leave little doubt in the reader’s mind just how strong and sometimes outlandish are the critical claims made of IB and its impacts. Although Bunnell does point out the fictitious nature of many of these claims, he understands that the actual ‘truth about IB’ does not necessarily matter in terms of the momentum and effects of these criticisms.</p>
<p>Before closing this review, I am compelled to make a few supplemental points to Bunnell’s account. First, although the attack on IB is definitely a concern, it is also the case that the IB cannot be mainstreamed and still maintain its distinction (academic capital). With others (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1475240913491057">Bagnall, 2010</xref>), Bunnell acknowledges this point (p. 18). If more conservative families stay clear of IB, there will still be more than enough families willing to consider the benefits of an international education such as provided by the IB. In actuality, the IB Diploma Programme can claim more success in developing students’ academic readiness for university over fostering students’ international mindedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1475240913491057">Tarc and Beatty, 2012</xref>). Indeed, the paleoconservative critique of IB’s internationalist ideals might unintentionally bolster the IB’s credibility for advocates of international education.</p>
<p>To my mind, charges that the IB promotes principles of the United Nations hardly represent criticism. Accordingly, the critiques of IB that have had more traction for me emerge from the ‘underside’, that manifestations of IB have moved too far from their original, idealist aims of international understanding, given individualistic uses of IB as an academic ‘choice option’ to gain competitive advantage in schooling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1475240913491057">Doherty, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1475240913491057">Tarc, 2009</xref>) and the larger implications of such uses in buttressing (transnational) class hierarchy (Lauder, 2007). To be fair, the IB has been working to open up access to its programmes beyond its more traditional base (students from relatively high socio-economic family status) and has been working in an ongoing manner to energize its more progressive and cosmopolitan aims. This movement, from a more classical knowledge approach for fostering international understanding to one of learner dispositions of the progressive learner/global citizen, represents a shift in the larger terrain of international education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1475240913491057">Tarc, 2011</xref>). In turn, as Bunnell recognizes, this more explicit focus on education for global citizenship (admittedly of a liberal inflection) has brought the IB even more centrally into the line of attack. I doubt IB will shift from this focus in the near future. Even where economic recessions and crises may well produce increased protectionist nationalisms and racisms as Bunnell notes, I suspect that the academic/social capital now afforded to internationalized models of education under globalization will hold and thus I do not foresee the ‘death’ of global education as Bunnell conjectures (p. 124).</p>
<p>Moreover, as with other targets of the politically-motivated culture wars, the <italic>actual</italic> nature and impacts of IB may be of little consequence. In essence, IB has become a useful object for ideological pundits to tap into an array of worries or insecurities of their conservative bases – an anti-American, Marxist education that indoctrinates children to privilege world government over local educational control and American sovereignty in a dangerous world, and paid for with government funding! There is little the IB organization can do against this kind of ideological frenzy. Conversely, there <italic>is</italic> a real concern for less politically motivated parents on the issue of who is afforded access to IB, who pays, and what advantages accrue. The heightened desirability and utility of international education under transnationalism has altered the content of cultural and academic capital. (Neo)conservatives recognize and react to this shift beyond the question of their own children’s schooling. They are reacting to the shifting terrain of what knowledge and experiences count in accessing the best universities and schools. If transnational corporations and organizations want ‘globally competent’ graduates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1475240913491057">Phillips, 2002</xref>) with learner dispositions aligned with the IB and other more progressive educational models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1475240913491057">Reznik, 2009</xref>), conservatives will be pushing back against this (neo)liberal globalizing terrain at multiple levels.</p>
<p>In summary, <italic>Global Education under Attack</italic> represents a significant contribution to the growing literature on the phenomenon of IB and to international education more widely. Proponents of the IB and other models of international education would do well to understand the form and content of this most recent ‘attack’ on international education in order to generate insights into how international education’s aims and practices might be better defended and promoted. This text supports the growing need to understand how social imaginaries are defined and shaped in an increasingly interdependent and mediated world. Bunnell’s account of the ‘attack on IB’ represents a needed and significant illumination of the growing salience and new complications of international education in global times.</p>
