<abstract>
<p>This article relates the current discourse on image wars to the interdisciplinary practice of ‘experimental geography’ in the writings and photographs of Trevor Paglen. In his ongoing project to map the dark geographies of covert military activity in the American southwest, Paglen engages a dialectical method that turns the imperial apparatus of surveillance against itself. Performing his photographic campaigns as a series of interventions into the aesthetic traditions of American landscape art, Paglen solicits a critical exploration not only of the power of military technology, but also of the power of imagination.</p>

<body>
<p>The first paragraph under the heading ‘Foresight – and Hindsight’ in the 9/11 Commission Report that was released to the public on 22 July 2004 is captioned ‘Imagination’. According to the commission, the surprise attacks on 11 September revealed a failure in the faculty of imagining. To successfully wage a War on Terror, it was not enough to mobilize social and military forces but also to ‘find a way of routinizing, even bureaucratizing, the exercise of imagination’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470412912468711"><italic>Final Report of the National Commission of Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States</italic>, 2004</xref>: 344). Enlisting imagination in the ensuing conflict, the report supports a logic in which the image precedes reality, picturing precedes perception, and vision precedes war. Answering to the call, the Bush administration responded with the convoluted doctrines of preemption, counter-insurgency and shock-and-awe.</p>
<p>The discourse of novelty that dominated political rhetoric at the time – declaring a new war fought by new means, with new allies and enemies – also resounded in the academy. The unprecedented spectacle of destruction on 11 September simultaneously launched a new world order and a new order of images. Rising to the challenge, media theorists have advanced increasingly bold paradigms to unravel the vertiginous logic of virtual and real, cause and effect, defining this new era of global image wars, whether in terms of spectrality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470412912468711">Mirzoeff, 2006</xref>), virtual trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470412912468711">Redfield, 2009</xref>), premediation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470412912468711">Grusin, 2010</xref>) or cloning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470412912468711">Mitchell, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The rhetorical inscription of ‘9/11’ marked a rupture in the temporal fabric. This disjuncture not only threw historical time out-of-joint, however, but also geography. Out of the rubble of downtown Manhattan emerged a faith-based Manichean geopolitical imaginary of clashing civilizations, crusades, rouge states and medieval tribalism. As the first in a series of toponyms to gain currency in political discourse, Ground Zero presented a blank slate for the urgent zeal to redraw the map. While some borders were sealed, others were split up. The firm agrarian foundation of ‘American soil’ and ‘the Homeland’ was consolidated against the treacherous geographies of the ‘old’ and the ‘new’ Europe (Donald Rumsfeld) and a stateless enemy supported by an ‘Axis of Evil’. The latter, in turn, proved a highly mutable concept, rapidly expanding ‘beyond the axis of evil’ (John R Bolton) and into the ‘outposts of tyranny’ (Condoleezza Rice). Departing from its sovereign and territorial moorings, what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470412912468711">Derek Gregory (2011)</xref> has referred to as ‘the everywhere war’ was also endless in temporal extension, executed through the ethical mandates of Infinite Justice and Jihad.</p>
<p>Where, then, can we locate an intersection between the virtual sphere of images and the material battlefields of this war? Recalling the rebuke of Baudrillard’s statement that the first Gulf War ‘did not take place’, the notion of image wars has been criticized as an excess of postmodern revisionism, eliding the real violence inflected upon human bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470412912468711">Pollock, 2008</xref>). Image wars, however, in common with concepts such as Edward Said’s ‘imaginative geographies’ or Benedict Anderson’s ‘imagined communities’, urge us to look beyond such dichotomies in order to facilitate, in Mitchell’s words, ‘a method that recognizes and embraces <italic>both</italic> the unreality of images <italic>and</italic> their operational reality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470412912468711">Mitchell, 2011</xref>: xviii, original emphases).</p>
<p>The following analysis seeks to address an effort of this kind. Combining geographic research and artistic practice, self-professed ‘experimental photographer’ Trevor Paglen implements such a dialectical method in his ongoing project to map and photograph the sprawling black sites of the US military and intelligence community. Paglen’s images rarely show human agents, other than the blurry figures boarding an unmarked aircraft, or the blackened-out faces on fake passports. It is concerned, instead, with the agency of space. Moving between imaginative geographies and what Paglen refers to as ‘facts on the ground’, it investigates how the former produces the latter, how imaginative geographies materialize.</p>
<p>As practiced by Paglen, ‘experimental geography’, a term coined by Paglen at the dawn of the War on Terror (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470412912468711">Thompson, 2008</xref>: 9), forms a hybrid of empirical science, investigative journalism, political activism and high end art. ‘Experimental geography’, however, does not merely invoke a vanguard interdisciplinary effort, but also the object it studies: an extraterritorial geography unbounded by law, a ‘black world’ which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470412912468711">Paglen (2010[2009]</xref>: 61) defines as ‘the power to create geographies, to create places where anything can happen’. Paglen’s field trips into this black world are deliberately anachronistic. He conducts his research in the mode of a 19th-century surveyor, collecting and identifying various specimens – military patches, code names, forged signatures, flight records – and arranging them into a taxonomic archive of the black world. The sections in this article – ‘Skylines’, ‘Mirages’ and ‘Preludes’ – attempt to emulate this taxonomy by addressing, in turn, his photographic series of classified spacecrafts (‘The Other Night Sky’), military installations (‘Limit Telephotography’) and mission patches (‘Symbology’).</p>
<p>While based on the positivistic premise that the black world takes place – that is, since it is made of the same mundane material as the world at large, it can also be mapped and measured – the principal strategy in Paglen’s writing and research is the trope of displacement. Blurring the lines between art and evidence, geography is approached as at once a physical and fictional construct, and as a powerful vehicle of imagination. More specifically, Paglen plays out these discourses through a series of interventions into the media history of American landscape art. Unfolding as an eclectic compendium of the aesthetic styles of the American landscape tradition, Paglen’s survey of the black world displaces geography into the realm of aesthetics, and the War on Terror onto the domain of the homeland.</p>
<p>The interventionist tactics of Paglen’s photographic campaigns engage two conflicting discourses on landscape. On the one hand, the revisionist tenet that takes its cue from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470412912468711">John Barrell’s (1980)</xref> thesis that landscape has a ‘dark side’. Historically serving as handmaiden to imperial campaigns and ethnocentric ideologies, landscape has been analyzed as a duplicitous image that cloaks its agenda behind a veil of natural and naturalizing scenery. In this sense, all landscapes are black sites. Invoking and reversing the tabloid rhetoric of Dick Cheney’s declaration that the United States had to ‘work the dark side’ and ‘spend time in the shadows’ to fight its elusive enemies, the conspiratorial logic implicit in Barrell’s thesis gains a renewed urgency with Paglen’s plunge into the ‘dark side’ of covert military programs hidden away in the American southwest. At the same time, landscape is the pictorial medium through which Paglen renders this darkness available to the senses. Hence, Paglen’s project also marks a reappraisal of a progressive notion of landscape as a medium that pushes the limits of perception, and that expands the faculty of imagining.</p>
<sec id="section1-1470412912468711">
<title>Skylines</title>
<p>‘Where do we begin our narratives of September 11th?’ The question was posed by art historian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470412912468711">Jon Bird (2003</xref>: 84, 93) as he pondered the altered skyline of lower Manhattan, ‘struggling to adjust to a panorama that was simultaneously familiar, yet strange’. In the photographic series ‘The Other Night Sky’, Paglen aligns this need to historicize with another panorama, equally familiar, yet strange. Pursuing frontlines of former military incursions, the series scans the skies above the vast hinterlands of the continent as encountered on the military and geological surveys in the late 1860s and early 1870s.</p>
<p>A beginning, of sorts, is retraced to Timothy H O’Sullivan, the official field photographer on the Fortieth Parallel Survey, and his famous 1868 photograph ‘Pyramid and Tufa Domes, Pyramid Lake, Nevada’. O’Sullivan’s image shows the crumbling deposits of petrified volcanic ash in the extinct lake. Rendered in stark geometry and sharp focus, the picture is at once figurative and abstract, a surreal vision of isolated geological formations suspended in a luminous, intangible space. A key icon of frontier photography, ‘Pyramid and Tufa Domes’ has also led an illustrious afterlife in academic discourse, serving as the paradigm in Rosalind Krauss’s seminal 1982 essay ‘Photography’s discursive spaces: Landscape/view’. Drawing on two versions of O’Sullivan’s photograph – the original print intended to cater to the domestic market of stereoscopic viewing, and the lithograph copy reproduced 10 years later in Clarence King’s <italic>Systematic Geology</italic> (1878) – Krauss proposes a distinction between ‘views’ and ‘landscapes,’ arguing that these categories ‘operate as representations within two separate discursive spaces, as members of two different discourses’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470412912468711">Krauss, 1982</xref>: 311). Retracing the shifting currency of O’Sullivan’s image as scientific record, popular view, and museum exhibit, Krauss criticizes the distorted genealogy that ensued when ‘Pyramid and Tufa Domes’ was assimilated into the canon of art photography.</p>
<p>From a deterministic point of view, the formal qualities attributed to O’Sullivan’s work were the outcome of technological limitations. The wet plate collodion process required very long exposure times, which meant that moving objects didn’t register and that skies were bleached out into uniform blank surfaces. In Paglen’s re-photograph of Pyramid Lake, the opposite happens. The long exposure time allows hidden presences to emerge from out of the skies, bringing the extra-terrestrial activity of classified spacecrafts and spy-satellites into a space of visibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1470412912468711">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>For the original survey photographers, skies remained a blind spot, either for post-photographic manipulation or, in O’Sullivan’s case, simply to be masked out. In a literal sense, we may say that Paglen fills in the blanks. This practice both complies with and contradicts the site-specific logic of re-photography. Changing the register from the terrestrial to the celestial, the domes and pyramid operate as <italic>repoussoirs</italic> to create historical depth, eliding two frontiers into one image: the colonization of the continental interior and the New Frontier of outer space. Returning the gaze of the surveillance satellites, Paglen thus turns the image back into evidence, into a record of how the apparatus of reconnaissance has continued to expand since O’Sullivan took his photograph. The lines between the discursive spaces identified by Krauss – between empirics and art, evidence and imagination – are intentionally blurred.</p>
<p>O’Sullivan’s posthumous artistic repute as harbinger of a modernist sensibility was initiated by the American landscape photographer Ansel Adams. After rediscovering O’Sullivan’s photographs in 1937, which he praised as ‘surrealistic and disturbing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470412912468711">Snyder, 2002</xref>: 192), Adams pitched them for an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Repeating Adams’ hindsight, ‘The Other Night Sky’ stages yet another rediscovery in a series of views modeled on Adams’ canonical portfolios from Yosemite National Park, the glacial valley in California where the artist settled his studio to perfect his high-contrast vision of the West. More than any previous landscape photographer, Adams was devoted to the aesthetic agency of transitory celestial phenomena: the thunderclouds towering above the Half Dome seen from Glacier Point rendered in crisp ink black and silvery tonalities, or the more gentle cloud formations gathering over the valley seen from Tunnel View and Inspiration Point. In Paglen’s revisions, the long exposures render the granite profiles of Cathedral Rocks, Half Dome and El Capitan in a grey, husky twilight, further amplifying their oneiric and immemorial character, while the radiant white streaks of satellites bisecting the star trails animate the scene. And instead of the luminous disc of the autumn moon above the Sierra Nevada skyline in Adams’ 1948 original, we see the glowing flash of the Milstar 6 military communications satellite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1470412912468711">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Seeking out the position of a previous gaze, the vantage point is as important as what is looked upon. The domes in Yosemite and Pyramid Lake act merely as a foreground to the astral photography, which could have been taken anywhere, providing a historical relief along which to trace the contours of the black world. Through the elaborations of focal range and exposure time, the landscape transforms, it comes to life: ‘If Ansell Adams had used an astronomy lens rather than a wide angle lens and blown up his images thousands of times’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470412912468711">Paglen (2009)</xref> ruminates, ‘he might have seen that the desert was not really the bucolic landscape that he often made it out to be.’ Paglen’s re-photography thus brings into optical consciousness the unconscious of Adams’ wilderness. He does not merely peer through the lens of his predecessor, however, but through the viewfinder of the millions of yearly visitors to Yosemite as well. Conflating the iconic vistas of the national park with the black world, this is also a conjunction of the hyper-visible and the invisible.</p>
<p>The strategic juxtapositions of ‘The Other Night Sky’ have an obvious precursor in the work of Richard Misrach, another photographer–explorer of the southwest ‘gunbelt’. In <italic>Bravo 20: The Bombing of the American West</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470412912468711">1990</xref>), Misrach chronicles the surreal devastation of a US Navy bombing range in the Nevada desert in lucid, large-format color photographs. The panoramic compositions stage an abrupt contrast between the vast skies and the damaged ground below, scarred with craters, target debris and shrapnel, and jutted by bombs and warheads. Taking this strategy to its logical conclusion, the book ends with a proposal to turn the area into America’s first environmental memorial, a national park ‘devoted to the history of military abuse in peacetime’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470412912468711">Misrach, 1990</xref>: 95). Yosemite Park provides the blueprint for Misrach as he outlines his prospect for the virtual Bravo 20 National Park, complete with guided tours, campgrounds and picnic areas, and a visitors’ centre with a museum and a gift shop to sell souvenirs and maps to radioactive landfills. Turning the didactic role of the national park against itself, Misrach and Paglen retrace the legacy of secret military programs along the stark outline of the western horizon – the crucible of ‘American soil’ and ‘Homeland’ – splitting up the visual field along the earth–sky axis in order to strain these histories into visibility.</p>

<title>Mirages</title>
<p>From the outset, Yosemite Valley and the Nevada Basin and Range were envisaged through opposing imaginative templates. The discursive spaces defined by Krauss – the artistic vision and the scientific view – were already in place as a way of seeing. The distinction was pre-conceived, or ‘pre-visualized’ to use Ansel Adams’ term. Whereas Yosemite was promoted as a visual attraction, the Nevada Basin was described as unsightly, or obscene. Whereas the former relished the gaze, the latter repelled it. Not only was the Basin described as a region hostile to settlement and aesthetic concepts, but also to seeing itself. Set apart in the national imagination, these were polarized geographies, both morally and aesthetically.</p>
<p>The contrapuntal construction of Yosemite and the Basin and Range may be elucidated through two publications by Clarence King, the American geologist, mountaineer and art critic who directed the survey mission along the fortieth parallel on which O’Sullivan served. In <italic>Systematic Geology</italic> (1878), King conceived of the Great Basin as the aftermath of some cataclysmic violence, referring to it as the scattered remains of what had once been scenery, as a ruin or a post-landscape. King’s excursions into Yosemite Valley, lovingly recounted in his memoir <italic>Mountaineering in the Sierra Nevada</italic> (1872), on the other hand, inspired an idiom of lush pastoralism, extolling the soft, radiant beauty of the valley. King was part of a veritable mass-pilgrimage to Yosemite in the early 1860s. Its iconic status was reproduced in Charlton E Watkins’s photographic albums, Albert Bierstadt’s canvases in the Great Picture style, and through its preservation as a National Park reserve, initiated by Sierra Club founder John Muir and prospected by Frederick Law Olmsted, who adapted the same compositional scheme he had used when he designed Central Park a decade earlier. All these visitors eulogized Yosemite’s appearance as a readymade park. With its soaring canyons enclosing the meadows and streams on the flat valley floor, Yosemite appeared pre-composed, showcasing all attributes of the wild and the pastoral. Yosemite Valley was quickly endorsed as the template of a national landscape, venerated in photography, painting and writing as a natural work of art, or what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470412912468711">Rebecca Solnit (1999[1994]</xref>: 229) has referred to as ‘the official version of Nature’.</p>
<p>In her book <italic>Savage Dreams: A Journey into the Landscape Wars of the American West</italic>, Solnit dismantles the binary relation between Yosemite Park and the military tests sites in Nevada. Linking these geographies through two unsettled wars a century apart – the Mariposa Indian War in 1851 and the nuclear war rehearsed in Nevada since 1951 – Solnit ties together these sites through the historical continuity of conflict. Since neither of them was ever legally acquired by the US from their first inhabitants, Solnit continues, they are both part of a war on the native population that has never been concluded. In fact, Yosemite was discovered on a military mission to evict the Ahwahneechee tribe and annex the area’s natural resources. One of the arguments that legitimized this violent dispossession was that the native population didn’t possess the aesthetic sensibility required to appreciate the scenery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470412912468711">Sears, 1998[1989]</xref>: 152). A battlefield before it was turned into a tourist destination, the preservation of Yosemite as a national park was in effect also an act of forgetting, a manufacturing of a blank spot, of a place innocent of history.</p>
<p>If Yosemite was memorial from its inception, commemorating the Edenic birthright of the nation, the Nevada Basin and Range presented a blank spot of a different kind. Perceived as a place of terror, this alien and forbidden zone required instead a scientific and military response. In his epic overview of the black world, <italic>Blank Spots on the Map: The Dark Geography of the Pentagon’s Secret World</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470412912468711">2010[2009]</xref>), Paglen speculates on how the initial response to the Basin and Range prepared it as a proving ground for future covert military activity. In Paglen’s words:
<disp-quote>
<p>What we see strongly guides what we do: To an extent, we enact what we imagine. When early explorers and settlers first came to the Basin and Range, they saw a wasteland. Then they laid waste to it. (p. 56)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Suggesting a causal relation between blankness and blackness in which the former conditions the latter, Paglen reflects at length on the lore of early explorers and emigrants who described the Basin and Range as a phantasmagorical geography of mirages and optical deceptions. Paraphrasing these early reports, Paglen produces a visual equivalent in a series of photographs called ‘Limit Telephotography’. In these pictures, classified military installations in the Basin are conveyed through the optics of astrophotography. Flattened out by the telescope lens and filtered through miles of atmospheric dust and distortions, the convection of the heat waves melts the distant sites into shimmering configurations, thus recreating the visual effect of desert mirages. Pushing his inventory of the American landscape tradition further into pictorial abstraction, Paglen changes the register from O’Sullivan’s grim records of the Basin and Range and Adams’ pristine vision of the Sierra Nevada, to the distilled elemental energies associated with the colorfield painters of the postwar era. Making his photographs look like abstract paintings, the compressed telescopic imagery emulates the atmospheric sublime of Mark Rothko’s canvases.</p>
<p>‘Limit Telephotography’ charts a series of generic locations that have a very limited expressive charge to begin with, and the amorphous shapes and blotches it presents are barely discernible as the flight terminals, control towers and shuttles described in the captions. Suggestive rather than informative, Paglen’s counter-espionage tactics yield an aesthetic of counter-transparency. The black world can only be represented in glimpses and fragments. There is a slippage, then, from the gestural dimension of colorfield abstraction to the gestural act of making these images. Insisting that the politics of producing the photographs outweighs the significance of whatever information they contain, they are performative also as enactments of US citizenship, exorcising the ‘right to look’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470412912468711">Mirzoeff, 2011</xref>), which in Paglen’s case is also the right to look back.</p>
<p>Evidence – what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470412912468711">Krauss (1982</xref>: 311) referred to as a ‘fanatical descriptive clarity … a hallucinatory wealth of detail’ in O’Sullivan’s photograph of the Tufa Domes – is precisely what these images refuse to yield. To make evidence inaccessible is also the purpose of the sites themselves. What goes on within their remits is by definition a state secret. The ‘Limit Telephotography’ series thus reproduces the paradox that ensues from the routine invocation of the ‘state secret privilege’, which dictates that crimes can’t be prosecuted because evidence can’t become exhibits in judicial procedures. In an analogy to this catch 22, Paglen makes images of the limits of what we are capable of seeing, of a place where seeing ends, where the law is blind. By the same token, ‘Limit Telephotography’ shows its own shortcomings and measures the secrecy – the physical extent of the buffer-zones and the act pushing the black world from public view.</p>
<p>‘Limit Telephotography’ also conveys a more direct visual pun. Consider, for instance, the long-range spy photograph of a chemical and biological proving ground in Utah shot from a distance of 42 miles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1470412912468711">Figure 3</xref>). This image can’t fail to bring to mind the satellite photographs of Saddam Hussein’s chemical and biological weapons laboratories presented by Colin Powell at the United Nations in February 2003. In both cases, imagination is required to make sense of perception, and the chimerical clues Paglen discloses are ultimately as inconclusive and prone to speculation as those used to launch the invasion of Iraq.</p>

<p>The efficacy of Paglen’s project depends precisely on his talent to devise pictorial forms that paraphrase the process of the black world. Literally dissolving into the air, ‘Limit Telephotography’ mimics the production of a spectral geography of black operations, ghost detainees and phantom identities. At once literal and allegorical, the series offers optical aberrations as itself a form of evidence.</p>

<p>9/11 has taught us that terrorism against American interests ‘over there’ should be regarded just as we regard terrorism against America ‘over here.’ In this same sense, the American homeland is the planet.

<p>The analogy between the surprise attacks on 11 September and Pearl Harbor is relentlessly pursued throughout the 9/11 Commission Report. The equation of the American homeland and the planet cited above may also bring to mind one of the pivotal images used to gain support for US involvement in World War II after Pearl Harbor. In the opening scene of Frank Capra’s <italic>Prelude to War</italic>, the first film in the propaganda series <italic>Why We Fight</italic>, an animated sequence made by the Disney studio shows how the earth divides in two.

<p>The blurring of lines between the attacks in 1941 and 2001 and the spatial metaphors advanced to narrate the War on Terror in World War II analogies derived a straight lineage from Pearl Harbor and Iwo Jima to Ground Zero, and from the Axis Powers to the Axis of Evil. Resolved into a cosmic struggle between Western civilization and its dark nemesis, the reproduction of this imaginative geography also foreclosed any possibility of common ground.</p>
<p>The master trope of Paglen’s research, the concept of ‘dark geography’, invokes and reverses the moral chiaroscuro promoted in the prelude to the War on Terror, as in Cheney’s reference to the ‘dark side’ or in Tony Blair’s speech to the US Congress on 17 July 2003, declaring that ‘the threat comes because in another part of the globe there is shadow and darkness’. The optical metaphor of the US as the Guiding Light of the Free World—extending from John Winthrop’s prophesy of a ‘shining city on a hill’, famously reiterated by Ronald Reagan, to Walter Houston’s voice-over in ‘Prelude to War’, calling on the founding fathers as ‘lighthouses, lightning up a dark and foggy world’—also galvanized George W Bush’s address to the nation on 11 September: ‘America was targeted for attack because we're the brightest beacon for freedom and opportunity in the world. And no one will keep that light from shining.’ One of the ironies of Paglen’s intertwined genealogies and geographies of the black world is that it has expanded precisely at those historical turning points which have boasted the US’s historical mission to spread the light of democracy. The splitting of the globe in ‘Prelude to War’ also spawned the secret geography of the nuclear race. Known as ‘The Manhattan Project’, this complex of secret cities, factories and test sites in Los Alamos, New Mexico, is referred to by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470412912468711">Paglen (2010[2009]</xref>: 95) as ‘the black world’s foundation’. After World War II, this geography doesn’t go away, but morphs into the military–intelligence complex. It is as if Enlightenment—the ideals of democracy, transparency, progress, rationality and technological achievement—bred its negative double, its shadow image. After 9/11, Paglen continues, the shadow state ‘was now free to pursue its vision of a new world, to create new geographies … The black world was supercharged with newfound life and purpose’ (p. 250). The virulent metaphoric language that informs <italic>Blank Spots on the Map</italic> endows this darkness with an agency and autonomy of its own. Inverting the biopolitical vocabulary so endemic to the discourse on terrorism, Paglen describes the black world as a kind of out-of-control organism that has ‘grown and thrived in the darkness’ (p. 207) of its own volition, sculpturing the surrounding world in its own image. From the Manhattan Project in New Mexico during World War II to the Salt Pit outside Kabul in the War on Terror, temporary facilities have congealed into permanent structures, emergency measures and states of exception have become standard operating procedure.</p>
<p>Whereas ‘The Other Night Sky’ and ‘Limit Telephotography’ snatched glimpses from across vast distances, ‘Symbology’, the third taxonomic unit of Paglen’s encyclopedic project, offers objects retrieved from the inner recesses of the black world, snatched from the shadows. The mission patches for secret units in the Basin and Range collected and deciphered by the artist present a crude and cryptic iconography steeped in insider jargon, mixing Latin phrases, occult symbolism and Halloween kitsch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1470412912468711">Figure 5</xref>). Pushing the biological metaphor, we may say that the patches constitute something like the DNA code of the black world. These close-ups of the black world are as obscure as the long-shots of orbiting satellites and off-limits installations. Contrary to the non-figurative imagery of ‘Limit Telephotography’, however, the patches contain a surplus of semiotic material. If the former tapped into the aesthetic tradition of colorfield abstraction, the latter appear as Pop Art ready-mades. In the oscillation between them, an interface between infrastructure and imagination begins to transpire.</p>

<p>While some patches draw celestial maps, charting the trails of orbiting satellites, they are all maps in the sense of being figments of a geopolitical imagination. The vision of the global homeland promoted in the Commission Report and in ‘Prelude to War’ is a signature feature on these embroidered emblems of Pax Americana where the globe is prowled by night-seeing predators, watched over by owls and eagles, entangled by snakes, or in the claws of giant dragons. The fanciful beasts that used to populate the margins of the known world in the early days of mapmaking here occupy the center. Ultimately, the patches reference a shared provenience, a permanent state of prelude to war in the void of the Great Basin. This is as much a proving ground for military technology as a test bed for imagination. The momentum of dark geography is concisely designated by the motto for a unit called ‘Ghost Squadron’ operating at the secret air force base known as Area 51: ‘Imagination without Boundaries’.</p>

<title>Artifacts</title>
<p>The convoluted plotlines of <italic>Blank Spots on the Map</italic> unravels a chain-reaction where blank spots in the budget begat blank spots on the map which, in turn, produce blind spots in the law, converting historical records into state secrets. The book reads equally as a topographical essay and a meditation on the two-tiered logic through which the hyper-visible and the invisible, civilian and covert, spectacle and secrecy, support and sustain each other. Beginning in Las Vegas, a ‘city whose greatest export is its own image’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470412912468711">Paglen, 2010[2009]</xref>: 33), Paglen’s initial observations of clandestine flights from his hotel balcony are followed by an excursion to ‘a mock city called Terror Town’ (p. 38) a fake Iraq village built in the Nevada desert for counterterrorism combat training. Later, an overview of the monumental architecture of Washington DC is followed by a tour through the anonymous office-parks in Northern Virginia where CIA’s covert action infrastructure resides behind mirrored walls and manicured lawns. The corporate facades and front companies constitute an architectural corollary to the operative euphemisms, code names and cover stories of military actions. This roaming itinerary comes to an end at a military air base north of Kabul, described by Paglen as ‘an oasis of American suburbanism on the Afghan plains’ (p. 244), complete with its staple leisure facilities and fast-food chains. The nickname for Bagram prison, ‘the other Gitmo’, further indicates how the black world keeps cloning itself.</p>
<p>The dialectical setup that informs Paglen’s project – the continual blurring and folding of one image, space or historical moment into another – was crystallized in a piece called <italic>Artifacts</italic> from 2010. <italic>Artifacts</italic> is a diptych, also the modus operandi of Paglen’s project as a whole, consisting of two photographs mounted side-by-side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1470412912468711">Figure 6</xref>). On the left, an image of an Anasazi cliff dwelling in New Mexico closely modeled on O’Sullivan’s <italic>Ancient Ruins in Cañon de Chelle</italic> from the Wheeler reconnaissance mission in 1873. On the right, the angled streaks of spacecrafts in Earth orbit. There is the black striation carved into the rock on the left, and the white streaks in the night sky on the right, the canyon wall as an index of geological activities in the past, and the sky as an index of extraterrestrial activities shaping the future.</p>

<p>Meaning accrues in the interval between these artifacts, between archeology and astronomy, between aftermath and anticipation, aligning the ancient Anasazi architecture of surveillance and defense in the cliff wall with the imperial ruins in perpetual orbit in space. This telescoping effect borrows the device of the famous graphic match-cut in the prologue sequence of Stanley Kubrick’s <italic>2001: A Space Odyssey</italic> (1969) where the evolutionary leap from stone age to space age transpires in a seamless cut matching a bone, the first tool of prehistoric man triumphantly thrown into the air, with a nuclear weapons satellite orbiting in space.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470412912468711">Helen Chang (2011)</xref> has commented that <italic>Artifacts</italic> ‘shows us the flipside of American exceptionalism – a superpower in decline and an empire surrounded by barely visible enemies, both real and imagined’. She also adds: ‘In the Navajo language, Anasazi means “ancient enemy”’. To continue her thought: an ancient enemy hidden away in the canyons of New Mexico invokes a future enemy sheltered in the mountainous border region of Pakistan and Afghanistan. For a contemporary audience in 1873, O’Sullivan’s photograph was not so much a picturesque curiosity as a vigilant record of the untamed peripheries of the empire, the cliff dwelling having served as a Navajo stronghold during the recent Indian Wars. In Paglen’s 2010 constellation, the mountainous terrain evokes instead the province of militant Islam, described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470412912468711">Faisal Devji’s (2005)</xref> study <italic>Landscapes of the Jihad</italic> as an imaginative geography, ‘dominated by images of caves, ruins and wilderness’ (p. 44). The blurring together of old and new enemies in the margins of the American empire was patently reinforced by the Obama administration when it codenamed the assassination of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan ‘Geronimo’, in tribute to the extraterritorial military operation in the 1880s to capture the Apache rebel leader in Mexico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470412912468711">Margolies, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Whereas O’Sullivan discovered the vestiges of an ancient city hidden in the New Mexico canyons, Paglen’s eerie night vision reveals the flickering lights of contemporary cities – a surveillance station sheltered in the valleys of West Virginia, or an Air Force Flight Test Centre on the desert plains of Nevada. Retracing the campaigns of the emerging empire in the wake of the Civil War, when notions like ‘Homeland’ and ‘American soil’ were still unsettled, Paglen locates these cities within a long history of imagining the nation waging a never-ending war. Reminding us that the Manichean struggle between savagery and civilization had already been rehearsed on American soil, Paglen’s taxonomies of the black world correlate blank spots on the map with blind spots in perception. Cautioning us in equal measure of the power of military technology and the power of imagination, they probe the failure in imagination proclaimed in the 9/11 Commission Report. By increasing the spectral range of our hindsight, however, maybe we can also begin to perceive alternative lines of foresight.</p>
