 <p>This timely volume represents an excellent intervention within debates about ‘the effects of social change on the social fabric’ (p. 1) in the context of globalization, increasing inequality and social diversity, and the intensification of concerns about these trends in the aftermath of the financial crisis, recession and the new politics of austerity. The impacts and outcomes of these forces are widely debated in the existing sociological literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0268580913477964">Bauman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0268580913477964">Judt, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0268580913477964">Perkins and Thorns, 2012</xref>; Young, 2010) and within this field, Andy Green and Jan Germen Janmaat offer, in my opinion, four substantive contributions: providing ‘necessary conceptual ground-clearing’ (p. 4) in defining social cohesion; constructing an insightful account of the origins and diverse intellectual traditions of social cohesion; developing a comparative typology of governmental and societal regimes underpinning social processes; and presenting quantitative international data to interrogate a series of hypotheses that have framed contemporary understandings in both the academy and policy governmentalities.</p>
<p>The book is structured in seven chapters. The opening chapter examines various definitions of social cohesion, before presenting the authors’ preferred conceptualization (p. 18): ‘social cohesion refers to the property by which whole societies, and the individuals within them, are bound together through the action of specific attitudes, behaviours and institutions which rely on consensus rather than pure coercion’. The chapter concludes with an identification of liberal, republican and social democratic discourses of social cohesion, each emphasizing variant constituent elements. This is followed by a commentary on intellectual traditions encompassing liberalism (Locke, Smith, Mill and de Tocqueville), republicanism (Rousseau, Durkheim) and a particularly helpful discussion of the romantic conservative tradition, grounded in Germanic romanticism and reacting against French rationalism through the emphasis upon cultural <italic>Volk</italic> traditions.</p>
<p>The third and fourth chapters attempt what the authors themselves recognize as being an extremely challenging task of identifying what they term ‘regimes of social cohesion’. Green and Germen Janmaat are explicit that regimes involve – in addition to bodies of ideas – rules, regulations and underpinning institutional forms (p. 41). Although their conceptual framework does not engage robustly with regime theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0268580913477964">Stone, 1989</xref>), the authors are right to identify the centrality of the configuration of the state, or the particular rule of Leviathan, in framing forms of social solidarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0268580913477964">Elias, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0268580913477964">Hobbes, 1651</xref>). Chapter 3 seeks to chart the social origins and development of traditions of cohesion and whether long-term traditions can be identified and located within ‘particular clusters of countries over time’ (p. 43), including liberalism and its linkages to industrialization and capitalism. The authors argue that nationalism in Western states consolidated territorially secure sovereign states while in Central and Eastern European nations an ethno-cultural form of nationalism was a key driver in the creation of new nation-states. The chapter concludes by tracing the modifications and mutations of the major social cohesion traditions in the twentieth century, making the crucial argument that in liberal regimes equality was never conceptualized as a necessary condition of societal cohesion (p. 51), although useful distinctions are also drawn between Britain and the United States. An account of republicanism, romantic conservatism and social democracy concludes with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580913477964">Esping-Andersen’s (1985)</xref> statement that both universalism and institutionalism are basic organizational principles for constructing solidarity.</p>
<p>The analysis in Chapter 4 turns to contemporary regimes of social cohesion and their institutional foundations. The authors focus upon national systems and, although they acknowledge that these regimes will be influenced by supra-national systems and flows (p. 65), it is difficult to overstate the importance of these issues, given that the global financial order has systematically realigned authority and power within (and increasingly beyond) nation-states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0268580913477964">Shaxson, 2011</xref>). It would also have been beneficial to consider how regimes of cohesion operate at more localized scales, particularly when these regimes challenge the primacy of the nation-state in determining and enacting concepts of belonging and solidarity and the institutions through which these are enacted (including ethnic and religious allegiances and organizations). In fairness, the authors do identify gated communities and independent incorporated cities in the United States as exemplars of social fragmentation (p. 74), to which should be added local municipalities increasingly redrawing local boundaries in response to immigration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0268580913477964">Gilbert, 2009</xref>). As with many commentators, gated communities are juxtaposed with urban ghettoes, although, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0268580913477964">Wacquant (2008)</xref> persuasively argues, there is a need for far greater conceptual and empirical clarity in the usage of this term given its powerful primacy within cohesion debates.</p>
<p>A typology of liberal, social market and social democratic regimes is augmented by an interesting note on East Asia, including Confucianism, as well as important points about the legitimacy of East Asian states being dependent upon economic development and the relational, rather than contractual, basis of economic organization (epitomized by the <italic>iemoto</italic> firms in Japan). Although the authors conclude that in East Asian societies social cohesion is often constructed as a top-down process highly dependent upon state authority, they also suggest the centrality of incorporating a population into a vision of a nation’s future and giving individuals a stake in this future. This strikes this reviewer as actually being the principal dilemma and project of contemporary government, exemplified in the UK by continual elite articulations of ‘Britishness’ coinciding with an economic catastrophe increasingly exposing the lack of control and authority of national institutions. This was epitomized by employment, housing and commodity prices crises and the urban riots of 2011 (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0268580913477964">Judt, 2010</xref>). What, then, are the sociological and political ramifications of generations having less than their parents (p. 172)? It is interesting to note that one such reaction – the emergence of new social movements such as the English Defence League – seeks to appropriate traditional symbols of nationhood as well as establish exclusionary cultural parameters.</p>
<p>Chapters 5 and 6 present findings from quantitative analysis of a range of international survey data sets. Three distinctive regimes are identified: liberal (English-speaking countries), social democratic (Nordic countries) and social market (Northwestern European countries), with separate clusters of Southern European, Eastern European and East Asian nations. The statistical testing mainly confirms the models of philosophical, political and economic regimes developed in the preceding chapters. Although there are internal variations within these regimes, institutional forms are integrally related to attitudinal and behavioural characteristics, including tolerance, civic participation and social trust. Chapter 6 explores Inglehart’s theory of post-materialist generational value change and finds some evidence to support this, although social, gender and urban–rural cleavages are also key explanatory variables in values diversity. It could be argued, of course, that the post-materialist paradigm is based on a series of societal and governmental assumptions about economic growth and opportunity which clearly no longer apply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0268580913477964">Flint and Raco, 2011</xref>). The authors conclude that values diversity is dynamic and unpredictable and therefore regimes must not be regarded as ‘unchanging socio-cultural constellations’ (p. 163).</p>
<p>The concluding chapter examines the impact upon social cohesion of the global economic crisis and suggests that overall trends towards declining social cohesion may mask important variations. Although this chapter provides intriguing evidence and some valuable insights and ideas, it suffers, unavoidably, from the methodological limitations of the authors’ approach and reliance upon global-level narratives. These cannot convincingly evidence a series of assertions about the actual sociological impacts and processes in the grounded reality of populations’ lives and relationships; hence the continuing need for complementary embedded qualitative and ethnographic studies. Finally, and again beyond the control of the authors, some of the later commentary about the nature of the economic crisis and its outcomes have been somewhat overtaken by events.</p>
<p>Although I have reservations about the extent to which societies were actually more cohesive in the past, Alan Green and Jan Germen Janmaat are surely correct to argue that creating more social cohesion is desirable and that it will require the radical reframing of existing governing rationalities. Their book is a very worthwhile contribution to these aims and should be widely read by all those working in the fields of cohesion studies.</p>
