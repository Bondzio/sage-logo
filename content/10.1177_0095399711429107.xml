<p>This article offers a new framework for understanding the role that nonprofit organizations play in American life. Popular sentiment and contemporary nonprofit theory suggest that nonprofits hold a special purpose: They provide assistance when the typical functioning of the economic and political institutions fails. Drawing on the critical perspective afforded by genealogy and on Foucault’s writings on government and liberalism, this article proposes an alternative reading of the development of the nonprofit sector. This alternate history suggests that the nonprofit sector and the contemporary theory that underpins it function as a part of a <italic>dispositif</italic>, the aim of which is to perpetuate the discourses associated with neoliberalism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>According to the Urban Institute’s National Center for Charitable Statistics, nonprofit organizations account for not only a sizable portion of the American institutional landscape but also how individuals spend a great deal of their money and time. In 2005 alone, nearly 1.5 million nonprofit organizations registered with the Internal Revenue Service and reported revenues of more than US$1.5 trillion and assets worth approximately US$3.4 trillion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095399711429107">Blackwood, Wing, &amp; Pollak, 2008</xref>). In addition, private giving to registered nonprofits reached an all-time high in 2006, with nearly US$300 billion in financial donations and 12.9 billion hr in volunteer time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095399711429107">Blackwood et al., 2008</xref>). Nonprofit scholars such as Lester Salamon have asserted that such dedication of resources to one segment of American life is likely due to the significant value that Americans place on nonprofits in return for the multitude of important roles that they play within society, namely, as service provider (to respond to unmet needs), advocate (to bring problems to public attention), an outlet of personal expression, a community builder or source of social capital, and a guardian of collectively held organizational and societal values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0095399711429107">Salamon, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The theoretical underpinnings of the nonprofit sector echo these generous sentiments in that they generally argue that nonprofit institutions hold a unique and highly valued—indeed, a special—position in American society. Some scholars contend that nonprofit organizations assume a distinct role in relation to the marketplace (compare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095399711429107">Billis &amp; Glennerster, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0095399711429107">Kingma, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0095399711429107">Sjostrand, 2000</xref>). They serve to correct the marketplace in instances of market failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0095399711429107">Weisbrod, 1975</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095399711429107">Clarke &amp; Estes, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0095399711429107">Easley &amp; O’Hara, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0095399711429107">Ellen &amp; Voicu, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0095399711429107">Hansmann, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0095399711429107">Krashinsky, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0095399711429107">Ortmann &amp; Schlesinger, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0095399711429107">Rose-Ackerman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0095399711429107">Young, 2001a</xref>) or government failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0095399711429107">Ferris, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0095399711429107">Young, 2001b</xref>). They also provide a space in the marketplace for the spirit of entrepreneurship to flourish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095399711429107">Badelt, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0095399711429107">James, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0095399711429107">Young, 1983</xref>). Other scholars argue that nonprofit organizations serve a unique purpose in civil society<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0095399711429107">1</xref></sup> by aiding in the development of citizens’ democratic capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0095399711429107">Eberly &amp; Streeter, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095399711429107">Eikenberry, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0095399711429107">Warren, 2004</xref>). More specifically, according to these theories, nonprofits serve as a venue through which citizens can express shared values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0095399711429107">Ott, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0095399711429107">Smith &amp; Lipsky, 2001</xref>), promote pluralism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095399711429107">Abzug, 1999</xref>), and learn to act in the public interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095399711429107">Berger &amp; Neuhaus, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0095399711429107">O’Connell, 1999</xref>). In either case, contemporary theorists seem to collectively agree that the presence of nonprofits is a good thing: they provide aid to individuals when typical economic and democratic processes fail.</p>
<p>Although there has been some discussion as to whether this collection of contemporary theories adequately describes the nature of the nonprofit sector and its role in American life (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0095399711429107">Langton, 1987</xref>), nonprofit scholars have remained largely silent on the development of nonprofit theory itself. Furthermore, nonprofit scholars have rarely concerned themselves with critically examining the assumptions on which these theoretical constructs are based. The seeming lack of critical engagement with the theoretical underpinnings of the nonprofit sector is part and parcel of a larger issue at work in the study of nonprofit organizations and the role(s) they play in larger society. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0095399711429107">Roelofs (1987)</xref> observes, scholars rarely seem to use a critical framework to examine the nonprofit sector, and thus “the liberal view is widely accepted in all quarters: that the private non-profit sector enhances pluralism and provides balance between business and government” (p. 39). Even the most critical of scholars in the field tends to affirm these assumptions about the nonprofit sector and to assert that nonprofit organizations and the work in which they are engaged are generally good for larger society. While they might argue that these good organizations and their good work have been co-opted and marketized<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0095399711429107">2</xref></sup> over time by neoliberalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0095399711429107">Eikenberry &amp; Kluver, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0095399711429107">Nickel &amp; Eikenberry, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0095399711429107">2010</xref>) or by the “non-profit industrial complex” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0095399711429107">INCITE! Women of Color Against Violence, 2007</xref>), they also maintain a belief in the <italic>inherent</italic> ability of nonprofits to do good in the world and in the “transformative potential of philanthropy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0095399711429107">Nickel &amp; Eikenberry, 2006</xref>, p. 5) itself. Moreover, they contend that nonprofits can thwart the forces of neoliberalism and capitalism—not only to reassert their own “goodness” but also on behalf of the public at large—by providing spaces to facilitate “counterdiscourses” to the more dominant marketized discourses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095399711429107">Eikenberry, 2009</xref>) and by openly calling into question the influence of the nonprofit industrial complex (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095399711429107">Ahn, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095399711429107">Burrowes, Cousins, Rojas, &amp; Ude, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0095399711429107">Tang, 2007</xref>) on charity, social justice, and individual and community well-being.</p>
<p>Asserting such a viewpoint tends to signify less of a critical stance toward the nonprofit sector and its corresponding activities and instead represents more of a critique of the state and of the marketplace and their collective (negative) influence on the nonprofit sector. In this viewpoint, the nonprofit sector maintains its position as the proverbial good (albeit fallible) guy whereas the state and the market play its nemeses in an old-fashioned tale of good versus evil. As such, the prevailing notions of the nonprofit sector are reinforced rather than critiqued. By accepting the assumptions on which we base our understanding of the nonprofit sector itself and the nature of the public service in which it is engaged, we risk oversimplifying the opportunities and the limitations to serving the public which can be afforded by nonprofits. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0095399711429107">Kohl (2010)</xref> observes, nonprofit organizations can open up spaces for enacting social change while at the same time acting to constrain or govern<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0095399711429107">3</xref></sup> the conduct of others. If we understand nonprofit organizations solely as entities that are <italic>governed</italic> by the state and by the market, then we fail to understand them and the roles that they play as <italic>governors</italic> in larger society.</p>
<p>This article seeks to address these issues by openly questioning the foundations on which our understanding of the nonprofit sector is constructed and by directly interrogating the assumptions that inform the theoretical underpinnings of the nonprofit sector. Working from the critical perspective afforded by genealogy<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0095399711429107">4</xref></sup> and drawing on Foucault’s writings on governmentality, this article ultimately concludes that the theoretical underpinnings of the nonprofit sector operate as one part of a <italic>dispositif</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0095399711429107">5</xref></sup>, the purpose of which is to help perpetuate the discourses associated with neoliberalism, namely, entrepreneurialism and competition. The argument unfolds in a twofold manner. First, drawing extensively on Foucault’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0095399711429107">Foucault, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0095399711429107">1991a</xref>, 2008) and others’ (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0095399711429107">Barry, Osborne, &amp; Rose, 1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0095399711429107">Burchell, Gordon, &amp; Miller, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0095399711429107">Cruikshank, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711429107">Dean, 1999</xref>) writings on government and liberalism, I proffer a genealogy of our contemporary understanding of the nonprofit sector. This genealogy serves two purposes. On one hand, it demonstrates that our understanding of the nonprofit sector and the nature of its service is contingent rather than finite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0095399711429107">Foucault, 1984</xref>), having shifted from the charitable to the philanthropic. On the other hand, it also demonstrates how the historical and political forces at play in liberal and neoliberal governing rationalities have worked to inform these developments over time. Then, I explore the role that contemporary nonprofit theory plays in supporting the aims of neoliberal governing rationalities. More specifically, I contend that the image of nonprofit organizations that contemporary theory conveys—as organizations specially designed to provide aid when our economic and democratic systems fail us—serves to disguise nonprofits’ role as an aide to the forces of marketization. This disguise of neoliberalism’s operation is of paramount importance to its success.</p>

<title>Advancing a Philanthropic Enterprise</title>
<p>Today, the commonly held notion of what nonprofit organizations and their activities should entail can be summed up as the philanthropic enterprise. A philanthropic enterprise should not be confused with a charitable one.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0095399711429107">6</xref></sup> Charity is defined as “what we give to alleviate the need, suffering, and sorrow of others, whether we know them or not” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095399711429107">Bremner, 1994</xref>, p. xi). Furthermore, charity “expresses an impulse to personal service; it engages individuals in concrete, discrete acts of compassion and connection to other people” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0095399711429107">Gross, 2003</xref>, p. 31). The very act of alleviating an individual’s suffering connects one human being to another whether a previous relationship existed or not. It comes as no surprise, then, that the modern-day understanding of charity draws from a lineage based in a Judeo-Christian ethic of benevolence toward others in service to God (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0095399711429107">Veyne, 1990/1976</xref>). Philanthropy, however, which has its roots in Enlightenment thought seeks “to apply reason to the solution of social ills and needs. . . . [It] aspires not so much to aid individuals as to reform society. Its object is the promotion of progress through the advance of knowledge” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0095399711429107">Gross, 2003</xref>, p. 31). By advancing the rational application of knowledge to cure society’s ills, philanthropy hopes to make charity unnecessary and obsolete.</p>
<p>Over the course of American history, philanthropy slowly but steadily subsumed the charitable impulse to become the authoritative mode for providing assistance to those in need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0095399711429107">Gross, 2003</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0095399711429107">Sealander, 2003</xref>). One way we can understand this development is by situating philanthropy as a practice of government. More to the point, we can understand philanthropy in terms of a defined set of governmental technologies, or what Foucault deemed <italic>programmes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095399711429107">Foucault, 1991b</xref>). Programmes act on existing regimes of practices of government in a strategic effort to change them, using “sets of calculated, reasoned prescriptions in terms of what institutions are meant to be organized, spaces arranged, [and] behaviours [sic] regulated” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095399711429107">Foucault, 1991b</xref>, p. 80). The philanthropic programme comprises technologies, languages, knowledges, and expertise that seek to promote a form of government by which individuals govern themselves and others with an aim toward solving society’s problems through the rational application of knowledge. Programmes emerge and operate within a milieu that is constituted by systemic ways of thinking about the nature of government (i.e., governmentalities; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711429107">Dean, 1999</xref>), and the philanthropic programme is no different. It emerged and took hold in a time when liberal governing rationalities dominated the Western world. Therefore, exploring the development of liberalism is crucial to understanding how the philanthropic programme has worked to reform benevolent service and how it has come to constitute our current understanding of nonprofit organizations and the role they play in American life.</p>

<sec id="section3-0095399711429107">
<title>Liberalism and the Creation of Society</title>
<p>In Western society, no governmentality can match the impact of liberalism, primarily because it functions as a political philosophy and as a specific type of art of government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711429107">Dean, 1999</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095399711429107">Burchell, 1996</xref>). As a political philosophy, one can sum up its particular <italic>ethos</italic> as, “‘One always governs too much—or at least, one should always suspect that one governs too much” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0095399711429107">Foucault, 2008</xref>, p. 319). In other words, liberalism is skeptical of the benefits wrought by the state’s exercise of superfluous government. It holds at its core a critical and problematizing nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095399711429107">Burchell, 1996</xref>), which allows it to position itself against other forms of government and to critique them, no matter what the circumstances in which it finds itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711429107">Dean, 1999</xref>). Intellectual titans such as Emmanuel Kant, Adam Smith, and James Steuart facilitated its historical development during the 18th century, as they produced treatises that, in part, focused on “knowability” (e.g., the ability of one to know the universe, or the ability of a sovereign to fully know the processes, institutions, and subjects that comprise his principality) and its limits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0095399711429107">Gordon, 1991</xref>, p. 16). In particular, Kant argued that humankind is incapable of possessing full knowledge of anything, and, thus, one’s control over everything is limited—an idea Smith seized on and applied to the management of the state. In time, these expositions led to the problematization of two existing forms of governmental rationalities that flourished during the 17th and 18th centuries—<italic>raison d’Etat</italic> (or reason of state) and police—which were declared as impossibilities in practice, thus paving the way for liberalism’s subsequent dominance in political thought.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0095399711429107">Foucault (1991a)</xref> argues that <italic>raison d’Etat</italic> as an art of government first emerged in the 16th century with the publication of <italic>The Prince</italic> and the subsequent responses to it generated by contemporary scholars who decried its emphasis on the sovereign and his relationship to the kingdom he ruled. <italic>Raison d’Etat</italic> can be understood as a way of thinking about governing without focusing on the sovereign’s role, for its particular emphasis is on management of the state. More specifically, governing “according to the principle of <italic>raison d’Etat</italic> is to arrange things so that the state becomes sturdy and permanent . . . wealthy, and . . . strong in the face of everything that may destroy it” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0095399711429107">Foucault, 2008</xref>, p. 4). Consequently, the state itself—and not the sovereign and his relationship to his principality—must be considered as the target of governance, a development that brings the state to bear as a natural, constituted object and that necessitates that this art of government use reason alone in its governing processes, foregoing the pursuit of guidance from God or the sovereign (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711429107">Dean, 1999</xref>). It is, after all, seeking to establish the state on its own merits and not those of a higher power, divine or otherwise. Accordingly, <italic>raison d’Etat</italic> must also recognize that its sole objective is maintenance of the state even though it respects “divine, moral, and natural laws . . . which are not homogeneous with or intrinsic to the state” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0095399711429107">Foucault, 2008</xref>, p. 4). To this end, individuals within the state are of use to <italic>raison d’Etat</italic> only with regard to their positive or negative influence on its pursuit of its objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711429107">Dean, 1999</xref>). Of course, maintaining a state through reason alone assumes that a certain knowledge of the state—primarily regarding its own strengths and weaknesses—exists and can be accessed by which the state can be armed in its struggle for survival against other states.</p>
<p>In practice, the state hones and shapes <italic>raison d’Etat</italic> through a system of armed forces and alliances with powerful individuals, institutions, and other states—a “diplomatico-military technology”—and through police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399711429107">Foucault, 1994</xref>, p. 69). While the diplomatico-military technology allows the state to externally maintain the appearance of strength to other states, it is the police that serves the state’s internal needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711429107">Dean, 1999</xref>). Prior to the 19th century, the word “police” did not have the same meaning as it does today (a force for maintaining law and order). Rather, it was understood as the state’s rationale and process for maintaining as well as expanding on its internal strengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0095399711429107">Pasquino, 1991</xref>)—a concept born from the German science <italic>Polizeiwissenschaft</italic>, the purpose of which was to develop techniques for maximizing the state’s wealth by enhancing the productivity of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0095399711429107">Gordon, 1991</xref>). Accordingly, police must accomplish three tasks: (a) keep and compile statistical information on the population, territory, and the state’s resources; (b) develop and implement measures to grow and maintain the wealth of the population and the state; and (c) maintain public felicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0095399711429107">Pasquino, 1991</xref>). In this way, police serves as a kind of “economic pastorate” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0095399711429107">Gordon, 1991</xref>, p. 12) in which the ancient Judeo-Christian imperative to care for all souls as they are shepherded toward eternal salvation—an influence that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711429107">Dean (1999)</xref> argues is still strongly felt in the 17th and 18th centuries—is turned on its head so that the state acts to ensure the welfare of all individuals—singly and as a cohesive population—as it steers them toward prosperity and security in <italic>this</italic> world. In other words, the knowledge and techniques of police must be individual and totalizing if it is to be successful in support of <italic>raison d’Etat</italic> and its pursuit of the maintenance of the state.</p>
<p>Liberalism, however, rejects as flawed both the underpinnings and pursuits of <italic>raison d’Etat</italic> and the police. Couched in the work of Kant and Smith, liberalism plays skeptic to the notion that the state can have full knowledge of its own strengths and weaknesses and thus shape its future accordingly. Liberalism argues that the state is in reality faced with managing its affairs in relation to the more “quasi-natural” domains of the marketplace and civil society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095399711429107">Burchell, 1996</xref>, p. 22), as well as the rise of active citizenship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0095399711429107">Rose, 1996b</xref>). The marketplace, civil society, and the free subject all exist outside the purview of the state, and thus hold their own intrinsic natures and methods for self-regulation—They do not need to be regulated by the state to correctly function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095399711429107">Burchell, 1996</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0095399711429107">Burchell, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711429107">Dean, 1999</xref>). In fact, they function at a more optimal level when left untouched.</p>
<p>These domains deeply affect the state and the pursuit of its own agenda, however, and are in many ways necessary to its success. This is a hard reality that liberalism addresses through the application of the principles and techniques of <italic>laissez-faire</italic>—“a principle for governing in accordance with the grain of things [which] presupposes a specification of the objects of government in such a way that the regulations they need are, in a sense, self-indicated” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0095399711429107">Burchell, 1991</xref>, p. 127). Liberalism understands that state interference in any one of these domains risks adversely affecting their naturally occurring dynamics, which in turn puts the state itself in jeopardy; yet, at the same time, it also understands that the state must ensure that conditions are optimal for securing positive outcomes within these domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095399711429107">Burchell, 1996</xref>). <italic>Laissez-faire</italic> to a large extent solves this “conundrum of how to establish a viable boundary between the objects of necessary state action and those of necessary state inaction” and sets the “<italic>agenda</italic> and the <italic>non-agenda</italic> of government” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0095399711429107">Gordon, 1991</xref>, p. 18, italics in the original). With its engagement of <italic>laissez-faire</italic>, liberalism metamorphoses from political philosophy into full-fledged art of government replete with processes, technologies, and knowledges all its own.</p>
<p>In practice, <italic>laissez-faire</italic> borrows heavily from the technologies of police in that it is individualizing and totalizing in its pursuit of security of the state, although it significantly differs from its predecessor by affirming “the necessarily opaque, dense autonomous character of the processes of population [while remaining] preoccupied with the vulnerability of these same processes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0095399711429107">Gordon, 1991</xref>, p. 20). More specifically, <italic>laissez-faire</italic> recognizes that the pursuit of individual interests <italic>à la Homo œconomicus</italic> is good not only for the individual but also for the whole of society as well as the state; however, it also recognizes that these interests must be shaped as much as possible to ensure the predictability of individual and collective choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0095399711429107">Burchell, 1991</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095399711429107">Burchell, 1996</xref>). Consequently, a <italic>laissez-faire</italic> government “depends upon the conduct of individuals who are parts of a population [as well as] subjects of particular, personal interests,” and thus becomes “a government of interests” at the level of the individual and the population as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0095399711429107">Burchell, 1991</xref>, p. 127).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095399711429107">Foucault (1990/1976</xref>) refers to this development as the introduction of “bio-power” into the forces of history (p. 140). At the individual level, bio-power is made manifest through the “anatamo-politics of the human body,” a system by which disciplinary techniques—perpetrated primarily through the disciplines associated with the social sciences—optimize the human body for economic pursuits by making it efficient and docile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095399711429107">Foucault, 1990/1976</xref>, p. 139; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095399711429107">Foucault, 1995/1975</xref>). A “bio-politics of the population,” however, aims to supervise individuals <italic>en masse</italic> by systematizing and controlling biological processes like health, births, deaths, life expectancy, and anything that might affect them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095399711429107">Foucault, 1990/1976</xref>, p. 139). In short, this fundamental control over individual and collective interests in the pursuit of state security is so complete that it amounts to a power over life itself.</p>
<sec id="section4-0095399711429107">
<title>The Creation of Society</title>
<p>To be sure, this development might indicate that liberalism is little more than a passive/aggressive version of <italic>raison d’Etat</italic>, yet the paramount feature of liberalism remains its critical nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0095399711429107">Rose, 1996b</xref>). It continually questions itself and its intentions in the pursuit of the optimal level of government that exists somewhere between too little and too much. Of course, liberalism is able to critique itself and still survive because it does so in the name of securing the quasi-natural domain of civil society. By questioning in the 18th century the efficacy of police and its ability to penetrate all levels of the population in its pursuit of knowledge and security, liberalism recognizes the existence of a “society” that exists outside the purview of the state (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095399711429107">Barry, Osborne, &amp; Rose, 1996a</xref>, p. 9). Liberalism in fact constitutes civil society and allows it to take shape in our consciousness when confronted with the inadequacies of police.</p>
<p>Civil society, then, can be viewed as the product of the processes of emergence and, more specifically, as one of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0095399711429107">Foucault (2008)</xref> calls <italic>transactional realities</italic>, the emergence and maintenance of which depends on the interplay between those entities that govern and those that are governed. Indeed, according to Foucault, civil society is not “an historical-natural given which functions in some way as both the foundation of and source of opposition to the state or political institutions. . . . [I]t is something which forms part of modern governmental technology” (p. 297). Civil society, in fact, provides the nonpolitical frame of reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711429107">Dean, 1999</xref>) by which liberalism can govern subjects who have both economic and juridical rights.</p>
<p>This situation is made possible by the very characteristics by which civil society is defined. First, civil society establishes a boundary that is concomitant with the idea of a nation, for this boundary acts to establish the parameters of population, territory, and—more abstractly—justice, for which the state is responsible to govern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711429107">Dean, 1999</xref>). Second, liberalism conceives of civil society as a totality, in that certain regularities in behavior, actions, and decisions associated at the level of a population are irreducible to a more limited level, such as the family or the individual. Finally, civil society carries with it a “self-rendering unity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0095399711429107">Gordon, 1991</xref>, p. 22; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711429107">Dean, 1999</xref>, p. 125) that allows economic and noneconomic interests to coexist, and which promotes “cohesion and solidarity . . . [as well as] breakdown and dissolution,” such that social norms can exist even in the face of racial, ethnic, political, and gender divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711429107">Dean, 1999</xref>, p. 125). Framed in this way, civil society allows <italic>Homo œconomicus</italic> and his self-interested nature to coexist relatively peacefully with Democratic Citizen, Biological Individual, Community Member, and so on, and still be manageable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0095399711429107">Foucault, 2008</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0095399711429107">Gordon, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711429107">Dean, 1999</xref>). In short, with the advent of society as a formalized concept, liberalism solves its dilemma of how to promote the self-interested behavior that is so vital to the smooth functioning of the marketplace while time retain the political and legal rights of the individual.</p>

<title>The Rise of the Welfare State</title>
<p>Ultimately, liberalism governs and produces civil society to ensure its optimal and natural functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095399711429107">Burchell, 1996</xref>); yet, over time, civil society proves to be a remedy unable to withstand every problem faced by liberalism. Over the course of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, liberalism becomes viewed as something of a failure, for it has been unable to produce satisfactory economic and social norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0095399711429107">Rose, 1996b</xref>). For example, poverty remains a troublesome issue, as concerns regarding pauperism—namely, the demoralization of the poor, criminality, unhygienic living conditions and disease—arise during this time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711429107">Dean, 1999</xref>). Liberalism proves ill equipped to contend with these issues, even through the routine functioning of the marketplace or through the norms of civil society, for its very nature disallows involvement in the lives of the individuals that comprise the state. There no longer exists a link between the state and the family, or between the state and the individual (only the population), and there are no tools available to liberalism beyond those provided by the economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711429107">Dean, 1999</xref>). So, the question becomes one of how to bridge the gap between the state and the family, or the state and the individual, and how to do so in a way that maintains appropriate juridical boundaries between the public and private spheres of life, so that the poor are successfully incorporated into civil society, especially as they pertain to participation in the marketplace and adherence to economic norms.</p>
<p>A solution presents itself through a new form of rule called <italic>welfarism</italic> or the <italic>welfare state</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0095399711429107">Rose, 1993</xref>). Through the governing strategies of the welfare state, politics and various forms of expertise assemble to combat the negative effects of liberalism’s <italic>laissez-faire</italic> form of rule by way of the reestablishment of the sense of solidarity that is so integral to the continued optimal functioning of the marketplace. In this new form of rule, the state is able to sidestep its inability to act directly on the individual by governing <italic>through</italic> society. More specifically, the state engenders solidarity by acting on individuals and their activities in relation to the establishment and promotion of social norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0095399711429107">Rose, 1993</xref>) by certain experts. Indeed,
<disp-quote>
<p>Political rule [i.e., the state] would not itself set out the norms of individual conduct, but would instill and empower a variety of “professionals” who would, investing them with authority to act as experts in the devices of social rule. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0095399711429107">Rose, 1993</xref>, p. 285))</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, in the welfare state, expertise is crucial, for it allows the state to govern at a distance.</p>
<p>The instrument/object of the welfare state is a reformulation of society collectively referred to as “the social” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0095399711429107">Donzelot, 1979</xref>, p. 88). The social is best understood as a terrain of programs, institutions, technologies, and knowledges that allow for a new kind of government of the individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0095399711429107">Rose &amp; Miller, 1992</xref>). More pointedly, the social is defined as,
<disp-quote>
<p>The set of means which allow social life to escape material pressures and politico-moral uncertainties; the entire range of methods which make the members of society relatively safe from the effects of economic fluctuations by providing a certain security—which give their existence possibilities of relations that are flexible enough, and internal stakes that are convincing enough, to avert the dislocation that divergences of interests and beliefs would entail. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0095399711429107">Donzelot, 1979</xref>, p. xxvi)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In other words, the social works on behalf of the welfare state to solve the problems created by liberalism through various techniques that ensure personal security while promoting social norms. These techniques include designating certain issues as particularly “social” issues, generating disciplines like social work and sociology, creating new socially oriented legal jurisdictions like juvenile and family courts, and designating new professionals like social workers and sociologists, all of which seek to better the quality of family and individual life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711429107">Dean, 1999</xref>, p. 53).</p>
<p>The solutions provided by these techniques to maintain security in the face of economic fluctuations and social upheaval are not without cost to the individual. Each technique, program, or institution ensures the supremacy of newly anointed social experts as they act on the individual to ensure compliance with social norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0095399711429107">Rose, 1996b</xref>). The techniques of the social are only successful when the individual or family on whom the intervention is applied acts as an accomplice in her own normalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711429107">Dean, 1999</xref>). Individuals must exhibit a desire to be functioning members of society—indeed, to be normal—for the social intervention to be deemed truly successful. This ultimately signifies that the network comprising truth-expounding experts and the individuals who play the objects of their interventions allows the state to govern at an arm’s length, thus solving the issues created by liberalism without foregoing its inherent nature.</p>

<sec id="section6-0095399711429107">
<title>Remaking the Social</title>
<p>Philanthropy is an integral component of the social and its processes of normalization. Through philanthropy and its constituent organizations and interventions, individuals who require assistance to better their unfortunate circumstances can be provided with immediate relief, but only in exchange for their acceptance of the benefits of certain expertise, such as the “right” way to save money, raise children, and maintain employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711429107">Dean, 1999</xref>, p. 128). In this process of exchange there is an inherent expectation that individuals will continue to use the information imparted to them to continue bettering themselves and their unfortunate circumstances. So, although individuals who have been deemed aberrant receive aid, they are also able to maintain a sense of autonomy in their decision making. Maintaining individuals’ ability to exercise knowledge in their own best interest is vital for the successful functioning of the marketplace (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0095399711429107">Cruikshank, 1999</xref>). Indeed, knowledge frees the individual. Only, in these particular circumstances, knowledge frees the individual with the express purpose to facilitate her full participation in the marketplace.</p>
<p>Although philanthropy plays an integral part in the social (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0095399711429107">Donzelot, 1979</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711429107">Dean, 1999</xref>) through its provision of a combination of care and knowledge, its particular mode of government did not take effect within the social in a completely comprehensive way. To put it simply, “things [did not] work out as planned” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095399711429107">Foucault, 1991b</xref>, p. 80). Rather, philanthropy faced “different strategies which are mutually opposed, composed and superposed” to it, which produced “permanent and solid effects which . . . don’t [sic] conform to the initial programming” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095399711429107">Foucault, 1991b</xref>, pp. 80-81). In this case, the opposing strategies consist of two erstwhile discourses that competed with the nascent philanthropic mode of service: charity and the self-interested, utility maximizing discourse of <italic>Homo œconomicus</italic>.</p>
<p>The existence of these competing discourses is evidence of a much larger issue at work in the social. While the social can be understood as a bounded domain that is the instrument/object of the welfare state, it is also fundamentally diverse, heterogeneous, and replete with assorted institutions, experts, and knowledges all aimed at responding to the problems posed by liberal government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711429107">Dean, 1999</xref>). In other words, its “guts” are neither coherent nor particularly unified. Rather, it shares only “a common vocabulary [which] was formed [to seek] a general codification of these problems as issues entailing the whole of society” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711429107">Dean, 1999</xref>, p. 129). More pointedly, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0095399711429107">Donzelot (1988)</xref>, the social “was never more than the lumping together under a single label of a whole range of concrete solutions to different aspects of social problems. It never succeeded in designating its object, concepts and methods with any rigour [sic]” (pp. 397-398). This is most likely why its various interventions, including the practice of benevolence, remained “tied to the main ideological currents of the nineteenth century” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0095399711429107">Donzelot, 1988</xref>, p. 397), including the practice of charity and the self-interested behavior of <italic>Homo œconomicus</italic>.</p>
<p>The inherent instability of the social ultimately serves to undermine the aims of the welfare state. Through the social, the welfare state proves unable to successfully reestablish the sense of solidarity that is necessary to promote the security of the marketplace. Indeed, the welfare state cannot resolve the conundrum posed by interests that are vital to the state’s own security but that also oftentimes operate in contradiction with one another.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0095399711429107">7</xref></sup> As a result, beginning in the mid-to-late 20th century, a collection of governmentalities, which are commonly referred to as neoliberalism, problematizes the welfare state. The aim of these particular governmentalities is to supplant the inherent naturalism of liberalism and welfarism with more constructivist tendencies in a rather paradoxical effort to reestablish the predominance of forms of government that work through the quasi-natural domain of the marketplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095399711429107">Burchell, 1996</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section7-0095399711429107">
<title>The Governmentalities of Neoliberalism</title>
<p>In Europe and the United States, neoliberalism emerged taking on two very distinct—although not altogether dissimilar—forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0095399711429107">Foucault, 2008</xref>). In Europe, neoliberalism surfaced post World War II through a series of essays published in the journal <italic>Ordo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0095399711429107">8</xref></sup>, which took aim at socialism and the Keynesian economic policies that emerged in the first half of the 20th century. In short, European <italic>ordoliberals</italic> criticize states that fail to rely on the mechanisms of the marketplace and instead engage with interventionist economic policies that undermine the natural functioning of the marketplace and the legal rights of citizens. For them, the marketplace does not require planning and intervention, and, in fact, they assert that Nazism and Stalinism would not have arisen without states’ proclivity toward intervention in the marketplace. The ordoliberals contend that the marketplace is rather something that can be organized—not planned or directed—through social policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0095399711429107">Gordon, 1991</xref>) so that it functions optimally but without impinging on the legal and social rights of those who participate in it. Essentially, they argue for intervention in civil society as a means to organize the marketplace.</p>
<p>In the United States, however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0095399711429107">Foucault (2008)</xref> argues that a brand of neoliberalism, which he dubs <italic>anarcho-capitalism</italic>, emerges predominantly through the writings of Chicago School economists. Like their European counterparts, they also object to interventionist economic policies, which in the United States manifest primarily through social programs like the New Deal. They believe these policies result in a welfare state run amok, replete with rigid bureaucracy, a proliferation of top-heavy state institutions, professionals whose authority is unchecked, and a distorted marketplace. Yet, American neoliberals differ from ordoliberals in their solution to excessive government, most likely because—as Foucault asserts—“liberalism in America is a whole way of being and thinking” (p. 218) and not simply a philosophical approach to government. Rather than manage the marketplace through carefully implemented social interventions as ordoliberals contend, American neoliberals propose the opposite: they propose to extend the rationality of the marketplace to all corners of human existence. In other words, in the United States, economics becomes “an ‘approach’ capable in principle of addressing the totality of human behavior, and, consequently, of envisaging a coherent, purely economic method of programming the totality of governmental action” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0095399711429107">Gordon, 1991</xref>, p. 43). In short, the question of government becomes one not of whether the state should intervene in civil society but of how it can intervene in civil society to achieve optimal results in the marketplace by using the very principles that organize it.</p>
<p>Regardless of the form of neoliberalism, though, a notion that becomes particularly salient to its development in the 20th century in Europe and the United States is the injection of the enterprise model into all areas of behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095399711429107">Burchell, 1996</xref>). In economic thought, the enterprise is an institution whose purpose is to facilitate supply and demand through competition. In liberal and neoliberal thought, however, the enterprise “is not just an institution but a way of behaving . . . in the form of competition in terms of plans and projects, and with objectives, tactics, and so forth” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0095399711429107">Foucault, 2008</xref>, p. 175). Neoliberalism seeks not only to infuse society with the enterprise model so that individuals must engage with it in a variety of capacities, but also to encourage the individual to think of herself and all her relationships through the framework of an enterprise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0095399711429107">Foucault, 2008</xref>). Indeed, the individual herself becomes conceptualized as an enterprise.</p>
<p>Of course, this creation of such an “enterprise society” engenders a number of significant effects. First, it allows the economic model of supply and demand, and competition, to become the model for social and interpersonal relations, thereby extending the economic model into civil society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0095399711429107">Foucault, 2008</xref>). Second, it engenders a highly potent form of self-government:
<disp-quote>
<p>The idea of one’s life as the enterprise of oneself implies that there is a sense in which one remains always continuously employed in (at least) that one enterprise [the self], and that it is a part of the continuous business of living to make adequate provision for the preservation, reproduction and reconstruction of one’s own human capital. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0095399711429107">Gordon, 1991</xref>, p. 44)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This signals an enhanced period of “responsibilization” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095399711429107">Burchell, 1996</xref>, p. 29) beginning in the latter half of the 20th century in which individuals actively seek to mitigate the negative impact of their behavior through a responsible practice of freedom and individual choice. In other words, neoliberalism engenders the specification of a new subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0095399711429107">Rose, 1996b</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0095399711429107">Rose &amp; Miller, 1992</xref>)—one who possesses the ability to freely act, but only in a responsible manner and within a prescribed mode of conduct.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0095399711429107">
<title>Community Government</title>
<p>With the advent of this period of responsibilization and enterprise behavior, the conception of civil society is transformed. Whereas the governing rationalities of liberalism and welfarism hold that society is a source of needs that “are individually distributed and collectively borne,” neoliberalism views society as “a source of energies contained within individuals’ exercise of freedom and self-responsibility” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711429107">Dean, 1999</xref>, p. 152). In other words, society is still viewed as a collection of individuals who have a collective impact; but, the source of that impact is not individuals’ <italic>needs</italic> but rather, the force of their autonomous decision making—their <italic>entrepreneurialism</italic>. Accordingly, the manner in which we understand how society should be governed also changes. In liberal society, individual interests are shaped in accordance with the domain’s inherent nature and internal mechanisms. The welfare state intervenes in society through the use of the experts to correct the problems wrought by liberalism’s <italic>laissez-faire</italic> approach to the management of society. For neoliberalism, however, the interests of society do not need to be regulated. Rather, the autonomous actions of individuals and groups within society need to be cultivated and facilitated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711429107">Dean, 1999</xref>) to affect a more competitive and efficient—indeed, a more “marketized”—sphere. Ultimately, the aim of neoliberalism is to extend the logic of the marketplace to all areas of life such that all “institutional and individual conduct [is reformed] so that both come to embody the values and orientations of the market, expressed in notions of the enterprise and the consumer” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711429107">Dean, 1999</xref>, p. 172).</p>
<p>To this end, neoliberalism emphasizes association rather than solidarity, which is at the heart of the aims of liberalism and the welfare state. While a certain measure of cooperation and <italic>esprit de corps</italic> among individuals and groups is necessary to stave off complete anarchy, a sense of kinship at the societal level is not ideal, for it stifles individuality and its consequent entrepreneurialism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0095399711429107">9</xref></sup> The ascendancy of the governing rationalities of neoliberalism signals a reassertion of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0095399711429107">Cruikshank (1999)</xref> calls the <italic>science of association</italic> (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711429107">Dean, 1999</xref>). Early in the development of the United States, individuals became socially isolated from one another by the very liberty that underpinned the newly formed democratic nation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0095399711429107">de Tocqueville, 1998/1834</xref>). This social isolation engendered a sense of individualism that undermined the social solidarity that is vital to the successful promotion of nationhood (and to the operation of the market). An artificial sense of solidarity was engineered through the formation of and participation in voluntary associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0095399711429107">Cruikshank, 1999</xref>). If these associations were to be successful in achieving their goals rather than dissolve into disorder, members had to exercise a certain level of restraint, or self-government. In other words, voluntary association engenders a certain measure of <italic>esprit de corps</italic> by way of members’ exercise of self-government.</p>
<p>The erstwhile science of association is reasserted as a part of a new “politics of community” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0095399711429107">Rose, 1996a</xref>). Community has now replaced the social as the instrument/object of the state. More specifically, with the advent of neoliberalism, the social fractured into a multitude of “localized, heterogeneous, [and] overlapping” communities<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0095399711429107">10</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0095399711429107">Rose, 1996a</xref>, p. 333). As such, the community is defined by its own set of characteristics that serve to distinguish it from the social. For instance, while the individual is still self-governing and responsible, she is also bonded to others in the community—but only in the community—whereas in the social, one held collective ties and obligations with the whole of society. In addition, the lines of an individual’s sense of personal identity are configured through allegiance to the things with which one identifies emotionally and traditionally—indeed, directly—rather than as a member of an integrated, national whole, or society (a process of identification that is more indirect in nature). Ultimately, this creates a new field of dividing practices<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0095399711429107">11</xref></sup> to identify those who are affiliated with the community (i.e., those who have the economic and moral means to be entrepreneurial) and those who are to be marginalized because they cannot enterprise themselves or are part of an anticommunity. In either case, these groups—these communities—“no longer mediate between society and the individual but represent a plurality of agents that are put into play in diverse strategies of government” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711429107">Dean, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The new politics of community necessitates a revised understanding of the role of expertise in the government of individuals. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0095399711429107">Rose (1996a)</xref> states it, “social government <italic>was</italic> [italics added] expert government” (p. 349). In the welfare state, experts governed society with authority bestowed on them by the state. In the government of community, however, experts, their organizations, and their institutions are being deployed in a new way:
<disp-quote>
<p>Locales and activities that were previously part of the assemblages of the “social” are being autonomized from the machinery of politics [i.e., the state] and novel devices are being used to govern the activities of those who work in them. In a plethora of quasi-autonomous units, associations, and “intermediate organizations,” experts are allocated and new responsibilities and new mechanisms are developed for the management of professional expertise “at a distance”—that is, outside the machinery of bureaucracy that previously bound experts into devises for the government of the “the social.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0095399711429107">Rose, 1996a</xref>, p. 350)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Rather than glean authority from the state to devise and maintain social norms, experts are now largely disconnected from the state<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0095399711429107">12</xref></sup> and must independently deploy their authority to govern the community. More pointedly, they oftentimes find themselves in “quasi-private” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0095399711429107">Rose, 1996a</xref>, p. 350) organizations and agencies such as nonprofits that facilitate the achievement of priorities once considered the domain of the state.</p>
<p>The state is able to continue governing at a distance through communities and the nonprofits that govern them while still achieving its aim of promoting the marketization of life by engaging in what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0095399711429107">Foucault (2008)</xref> calls “framework policy.” Framework policy allows the state to organize all the mechanisms that surround the marketplace to ensure its smooth functioning without actually working directly on mechanisms of the marketplace itself. In other words, the state frames all that is not naturally a part of the marketplace, such as individuals’ needs, natural resources, political and legal structures, and scientific knowledge (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0095399711429107">Foucault, 2008</xref>, p. 140n) so as to bolster the functioning of the market. By transforming through law the scientific, technical, social, and legal bases on which the market operates, the state is able to organize the conditions of the marketplace without directly working on its mechanisms. In other words, the law is a tool by which the neoliberal state can effectively govern at a distance. Here, the state uses framework policy to establish a norm of philanthropy for the nonprofit sector (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0095399711429107">Sandberg, 2011</xref>). More specifically, through the passage of legislation like the Tax Reform Act of 1969 and the establishment of the 501(c) section of the tax code, the state organizes communities and the nonprofit sector and orients them toward the principles of the marketplace without directly working on them by establishing through law a norm of philanthropic service.</p>

<title>Theorizing Society’s Aide</title>
<p>If the function of the contemporary nonprofit organization within neoliberal governing rationalities is to provide a venue through which citizens can learn to become autonomous, self-governing subjects vis-à-vis philanthropic norms, what then is the purpose of the theoretical constructs that underpin the sector today? What is their purpose within the larger <italic>dispositif</italic> that supports the marketization of all areas of life? As has been discussed, contemporary nonprofit theory collectively asserts that nonprofit organizations’ very existence is to shore up our economic and political systems. They correct the marketplace when private enterprise and/or government institutions fail to provide goods and services in an efficient and effective manner. They act as a trustworthy source for the provision of public goods, even to the most disenfranchised consumers in the marketplace. Nonprofits fill a creative void in the hearts and minds of ideological entrepreneurs, and they provide a third-party venue through which members of a democratic society cannot only learn about their civic duty but also exercise it. More specifically, though, in these theories the nonprofit institution exists to provide balance in a political, economic, and social landscape that has become unbalanced and—even more frightening—unpredictable. Without the presence of these organizations, all members of society would not be able to participate in the marketplace or in democratic processes. In short, they act as society’s aides. They are our helpers, our assistants. Nonprofits rescue us and—perhaps more significantly—our economic and democratic systems when they fail to operate as they should.</p>
<p>By asserting the notion that nonprofits act as aides to restore political, social, and economic equilibrium, it becomes easier to sidestep difficult questions posed by the very theoretical foundations on which these conclusions are drawn. Questions such as, “Why do our democratic and economic systems need so much assistance as to necessitate the evolution of a brand new sector?” or, perhaps more pointedly, “What forces are at play within our democratic and economic systems that require an institutional aide to ensure that they continue working for us?” In this way, contemporary nonprofit theory serves to disguise the function of the nonprofit organization within a neoliberal governing rationality. While the nonprofit institution itself helps to facilitate the marketization of all areas of life through the promotion of the values of entrepreneurialism and competition vis-à-vis a philanthropic mode of service, its theoretical underpinnings sentimentalize its purpose and give it meaning as an equalizer in an unbalanced world, which on its face is a laudable purpose. More to the point, contemporary nonprofit theory collectively serves to constitute “the truth” of how this type of institution functions in our individual and collective lives. This truth, however, cannot be separate from the power relations that inform its development and operation. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0095399711429107">Foucault (1980b)</xref> asserts that truth can never be separated from power: “Truth isn’t [sic] outside power, or lacking in power. . . . Truth is a thing of this world: it is produced only by virtue of multiple forms of constraint. And it induces regular effects of power” (p. 131).</p>
<p>Why then has <italic>this</italic> truth been produced? What is the ultimate function of the discourse of contemporary nonprofit theory that asserts the notion of the nonprofit-as-aide? If the nonprofit institution acts to facilitate the objectives of neoliberalism and promote an enterprise culture in pursuit of the marketplace, then the notion of the nonprofit-as-aide acts to make at least a part of this process palatable by asserting that not only does the nonprofit institution operate outside typical economic and political processes, which are sometimes found to be distasteful, but also, its sole purpose is in fact to mitigate the damage done to the individual and to the community by these processes. Contemporary nonprofit theory, then, ultimately functions within this <italic>dispositif</italic> to mask the power that defines and gives form to neoliberal governing rationalities, at least as they relate to nonprofit organizations. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095399711429107">Foucault (1990/1976)</xref>,
<disp-quote>
<p>Power is tolerable only on the condition that it mask a substantial part of itself. Its success is proportional to its ability to hide its own mechanisms. . . . Secrecy is not in the nature of abuse; it is indispensable to its operation. (p. 86)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>And there is no better mask for power than one that projects the very antithesis of the mechanisms it seeks to hide.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article has provided an alternative framework for understanding the role that nonprofit organizations play in American life. Drawing on the critical insights afforded by the literature on genealogy, government, and liberalism, this alternate reading of the development of the nonprofit sector and of the contemporary theoretical constructs that underpin it suggests that nonprofits have a distinct role to play in advancing the aims of neoliberalism, namely, entrepreneurialism and competition. In addition, the analysis undertaken in this article suggests that nonprofits can be viewed not only as objects that are governed by the marketplace and by the state within neoliberal governing rationalities, but also as governors themselves who—through the use of a philanthropic norm of service—act to inform individuals’ conduct.</p>
<p>My intent with this article is not to supplant the predominant understanding of the nonprofit sector and simply replace it with another one. Rather, it is to confront the dominance of the discourse of nonprofit-as-aide within nonprofit studies to begin a dialogue regarding the role—or potential role(s)—that nonprofits play in larger society. It is my hope that by suggesting that there is (and can be) an alternate understanding of the nonprofit sector and of the place it occupies in American life, we can create an opportunity to change what is possible to say about the nature of nonprofit service. And when there is an opportunity to change what is possible to say, then there exists the opportunity to “change what is possible to do, to think, or to be” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0095399711429107">Cruikshank, 1999</xref>, p. 21).</p>

<p>While the intellectual influences on the theoretical underpinnings of the nonprofit sector range from economics to sociology, and from anthropology to ethics (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0095399711429107">Ott, 2001</xref>), existing theories that seek to explain why we have a nonprofit sector fall into one of three distinct categories: economic theory, political theory, and everything else (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0095399711429107">Salamon, 2001</xref>). While such a statement may seem unsympathetic with regard to the well-articulated theories that fall outside the realm of the economic and the political (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095399711429107">Billis &amp; Glennerster, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0095399711429107">DiMaggio &amp; Anheier, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0095399711429107">Lohmann, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0095399711429107">Sjostrand, 2000</xref>), the influence of economic and political theory (though primarily economic theory) within nonprofit studies has been so profound that little else currently wields much influence.</p></fn>

<p>There is debate as to whether charity and philanthropy hold the same meaning.

<p>Foucault refers to this as the “welfare state problem,” in which the individual is viewed as an actor who has equal rights within the political community and a person whose welfare is promoted as part of an ongoing system of integration into society (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711429107">Dean, 1999</xref>, p. 82).

<p>Here, the work of Hannah Arendt is a key touchstone. In her discussion of the social versus the political, Arendt argues that the predominance of the social realm has stifled individual freedom. The social expects a certain kind of behavior from individuals, and thus imposes rules on them to restrict their behavior. This restriction of behavior—this normalization of individual behavior—stifles individuality and personal achievement.

<p>This is not to say that the state does not deploy expertise and experts on its own behalf. The experts and expertise in question here relate to anything formerly referred to as a “social” issue. This is said, however, with the caveat in mind that what is considered a target of “social” or “community” expertise is something of a moving target, as priorities change over time.</p></fn>
