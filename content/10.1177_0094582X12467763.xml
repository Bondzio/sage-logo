<abstract>
<p>During the twentieth century, the political action of the urban poor in Santiago de Chile and Rio de Janeiro was a focal point of research in the social sciences. A critical reading of the major theories that were proposed begins with an analysis of marginality theory, which represented the first (negative) interpretation of the political potential of the marginalized. Subsequently, Santiago and Rio witnessed a series of urban popular experiences that elicited two opposing schools of thought: the urban-social-movement school and the utilitarian perspective. Chilean and Brazilian social scientists grappled with the way the popular sectors reacted to each country’s military dictatorship, and their interpretations reflected a certain indeterminacy, ranging from rediscovery to eulogy to denial. Urban popular struggle must be rethought in order to move beyond this theoretical ambivalence.</p>

La lucha popular urbana tiene que volver a pensarse para superar esta ambivalencia teórica.</p>

<p>During the twentieth century, Latin America’s urban poor stood at the center of the region’s intellectual debates. Reflection on their position gave rise to an extensive body of theory aimed at understanding the specifics of social reality in Latin American cities. Efforts were made to interpret the collective action of those residing in popular housing (which takes many forms) and situate it within the analytical frameworks of particular political agendas, agendas vying for the right to lead dependent societies down the road to development.</p>
<p>The marginalized have been understood by some writers as pawns (<italic>massa de manobra</italic>) potentially at the mercy of populist or revolutionary agendas, as a lesser arm of the proletariat, or as leading actors in a new form of class struggle, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094582X12467763">Castells (1972)</xref> would say—this despite the secondary nature of the dynamic that defines them (consumption/housing). All the same, they have been at the center of the political debate at certain junctures, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0094582X12467763">Touraine’s (1987)</xref> famous phrase “the centrality of the marginalized” (although apparently paradoxical) came to describe a major facet of collective popular action in Latin America.</p>
<p>My goal in this study is to analyze critically the way in which twentieth-century social science came to understand the political action of the urban poor in Rio de Janeiro (<italic>favelados</italic>) and Santiago de Chile (<italic>pobladores</italic>); in the process, I suggest some possible rereadings of these urban social movements.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0094582X12467763">1</xref></sup> Although the categories of favelado and poblador describe particular segments of the urban poor and not their totality, these labels became the focus of much of the debate around urban social issues in the region.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0094582X12467763">2</xref></sup> The favela is probably the type of popular housing that has had the greatest impact on images of urban poverty, whereas the experience of pobladores, for its part, played a decisive role in leading to the recognition that an eminently urban social movement starting from a subaltern position was capable of creating profound social transformations.</p>
<p>An effort to compare and contrast the way social scientists have approached the paths of collective action taken by favelados and pobladores can advance our understanding of the collective action of Latin America’s urban poor, moving beyond the dichotomies and vagaries of the different schools of thought that have examined urban social issues in Latin America.</p>
<p>This study is divided into four parts. The first part sets the stage by discussing trends in the interpretation of the “social question” in both Brazil and Chile. Here we see a tendency that also appears in the realm of specifically urban social issues: the Brazilian working class is seen as an object of manipulation (<italic>massa de manobra</italic>), whereas the Chilean working class is seen as becoming aware of its historical role in social transformation. The second part addresses the emergence of marginality theory as an initial, nebulous attempt at recognizing the political agency of favelados and pobladores. The third part examines the schools of thought opposed to marginality theory: major alternative interpretations of the urban poor’s political action came to see it as either a radical movement based on class consciousness or a utilitarian movement based on concrete demands. The final part briefly considers how the social sciences came to understand the reaction of movements led by pobladores and favelados vis-à-vis the military dictatorships of their respective countries.</p>

<title>The Social Question: Gift or Achievement?</title>
<p>The social question is closely tied to industrialization and urbanization; following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094582X12467763">Castel (2004)</xref>, it can be understood as an awareness of a central fracture, dramatized by proliferating descriptions of poverty, that may even lead to the dissolution of society as a whole. In Chile and Brazil academic approaches to the social question displayed certain similarities but arrived at opposite conclusions.</p>
<p>In both cases we see an initial stage of heroic unionism confronting the miserable living conditions of the working class, followed by a subsequent stage marked by an effort to expand the horizon of citizenship in relation to the state. In both countries the transition from the first stage to the second coincided with a framing of the movement that centered on the figure of the union as an entity mandated by the labor code, ignoring the initial heterogeneity displayed by workers’ organizations. From then on, the labor movement could no longer be understood outside its relation to the state, which itself came to be redefined by its attempt at social inclusion. This entailed a fundamental disjunction: relinquishing autonomy as a movement while achieving an important set of goals.</p>
<p>For mainstream Chilean historiography the social question was defined by the self-awareness of the working class, a product of its political and organizational maturity; pressure applied through strikes and electoral struggle resulted in the achievement of social legislation. Brazilian historiography, however, arrived at a diametrically opposite interpretation: social legislation was seen as a “gift” from the administration of Getúlio Vargas and the corporate state rather than the product of working-class struggle; unions were the result of social legislation rather than its cause.</p>
<p>The corporate state is the basis for understanding the rise of the idea that after the Brazilian Revolution of 1930 the social question became a matter of official policy rather than an opportunity for the working masses to bring about social change. This hypothesis was set forth by a thinker who was one of the Vargas administration’s most brilliant supporters, Oliveira Vianna: “The Revolution of 30 had the distinct merit of raising the social question—hitherto left to police jurisdiction in raids on the public square—to the dignity of a fundamental national problem, a problem to be solved through a set of laws whose precepts were guided, with a deep sense of social justice, by a noble spirit of harmony and collaboration” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0094582X12467763">Vianna, 1951</xref>: 11).</p>
<p>In Chile, by contrast, the official process of integration, which culminated in the institutionalization of a series of rights, was far from being interpreted as a gift from the ruling classes. Mainstream historiography saw it as an achievement of the working class, an achievement made possible by proletarian awareness, organizational capacity, and combativeness: “The history of the labor movement demonstrates that the rights now enjoyed by the working class and whatever benefits have been attained were not free concessions made by bourgeois authorities or landowners, nor were they disinterested gifts from the ruling classes. They are solely and exclusively achievements of the working class” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0094582X12467763">Ramírez Necochea, 2007</xref>: 287).</p>
<p>This brief overview has highlighted the basic either/or approach taken by traditional interpretations of the social question, which see the subaltern classes as either passive on the one hand or assertive on the other. The Chilean working class is held up as an example of a “class for itself,” whereas the Brazilian working class is seen as a “class in itself” (closer to being a “mass in itself”). It would be a mistake to apply this oversimplification to the context of the urban poor; if we were to do so, of course, the pobladores would represent a combative and politically active social movement, whereas the favelados would be (once again) an object of manipulation. We need to move beyond the limits of this interpretation and its effort to define the subaltern classes as more or less combative or more or less manipulable and focus instead on the constitution of both pobladores and favelados as political actors in their respective societies. The differences between their trajectories lie not in a predisposition toward organization and radicalism on the Chilean side (versus the opposite on the Brazilian side) but in the different political processes involved in the national disputes that in each country made it possible for a given repertoire to be more successful than its alternatives.</p>
<p>Specifically, the social question involves a dilemma that must be “prevented” insofar as the continued survival of society itself depends on ending the working class’s state of destitution. It entails a recognition of the potential within the subaltern classes to construct, hypothetically, a counterhegemonic project whose discourse is emboldened by their members’ lived experience of poverty. The “preventive” response to the social question in both Chile and Brazil represented an attempt to anticipate the social fractures that might arise from the organized action of the subaltern classes. The role of the working class is crucial here, whether because of the real threat it represents or because of the potential threat posed by its autonomous organization.</p>

<title>Marginality: Political Actors and the Threat They Pose</title>
<p>In the Latin American context several theories employed the category of “marginality” as a key explanatory variable. Their emphasis on different areas—productive, technical (related to the organization of production), sociocultural, political, demographic—demonstrated that discussions of marginality were imbricated with the assumptions that underlay the contrasting models of development presented as alternatives for understanding and overcoming underdevelopment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0094582X12467763">Germani, 1973</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the theoretical heterogeneity of the “marginal” perspectives, they found common ground in their reading of marginality as dysfunctional; regardless of the ideological allegiance behind the analysis, the marginalized were associated with a potential for disruption, whether positive (in their capacity for revolution) or negative (in the burden they placed on the rest of society). The focus remained on the need for social change, be it revolutionary or reformist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0094582X12467763">Machado da Silva, 1971</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the foremost marginality theorists in Latin America was Roger Vekemans, a Belgian sociologist and Jesuit priest. Tied politically to the Christian Democrats, he carried out much of his work at Chile’s Centro para el Desarrollo Económico y Social de América Latina (Center for the Economic and Social Development of Latin America—DESAL). Marginality theory played a fundamental role in consolidating the different schools of thought attempting to think the specificity of urban development in Latin America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0094582X12467763">Lezama, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In the view espoused by DESAL, Latin America became aware of the presence of the marginalized only after its cities had been inundated and it became physically possible to point one’s finger at the swaths of destitution. Marginality entails a lack of participation and social belonging, manifested in Latin America’s characteristic social dichotomy: a participatory society on the one hand, settled and hegemonic, versus a society of marginalized masses on the other. Marginality is relational and negative (a lack); the phrase “lack of participation” implies a negation of the bond that should tie the marginal sphere to mainstream society. Marginality is not only economic but above all cultural, in the sense that it affects every area of social life. This dynamic was seen as coinciding with a physical manifestation, crystallized in a specific social space: the favela (or <italic>población</italic>). It is here that the strongest image of marginality emerges: “The world of the marginalized. . . is internally fractured and fragmented, a world whose ‘agglutinations’ take the form of ghettos, defensively folded in upon themselves and unwilling to confront the social mainstream” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0094582X12467763">Vekemans and Silva, 1976</xref>: 81).</p>
<p>An undeniable aspect of this theory is the cautionary tone it takes when discussing the marginalized: “The marginal masses are standing, metaphorically, outside the shop window, yet they have no purchasing power. . . . Four centuries have passed and, faced with this new reality, we must act to prevent the shop window from being violently shattered” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0094582X12467763">Vekemans and Silva, 1969</xref>: 61). To “prevent the shop window’s destruction,” DESAL proposed the Promoción Popular (Popular Promotion) program, an attempt to integrate the marginalized into society through a process of social restructuring. The idea of promotion can be understood as both <italic>top-down</italic> (capacity building) and <italic>bottom-up</italic> (organizing) because the foundation of the process of social reintegration lay in grassroots organizations (neighborhood associations, mothers’ centers, and so on).</p>
<p>These ideas clearly exerted a profound impact on many intellectuals and on important political projects in the region. In Brazil similar elements had already been present in the scholarship of urban sociology pioneers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0094582X12467763">Carlos Alberto de Medina (1964)</xref>, who viewed the favela as an extension of the countryside in the city, a rural-primitive tumor within the modern metropolis. Although the favela was a blight, it could be cured through good public administration. The problem was that favelados, because they reproduced cultural patterns originating in the countryside, were easily manipulated by demagogues, which hindered the possibility of finding a solution for their situation. According to the first major study of favelas, <italic>Aspectos humanos da favela carioca</italic> (Human Aspects of the Favela of Rio de Janeiro) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0094582X12467763">Rios, 1960</xref>), migration from the country to the city led to the development of a “Caboclo culture” with the psychological traits and behavioral norms of rural life preserved in the favela. Here the cautionary tone is even more pronounced than with DESAL: “We must go up the hill before the communists come down it” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0094582X12467763">Rios, 1960</xref>: 43).</p>
<p>The Catholic Church’s creation (in alliance with Carlos Lacerda, the governor of Rio de Janeiro) of the Fundação Leão XIII and the Cruzada São Sebastião became the practical manifestation of a new conception of favela residents, one geared toward a long-term solution: the human promotion of the favelado. These mechanisms were designed to foster “community participation” and grassroots organizations, essentially to oppose “demagogic exploitation by politicians” and neutralize the communist influence in the favelas.</p>
<p>Does the idea of a threat also carry with it a potential recognition of the political capacity of the marginalized? Can the preventive nature of “going up the hill” to keep the “glass from being shattered” be compared to the social question’s reflective response to the demands of the working class? The idea of the “manipulable masses” found in the work of marginality theorists stands opposed, by definition, to the recognition of subaltern political action. Yet is it possible to warn of society’s potential fracture without acknowledging the possibility of building a political project that would make such a fracture viable?</p>
<p>The notion of “recognition” is somewhat clearer regarding the workers’ movement than with regard to that of the favelados or pobladores. Still, the idea that “we must go up the hill before the communists come down it” is not only a matter of defusing danger but also an acknowledgment of the potential emergence of a “radical” political actor. There is a fear of the amorphous masses, but the greatest fear is of the masses’ becoming a radical oppressed class (the manipulable communist masses, in this view). The fear is that the amorphous masses will become a political actor outside the predefined boundaries that the dominant classes have set for the subaltern classes, boundaries based on the idea of the “good favelado” who “learns” to escape from poverty. Despite political prejudices regarding the urban poor, what we have here is still a (dominant) social group contemplating a scenario that is possible; hence this hypothetical situation (“the communists coming down”) is already having concrete consequences in the real world, and, according to the Thomas theorem, “if men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences” (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0094582X12467763">Merton, 1970</xref>: 515).</p>
<p>Particularly in the case of Brazil, a distinction should be made regarding the preventive nature of state action. The dominant sectors took systematic action to prevent a social avalanche (from coming down the hill) and to neutralize the communist influence in the favelas. Yet if the social question (for workers) shifted from a police matter to a matter of citizenship regulated by the state (for the benefit of a small sector of Brazilian workers) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0094582X12467763">Santos, 1998</xref>), the urban social question in large part remained a police matter. State regulation of citizenship in the favelas was much more contradictory and repressive than in the factories. In other words, if the state’s approach to unions showed both a strong left arm (through labor legislation) and a strong right arm (through control), its approach to the favelas demonstrated an extreme swing to the far right, most visible in the form of forced removals. Even under conditions that were favorable to the favelas, repression was always present in places of poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0094582X12467763">Silva, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, mention should be made, albeit briefly, of the versions of marginality theory that were Marxist in inspiration (economic marginality). In opposition to the version proposed by DESAL and others—including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0094582X12467763">Lewis’s (1961)</xref> “culture of poverty” and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0094582X12467763">Germani’s (1971)</xref> modernization theory—they undertook a materialist reading of marginality that was key to shaping the debate that would develop in Chile with Castells and the Centro Interdisciplinario de Desarrollo Urbano (Interdisciplinary Center for Urban Development—CIDU). The economic reading of marginality would become a source and to a certain extent an integral part of the literature on urban social movements. The debate between Nun and Fernando Henrique Cardoso regarding the idea of the “marginal masses” is a case in point; at issue here was an effort to explain the increase in dysfunctional populations vis-à-vis the dominant system of production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0094582X12467763">Nun, 2001</xref>). In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0094582X12467763">Anibal Quijano (1972)</xref> would develop the category of the “marginal pole” to identify a new social stratum cast off by each sector of the economy and excluded from the most productive sectors because it lacked a production-oriented function. It is not surprising that in the fertile Latin American sociological debate of the late 1960s attempts were made to develop totalizing approaches that integrated a range of categories, including development, underdevelopment, dependency, marginality, and spatial inequalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0094582X12467763">Sunkel, 1970</xref>), approaches that would give Latin America’s urban poor a leading role in the theoretical development of social science research in the region.</p>

<title>An Urban Social Movement or a Utilitarian Movement?</title>

<title>The Urban-Social-Movement School</title>
<p>Influenced by Chile’s climate of social and political ferment in the early 1970s, a group of researchers in Santiago turned its attention to what seemed to be a new and potentially decisive political actor in the midst of the country’s polarization: the poblador. These intellectuals saw the marginalized as an “urban spearhead,” in the words of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0094582X12467763">Fanon (2007)</xref>, that would lead the processes of social transformation at work in the region. Their first task as researchers was to refute the arguments of marginality theory à la DESAL. In a series of empirical studies, they called into question the “lumpen” label that had been applied to those living in popular housing, demonstrating instead the “popular heterogeneity” of poblador communities. They problematized the idea of marginal subculture, affirming instead that the cultural life of low-income neighborhoods could not be separated from the ideological and political ebb and flow of the general processes of class struggle.</p>
<p>They also criticized the interventionist approach to marginality theory taken by DESAL, an approach geared toward justifying the political modus operandi of the Christian Democratic Party. They saw marginality theory as an attempt to conceal the relation of exploitation that was part and parcel of the capitalist system; economic in nature, the causes of marginality were not to be found within the marginalized themselves (as a supposed subculture incapable of organized action). The work of DESAL, in their view, served to legitimize the workings of a paternalistic and populist state, one that expected the marginalized to become electoral clients of its political agenda.</p>
<p>At the same time, their critique also applied to traditional workers’ parties (especially the Communist Party), which consisted primarily of nonmarginal workers. The presence of these parties in low-income communities was limited to a basically economistic approach, tactical in nature: their weak ideological foothold manifested itself in a tendency to focus on the neighborhood council as an institution that could provide a purely electoral advantage.</p>
<p>As the research group most responsible for fostering this approach, CIDU was dedicated to understanding the sociopolitical phenomenon of the newly organized movement being led by activists from several political parties—Christian Democratic, Communist, Socialist, and the Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria (Movement of the Revolutionary Left—MIR), a movement characterized by land occupation and the establishment of scores of <italic>campamentos</italic> (encampments). To the right wing, the campamentos were a lumpen safe house; to the communist left, they were the primary way the masses could push to obtain housing; and to the revolutionary left, they were the first step toward taking power (“take this land, then take power”). Beyond these competing interpretations, CIDU saw the pobladores’ campamentos as a unique experience of political struggle and urban organization. The movement’s originality lay in the explicit relation between land occupation and power. At issue was not only the presence of a variety of popular organizations within the campamentos but also the directly political role played by the act of land occupation itself in the Chilean context of the late 1960s and early 1970s, when the poblador movement took center stage; it was in this context that the varying interventions of the campamentos’ different political actors took shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094582X12467763">CIDU, 1972</xref>).</p>
<p>For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094582X12467763">Castells (1972)</xref>, the poblador movement was defined, in the context of class struggle, by the way it linked urban social demands to a political strategy of mobilization, one whose goals were tied to local governance. This combination gave rise to the development of new forms of political organization. Urban issues in Santiago came to overshadow even the struggle of factory workers during the period preceding the election of 1970 (won by the socialist Salvador Allende); their centrality was a function of the concurrent action of three opposed political strategies competing within the campamentos and poblaciones in an effort to find a way out of the structural crisis of popular housing in Chile. The strategy of the Christian Democrats, inspired by Popular Promotion policies, was viewed by CIDU as merely a populist attempt to draw workers into the party’s potential power base. The workers’ parties, especially the Communist Party, aimed to take the political struggle onto the terrain demarcated by the Christian Democrats. For its part, the revolutionary left, led by the MIR, saw the explosive nature of the occupations as an opportunity to further its strategy of armed struggle and gain a foothold with the poor and working class, whose unions had been dominated by communists and socialists.</p>
<p>The different forays by external actors (political parties) into Santiago’s poblaciones are viewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0094582X12467763">Vanderschueren (1971)</xref> as efforts marked by two extremes: at the one end an attempt to neutralize and control popular pressure (Popular Promotion) and at the other an effort to stimulate popular mobilization to achieve the “real” liberation of the popular sectors. Vanderschueren sides with the latter perspective, the mobilizing approach, understood as a form of “proper practice,” one that sees the socioeconomic system as a source of exploitation.</p>
<p>Other scholars underscore the way in which the mobilization of pobladores, with their urban political demands, led to new forms of “popular power,” lending a new complexion to the Chilean political struggle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0094582X12467763">Quevedo and Sader, 1973</xref>). The pobladores were able to organize to such an extent that they managed, in large part, to make up for the state’s inability to meet popular demands, developing the capacity to propose alternatives to existing institutions. At the same time, they understood that different manifestations of popular power carried different political meanings, and they were aware that if these manifestations were limited to the level of political demands they would lose their capacity for transformation. In short, these experiences demonstrated a qualitatively different approach to confronting the problems and needs of the popular sectors; they represented an original attempt on the part of the dominated to change the nature of the position of subordination in which they found themselves.</p>
<p>The momentum of the pobladores in their struggle was interrupted by the coup d’état that toppled the Allende government and focused much of its repression on the poblaciones, both selectively through the killing or disappearance of their primary leaders and collectively through police raids, blockades, mass detentions, kidnappings, destruction, and theft of personal and household items. Despite the dictatorship’s obstruction of the movement’s continuity, the popular experience that took shape in the poblaciones during the three years of the Allende government seems to have led to the consolidation of a new social actor: “The potential of the poblador movement is key to the development of a political strategy for the revolutionary transformation of the countries of Latin America” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0094582X12467763">Pastrana and Threlfall, 1974</xref>: 153)</p>
<p>And yet it was precisely the coup that called many of CIDU’s premises into question, opening the way to a more skeptical reading of the political potential of the poblador’s world: “In light of the sector’s present state, it is difficult to believe that truly substantial mobilizations have taken place. Expectations of a revival seem to fade before the harsh reality of the present moment. . . . The poblador seems to prefer individual solutions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0094582X12467763">Espinoza, 1982</xref>: 42).</p>

<title>The Utilitarian Perspective</title>
<p>Although Rio de Janeiro was not home to an organized school of thought with the same level of intellectual unity as that of CIDU, there was still an effort to marshal a counterargument against the urban-social-movement school and marginality theory, an effort that for lack of a better description I will call the utilitarian perspective.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0094582X12467763">Perlman (1976)</xref> is among those to deconstruct the different assumptions of marginality theory, calling into question the “constant attempt of those in power to blame the poor for their position” (102). She marshals a considerable amount of empirical evidence to demystify marginality in each of its dimensions: social (internal disorganization and internal isolation), cultural (traditionalism and a culture of poverty), economic (parasitism and parochialism), and political (apathy and radicalism). Because of the leading role played by politics in Perlman’s study, I focus here on the final dimension of her analysis. Contrary to the notion that favelados are politically apathetic, Perlman points to the existence of an internal political system through which they actively participate in local organizations and work to establish external social connections. She also highlights the presence of leaders who have an acute understanding of mainstream political processes that allows them to be selective and concentrate on local concerns to obtain results. Not without a sense of realism, she states that “under the circumstances in 1968–1969, they were not about to assume any dead-end risk or harbor any ideological illusions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0094582X12467763">Perlman, 1976</xref>: 188), in contrast to those who hoped for a popular uprising that would change the course of events following Brazil’s military coup. The conclusion is clear in this regard: favela politics cannot be understood apart from the context of political repression particular to a dictatorial regime, which played out in various ways within the favela.</p>
<p>Another leading critic of marginality theory was Anthony Leeds, whose research on urban Brazil included a definition of politics that would play a crucial role in defining the debate in the Brazilian context. According to Leeds, politics is “any action, interest articulation, or attempt by an actor to maneuver public or private bodies which is aimed at extracting goods and services from a given system by other than standardized exchanges of value, usually by means of money” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0094582X12467763">Leeds and Leeds, 1976</xref>: 194). Politics is understood in this sense as the use of paternalistic and individualistic methods, quid pro quo, to obtain favors and achieve specific goals (political support in exchange for public services, for example) in the absence of action by government officials. Despite being a limited definition of politics, this view compels Leeds to conclude, in contrast to the scholarly consensus of his era, that the relation between a given proletarian population and the external political community was not necessarily one of unilateral exploitation by the latter.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0094582X12467763">Valladares (2005)</xref>, however, offers one of the most fleshed-out responses to the tradition represented by Manuel Castells. Moving beyond descriptions of popular participation as passive or of the relation between favelados and public officials as merely hierarchical, she rejects the notion of an urban social movement as Castells would have it, arguing instead for free-rider theory as an explanatory model. In practice, favelados are ideologically utilitarian, more individual than collective, and able to deploy both formal and informal mechanisms such as the Brazilian <italic>jeitinho</italic> to obtain results. That the efforts of some communities to resist 1970s-era removal plans were unsuccessful demonstrates that “the favelas never came to represent organized hubs of resistance and struggle” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0094582X12467763">Valladares, 1978</xref>: 52).</p>
<p>There are two points to be made in countering this approach. First, it would be fallacious to argue that a movement never existed simply because it did not succeed. Yet here we have, for example, the unsuccessful case of the Federação de Associações de Moradores de Favelas do Estado da Guanabara (Federation of Favela Neighborhood Associations of the State of Guanabara—FAFEG), in its opposition to the government’s removal program, being cited as evidence for denying the existence of organized collective action against forced removal. On the contrary, this example is proof that there were in fact concrete attempts to resist government action on this front. Second, it is worth asking whether the favela could have maintained its place in the urban landscape if it had hewed to a particularistic discourse based on an ethics of individualism and utilitarianism. In the push for “urbanization yes, removal never” is there not a notion—albeit inchoate—of fighting for one’s right to the city, an affirmation that a space that has been won should be allowed to be kept?</p>
<p>In <italic>Movimentos urbanos no Rio de Janeiro</italic> (Urban Movements in Rio de Janeiro), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0094582X12467763">Carlos Nelson Ferreira dos Santos (1981)</xref>, whose interpretation is similar to that of Valladares, also argues against the urban-social-movement approach. His critique reflects his own rich ethnographic perspective, stemming from his experience as an architect for FAFEG during Rio de Janeiro’s favela urbanization process. For Santos the urban-social-movement concept overstates the novelty of this new form of social conflict; it fails to distinguish between capitalism and the city itself, transforming the demands of the urban poor into a reflection of class struggle. It amounts to an external framework whose ideological commitments prevent it from appreciating the particularity of lived experiences of urban struggle. For his part, Santos examines the limits on the action of the urban poor while at the same time acknowledging its transformative potential. In cases where efforts to resist forced removal were successful, the experience did not constitute an ideal prototype for socially oriented urbanization; rather, it represented a regression from a supposed sense of community toward a focus on individual objectives. Those involved came to behave like any other homeowner. Behind any presumed common interest, a decisive set of particular interests was at stake.</p>
<p>From a different perspective, one that cannot be classified as utilitarian, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0094582X12467763">Machado da Silva (1967)</xref> advances one of the most suggestive discussions of favela politics. He contends that the defining political factor in this context is the figure of the “bourgeois favelado,” a figure who monopolizes access to and control over economic and social resources (political contacts). This ability to mediate offers privileged access to external resources in exchange for potential internal support (votes). Accordingly, other favelados, particularly those with the least socioeconomic status, become the “manipulable masses” exploited by the bourgeois favelado vis-à-vis his or her personal connections. Condemned to a position of subordination, albeit internally, and lacking the slightest political consciousness, they are limited to scattered uprisings and reduced to a position of “defensive passivity.”</p>
<p>It is safe to say that there is no single school of thought that evenly incorporates the arguments of those putting forth an alternative to Castells’s interpretation of urban popular participation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0094582X12467763">Lima (1989)</xref>, for example, champions the existence of a favela movement; taking issue with the utilitarian approach, she underscores the continuity of mobilization efforts in the favelas of Rio and their perseverance in the face of intense political repression. For Lima the creation in 1954 of the União de Trabalhadores Favelados (Favela Workers’ Union) indicates a convergence, by its very name, between favela organizers and the labor movement, explicitly identifying favelados as workers (who have no other available housing option). She highlights the robust presence of union leaders in the favela workers’ movement, particularly in textile and construction unions (reflecting the occupational profile of the favelas). Joining them were communist activists, who were engaged in organizing the movement.</p>

<title>Military Dictatorships and The Urban Poor</title>
<p>The authoritarian wave that struck Latin America in the 1960s and led to the establishment of military dictatorships in many countries, including Brazil and Chile, posed a significant challenge to social movements in the region. The break with democracy coincided with the point when the favelado and poblador movements, respectively, had reached full ferment. Regarded by intellectuals on the left as vehicles for expected change, these movements were seen as a possible way to respond to the region’s military dictatorships. Yet when power was seized it was precisely the absence of social mobilization that led <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0094582X12467763">Alain Touraine (1987</xref>: 219) to argue that, “contrary to what was thought to be the case in the 1960s, there were no urban movements of hyperradicalized pobladores; this reserve army of revolution did not in fact mobilize in Brazil in 1964, in Argentina in 1966 or 1976, or in Uruguay or Chile in 1973.” Touraine’s message is directed at Manuel Castells: “As for the urban movement phenomenon, my general opinion is that there never was one, there is not one now, and there will never be one. Of course there are urban struggles, but they do not constitute urban social movements” (218).</p>
<p>Whatever the case, once the military had consolidated its hold on power, one of its first measures was to demobilize civil society through blatant repression. In both Chile and Brazil organizations representing the urban poor were directly targeted and their leaders persecuted.</p>
<p>Because of its pivotal role in Salvador Allende’s Chilean socialism, the poblador movement became a chief target for repressive action during the dictatorship. Organizations representing pobladores were banned and subsequently broken up; their leaders were persecuted and in many cases executed or disappeared; many others went into hiding, often abandoning their neighborhoods. Taken together, these factors led to an almost total dismantling of the movement that had inspired urban-social-movement theory.</p>
<p>The early 1980s, however, saw the beginning of nationwide protests against the regime; once the opposition had emerged from its disarray and begun to coordinate more effectively, it was precisely the poblaciones that became the primary centers of resistance to and disapproval of the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. For some (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0094582X12467763">Pinto, Candina, and Lira, 1999</xref>), these days of protest led to a territorialization of popular and political power; as one of their most salient consequences, they returned the poblador to the foreground.</p>
<p>The dictatorship reacted by broadening the scope of its aggression (which previously had been more selective); because of the instruments of repression developed by the dictatorship and specifically designed to control and suppress popular action, the territory identified with the población became a space of torture and political imprisonment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094582X12467763">Comité de Memoria Histórica, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, the 1980s, after a period of reversal and recovery, were marked by a revival of the poblador movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094582X12467763">Cáceres, 1993</xref>). There was even talk, despite research that emphasized the movement’s continuity via the construction of a shared local culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0094582X12467763">Schneider, 1990</xref>), of a new social actor. For Touraine, the mobilization of Santiago’s urban poor did not possess the elements needed to constitute a social movement. In Chile, Touraine was perhaps the most influential voice on social movements, and his statements had a significant impact on local scholarship. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0094582X12467763">Eugenio Tironi (1986)</xref>, for example, questioned the poblador movement’s ability to create a lasting collective identity, arguing that it was defined not by being social in nature but by the mere presence of activists. The movement’s propensity for discontinuity and its tendency to become visible via sporadic outbursts helped corroborate this understanding, posing a serious interpretive challenge for the social sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0094582X12467763">Espinoza, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>In Brazil the dictatorship was effective in curtailing the movement being organized around FAFEG. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0094582X12467763">Machado da Silva (2002)</xref> points out, “There was a decline in terms of political power and mobilization capacity, beginning with the repression unleashed by the dictatorship at the height of forced removals and in particular with the period marked by the hegemony of <italic>chaguismo</italic>, which succeeded in disrupting and dividing the movement’s leadership and even led to the creation of a parallel federation.” According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0094582X12467763">Eli Diniz (1982)</xref>, chaguismo came to describe a political modus operandi in Rio de Janeiro during the dictatorship, namely, the institutionalization of trading support (primarily votes) for special favors from public officials. In other words, chaguismo represented a political machine that created a centralized system of service provision for different kinds of local electoral clienteles; the low-income urban population, despite its heterogeneity and fragmentation, constituted the core of its electoral base.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1978, with the dictatorship’s transition toward political liberalization, efforts to organize began to make a comeback, particularly in the urban context, and neighborhood associations began to multiply. This placed a strain on the structures of representation controlled by the state government. The creation of a parallel federation as an alternative to the official one was driven by a demand for organizational autonomy. This move signaled a break with chaguismo’s approach to grassroots political organization and reflected a turn toward raising the consciousness of favelados through a focus on civil rights; the use of pressure applied through mobilization became the primary means of interacting with government officials.</p>
<p>It was in this break with chaguismo that the Catholic Church’s Favela Ministry began to play a prominent role in political organizing among Rio de Janeiro’s urban poor, bringing together a number of local leaders and professionals. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0094582X12467763">Eduardo Guimarães de Carvalho (1991)</xref>, the 1960s saw the emergence of several organizations concerned with human rights, nearly all of them tied to the Catholic Church. Once the dictatorship’s intensity began to weaken, these groups, under the Church’s coordination, began to diversify their activities, focusing mostly on land issues. For some groups on the left, the Favela Ministry came to serve as an umbrella organization. The Partido Democrático Trabalhista (Democratic Labor Party—PDT) played an important role in political organizing in the favelas, as did the Partido dos Trabalhadores (Workers’ Party—PT). The latter drew upon what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0094582X12467763">Ana Maria Doimo (1995)</xref> refers to as a significant ethical-political push, a self-described “popular movement” that exerted considerable influence on the Brazilian political process between 1975 and 1990. The main influences behind this new push were the popular pedagogy of Paulo Freire and the liberation theology of figures such as Leonardo Boff and Frei Betto.</p>
<p>This rebirth of popular movements was followed once again by a reversal and decline. Chile’s democratic transition emphasized political stability, betting on the demobilization of the sectors responsible for Pinochet’s departure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0094582X12467763">Lechner and Güel, 2006</xref>). At the same time, a policy emphasis on public housing satisfied in part the movement’s primary grievance, which was precisely the lack of adequate housing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0094582X12467763">Ducci, 1997</xref>). In Brazil, despite the popular movement’s leading role in the country’s democratic transition and despite the ongoing threat of eviction faced by residents of Rio’s favelas, these communities faced a serious impediment to political representation in the consolidated power of heavily armed drug traffickers, both in the physical threat they posed to community leaders and in the actual submission of some to their orders, which “undermined the social base and legitimacy” of their organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0094582X12467763">Leite, 2008</xref>: 119).</p>
<p>The focus of social scientists shifted once again from the popular sphere’s new leading role to a diagnosis of its absence, a veritable postmortem of the movement. Did urban social movements ever truly exist? Were they an illusion or a transient reality? In Chile and Brazil social science interpretations of the poblador and favelado movements were ambivalent, ranging from eulogy to rediscovery to denial.</p>
<p>Regardless of the intellectual vagaries of academe, the social movements led by the urban poor in Chile and Brazil demonstrated a tremendous capacity for reinvention and political and organizational metamorphosis throughout the twentieth century. The nearly constant process of construction and reconstruction that characterized these movements calls for a reevaluation, one that understands them as relevant political actors while avoiding overideologized optimism, uninformed admiration (ignoring the movements’ historical trajectories), or undue pessimism (underestimating their political reach).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0094582X12467763">
<title>Final Considerations</title>
<p>During the twentieth century, both poblador and favelado movements represented a constant interpretive challenge for the social sciences. If on the one hand the social sciences contributed to a recognition of the political importance of urban popular mobilization, on the other hand urban movements themselves constantly broke the analytical molds into which they were forced.</p>
<p>This critical review of the twentieth-century literature on urban movements points to the need for a fresh understanding of the urban poor’s collective action, one that transcends the dichotomy between free riders and the radical marginalized. The different approaches taken by the popular sectors in constructing their urban demands correspond to the possibility of using a particular form of pressure or organization in response to a given set of social circumstances, subject to the unfolding of a particular sociopolitical process (bound to be different in different places, as in Chile and Brazil). Specific grievances, whether born of individual or radical motives, are not essential attributes of the actors seeking to redress them, nor are they the constitutive elements of a given social identity. Rather, they should be seen as variables in a strategic repertoire whose deployment depends on the context, be it favorable or adverse to a given form of collective action. In this process, the urban poor have shown great skill in knowing when to use one form and when to use another.</p>
<p>In sum, the poblador and favelado movements must be rethought in a way that moves beyond the theoretical back-and-forth that has characterized social science approaches to social movements and has reproduced an analytical cycle of eulogy, rediscovery, and denial. The trajectory of these movements cannot be traced without a broad (and at the same time critical) review of the literature that tried to understand them (or confirm their absence); the real task, however, is to move beyond that literature.</p>

<p>The greater precision of the original Spanish and Portuguese terms—<italic>poblador, favelado, población, favela</italic>, and their respective plural forms—has been preferred to the rough equivalence of the translations available in English (squatter, slum dweller, slum, shantytown, ghetto, and so on). In a discussion of the semantic space around the term <italic>favela</italic>, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0094582X12467763">Valladares (2008</xref>: 1) warns that the use of familiar terms such as “slum” can lead to an erasure of the historical specificity of the favela as a social space and end up further “stigmatizing neighborhoods situated at the bottom of the hierarchical system of places that compose the metropolis.”—Translator’s note.</p>
