<abstract>
<p>Intergroup contact is among the most effective ways to improve intergroup attitudes. Research examining whether the effects of contact are contingent on individual differences is limited, however. The authors test a dual process model perspective of individual differences in contact and prejudice. Their model predicts that intergroup contact should be particularly effective for people high in right-wing authoritarianism, but not those high in social dominance orientation, because these ideological attitudes are driven by different underlying motivational goals. The authors confirm these hypotheses in longitudinal (<italic>N</italic> = 805) and cross-sectional (<italic>N</italic> = 1,343) national probability samples. They also isolate perceived social threat, but not competitive threat, as a mediator for the interaction of right-wing authoritarianism and contact on prejudice. The authors elaborate on the individual difference mechanisms that facilitate and inhibit the effects of intergroup contact on prejudice and discuss how these relations may depend on contextual factors and the varying functions of prejudice.</p>

<p>Ever since the influential work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167211429747">Allport (1954)</xref> it has been shown repeatedly that contact between members of different groups improves intergroup attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167211429747">Brown &amp; Hewstone, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0146167211429747">Pettigrew &amp; Tropp, 2006</xref>). However, Allport also stressed that “contact, as a situational variable, cannot always overcome the personal variable in prejudice. This is true whenever the inner strain within the person is too tense, too insistent, to permit him [<italic>sic</italic>] to profit from the structure of the outer situation” (pp. 280-281).</p>
<p>A plethora of studies have shown the overwhelming effect of individual differences on generalized prejudice (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167211429747">Akrami, Ekehammar, &amp; Bergh, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0146167211429747">Altemeyer, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167211429747">Duckitt &amp; Sibley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167211429747">Duckitt, Wagner, du Plessis, &amp; Birum, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167211429747">Heaven &amp; Quintin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0146167211429747">Lippa &amp; Arad, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0146167211429747">Sibley &amp; Duckitt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0146167211429747">Whitley, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0146167211429747">Zick et al., 2008</xref>). In support of Allport’s claim, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0146167211429747">Pettigrew and Tropp (2011)</xref> have recently shown that people high in authoritarianism engage in less intergroup contact than people low in authoritarianism. This finding indicates that certain individual differences might incline people away from intergroup contact and therefore from a subsequent change in intergroup attitudes. Indeed, only in recent years have researchers begun to seriously consider that the effects of contact may differ depending on key individual differences such as authoritarianism or similar social attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167211429747">Dhont &amp; Van Hiel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167211429747">Hodson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167211429747">Hodson, Harry, &amp; Mitchell, 2009</xref>). These studies show that the higher authoritarian attitudes are, the more the participants benefit from intergroup contact experiences. This is a particularly promising and pertinent area of research given that it is people high in authoritarianism and related constructs who should tend to be among the most prejudiced and thus those whom it may be most important to target with antiracism interventions.</p>
<p>Here we propose and test a dual process model (DPM) perspective of individual differences in contact and prejudice that extends previous research on individual differences in intergroup contact within a unified theoretical framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167211429747">Duckitt, 2001</xref>). The DPM proposes that right-wing authoritarianism (RWA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0146167211429747">Altemeyer, 1981</xref>) and social dominance orientation (SDO; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0146167211429747">Pratto, Sidanius, Stallworth, &amp; Malle, 1994</xref>) express different motivational goals and therefore predict prejudice toward differently perceived groups. According to the DPM, RWA predicts prejudice toward groups perceived as socially threatening, whereas SDO should predict prejudice toward groups perceived as competitive or low in social status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0146167211429747">Duckitt, 2006</xref>). We hypothesize that intergroup contact experiences should under optimal conditions reduce prejudice for people high in RWA, but not for people high in SDO. We argue that these different effects arise because of the different motivational goals expressed by RWA and SDO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167211429747">Duckitt, 2001</xref>) and different functions of prejudice associated with these motivations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146167211429747">Kessler &amp; Cohrs, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0146167211429747">Navarrete, McDonald, Molina, &amp; Sidanius, 2010</xref>). We test the effect of intergroup contact on prejudice subject to RWA and SDO over time (Study 1) and the role of social and competitive threats as potential mediators of this effect (Study 2). Our study is thus one of a small handful to model the longitudinal effects of contact in a representative national sample and presents an integrated theory of key individual differences with the contact hypothesis.</p>

<title>Intergroup Contact and Individual Differences</title>
<p>Intergroup contact theory has been shown to be one of the most powerful theoretical approaches for improving outgroup attitudes. In a comprehensive meta-analysis summarizing more than 500 studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0146167211429747">Pettigrew and Tropp (2006)</xref> showed that contact with an outgroup member generalizes to more positive attitudes toward the outgroup as a whole. Even though most studies on intergroup contact report cross-sectional results, a growing body of research has focused on the longitudinal effects of contact (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0146167211429747">Brown, Eller, Leeds, &amp; Stace, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0146167211429747">Christ et al., 2010</xref>; Swart, Hewstone, Christ, &amp; Voci, in press).</p>
<p>Intergroup contact can be differentiated into quantitative and qualitative aspects. Contact quantity, such as contact opportunities or contact frequency in the neighborhood or at the workplace, has been shown to be negatively correlated with prejudice (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0146167211429747">Wagner, Christ, Pettigrew, Stellmacher, &amp; Wolf, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0146167211429747">Wagner, van Dick, Pettigrew, &amp; Christ, 2003</xref>). However, contact quality seems to play an even more important role. In particular, intergroup friendships provide high-quality contact because they meet several key conditions of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167211429747">Allport’s (1954)</xref> contact hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0146167211429747">Pettigrew, 1998</xref>). Numerous studies have underlined the effectiveness of intergroup friendship for prejudice reduction, as recently summarized in a meta-analysis by Davies, Tropp, Aron, Pettigrew, and Wright (in press). Intergroup friendship implies close affective ties with outgroup members, and this has been shown to generalize to the outgroup as a whole, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0146167211429747">Pettigrew and Tropp (2011)</xref> report in a reanalysis of their meta-analytic data. However, intergroup friendships also go beyond contact frequency in the neighborhood or at the workplace. Friendships imply a strong affective tie to the specific outgroup member and require some previously established contact by individuals. This means that certain social barriers have to be overcome to develop friendships with outgroup members. There is ample evidence that once these barriers are overcome, friendship plays a major role in prejudice reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0146167211429747">Davies et al., in press</xref>). To capture the breadth of intergroup contact, various researchers combine indicators for contact quality and quantity as broad measures of intergroup contact across its different aspects (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0146167211429747">Pettigrew, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0146167211429747">Tam et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0146167211429747">Voci &amp; Hewstone, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>There has been surprisingly little research, however, on the influence of individual differences on intergroup contact effects. Recent research has explored RWA and SDO as potential moderators of contact effects and generated some intriguing findings. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167211429747">Duckitt (2001)</xref> RWA represents a threat-driven motivation for collective security and ingroup cohesion. This construct is derived from earlier work on the authoritarian personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0146167211429747">Adorno, Frenkel-Brunswik, Levinson, &amp; Sanford, 1950</xref>). Recent developments in research on authoritarianism indicate that authoritarianism fulfils certain functions for the ingroup. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146167211429747">Kessler and Cohrs (2008)</xref> argue that authoritarianism can be adaptive because adherence to ingroup norms and fending off threats to these norms and the ingroup may benefit the ingroup. RWA expresses a motivation to protect the ingroup against these threats. From such a functionalist perspective, prejudice can be understood partially as an avoidance-oriented response to threat, predicted by RWA.</p>
<p>SDO, in contrast, reflects a competitive-driven motivation for group-based dominance and hierarchy versus egalitarian relations between social groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0146167211429747">Pratto et al., 1994</xref>). It expresses values of power and superiority over other groups. A functional perspective suggests that SDO predicts the strategic use of prejudice to establish social hierarchies and to maintain dominance in intergroup relations. From this point of view SDO is an approach-oriented motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0146167211429747">Navarrete et al., 2010</xref>) that applies prejudice as a means to reach the social goal of hierarchical intergroup relations. RWA and SDO have repeatedly been shown to be strong and complementary predictors of prejudice across numerous domains (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0146167211429747">Altemeyer, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167211429747">Duckitt et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167211429747">Duckitt &amp; Sibley, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167211429747">Hodson (2008)</xref> was the first to provide evidence that intergroup contact effects might be especially strong for people high in SDO. In an interesting and unusual sample of convicts from British prisons, a strongly hierarchical environment, he showed an interaction effect between SDO and positive intergroup contact experiences on ethnic prejudice. High SDO convicts, but not low SDO convicts, showed less prejudice if they experienced positive intergroup contact. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167211429747">Dhont and Van Hiel (2009)</xref> expanded this focus to also include RWA and examine similar contact effects in community samples. In two cross-sectional studies they demonstrated that people high in RWA show less prejudice if they experience positive intergroup contact. For SDO, however, the results were less clear. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167211429747">Dhont and Van Hiel (2009</xref>, Study 2) replicated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167211429747">Hodson’s (2008)</xref> finding in an undergraduate sample but failed to replicate them in a population sample (Study 1). Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167211429747">Hodson et al. (2009)</xref> also provided support for the moderating effect of RWA on the contact–prejudice relation. In a cross-sectional study, they found that the positive relation of RWA with prejudice against homosexuals was weakened by increased contact quantity, higher contact quality, and direct and indirect friendships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0146167211429747">Wright, Aron, McLaughlin-Volpe, &amp; Ropp, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The above studies also revealed possible mediators of these contact effects. As for general intergroup contact effects (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0146167211429747">Pettigrew, Christ, Wagner, &amp; Stellmacher, 2007</xref>), reduced perception of threat mediated the effects for people high RWA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167211429747">Hodson et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, empathy has been shown to be a mediator for SDO in the prison study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167211429747">Hodson, 2008</xref>). These intriguing findings suggest that intergroup contact, especially when it is positive, may be especially effective at reducing the threat perceptions of high RWA persons, hence reducing threat-driven aspects of prejudice. Conversely, there is also some more mixed evidence to suggest that intergroup contact may also decrease the competitive perceptions of high SDO persons, and hence competitive-driven prejudice in some contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167211429747">Dhont &amp; Van Hiel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167211429747">Hodson, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0146167211429747">
<title>The Dual-Process Motivational Model</title>
<p>We argue that RWA and SDO should differentially moderate the effect of contact on intergroup attitudes because they express different motivational goals and therefore serve different functions in intergroup relations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167211429747">Duckitt (2001)</xref> proposed a model of the combined effects of individual differences in RWA and SDO, and situational processes, on prejudice. The Dual Process Model (DPM) conceptualizes RWA and SDO as broad social attitudes rather than personality factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0146167211429747">Sibley &amp; Duckitt, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>According to the DPM, RWA is based on a perception of the world as a dangerous place and expresses the threat-driven motivational goal of maintaining and establishing social order and stability. People high in RWA are especially prejudiced in particular toward groups perceived as disrupting social order, cohesion, stability, and security. This includes not only realistic threats deriving from outgroup violence, high crime rates, economic decline, and so on but also symbolic threats to collective values, norms, traditions, and culture (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0146167211429747">Stephan &amp; Renfro, 2003</xref>). People high in RWA are motivated to instrumentally use prejudice to avoid these social threats and thus (in their eyes) help to protect the ingroup (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146167211429747">Kessler &amp; Cohrs, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>SDO, on the other hand, is based on the perception of the world as a competitive jungle and expresses a competitive-driven motivation for dominance, superiority, and power. People high in SDO are especially prejudiced against groups perceived as socially subordinate and low in status as well as those challenging established social hierarchies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167211429747">Sidanius &amp; Pratto, 1999</xref>). Here prejudice functions as a means to maintain dominance and hierarchical intergroup relations. Prejudice is directed toward groups that threaten these hierarchies or that are at the lower end of the hierarchy. In both cases, prejudice fulfils the function of social control over intergroup relations (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0146167211429747">Navarrete et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Even though the DPM is not explicitly formulated as a functionalist model, it indicates that RWA and SDO represent different motivations that functionally predict prejudice for different reasons: either to avoid social threats to the ingroup or to approach and combat competitive threat to the established hierarchy. Recent research supports the causal effects of RWA and SDO on forms of prejudice predicted from the DPM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167211429747">Asbrock, Sibley, &amp; Duckitt, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0146167211429747">Cohrs &amp; Asbrock, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0146167211429747">Dru, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0146167211429747">Duckitt &amp; Sibley, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167211429747">Duckitt and Sibley (2007)</xref>, for example, differentiated three generalized prejudice factors and found that RWA, but not SDO, predicted prejudice toward dangerous (threatening) groups, SDO, but not RWA, predicted prejudice toward derogated (low-status) groups, and RWA and SDO jointly predicted prejudice toward dissident (threatening <italic>and</italic> competing) groups. In a recent study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0146167211429747">Thomsen, Green, and Sidanius (2008)</xref> offered an excellent example of the differentiated effects of RWA and SDO. In two experimental studies they showed that RWA predicted persecution of immigrants when they refused to assimilate into the dominant culture (i.e., social threat), whereas SDO predicted persecution of immigrants when they were willing to assimilate and thus possibly cross the status boundary (i.e., competitive threat to social hierarchies).</p>
<p>This view of RWA and SDO as different underlying motivations for the functional application of prejudice allows for a new perspective on the moderating effects of individual differences on the relationship between contact and prejudice, which we will outline below. In addition, we identify three aspects of previous research on SDO, RWA, and contact that require clarification. First and foremost, previous studies have not analyzed RWA and SDO simultaneously, that is, they did not control for the respective other attitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167211429747">Dhont &amp; Van Hiel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167211429747">Hodson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167211429747">Hodson et al., 2009</xref>). This is important because RWA and SDO are typically moderately correlated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167211429747">Duckitt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167211429747">Duckitt et al., 2002</xref>). Analyses that control for the shared variance by taking RWA and SDO simultaneously into account indicate diverging predictions for specific kinds of prejudice (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0146167211429747">Cohrs &amp; Asbrock, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0146167211429747">Dru, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0146167211429747">Duckitt &amp; Sibley, 2010</xref>). Second, the three prior studies examining the effects of SDO and RWA on contact rely exclusively on cross-sectional data. The contact literature provides ample evidence that intergroup contact affects prejudice over time (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0146167211429747">Brown et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0146167211429747">Christ et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0146167211429747">Swart et al., in press</xref>), but there is no empirical evidence thus far that the differential effects for people low versus high in RWA and SDO occur longitudinally. Third, previous research has focused mostly on small and fairly homogeneous samples (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167211429747">Dhont &amp; Van Hiel, 2009</xref>). We present two studies that extend previous research in this area and address these three issues by modeling the simultaneous effects of SDO and RWA in cross-sectional and longitudinal national probability samples.</p>

<title>The Present Research</title>
<p>In the present research we apply the DPM as a theoretical framework for the analysis of individual differences on the relation of intergroup contact with prejudice. The DPM generates specific predictions about differentiated effects for RWA and SDO, which complement previous contact research. Moreover, and in line with recent research, it also underlines the perspective that prejudice can serve different functions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146167211429747">Kessler &amp; Cohrs, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0146167211429747">Navarrete et al., 2010</xref>). Although the empirical results concerning moderation by RWA seem reasonably clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167211429747">Dhont &amp; Van Hiel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167211429747">Hodson et al., 2009</xref>), the results for SDO are more ambiguous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167211429747">Dhont &amp; Van Hiel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167211429747">Hodson, 2008</xref>). We argue that this ambiguity is in part subject to the lack of simultaneous analyses of RWA and SDO, which has resulted in less pure estimates of the competitive-driven motivation that we argue is at the heart of the SDO construct.</p>
<p>In contrast to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167211429747">Hodson (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167211429747">Dhont and Van Hiel (2009)</xref>, we do not expect a decrease in prejudice after contact experiences for people high in SDO. From a DPM perspective, SDO is based on a motivation to maintain and enhance social hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167211429747">Duckitt, 2001</xref>). Moreover, social dominance theory (SDT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167211429747">Sidanius &amp; Pratto, 1999</xref>) states that SDO should reflect a competitive-driven motivation to enforce social hierarchy and group dominance, wherein prejudice itself is a mechanism that is used strategically to enforce hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0146167211429747">Navarrete et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167211429747">Sidanius &amp; Pratto, 1999</xref>). This competitive-driven form of prejudice should not necessarily be reduced for those particularly high in SDO, even when experiencing positive intergroup contact. Rather, those high in SDO should be the most resistant to change in their levels of prejudice because they make strategic use of ideologies that most effectively legitimate domination and subjugation in a given context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167211429747">Sidanius &amp; Pratto, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, prejudice is unlikely to be reduced by intergroup contact for people high in SDO because they are motivated to maintain and enhance hierarchies between groups. In this case prejudice functions to serve this goal, and consequently positive affect should not generalize from a contacted outgroup member to the whole outgroup. This is because positive contact experiences are unlikely to change the willingness to engage in hierarchical intergroup relations. Consequently, we predict that SDO will <italic>not</italic> interact with intergroup contact experiences in a way that the prejudice-reducing effect of contact is especially strong for people high in SDO (Hypothesis 1).</p>
<p>On the other hand, we hypothesize that people high in RWA should show less prejudice when they experience intergroup contact (Hypothesis 2). According to the DPM, RWA is based on the motivation to maintain and establish security and social order, which includes the preservation of traditions and cultural values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167211429747">Duckitt, 2001</xref>). For people high in RWA, prejudice serves the function of protecting the ingroup from social threats. Consequently, RWA predicts prejudice against groups perceived as a threat to these cultural values and to security (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0146167211429747">Cohrs &amp; Asbrock, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0146167211429747">Duckitt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167211429747">Duckitt &amp; Sibley, 2007</xref>). In line with these predictions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167211429747">Hodson et al. (2009)</xref> showed that contact reduced perceptions of homosexuals as a value threat for those high in RWA. In line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167211429747">Hodson et al. (2009)</xref>, we argue that intergroup contact is especially effective for people high in RWA because it reduces the perception of the outgroup as socially threatening and therefore prejudice. Contact experiences with an outgroup member generalize to more positive attitudes toward the outgroup as a whole because contact reduces perceived social threat.</p>
<p>Refining previous research, we compare two kinds of threat as possible mediators of intergroup contact effects on prejudice. According to the DPM, the effect of RWA on prejudice is mediated by perceived social threat, but not by competitive threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0146167211429747">Duckitt, 2006</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesize that social threat, but not competitive threat, will mediate the interaction effect of RWA and contact on prejudice (Hypothesis 3). In line with Hypothesis 1, we do not expect a mediation effect by competitive threat for the interaction of SDO and contact. We also extend previous studies in two additional ways. First, we test our first and second hypotheses using a longitudinal design. To our knowledge, this provides the first empirical test of the hypothesized effect of the interaction of individual differences and intergroup contact on prejudice over time. Second, we base our analyses on data from representative population samples collected in Germany. In contrast to previous research, given the costly nature of collecting longitudinal and national samples, we do, however, rely on short-form measures of all constructs. It is worth noting that we employ a measure for intergroup contact that includes indicators for contact quantity and intergroup friendship. This measure provides a stringent test of our hypotheses because previous research has shown that especially high- quality contact can improve intergroup relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0146167211429747">Davies et al., in press</xref>). If we find that even such high-quality contact does not improve intergroup attitudes for people high in SDO, this would further strengthen support for our differentiation of RWA- and SDO-related motivational goals.</p>
<p>In Study 1 we analyze longitudinal data to test the expected effect of intergroup contact on prejudice for people high in SDO and RWA (Hypotheses 1 and 2). We extend this analysis in Study 2 using nationally representative cross-sectional German data to model perceptions of social and competitive threat as possible mediators of contact effects (Hypothesis 3).</p>

<p>Data for this study were collected as Waves 1 and 2 of a multiwave panel study representative of the German adult population (16 years and older) with no migration background (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0146167211429747">Zick et al., 2008</xref>, for further details). A total of 805 participants (399 male, 406 female), with a mean age of 47.08 (<italic>SD</italic> = 15.91), were interviewed using computer-assisted telephone interviews in both waves in 2002 (Time 1) and 2003 (Time 2). Systematic panel mortality was negligible (for further details, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0146167211429747">Christ, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0146167211429747">Zick et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p><italic>Intergroup contact</italic> at Time 1 and Time 2 was measured by three items (“How often do you have any personal contact with foreigners living in your neighbourhood?” “How often do you have personal contact with foreigners at your workplace?” “How many of your friends and close acquaintances are foreigners?”). These measures represent quantitative and qualitative aspects of intergroup contact (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167211429747">Hodson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0146167211429747">Tam et al., 2007</xref>) and have been shown to be reliable indicators for intergroup contact experiences (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0146167211429747">Wagner et al., 2003</xref>). The items were answered on 4-point rating scales from 1 (<italic>none</italic>) to 4 (<italic>very often/very many</italic>) and were averaged to create a scale for intergroup contact (Cronbach’s α = .54).</p>
<p><italic>RWA</italic> at Time 1 was measured by two items indexing authoritarian aggression (“To preserve law and order, outsiders and troublemakers should be pursued more rigorously” and “Crimes should be punished more severely”) adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0146167211429747">Altemeyer (1981)</xref>. Authoritarian aggression has been shown to be the key component of the RWA scale that predicts prejudice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167211429747">Altemeyer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0146167211429747">Manganelli Rattazzi, Bobbio, &amp; Canova, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0146167211429747">Mavor, Macleod, Boal, &amp; Louis, 2009</xref>), and items from this subscale have therefore been recommended as the first choice when researchers have to restrict their number of items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0146167211429747">Mavor, Louis, &amp; Laythe, 2011</xref>). The two items correlated at <italic>r</italic> = .61 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). These and the following items were answered on 4-point rating scales from 1 (<italic>fully disagree</italic>) to 4 (<italic>fully agree</italic>).</p>
<p><italic>SDO</italic> at Time 1 was measured by three items (“Those groups with a low status in our society should keep their low status,” “There are groups in the population who are less worthy than others,” “Some groups in the population are more useful than others”) adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0146167211429747">Pratto et al. (1994)</xref>. The scale for SDO had an internal consistency of α = .57. This scale has been shown to be a reliable indicator for SDO in previous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0146167211429747">Wagner, Christ, &amp; Pettigrew, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0146167211429747">Zick et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Prejudice toward immigrants</italic> was measured by two items (“If jobs become scarce, foreigners should be sent back to their home countries,” “There are too many foreigners in Germany”) at Time 1 (<italic>r</italic> = .61, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and Time 2 (<italic>r</italic> = .66, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). These two items focus on cultural and material aspects of anti-immigrant prejudice, which are core elements of ethnic prejudice in the German and European contexts (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0146167211429747">Heitmeyer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0146167211429747">Wagner, van Dick, &amp; Zick, 2001</xref>). This blatant form of prejudice is based on the perception of zero-sum competition and an “antiquated” immigrant culture (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0146167211429747">Pettigrew &amp; Meertens, 1995</xref>).

<title>Cross-sectional analyses</title>
<p>To test Hypotheses 1 and 2 we conducted a hierarchical moderated regression analysis, with prejudice against immigrants as the dependent variable and mean-centered predictor variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0146167211429747">Aiken &amp; West, 1991</xref>). First we tested our hypotheses within the Time 1 data set with prejudice at Time 1 as the depended variable, controlling for participants’ age and gender.</p>
<p>In the first step we entered intergroup contact, RWA, and SDO as predictors as well as gender and age as control variables. As expected, the predictors were significantly associated with prejudice at Time 1, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .34, <italic>F</italic>(5, 798) = 81.36, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Intergroup contact had a negative association with prejudice (<italic>b</italic> = −0.19, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.04, β = −.17, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), whereas RWA and SDO had positive associations (<italic>b</italic> = 0.37, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.04, β = .32, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; and <italic>b</italic> = 0.47, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.05, β = .31, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).

<p>A simple slope analysis for RWA (controlling for SDO, gender, and age) indicated that intergroup contact was negatively related to prejudice at Time 1 for those high in RWA (+1 <italic>SD; b</italic> = −0.29, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.05, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) but not for those low in RWA (−1 <italic>SD; b</italic> = −0.07, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.06, <italic>p</italic> = .22).

<title>Longitudinal analyses</title>
<p>Extending these cross-sectional analyses, we conducted longitudinal data analysis with prejudice toward immigrants at Time 2 as the dependent variable to test if the effects were stable over time. We entered prejudice at Time 1 in the first step and found a significant effect for the autoregression on prejudice at Time 2 (<italic>b</italic> = 0.75, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.02, β = .75, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .56, <italic>F</italic>(1, 803) = 1032.86, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. This represents the stability of prejudice across the two waves.</p>
<p>At Step 2 we entered intergroup contact, RWA, and SDO as predictors, which significantly improved the regression model, Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .03, <italic>F</italic>(3, 800) = 18.68, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Intergroup contact at Time 1 predicted reduced prejudice at Time 2 (<italic>b</italic> = −0.09, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.03, β = −.08, <italic>p</italic> = .002). RWA and SDO simultaneously predicted increased prejudice (<italic>b</italic> = 0.17, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.03, β = .15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; and <italic>b</italic> = 0.07, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.04, β = .05, <italic>p</italic> = .07, respectively). Note that the first-order effect for SDO was only marginally significant. In the third step we entered the interaction terms for intergroup contact with RWA and SDO. This produced a marginally significant improvement of the regression model, Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .003, <italic>F</italic>(2, 798) = 2.82, <italic>p</italic> = .06. As hypothesized, we replicated the findings from the cross-sectional Time 1 data. The RWA × contact interaction had a negative effect on prejudice at Time 2 (<italic>b</italic> = −0.08, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.04, β = −.05, <italic>p</italic> = .04), whereas the interaction of SDO and contact had a marginally significant positive effect (<italic>b</italic> = 0.09, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.05, β = .04, <italic>p</italic> = .07). The right column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0146167211429747">Table 2</xref> shows all first-order and interaction effects in the final model.</p>
<p>The simple slope analysis for RWA (controlling for SDO and prejudice at Time 1) shows that intergroup contact at Time 1 was negatively related to prejudice at Time 2 only for those high in RWA (+1 <italic>SD; b</italic> = −0.14, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.04, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), but not for those low in RWA (–1 <italic>SD; b</italic> = −0.02, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.04, <italic>p</italic> = .72; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0146167211429747">Figure 1a</xref>). We conducted a simple slope analysis (controlling for RWA and prejudice at Time 1) to explore the marginally significant the SDO × contact interaction. Replicating the findings from Time 1 data, intergroup contact at Time 1 was negatively related to prejudice at Time 2 for those low in SDO (–1 <italic>SD; b</italic> = −0.13, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.04, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) but not for those high in SDO (+1 <italic>SD; b</italic> = −0.03, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.04, <italic>p</italic> = .54; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0146167211429747">Figure 1b</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Study 1 supported our hypotheses about the differentiated effects of intergroup contact on prejudice for people high in RWA and SDO using a longitudinal design. First, consistent with the basic tenets of both SDT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167211429747">Sidanius &amp; Pratto, 1999</xref>) and the DPM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167211429747">Duckitt, 2001</xref>), RWA significantly and SDO marginally significantly predicted independent increases in prejudice over time.</p>
<p>Contrary to previous research, but in line with our predictions, we did not detect a stronger improvement of intergroup attitudes by intergroup contact for people high in SDO. On the contrary, we found effects in the opposite direction. Intergroup contact was not associated with prejudice toward immigrants for people high in SDO <italic>but rather for people low in SDO</italic>. As expected, people high in SDO did not deviate from their hierarchy-enhancing motivation after they experienced contact with immigrants. This implies that they continue to employ prejudice as a hierarchy-legitimizing myth in the face of intergroup contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167211429747">Sidanius &amp; Pratto, 1999</xref>). This indicates that people high in SDO not only avoid intergroup contact per se (as can be seen by the negative correlation between SDO and contact at Time 1 of <italic>r</italic> = −.16) but also do not benefit from contact experiences that they do encounter, even if they befriend outgroup members.</p>
<p>For people high in RWA, on the other hand, intergroup contact was associated with reduced prejudice. This is in line with our second hypothesis as well as previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167211429747">Dhont &amp; Van Hiel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167211429747">Hodson et al., 2009</xref>). Our longitudinal results show that this effect is stable over time. To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal test of the moderation effect of RWA on intergroup contact. Unlike most previous research in this field, our study, as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167211429747">Dhont and Van Hiel (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167211429747">Hodson (2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167211429747">Hodson et al., 2009</xref>), took individual difference variables into account and showed that intergroup contact effects systematically varied because of these differences.</p>

<title>Study 2</title>
<p>Study 2 replicated and extended the findings from Study 1. Given small effect sizes of our findings and seeming inconsistencies between our results in Study 1 and previous cross-sectional research on the effects of SDO and contact, we replicated the effect in an independent national probability sample. Moreover, Study 2 focused specifically on the mechanism driving the differential contact effect for those low versus high in RWA. According to the DPM, people high in RWA show prejudice toward groups they perceive as a threat to their ingroup’s values and security. On the other hand, people high in SDO express prejudice toward groups they perceive as competitive for scarce resources as well as those low in status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0146167211429747">Duckitt &amp; Sibley, 2009</xref>). Consequently, we expected the effect of intergroup contact on prejudice reduction for people high in RWA to be mediated by corresponding reductions in perceived social threat but not perceived competitive threat.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section15-0146167211429747">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Data for this study were obtained from a national probability survey of the German adult (16 years of age and older) population without migration background. A total of <italic>N</italic> = 2,656 respondents were interviewed using computer-assisted telephone interviews in 2004. Half of the respondents, selected at random, were asked about their contact with foreigners. All analyses are based on this random split of the total sample (<italic>N</italic> = 1,343) including 594 men and 749 women, with a mean age of 45.46 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 15.75). This cross-sectional sample was independent of the sample in Study 1 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0146167211429747">Zick et al., 2008</xref>, for further details).</p>

<p>Intergroup contact (α = .57), RWA (<italic>r</italic> = .63, p &lt; .001), SDO (α = .62), and prejudice toward immigrants (<italic>r</italic> = .63, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) were measured using items identical to those in Study 1. In addition, social threat was measured by the item “Foreigners living here pose a threat to our liberties and rights,” and competitive threat was measured by the item “Foreigners living here pose a threat to our economic wealth.” Both measures were answered on rating scales from 1 (<italic>fully disagree</italic>) to 4 (<italic>fully agree</italic>).</p>

<p>In the first step we tested the hypothesized effects of intergroup contact on prejudice moderated by RWA and SDO without mediating variables. We simultaneously entered the predictor variables (intergroup contact, RWA, SDO, and their interactions) and prejudice as the dependent variable into the model. This analysis replicated Study 1. As in Study 1, we also controlled for participants’ age and gender. These demographic variables did not affect prejudice (<italic>b</italic> = −0.01, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.01, β = −.01, <italic>p</italic> = .59 and <italic>b</italic> = 0.07, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.04, β = .04, <italic>p</italic> = .07, respectively).</p>
<p>Contact had a negative association with prejudice (<italic>b</italic> = −0.20, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.03, β = −.15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), but RWA (<italic>b</italic> = 0.49, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.03, β = .42, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and SDO (<italic>b</italic> = 0.39, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.04, β = .25, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) had positive associations with prejudice. Replicating Study 1, the interaction of RWA and contact on prejudice showed a negative effect (<italic>b</italic> = −0.10, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.05, β = −.05, <italic>p</italic> = .02). The interaction of SDO and contact showed the expected positive effect on prejudice (<italic>b</italic> = 0.13, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.06, β = .04, <italic>p</italic> = .04). To illustrate the interaction of RWA and contact, we conducted simple slope analyses (controlling for SDO, age, and gender) indicating that contact reduced prejudice for people low in RWA (–1 <italic>SD; b</italic> = −0.12, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.04, <italic>t</italic> = −2.90, <italic>p</italic> = .004), but the effect was stronger for people high in RWA (+1 <italic>SD; b</italic> = −0.28, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.05, <italic>t</italic> = −5.60, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The simple slope analysis for the SDO by contact interaction showed that contact also had a negative effect on prejudice for people high in SDO (+1 <italic>SD; b</italic> = −0.13, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.05, <italic>t</italic> = −2.79, <italic>p</italic> = .005), but a stronger negative effect for people low in SDO (–1 <italic>SD; b</italic> = −0.27, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.04, <italic>t</italic> = −6.53, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). This also replicates our findings from Study 1 because contact again showed to be less effective for people high in SDO.</p>
<p>In the second step we included the potential mediator variables to test the expected mediated moderation effect. This model included paths from the predictor variables (intergroup contact, RWA, SDO, and their interactions) to social and competitive threat as well as prejudice. There were also paths from both kinds of threat to prejudice as well as a correlation between social and competitive threat (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0146167211429747">Figure 2</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0146167211429747">1</xref></sup> The standardized and unstandardized regression coefficients for all direct effects are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0146167211429747">Table 4</xref>. The effect of the RWA × contact interaction on prejudice was non-significant (<italic>b</italic> = −0.07, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.04, β = −.04, <italic>p</italic> = .08). However, as expected, there was a significant negative effect on social threat (<italic>b</italic> = −0.09, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.04, β = .05, <italic>p</italic> = .046), but not on competitive threat (<italic>b</italic> = −0.05, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.05, β = −.03, <italic>p</italic> = .30). The interaction of SDO and contact did not significantly affect prejudice (<italic>b</italic> = 0.08, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.05, β = .03, <italic>p</italic> = .11) or social (<italic>b</italic> = 0.01, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.06, β = .01, <italic>p</italic> = .87) or competitive threat (<italic>b</italic> = 0.11, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.06, β = .05, <italic>p</italic> = .07).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Study 2 replicated the findings of Study 1 and provided further support for our first two hypotheses. In addition, we showed that social threat mediated the RWA × contact interaction effect on prejudice. This indicates that people high in RWA showed reduced prejudice in arguably positive contact conditions (when experiencing contact with outgroup friends) because they tended to perceive immigrants as less socially threatening. As expected, there was no mediation effect via perceived competitive threat or for the SDO × contact interaction. People high in SDO do not change their perception of outgroups as competitive after similar contact experiences. To our knowledge, this study is the first to differentiate the role of these two kinds of threat as proposed by the DPM for the prejudice-reducing function of intergroup contact.</p>

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>The present study showed that intergroup contact had different effects on intergroup attitudes depending on individual differences in SDO and RWA. We applied a DPM perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167211429747">Duckitt, 2001</xref>) and demonstrated in two independent representative German population samples that intergroup contact was negatively associated with prejudice over a 1-year period for people high in RWA, but not for people high in SDO (Study 1).</p>
<p>Moreover, and consistent with predictions derived from the DPM, the synergistic effect of contact and RWA was fully mediated by the reduction in social threat experienced by those high in RWA who experienced intergroup contact (Study 2). This indicates that people high in RWA, even though they tend to avoid intergroup contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0146167211429747">Pettigrew &amp; Tropp, 2011</xref>), benefit from intergroup encounters. They perceive the world as a dangerous and threatening place, which motivates them to maintain security and social order. This motivation likely drives them away from outgroup members, such as immigrants, but <italic>if</italic> they experience arguably positive contact (with friends), perceived social threat decreases and their attitudes toward the outgroup as a whole improve. This indicates that the transfer from positive attitudes toward an outgroup member to the outgroup as a whole takes place via the reduction of perceived social threat. This is also in line with a functionalist perspective of authoritarianism (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146167211429747">Kessler &amp; Cohrs, 2008</xref>). Prejudice is expressed to protect the ingroup from outgroup threats, but if these threats disappear, prejudice is also attenuated.</p>
<p>Our theoretical reasoning also allowed us to disentangle previous ambiguous results about the moderating role of SDO for intergroup contact effects. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167211429747">Hodson (2008)</xref> found a significant reduction in concurrent levels of prejudice for people high in SDO, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167211429747">Dhont and Van Hiel (2009)</xref> found supporting empirical evidence in only one of their two studies. Our own results, however, paint a rather different picture. As predicted by the DPM and SDT, we showed that intergroup contact effects on prejudice are <italic>not</italic> especially effective for people high in SDO. On the contrary, we found that people low in SDO benefit more from contact experiences that those high in SDO. According to the DPM, SDO manifests as a competitive threat-driven motivation to maintain and enhance social hierarchy. This is also in line with a functional perspective of social dominance and prejudice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0146167211429747">Navarrete et al., 2010</xref>). Social dominators are motivated to use prejudice in a functionalist way to reach their social goal of dominance and subjugation over outgroups. Positive contact experiences, even friendship with an outgroup member, did not seem to affect the perception of the outgroup as a whole as a competitive threat and therefore the approach-oriented function of prejudice as a means to maintain hierarchy. SDO thus seems to provide an excellent example for an individual difference variable that makes people particularly resilient to the positive effects of intergroup contact. We argue that the results found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167211429747">Hodson (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167211429747">Dhont and Van Hiel (2009</xref>; Study 2) may be the result of the fact that they did not simultaneously test for the joint effects of RWA and SDO, even though both concepts share a substantial amount of variance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167211429747">Duckitt, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, the DPM also suggests another possible reason for why results from research suggesting that SDO moderates contact effects might have varied. It is possible that there might be specific context-of-contact effects that might in those specific situations alter the way in which SDO (and possibly also RWA) might moderate contact effects. For example, although high SDOs might not generally respond to positive contact by reducing prejudice, there may be certain contexts in which they do. Such a context might be one in which intergroup power differentials were highly salient and important and the outgroup, or their members, might seem higher in power or equal in power to ingroup members. This might explain why <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167211429747">Hodson’s (2008)</xref> study of White prison inmates’ attitudes toward Black inmates showed improved attitudes for high SDO Whites but little effect for low SDO Whites.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167211429747">Dhont and Van Hiel’s (2009)</xref> study also suggested that specific context effects can operate to influence the way RWA and SDO moderate contact effects. In their research, high RWAs and SDOs showed greater positive attitude change with positive outgroup contact but more negative attitude change with negative contact experiences. The studies by both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167211429747">Hodson (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167211429747">Dhont and Van Hiel (2009)</xref> were correlational and so could not indicate the direction of causality, but they do suggest that specific context effects might well alter the way in which persons varying in RWA and SDO might generally respond to positive intergroup contact as measured in this particular study and so account for some of the inconsistencies in findings. Clearly this possibility still needs systematic empirical investigation.</p>
<p>Some readers may be wondering if perhaps our findings for RWA are the result of a floor effect, that is, people low in RWA are already low in prejudice, so that contact experiences cannot reduce prejudice any further. However, our SDO findings contradict this assumption because here we find a prejudice reduction for people <italic>low</italic> in SDO, that is, people who are also low in prejudice to begin with. Consequently, our studies support the hypothesis that people high in RWA really benefit from positive contact experiences that approach arguably optimal conditions (i.e., contact with friends, where the hard work in establishing repeated contact has been established).</p>
<p>Our findings leave us optimistic on one hand but pessimistic on the other. It seems that intergroup contact, even though generally helpful for improving intergroup relations, does not help everybody equally. This is in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167211429747">Allport’s (1954)</xref> claim that “contact, as a situational variable, cannot always overcome the personal variable in prejudice” (p. 280). SDO prevents engagement in intergroup contact as well as shielding one from an improvement of outgroup attitudes after contact experiences. However, even though the results for SDO leave room for pessimism, research indicates that SDO can vary during socialization (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167211429747">Duckitt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0146167211429747">Guimond, Dambrun, Michinov, &amp; Duarte, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0146167211429747">Van Laar, Levin, Sinclair, &amp; Sidanius, 2005</xref>). This indicates that socialization to lower social dominance might be a more effective strategy for the reduction of prejudice.</p>
<p>The results for RWA, on the other hand, leave us much more optimistic: People high in RWA actually benefit from intergroup contact. In concert with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167211429747">Dhont and Van Hiel (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167211429747">Hodson (2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167211429747">Hodson et al., 2009</xref>), our research indicates that the effects for RWA are stable over various samples. Moreover, we isolated social threat as a mediator for the improvement of intergroup attitudes for people high in RWA. In sum, our theoretical framing allows for predictions regarding <italic>why</italic> RWA and SDO interact with intergroup contact in different directions and also <italic>how</italic> these effects operate. This contributes to recent developments in intergroup contact theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0146167211429747">Pettigrew &amp; Tropp, 2011</xref>), especially to those focusing on the processes underlying contact effects (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167211429747">Hodson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0146167211429747">Pettigrew et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0146167211429747">Turner, Hewstone, &amp; Voci, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0146167211429747">Vonofakou, Hewstone, &amp; Voci, 2007</xref>). A more detailed analysis of the specific effects of individual differences on the transfer effects of intergroup contact would provide an interesting avenue for future research.</p>
<p>The question nevertheless remains, how do we get people high in RWA to engage in positive contact with friends in the first place? Our results show that contact opportunities and high-quality contact (i.e., intergroup friendships) improve outgroup attitudes for people high in RWA, even though they tend to avoid contact overall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0146167211429747">Pettigrew &amp; Tropp, 2011</xref>). But how can this social barrier be overcome, so that high RWAs can develop friendships with outgroup members? One promising approach might be imagined contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0146167211429747">Crisp, Husnu, Meleady, Stathi, &amp; Turner, 2010</xref>). It has been shown that mental representations of a positive encounter with an outgroup member can reduce prejudice and enhance future contact intentions. Initial empirical evidence indicates that imagined contact is especially effective for people high in RWA. Compared to a control group, they were more willing to engage in future contact with an outgroup after imagining a positive encounter with an outgroup member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0146167211429747">Asbrock, Gutenbrunner, &amp; Wagner, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Limitations and Directions for Future Research</title>
<p>Testing our hypotheses in two independent nationally representative samples strengthens the external validity of our cross-sectional and longitudinal findings. However, our research is not without its caveats. First of all, the hypothesized interaction effects are very small. One reason for our small effects might be our measures. A common problem in survey research is the very limited number of items, which results in less reliable measures. This is especially problematic with single-item measures, as for social and competitive threat in Study 2. In addition, our measures of RWA and prejudice are narrow. However, the authoritarian aggression subdimension has been shown to be the best predictor for prejudice and should therefore be used if researchers have to restrict their number of items in a survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0146167211429747">Mavor et al., 2011</xref>). Our prejudice measure also focused on threat-related prejudice toward immigrants, but these have been shown to be a fundamental core element in the German national discourse about the perception of immigrants (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0146167211429747">Heitmeyer, 2002</xref>). It is thus possible that the small number of items and the low reliability of some of our measures affected our findings and led to the small effect sizes for the interaction effects. start new paragraph here. On the other hand, however, we found support for our hypotheses in a national probability sample, which was in line with the theoretical models of the DPM and SDT and, concerning the RWA-related findings, with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167211429747">Dhont &amp; Van Hiel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167211429747">Hodson et al., 2009</xref>). A second limitation is related to our contact measure. The combination of indicators for contact quantity and quality provides a strong test of our hypotheses. Developing intergroup friendships requires that certain social barriers be overcome initially, however. Therefore, high-quality contact, such as intergroup friendship, describes a different level of contact than mere contact opportunities. If these barriers are overcome, people high in RWA indicate more positive attitudes toward an outgroup. This remains a positive finding, and one that extends our understanding of the person dynamic in contact. On the other hand, even friendship does not seem to reduce prejudice for people high in SDO. This provides strong support for our hypothesis that SDO keeps people from benefiting from positive contact experiences. Connected to our previous point, however, future research is needed to examine intergroup contact quality and quantity more deeply.</p>
<p>Another limitation of the present studies is that we could not test our mediation hypothesis in a longitudinal design (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0146167211429747">Little, Preacher, Selig, &amp; Card, 2007</xref>). Unfortunately, the longitudinal study did not include any measures of social and competitive threat. However, we were able to show a general attitudinal improvement in the longitudinal study. In addition, other studies also found social or value threat to be a valid mediator for contact effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0146167211429747">Pettigrew et al., 2007</xref>), even for people high in RWA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167211429747">Hodson et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Study 1 is the first test of the proposed moderation effects by RWA and SDO over time. This does not allow for causal interpretation of our data. The data are still correlational, and the effects might be driven by a third variable. A growing body of research tests contact effects longitudinally (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0146167211429747">Brown et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0146167211429747">Christ et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0146167211429747">Swart et al., in press</xref>), which constitutes a major step from the cross-sectional designs mostly used in contact research. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0146167211429747">Pettigrew and Tropp’s (2006)</xref> meta-analysis, only 5% of their 515 studies were experimental. If we want to be sure about a causal effect of contact on prejudice, we need more experimental studies.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We found supportive as well as contradictory results for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167211429747">Allport’s (1954)</xref> claim that certain personality factors prevent people from benefitting from intergroup contact. Individual differences in the motivation to establish and maintain social hierarchy (SDO) seemed to prevent people from engaging in intergroup contact. Moreover, this tendency seemed to make people resistant to positive contact experiences. On the other hand, people high in RWA seemed to benefit from intergroup contact with friends, once they overcame their tendency to avoid outgroup contact in general. These findings suggest that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167211429747">Allport (1954)</xref> was right about individual differences as <italic>preventions</italic> for positive contact effects. But luckily it shows that even highly prejudiced people can benefit from contact experiences (at least those high in RWA). This gives hope for intervention programs and also supports the important claim that intergroup contact does not only improve attitudes of those who are already low in prejudice. Our findings and those of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167211429747">Dhont &amp; Van Hiel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167211429747">Hodson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167211429747">Hodson et al., 2009</xref>) provide strong arguments for the provision of intergroup contact opportunities under specific conditions, and for those high in RWA, conditions stressing social cohesion and a lack of value-based threat.</p>
