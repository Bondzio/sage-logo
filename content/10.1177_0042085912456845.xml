<abstract>
<p>This article explores practitioner inquiry and culturally relevant pedagogy to create academic success with students facing high school exit examinations in Reading. In Florida, about one-third of African American students passed the test in 2010. Student perspectives on achievement, school processes, and engagement were incorporated with strategic practice to create a collaborative, classroom environment. Culturally relevant pedagogy, literacy theory, and English language arts instruction were integrated with student’s perspectives in curriculum design and instruction.</p>

<title>Standardized Tests and Struggling Readers in the Age of Accountability</title>
<p>With the advent of No Child Left Behind (NCLB) in 2002, loud rhetoric surrounding the gap in achievement on standardized tests between Black and White children and between Hispanic and White children began to take center stage in the agenda to reform education in the United States. As its primary goal, NCLB states that by 2014 all children, despite differences in economic status and ethnic history, will graduate from high school with skills that prepare them for college.</p>
<p>In Florida, the primary measure for assessing student performance is the Florida Comprehensive Achievement Test (FCAT). State statutes mandate all students to pass the 10th grade FCAT in Reading and Mathematics to be eligible for a standard high school diploma. In 2010, 70% of White students passed this exit exam with a level 3 or higher during their 10th grade year. However, only 36% of African American students scored a level 3. Florida statutes mandate that every middle and high school student scoring a level 1 or 2 must enroll in an intensive reading course the year following the score for remediation, thus large populations of African American students fill intensive reading courses throughout the state during their middle and high school years.</p>
<p>Unsatisfactory school achievement and educational outcomes, under funding for African American students and a majority of non-White students is well documented in literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042085912456845">Books, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042085912456845">Haycock, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042085912456845">Powell, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0042085912456845">Rothstein, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0042085912456845">Rothstein, Jacobson, &amp; Wilder, 2008</xref>). Research on African American school achievement has pervasively documented stressors and hurdles rooted in structural inequalities and racism faced by African American students seeking educational success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042085912456845">Anderson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042085912456845">Chambers et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042085912456845">Kozol, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042085912456845">Lee, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042085912456845">Morris, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042085912456845">Powell, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0042085912456845">Winn, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Best practices in teaching and learning are central. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042085912456845">Cochran-Smith and Lytle (2009)</xref> note the capacity of best practices, especially as demonstrated by practitioner inquiry and professional development communities, to lessen the impact of “factors and forces outside of school, including failed social policies, poverty and racism as well as a system of schooling in which low expectations and outcomes for certain groups and subgroups of students are endemic” (p.1).</p>
<p>This study describes key lessons that emerged from my use of practitioner inquiry in a high school intensive reading course. The study takes place over one academic year, when I was the course instructor. Drawing from literacy theory, English language arts instruction, and a culturally relevant pedagogy with African American secondary students, I create a conceptual framework for instruction and share the lessons I learned from students. I also share methods of integrating student perspectives into course design, and finally, discuss the implications of the findings for teachers, policy makers, and administrators who work with urban African American students.</p>

<title>Literacy Theory, Reading, and English Language Arts Instruction</title>
<p>English language arts and reading instruction both fall under the purview of literacy theory. Encompassing “reading, writing and other modes of symbolic communication that are often valued differently by people living in different social and economic structures and holding different political views,” literacy theory and instruction is a wide and varied field with many meanings and incarnations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042085912456845">Alvermann, 2002</xref>, p. 4). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042085912456845">Franzak’s (2006)</xref> review of literature on marginalized adolescent readers and literacy theory, conceptions of literacy have undergone several iterations over time, with each iteration contributing elements to secondary classroom practices and policy. Although shifts represent chronological periods, elements of previous literacy paradigms are often embedded in contemporary contexts.</p>
<p>Two elements of historical literacy theory that continually marginalize readers are the practice of ranking students in a hierarchy, and the conceptualization of discrete categories of cognition, which can be identified through formal and informal assessments and then translated into achievement levels. Common levels for secondary students are below grade, on grade, and above grade level. These are used to place students in courses. Those deemed below grade level are viewed as in need of interventions and remediation, which are meant to bring students up to grade-level performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042085912456845">Franzak, 2006</xref>). This ranking of students, and the designation of “struggling reader” that accompanies the placement in remedial or interventionist coursework does little to disentangle the variety of factors, literacies, and reading strengths/weaknesses that students who fall within this category possess (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042085912456845">Greenleaf &amp; Hinchman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042085912456845">Lee, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Instead, in these courses, students are often taught through the use of pre-packaged remedial reading programs and curricula that focus almost exclusively on phonemic awareness, fluency, and the explicit instruction of strategy use in comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042085912456845">Dennis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042085912456845">Franzak, 2006</xref>). Very little data substantiate the effectiveness of this type of instruction as a means to provide students with the broad range of skills they need to understand complex literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042085912456845">Dennis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042085912456845">Lee, 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, this type of instruction proliferates as one kind of strategy-based pedagogy aimed at meeting the needs of students failing high stakes standardized tests in an ever-increasing climate of punitive practice for teachers and students alike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042085912456845">Dennis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042085912456845">Franzak, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Strategy-Based Pedagogy: Beyond Remediation</title>
<p>Strategy-based pedagogy is a part of the domain of strategic reading, one of three categories of literacy theory with implications for marginalized readers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042085912456845">Franzak, 2006</xref>). Strategic reading is largely focused on the ways readers approach texts and aims to teach students how to employ a range of strategies to facilitate comprehension. Strategy use can be further divided into two subsections: teaching strategies and learning strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042085912456845">Kamil, 2003</xref>). Teaching strategies are content focused and teacher initiated, whereas learning strategies are student directed and used to build independence in reading. Examples of teaching strategies include guided reading, direct instruction, and the use of graphic organizers; learning strategies include note taking, metacognitive training, and outlining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042085912456845">McDonald, Thornley, Staley, &amp; Moore, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0042085912456845">Panel, Health, &amp; Development, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The goal of all reading strategies is to have students become more aware of their metacognitive capabilities and aid them in understanding what they are reading. Research has corroborated that there are benefits to explicit instruction that supports metacognition and comprehension, although less is known about the ways this is incorporated into effective and comprehensive pedagogy. Effective pedagogy encompasses far more than specific skills or techniques. It supports and develops student engagement; it is appropriately leveled for student ability yet sufficiently complex for concept building, and it is relevant to student sociocultural identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042085912456845">Franzak, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042085912456845">Greenleaf, Jiménez, &amp; Roller, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042085912456845">Greenleaf &amp; Hinchman, 2009</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-0042085912456845">
<title>Reader’s Response and Critical Literacy</title>
<p>Two other categories of literacy theory affecting marginalized readers are reader’s response and critical literacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042085912456845">Franzak, 2006</xref>). Moving beyond a correct interpretation of a text to an authentic and personally situated interpretation of a text, reader’s response requires students to actively engage in reading processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042085912456845">Eckert, 2008</xref>). Thus, it has the potential of supporting marginalized readers by allowing for the use of diverse schemas within the English classroom, and provides the teacher with the freedom to move beyond a narrow canon of literature often conceptualized as traditional or standard, and shift the focus into content that students find meaningful and relevant to their lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042085912456845">Franzak, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042085912456845">Greenleaf et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Critical literacy takes the position that reading “involves not just the text and one’s transaction with it, but framing that transaction in a larger sociopolitical context. In so doing, one is reading the word and the world” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042085912456845">Franzak, 2006</xref>, p. 218). In suggesting that literacy is culturally and socially situated, critical literacy explicitly deconstructs how literacy (and more specifically academic literacy) privileges groups and identities while marginalizing others. Critical literacy instruction can examine the influence of textual worlds on the identity of the reader through textual words at the junctures of home, school, and society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042085912456845">Giroux, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042085912456845">hooks, 2010</xref>). At its heart is a practice of inquiry, digestion, and dialogue.</p>

<title>Linking Literacy and Culture to Create Community</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042085912456845">Greenleaf et al. (2002)</xref> suggest the following two premises for instruction based on their experiences in secondary literacy teacher education. First, “high-quality instruction for marginalized and often excluded groups of students builds upon these students’ prior literacy experiences, which are often not present or valued in school settings” (p. 492). Second, “To invite these students to use and extend the literacies they practice outside of school, teachers must learn about these literacies, perhaps from researchers, but also directly from these students and their communities” (p. 492). Noting the explicit need for teachers of marginalized students to be learners of and from students, this study utilized cultural frameworks embedded in African American contexts, and included student perspectives to inform practice.</p>
<p>To that end, culturally relevant pedagogy (CRP), especially CRP studies with African American students, describes a body of knowledge that theorizes frameworks, describes practices, and provides evaluations of culturally centered methods from an African American sociocultural lens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042085912456845">Adkins-Coleman &amp; Lyons, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042085912456845">Bondy, Ross, Gallingane, &amp; Hambacher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042085912456845">Cholewa, Amatea, West-Olatunji, &amp; Wright, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042085912456845">Durden, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042085912456845">Gay, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042085912456845">Hefflin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042085912456845">Howard, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042085912456845">Irvine &amp; Armento, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042085912456845">Ladson-Billings, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042085912456845">1995a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042085912456845">1995b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0042085912456845">Milner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0042085912456845">Murrell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0042085912456845">Shade, Kelly, &amp; Oberg, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0042085912456845">Tillman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0042085912456845">Ware, 2006</xref>). CRP seeks to identify and articulate theoretical premises and models, examples of exemplary teaching practices, and strategies for teacher education embedded within African American communities of educators, students, and families.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042085912456845">Ladson-Billings’(1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042085912456845">1995a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042085912456845">1995b</xref>) 6-year research project with excellent teachers of African American children was a pivotal example of culturally centered work in the growing context of school reform. On the whole, CRP literature contrasts deficit models of pedagogy and practice which problematize student behaviors and identities, and instead explores teacher’ identity, beliefs, attitudes, dispositions, and practice as a core correlation to student achievement and success. Ladson-Billings asserts that, “culturally relevant pedagogy is designed to problematize teaching and encourage teachers to ask about the nature of the student-teacher relationship, the curriculum, schooling, and society.” (1995a, p. 21).</p>
<p>Using grounded theory, Ladson-Billings analyzed the practice of eight teachers identified by community nomination as outstanding teachers of African American children. From their perspectives, practice and understandings as well as her experience as a former student and educator in African American communities, she extrapolated three broad propositions for culturally relevant pedagogy that would exemplify highly successful teacher practice. First, that culturally relevant teaching is foremost defined by its ability to promote academic success; second, that it helps to develop or maintain students’ cultural competence; and third, it supports the development of a critical and broad sociopolitical consciousness in youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042085912456845">Ladson-Billings, 1995</xref>).

Linkages between CRP theory and multicultural education theory have also surfaced as important considerations for practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042085912456845">Banks, Cochran-Smith et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042085912456845">Hefflin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042085912456845">Irvine &amp; Armento, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0042085912456845">Tileson &amp; Darling, 2008</xref>). However, scholars continue to note the need for concrete examples of teachers as well as other empirical work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0042085912456845">Sleeter, 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Guiding Principles</title>
<p>By merging frameworks based in literacy theory and culturally relevant pedagogy, I derived several initial guiding principles to inform my practice: (1) to create strong and caring relationships with students based on mutual respect and high expectations, (2) to access student thinking regarding their own learning needs and their cultural background to inform the curriculum, and (3) to teach metacognition and comprehension skills and strategies in multiple formats both explicitly and generatively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0042085912456845" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>I utilized a cycle of planning, action, assessment, reflection, and re-planning to create my curriculum, research my practice, and make changes in the curriculum as needed to meet the goals of developing more critical readers and providing instruction to pass the FCAT exam. My practice underwent three distinct cycles over the 2009 to 2010 academic year. The first cycle of inquiry spanned the first two units of instruction. The second cycle encompassed the third and fourth units, and the last cycle encompassed the fifth unit as my students took the final FCAT of the year.</p>
<p>Practitioner inquiry is a cyclical process in which a practitioner poses questions or “wonderings” that arise from problems within the classroom (planning), collects data to assess the wondering (action), then analyzes data within the context of relevant literature (assessment), ultimately making changes in practice as a result of new understandings (reflection and re-planning) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042085912456845">Dana &amp; Yendol-Hoppey, 2009</xref>). Also termed action research, practitioner inquiry is systematic intentional study of one’s assumptions, to develop local knowledge of classroom practice over time. Key knowledge gained from practitioners contributes to existing paradigms in educational research by providing an alternate, emic voice that highlights teacher concerns and has the capacity to affect change in localized scenarios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042085912456845">Cochran-Smith &amp; Lytle, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042085912456845">Dana &amp; Yendel-Hoppey, 2009</xref>).</p>

<list-item><p>Unit 1: Class Building and Diagnostic Assessments</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In the first unit, I utilized the guiding principles from my literature review. My goals were to create a cohesive classroom culture, to gain an understanding of students’ cultural worldview, to assess students’ personal learning styles and preference, and to diagnose basic reading and writing ability. I set forth these goals for several reasons. As a class, we would be spending much of our time in small groups, working with partners, or working as one large group; I wanted to judge students’ competence and comfort levels in working in these environments, and I wanted to access information regarding themselves, their experiences, and their worlds.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042085912456845">Cushman (2003)</xref> suggests that students feel cared about and respected when asked to share responsibility for envisioning the goals and expectations within the classroom; I requested that students co-generate rules and guidelines for communication and interactions. This activity provided essential information for my practice as a warm demander, especially with older high school. I also used an online multiple intelligences test and several other assessments to gather needed information.</p>

<list-item><p>Unit 2: Short-Term FCAT Preparation</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The retake of the 10th Grade Reading FCAT was approaching rapidly, 13 weeks after school began. I designed a unit that would reinforce skills my students would need to understand the format of the test, to think critically about the content, and to utilize test-taking skills to maximize their score. Specifically, I taught students standardized test deconstruction, test-taking strategies, the process of elimination, and how to write both short and extended essay responses for standardized tests. I also began to teach metacognition skills, reading strategies, and analytic writing skills for both fiction and nonfiction texts. Instruction and assessment for unit two were connected and cyclical.</p>
<list id="list4-0042085912456845" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Unit 3: Immigration</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>For our third unit, we focused on United States immigration policies and practices, as my students were very interested in the topic, its ethical considerations, and political implications in their lives. Most students, when probed even at the surface, had an opinion and belief about the topic. Moreover, studying immigration allowed for a wide selection of nonfiction and fiction texts while requiring my students to actively engage real-world concepts. I taught evaluation skills—reliability and validity of information, articulation, and summarization of main ideas, synthesizing sources, identification of themes and author’s perspective. Once again, I worked cyclically, first to instruct students in concepts, then to provide strategies to practice skills, then to assess student progress and reteach as necessary.</p>

<list-item><p>Unit 4: Mid-Year Reflections and Focus Groups</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>During this time, I analyzed FCAT retake scores. Six of the 14 students who retook the test passed at this time with a score of level two or higher and were thus removed from my class. Of the remaining eight students, 75% displayed an increase in their Developmental Scale Score from their previous FCAT score in April of 2009. Developmental Scale Scores are used to measure learning gains over time, thus even though students had not progressed enough to move levels, they were learning and progressing on the measure.</p>
<p>I conducted student focus groups to gather information on students’ perceptions of self-efficacy, classroom management, engagement, and curriculum. Student participation in focus groups was voluntary. Ninety-three percent of class participants opted to partake in the focus group interviews. I also held informal discussions in class to solicit feedback on students’ needs with regard to classroom environment and students’ suggestions for classroom practice in the 2 months leading up to the next FCAT exam. I coded these data into categories, which included students needing more structure, students needing frequent breaks in class, suggestions for break activities, and comments on classroom management. I then adjusted my practice based on these findings and incorporated them into the framework I developed using my review of literature.</p>

<list-item><p>Unit 5: Novel Reading</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In this unit, we read a novel written by 2 authors: an African American male and a White male. The text provided a rich source for examining the larger sociocultural reality of life, as well as speech patterns, writing styles, word choice, and literary devices used differently (and similarly) by the two authors. I focused instruction on strategy-based pedagogy—making inferences, identifying and articulating author’s purpose in a text, and decoding unfamiliar vocabulary terms. I also continued instruction on reading for comprehension and reader’s response techniques to make meaning of what is read. I chose these areas of instruction as they are commonly assessed on the FCAT test and are necessary skills to understand fiction texts at the secondary level. I utilized an autobiographical narrative text as a base for instruction and provided students with large chunks of classroom time to read the text, uninterrupted but with support if needed, using the strategies addressed in former units.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>At the beginning of the school year, there were 24 students divided into two class periods of an intensive reading course. The classes were divided by grade level with ninth and tenth graders in one class, and eleventh and twelfth graders in the other.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0042085912456845">1</xref></sup> In total, there were two 9th grade students, nine 10th grade students, twelve students in 11th grade, and one 12th grade students. Students in 9th and 10th grade were assigned to intensive reading courses because a score of a level 1 or 2 on the previous year’s FCAT exam. Students in 11th and 12th grade were assigned to the course because of having failed the 10th grade FCAT exam one or more times. By virtue of the school policy, once a student has passed the 10th grade FCAT Reading test they are able to withdraw from the intensive reading course and attend an elective course of their choosing, thus six students were withdrawn from the study in December of the academic year. These students, after 13 weeks of instruction passed the FCAT retake with a score of 300 or higher. By the end of the school year, 17 students remained in the course. The majority of the course’s population was African American students.</p>

<sec id="section9-0042085912456845">
<title>Data</title>
<p>Sources of data included standardized test scores, teacher observation notes, student artifacts (e.g., student journals, student essays), in-class assessments (e.g., fluency assessments, teacher-generated comprehension assessments, standardized test questions drawn from prior assessments, a Gardner multiple intelligences assessment, teacher-generated curriculum-based assessments), focus group interviews with students, and a reflective teacher/researcher journal.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0042085912456845">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>For each cycle, I coded and analyzed relevant data to inform practice. During cycle one, data analyzed included teacher observation notes and diagnostic assessments of reading fluency, writing competence, and type of intelligence. During cycle two, data included standardized reading test scores, focus group notes, student journals, sample reading standardized test passages, student essays, and other in-class assessments. During cycle three, data included curriculum based assessments, test data, and teacher/researcher journal.</p>
<p>Standardized test scores are reported using FCAT. The FCAT is a criterion-referenced examination that assesses students on their ability to attain proficiency in meeting readings benchmarks set forth by the Sunshine State Standards (SSS). Scores are denoted in Achievement Levels ranging from 1 (lowest) to five (highest); each Achievement Level represents a range of scale scores and developmental scale scores. Developmental scale scores can be tracked across years to determine learning gains over time. Passing levels for the Grade 10 FCAT SSS and Retake tests are a developmental scale score of 1,926 (scale score of 300) or above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042085912456845">Florida Department of Education, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>The findings are presented in two ways. First, results of the study are quantified using assessment measures administered at the state level. The second section uses a narrative reflection based on qualitative data to describe what I learned from the students that helped me understand what worked best for them academically.</p>

<title>Quantitative Assessment</title>
<p>The 10th grade FCAT Reading exam is administered in the spring of the 10th grade year. Students who do not pass this exam retake a comparable exam, called the FCAT Reading Retake exam, in the fall of the following year and again in the spring. Thirteen students took the FCAT Retake exam in the fall of 2009, after approximately 13 weeks of instruction. Fifty-eight percent of students passed the test at that time by scoring 300 points or greater. In the spring of 2010, six additional students took another retake exam after approximately 25 weeks of instruction. Sixty-six percent of students taking the spring retake exam passed, thus overall 84% of the students taking the FCAT Retake exam during the 2009 to 2010 school year passed the exam. This rate of passing the exam was 190% percent higher than the state average of 29% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042085912456845">Florida Department of Education, 2011</xref>). Nine students took the 10th grade FCAT Reading Exam at this time and two students took the 9th grade FCAT Reading Exam. None of the 10th grade students passed this critical exam with a score level of 300 or higher. Forty-four percent had learning gains of 1 year or more, and both 9th grade students had at least one year of learning gains as measured on the test.</p>

<title>Qualitative Description of Lessons Learned From Students</title>
<p>This section presents qualitative data to describe what I learned in relationship with students that helped me understand and craft an academic environment. Findings were based on qualitative analysis of data from student focus groups, teacher observations, and my teacher journal. Five key lessons emerged as meaningful for my classroom practice. They are:</p>

</list>
<sec id="section14-0042085912456845">
<title>Lesson one: Failure on the FCAT test can translate to personal failure for the student</title>
<p>Student reflections in their journal entries and in focus groups conveyed a deep sense of personal failure and a lack of self-efficacy based solely on their failing scores on the FCAT test. Students repeatedly made comments about their perceived intelligence and were comparatively more withdrawn, angry, and reticent with respect to learning than other students in my course who had not failed the FCAT test. The quote at the beginning of this article, “As soon as I found out I was in this class, I was like, I don’t want to be in the slow class,” represent student comments that illustrate their sense of personal failure and their perceptions of their own intelligence as a result of their failure on the test. Students also expressed this sense of failure during in class written reflections. One student remarked, “I was real depressed after I had failed the test. I tried real hard last year and studied a lot. I don’t know why I failed.” Other students expressed similar sentiments during in-class reflective assignments. These reflections served to orient me to students’ perceptions of their effectiveness as readers and provided information on their responses to their performance on the previous year’s test.</p>
<p>During pre-planning, as I prepared my curriculum and assessed my students based on their most recent test scores in reading, I assumed that I would teach one lesson for both my Intensive Reading classes due to the similarities in test scores and skill weaknesses and strengths of the two classes. As I met the students in the two classes, I learned that this assumption was incorrect. I was struck by the difference in the social and learning environment of my two classes of students despite the fact that they had fairly similar reading profiles. The two sections of Intensive Reading that I taught were divided based primarily on the age of the students so that in one course (Section A), I had mostly 11th and 12th grade students, with the exception of two 9th grade students, and the other course (Section B) was comprised of mostly 10th grade students who had not yet taken the 10th grade FCAT but who had scored a level 1 on the 9th grade test FCAT test and a few 11th grade students.</p>
<p>Although these groups of students were very similar in skill proficiency, they were miles apart in their beliefs about their own efficacy. I found that 11th and 12th graders, that is students who had failed the 10th grade FCAT test, were more withdrawn, angry, and reticent to take the risks necessary in learning than my 10th grade students who had not faced this failure.</p>
<p>During the first week of classes I noted, “Students in this class (Section A) seem unreceptive to academic learning in this course. They provide very little feedback, non-verbally or verbally. One student kept his eyes down on the floor for the majority of the period.” Then later on,<disp-quote>
<p>By the middle of the second week, it is clear that I am going to have to differentiate instruction for the two classes despite their reading similarities. The format that I had conceived is not working with the older group. They are not willing to participate in “connections’. “Connections were class-building activities I use to center their focus on our classroom unit and our day’s lesson. They giggle, are rude, call out when they should not, and do whatever they can to derail the activity in progress. (Teacher journal entry, August 19, 2009)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>With these students, who seemed to suffer emotional effects from their previous failures in reading, my approach needed to be more matter-of-fact and outcome-oriented. They were withdrawn from the process of reading and the supposed joy in learning. They did not want to connect, to reveal who they were and to bond as a class. After this date entry, I changed several aspects of my practice. Instead of beginning class in a whole group activity (a circle intended to allow students to share insights from their day or from our last class time together), we began the day in rows facing forward, quickly getting into the subject matter at hand despite the look of apathy I regularly confronted. And usually, they performed. Thus, I learned that for these students, connecting with others, sharing personally, and intentionally building a classroom community of openness and good will was not going to procure the type of warm classroom environment I envisioned. Some students required distance and impersonal professionalism to thrive in an area where they have found failure. However, as time progressed and students began to succeed in coursework and to trust my intentions personally and professionally, they began to take more risks and develop authentic relationships with me.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0042085912456845">
<title>Lesson two: Being assigned to a remedial class is perceived as a loss to the student’s academic choice making and affects their school related persona</title>
<p>Students expressed sentiments of loss and resignation because of their placement in an intensive reading class. For most, the requirement was at the expense of an elective course that the student had been excited about. During focus groups, five (out of 17) students commented on the loss they felt at trading an elective course such as Performing Arts, Weightlifting, or Art for Intensive Reading. This sense of loss seemed to translate into a reluctance to be in an intensive reading course or even resentment toward the class. Students often came to the course angry or disgruntled. As one student remarked, “I hate coming to this class, [author], no offense to you.” Students also noted that they were teased by peers due to their enrollment. One student noted that he regularly made fun of himself before other students so as to preempt their teasing, “Other students try to crack jokes about me being in here but I just laugh with them. I make fun of myself so that they can’t make fun of me first. I also hear comments from other teachers.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0042085912456845">
<title>Lesson three: Relationships are built one on one</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042085912456845">Palmer (2007)</xref> states, “If a space is to support learning, it must invite students to find their authentic voices, whether or not they speak in ways approved by others. Learning does not happen when students are unable to express their ideas, emotions, confusions, ignorance, and prejudices. In fact, only when people can speak their minds does education have a chance to happen” (p.117). Thus, as an educator, I took the stance that student misbehavior should be met with as much understanding and instruction as I could muster.</p>
<p>Upon taking this position, I met with the Assistant Principal, who provided me with a brief personality and behavioral history for each of my students. He stressed the need for forming a partnership with him to help my students understand the consequences of their behavior in class. It was clear that he anticipated behavioral deviance in class. At least 60% of the juniors and seniors enrolled in my course had received previous discipline referrals in other courses. One student was in my course because another teacher refused to teach him citing profound behavioral problems and a personality clash.</p>
<p>Rather than using the administrative and disciplinary team of the school to mediate difficult relationships, I made a point to work through problems in house. It seemed vitally important to send a different message from what I speculated was a long history of punitive practice and ostracization that is all too common with African American students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042085912456845">Fenning &amp; Rose, 2007</xref>). I learned that wrestling with the students’ unacceptable behaviors, being honest regarding my disappointment and offense, and speaking truthfully and directly while simultaneously nurturing the relationship with the student did more to change behavior. I viewed it as an investment, one that surely sent a better message than sending a student away out of the classroom during valuable learning time for discipline.</p>
<p>One example of an interaction with a student illustrates this. Seventeen years old and a junior, Janissa had been in Intensive Reading courses since middle school. In her last year at the school, she had received three discipline referrals. Within the first 3 weeks of our course, Janissa began to behave in class in a manner that was unacceptable and disruptive. From my Teacher Journal,<disp-quote>
<p>Today, Janissa seemed to do everything she could to disrupt my lesson, get under my skin, and be rude to me. She keeps a running conversation going with John who is on the verge of being expelled from this school. Today, I had it and called Janissa into the hall in the middle of class to discuss her behavior. I was short, direct, and visibly angry as I told her that she had a choice, either she could stay and learn and be respectful of me as a person or she could leave. ‘But know this, if you leave you will not get the skills you need to pass this test, and I know you want to pass the test. You are so capable of doing it, but you waste your time, joking and laughing and being rude in class. That’s your choice. But you are not going to waste my time anymore. Decide if you want to learn. If you do, get it together and come back to class quietly. If you don’t we can find another place for you.’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In her own time, Janissa returned to class, reluctant and visibly angry, but quiet. That evening I sent her a text message saying, “You are far too brilliant and talented to waste your time behaving ugly. Come back to class tomorrow and bring your ‘A’ game.” She sent a text back responding, “Yes, ma’am. I am sorry I was rude. I’ll see you tomorrow.” During the course of the year, I issued only one referral and regularly managed to maintain a controlled yet positive environment in the class.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0042085912456845">
<title>Lesson four: A relaxed class is not a lax class</title>
<p>My aim was to maintain a friendly, cooperative, fun, and respectful classroom environment. I enjoyed teaching and learning and I wanted to share that love with my students, thus our classroom’s emotional climate was easy-going and jovial. Student comments demonstrated that they appreciated the relaxed comfortable nature of our classroom, despite the high level of rigor I demanded. One student stated, “In this class we are learning what we need to learn and we are relaxed while we are doing it so we are not stressing out because the FCAT is coming.” Another student when discussing classroom management remarked, “I like this class because it’s real relaxed. You don’t put a lot of pressure on doing the FCAT. I like the fact that the rules are relaxed and you treat us like adults.” Another stated, “I hate it when the reading teacher makes it seem as though if we don’t pass this test, it is the end of the world. Teachers need to tell their students that they are just taking a test and they can always retake it.”</p>
<p>Intentionally, I adopted some rules that were unusual in a high school. Any student who needed to use the restroom was able to walk out of class and go—no permission was needed. In addition, students were able to use their MP3 players and headphones while working individually despite the campus wide rule that did not allow for use of personal electronic equipment in classrooms. I allowed the use of mp3 players because I found that a majority of students in my course had a high musical intelligence based on an online version of Gardner’s Multiple Intelligence test. I wanted to capitalize on that by allowing students to use music to enhance memory and focus if they felt it did so. Second, I did not want to waste time enforcing a minor rule that was regularly disobeyed by the majority of the student body. Finally, as a principle, I wanted to place the responsibility for their behavior and learning squarely in their hands and did as little micromanaging as possible.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0042085912456845">
<title>Lesson five: All literacies are valid and can be used for instruction</title>
<p>This lesson centers on the use of text messaging and informal dialogue after school hours to support instruction given in class. Early in the school year, I provided students with a questionnaire regarding their reading habits, likes, and dislikes. I encouraged students to be as honest and descriptive as possible with regard to what they read, when and how they accomplished reading. Overwhelmingly, the top ranked reading material for my students were text messages received on their mobile phones; for some students this was the only material that they listed as reading. Every student except one had a mobile phone with unlimited text messaging service. I chose to incorporate text messages as a form of literacy, a method of communication, and a space for content based interaction in the course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042085912456845">Greenleaf et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>I frequently sent messages en masse to my classes when assignment due dates were approaching. On average, I would have approximately a 75% rate of completion for anything I assigned and then followed up with a text. Prior to beginning this practice, I would have approximately a 30% rate of completion on any given assignment, with the same students completing their homework each time. Beyond using texts as a reminder for deadlines, texts served as a mode of discussing content. A series of texts between a student and I are reprinted below:</p>
<speech><speaker>Me:</speaker><p>Your Homework is due tomorrow, don’t forget!</p></speech>
<speech><speaker>Student:</speaker><p>OK. But I don’t remember what a metaphor is. . .</p></speech>
<speech><speaker>Me:</speaker><p>Do you have the notes from class today?</p></speech>
<speech><speaker>Student:</speaker><p>Yes Ma’am but I don’t get it.</p></speech>
<speech><speaker>Me:</speaker><p>Remember the song I used in class-She loves me like a rock. Then think about “She IS a rock.” Does that help?</p></speech>
<speech><speaker>Student:</speaker><p>Kinda, I’ll try . . .</p></speech>
<speech><speaker>Me:</speaker><p>Okay, text back if you are still struggling later.</p></speech>
<p>Using text messages to reinforce in class concepts provided much more of an individualized insight into students’ needs and weaknesses. Repeatedly throughout the year, I was able to follow up a text with a call to a student’s home to help them complete an assignment for which they needed support. In part, I suspect that texting worked so well because it was so private. It is a different medium altogether than calling a student’s family home phone number, or keeping a child after class, or even providing one to one assistance during class time. For some of my students, I believe this privacy was highly important, as they had already revealed that they often times felt shamed, ashamed, and without agency as a marginalized student. Had I not begun the practice of texting, I am not sure that students would have emailed my professional address or felt comfortable calling. Text messaging became a standard method of communication we used outside of class.</p>

<title>Discussion and Implications for Practice</title>
<p>In Florida, only 15% of twelfth grade students who failed the 10th grade FCAT Reading Exam passed a retake by the end of the twelfth grade year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042085912456845">Florida Department of Education, 2011</xref>). Thus, the findings are extraordinary as 84% of students failing the 10th grade exam passed the Retake exam during the 2009 to 2010 school year. My practice was a contextualized blend of inquiry practice, literacy, and reading theory—especially as conceived for marginalized readers and culturally relevant pedagogy for African American students. How, then, do we create spaces of success, especially for those most at risk of academic failure as defined by high stakes standardized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042085912456845">Holme, Richards, Jimerson, &amp; Cohen, 2010</xref>)?</p>
<p>High stakes exams are an increasing and particular phenomenon. They pose important considerations for teacher practice that go beyond mastery of curriculum, subject matter, and classroom management. As suggested by the students discussion of the emotional effects of remedial education and failure on tests, teaching in high stakes environments also requires an understand of the psychological effects of these tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042085912456845">Holme et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0042085912456845">Reardon, Arshan, Atteberry, &amp; Kurlaender, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>As a practitioner researching the particular context of my classroom, the qualitative lessons I learned from my students were essential to the development of a living, thriving curriculum, and classroom environment. I learned these lessons because of an intentional practice that augmented the cycle of planning, action, assessment, and reflection to involve students as collaborators within this process. I conducted student focus groups and reflective writing assignments with the stated focus of having students examine the context of the course, the course material, progression, and my instruction, and their own goals and lives. Thus, the inclusion of student perspectives went far beyond an assessment of their voice through their coursework. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0042085912456845">Wiggan (2007)</xref> notes the dearth in the literature of studies centered in student voice and perspectives, although these studies are necessary and integral to conceptualizing student achievement and learning.</p>
<p>The lessons I learned from my students furthermore contributes to the literature on student motivation and engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042085912456845">Fisher &amp; Gay, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042085912456845">Franzak, 2006</xref>), which suggests understanding and addressing student motivation within the classroom is a key component for academic achievement. In this study, students described their motivations and hurdles in several ways: by elucidating on their experiences and identities as marginalized readers in a public school, as test takers hoping to graduate high school, and more broadly as youth hoping to access written literature for a range of personal reasons. In my practice, I explicitly addressed the demands of the assessment phenomenon and its mandates while still building broader conceptions of literacy, reading, and English language arts skills in the curriculum. Within literacy and reading intervention literature, student motivation and goal setting are often conceptualized to mean that students have the opportunity to engage in authentic reading and writing based on personal interest. This study suggests that the concept of motivation could be broadened to include the student’s motivation with regard to their academic identities and agency, their goals regarding assessments—particularly high stakes exams, as well as focusing on more intrinsic motivation to read.</p>
<p>The integration of culturally relevant pedagogy, literacy theory, and practitioner inquiry that was used in this study resulted in a site-specific culture-based form of literacy instruction. This culture-based model stands alongside other perspectives on content area literacy such as funds of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042085912456845">Moll, Amanti, Neff, &amp; Gonzalez, 1992</xref>), and cultural modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042085912456845">Lee, 2001</xref>) as a third method of teacher practice and pedagogy. By infusing practices and theoretical concepts from literature on culturally relevant pedagogy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042085912456845">Cholewa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042085912456845">Gay, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042085912456845">Irvine &amp; Armento, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042085912456845">Ladson-Billings, 1995a</xref>) into practices and theoretical considerations learned from the literature on literacy and reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042085912456845">Alvermann, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042085912456845">Lee, 2007</xref>), I was able to create my own framework, one that was context specific.</p>
<p>Finally, this study took place as part of my graduate work in education. I had access to a research community that provided direction and expertise in seeking literature that might support my particular context. However, most teachers do not have direct access to this professional community. Instead, they rely on professional development trainings and workshops at the district level. Professional development for practicing and preservice teachers is repeatedly cited as an area for improvement for quality and sound education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042085912456845">Fishman, Marx, Best, &amp; Tal, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0042085912456845">Milner, 2006</xref>). The findings of this study corroborate that the use of school or district wide inquiry communities as a professional development practice could provide teachers with the structure, knowledge, and access needed to solve problems arising within their own domains to the benefit of their local community and student population.</p>
