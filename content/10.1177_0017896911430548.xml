<abstract>
<p><bold>Background</bold>: Health education in primary and middle schools in China has been implemented for more than two decades since 1990s. This study aims to assess the students’ health literacy gained through school health education, and provide scientific base to the concerned government agencies for updating the relevant national policy for school-based health education.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: The study was conducted through cross-sectional multi-stage cluster-stratified sampling survey in 77 elementary and 76 middle schools in 24 project provinces and two municipal cities in China. A self-administered questionnaire was developed. The reliability of the questionnaire was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha and Spearman-Brown coefficient. A descriptive analysis was used to summarize the outcome.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: The survey covered 8,008 subjects (4,011 from elementary and 3,997 from middle schools). The correct answer given on the majority of health knowledge was higher than 60% among the surveyed subjects. However, it was found that there were differences on student knowledge and practices from regions and economic levels; and the healthy personal behaviours between elementary and middle school students varied. Positive correlations between knowledge and practices, knowledge and attitudes were observed among subjects.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions</bold>: Health literacy of the primary and middle school children in China was found to be limited and unbalanced. Thus school-based health education should be enhanced and the national guidelines for school health education and curriculum framework should be updated.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Health literacy of students is a concern of the education authority in the field of health promotion and protection, disease prevention, as well as health behaviour change. Health literacy refers to the capacity of an individual to obtain, interpret and understand basic health information and services to enhance their own health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0017896911430548">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0017896911430548"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0017896911430548"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0017896911430548">4</xref></sup> In other words, individual health-related knowledge, attitudes, behavioural intentions and skills could be measurable indicators to identify health literacy level of the groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0017896911430548">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0017896911430548">6</xref></sup> Generally speaking, school is one of the main settings for students to spend more time in their life on not only studying, but also developing health-related attitudes and behaviours. School-based health education was and has been recognized as pivotal in composing an ideal approach to help children and adolescents develop the knowledge and skills, motivate and support them to willingly choose a healthy life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896911430548">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0017896911430548">8</xref></sup> Some research from developed countries showed that school health education is more likely to develop in various ways, such as curriculum, activities to accelerate school children gaining health literacy and applying health information and knowledge to change their behaviours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0017896911430548">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896911430548">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are about 200 million elementary and middle school students who account for about one-sixth of the total population at present in China. School has become a crucial place that can help students not only acquire academic achievement, but also develop health consciousness and healthy behaviour. In 1990, the China National Committee of Education (NCE) and the Ministry of Health (MOH) jointly issued the document <italic>The Work Ordinance for School Health</italic>, in which it proposed to improve students’ health through a comprehensive school-based health programme that promotes health service, safety environment, and cultivating of personal healthy habits. In 1992, NCE and MOH published <italic>The Basic Requirements of Health Education for Primary and Secondary Schools as a National</italic> Guideline, which stipulated health education as an independent subject in the period of compulsory education. Since then, school-based health education has been developed in various patterns step by step in China.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911430548">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0017896911430548"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0017896911430548">13</xref></sup> However, with the rapid development of society and the shift of spectrum of disease in the population, school children also face some new challenges. The data from China national surveillance shows that obesity and overweight have become an increasing trend. Also unintentional injuries and some health problems related to lack of exercise, vision problems (especially myopia), mental and emotional development are becoming more and more common among Chinese children and adolescents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0017896911430548">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896911430548">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study was a first attempt at a national scope of assessing research in China. The study objective is to better understand the impact of school-based health education on improving students’ health literacy, mainly on knowledge, motivation and ability development at elementary and middle schools since the implementation of the National Guidelines in 1992, and more, to provide scientific suggestion for updating it for the school health education and health promotion.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0017896911430548">
<title>Study population</title>
<p>Using the multi-stage cluster-stratified sampling method, the study was conducted from March to June, 2005. At the first sampling stage, two to three cities or districts, highly developed, middle-developed and developing cities or districts of each project province were sampled according to their socioeconomic level. At the second sampling stage, 153 schools were selected on random basis according to school enrollment size, and one or two classes from the sampled schools were randomized at the third sampling stage. The subjects included elementary and middle school students, who were at third or fourth grade in elementary school or eighth grade in middle school. There were at least six schools selected in each project province/municipality.</p>
<p>Excluding Hong Kong and Macao Special Administrative Regions, there are 31 provincial administration regions in mainland China. In the survey, we covered 24 project provinces and autonomous regions, and two project municipal cities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0017896911430548">Figure 1</xref>). These project areas are divided into three geographical zones based on their economic development and population density, namely eastern, middle, and western areas, which objectively reflects their difference and development trend from more developed to less developed.</p>

<title>Data collection</title>
<p>A structured questionnaire that contained 37 items, both close-ended and open-ended, question for students at elementary and middle school was designed by an expert panel consisting of epidemiologist, psychologist, school health and health educational experts, based on NEC and MOH’s requirement and the <italic>National Standards on School Health Education (NSSHE)</italic> to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) level of the subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911430548">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896911430548">15</xref></sup> The questionnaire also required the general demographic information of the participants.</p>
<p>Health-related knowledge and behaviours were the measurable indicators used to identify health literacy. The knowledge part of the questionnaire was composed of seven topics in accordance with the NSSHE; that is, personal healthy habits, food and nutrition, diseases prevention, substance abuse prevention, safety and injury prevention, physical activity, and growth and development (containing body and mental development and adolescence health). The gradings of the questions were scored ‘1’ point for a correct response, and ‘0’ for an incorrect or don’t know response. Then total scores were converted into percentages. The higher score the students gained, the better health cognition they had.</p>
<p>All students were required to answer questions about their lifestyle and individual health habit-related diet, disease prevention and dental hygiene, etcetera. The answer was graded into three levels: ‘well done’, which meant that the respondent did it every time/day each week; ‘medium’ which meant the respondent did it every two or three days; and ‘poorly done’ which meant never or seldom done, with a score of 3, 2 and 1 respectively. The higher scores mean the better behaviours.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, students were requested to answer two questions about their attitude towards school health education: ‘Do you like to learn health knowledge and information?’ and ‘Do you agree that health is a base of learning achievement?’.</p>
<p>Cronbach’s alpha coefficient, a measure of internal consistency for the questionnaire, ranged from 0.71 to 0.82 over each individual item. The Cronbach’s alpha for overall assessment was 0.73 and Spearman-Brown coefficient for split-half reliability was 0.75, which indicated a moderate degree of internal consistency in measuring instruments.</p>
<p>The questionnaires were dispensed to sampled students in the classrooms of each school. All the participants were given detailed explanations and informed prior to answer the questionnaires, which were filled in anonymously.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The database was established with Epidata 3.02, and parallel double-entry and logical error detection were used for quality control of the data management. A descriptive analysis was used to summarize the outcome. The categorical data were listed as ratio and proportion, and Chi-square test or Fisher exact test was used in the statistical inference; the measurement data were calculated by mean and standard deviation, and the response score difference among groups were analyzed with Kruskal-Wallis <italic>H</italic> test for the data with skewness distribution. All analyses were performed with SPSS version 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago IL).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section7-0017896911430548">
<title>Demographic characteristics</title>
<p>There are altogether 153 schools, 77 elementary and 76 secondary schools; 8,008 students, 4,011 from elementary schools and 3,997 from middle schools; 3,877 boys and 4,131 girls from 24 project provinces and two project municipal cities in China. The participants from eastern, middle and western areas accounted for 33.2%, 27.2% and 39.6% respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0017896911430548">
<title>Knowledge level about health</title>
<p>The analysis results showed that the correct answer rate of most questions was higher than 60 points for the overall participants. The top five questions with highest correct rate for elementary and middle school students were different. However, there were three items with a correct rate lower than 60 points for elementary school pupils, and five items for middle school students. These items with lower correct rates were mainly on the topics of food and nutrition, personal health habits, disease prevention, and adolescence development. More than 50% of elementary and middle school students did not know ‘the nutritive effect of milk on health’; 51.7% of middle school students did not know ‘what is the secondary sexual characteristics during puberty’; nearly 90% of middle school students didn’t know ‘how to do self care for adolescent common problems, such as acne, menses etc.’; 41.1% of elementary school students and 66.4% of middle school students did not know ‘sleeping for enough time is necessary for individual development and health’; only 27.7% of middle school students knew the ‘correct prevention strategy for hepatitis A’.</p>
<p>The average score of elementary school pupils was higher than that of middle school students; and regardless of school level, the girls had higher average scores than boys. The results showed a significant difference among the three regions divided by different economic conditions, the average scores in the eastern and middle regions were higher than that in western region. The knowledge level in elementary and middle schools in the western region was relatively limited and lower, especially in male students (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0017896911430548">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Personal healthy practices and behaviours</title>
<p>As presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0017896911430548">Table 2</xref>, the rate of ‘well done’ for the healthy practices surveyed, such as having breakfast, choosing healthy food, washing hands with soap or without soap, and brushing teeth, were all lower. Only 75.7% and 67.0% of all surveyed students reported they had breakfast and ate vegetables every day in the last week before the survey respectively; the rate of ‘brushing teeth before going to bed at night daily’ was lowest: only 58.6% of all the participants. For most of these personal healthy practices, the differences between schools and regions were significant; the elementary school pupils were more likely to do better than middle school students except for ‘having vegetables daily’. The students in the economically better-off eastern area were better than those of the poorer western and middle areas.</p>

<p>Of the students, 22.5% reported that they would not like to talk with anyone when they were in a bad mood, and this proportion among middle school students was higher than that in elementary school (23.4% vs. 21.7%), male students higher than females (25.6% vs. 19.7%). The first target for communicating if they chose was their schoolmates or friends, and the proportion was significantly higher among girls than in boys (56.4% vs. 48.3%). Our survey also found that the high incidence of conflict with schoolmates and of injury were associated with students’ individual stress (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).</p>

When the students had a positive attitude towards health – that is, they agreed with ‘Health is a basic requirement for learning achievement’ – they were more likely to pay more attention to health education curriculum in school and have higher average knowledge scores.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As with the outcome model of health promotion developed by Nutbeam,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0017896911430548">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0017896911430548">6</xref></sup> health literacy composed of multiple indicators, such as knowledge, motivation, personal skills, etcetera, is highlighted as a key outcome from health education. Our findings indicated that school children in China possessed a certain level of health knowledge through school health education. However, it was still somewhat limited. The phenomenon of lacking basic knowledge about healthy food and nutrition, personal health, adolescence growth and health care was highly persistent in both elementary and middle school students. The knowledge level of students in different regions varied significantly. The students in the western region were likely to have lower levels of knowledge.</p>
<p>Practice and ability to maintain health are important composing parts of health literacy. One of ultimate purposes of health education is to gradually guide the students to cultivate healthy practices. Our study indicated that students had fairly bad personal healthy habits, and there was a gap between students’ possession of knowledge and their behaviours. Taking an example of ‘brush teeth every night’, almost one half of school students admitted that they didn’t, although this was high-rated correct answer concerning oral health knowledge. As the data from the China National Report of Student Constitution and Health Survey in 2005 showed, the prevalence of decayed teeth among school children in China, regardless of their sex, was still close to 50% although it slightly decreased compared with the data in 2000.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0017896911430548">17</xref></sup> Poor oral hygiene is undoubtedly an important factor leading to a high rate of dental caries. It suggests that cultivating health practices of students should be emphasized besides providing information and knowledge.</p>
<p>Moreover, regional factors also became an important relating element: the healthy practices of students from poorer and medium economic development areas were worse. Such results, shown in the knowledge, suggest that existing school health education in China is insufficient to improve students’ health literacy, especially in encouraging students to adopt healthy behaviours. Social and economic factors would have substantial impact on the resources allocation, such as lacking financial support, teacher and relative teaching materials, to the school-based health education, and further on the students’ accessing health information and shaping behaviours. Health promotion in school should not be a stand-alone subject. It needs to plan for the appropriate content, effective methods of health education based on different needs of students’ gender, grade and region situation.</p>
<p>In addition, it needs to pay attention to the mental health of students. The study found that students showed inadequate capabilities of psychological and social adaptation in coping with their negative emotions. Nearly one fourth of the school students did not like to communicate with others when they felt depressed, and the stress endured by students can be an influencing factor in causing the high incidence of conflicts among students as well as injuries. A few studies have indicated that appropriate social communication is an effective approach to adjust and improve one’s mood. In fact, good communicative ability has also been regarded as a crucial component of functional health literacy, to access and coordinate with health and social resources.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0017896911430548">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0017896911430548">6</xref></sup> School children are in a period of rapid physical and psychological growth and tend to experience various psychological and behavioural problems, such as anxiety and depression, under the influence of multiple factors including the academic burden, parents’ high expectations and diversified culture. With the improvement of the overall school sanitary conditions, some common contagious diseases among students have been under effective control in China. However, psychological problems have become increasingly an issue of urgent concern. It is suggested that students’ ability for psychological adjustment and life skills, such as coping with emotion, effective communication and negotiation, etcetera, should be enhanced in order to keep pace with the physical and mental health needs of students’ development.</p>
<p>The correlation analysis of this study has also supported this idea that there was a mutual relationship between the health knowledge level of students and their behaviours as well as attitudes. The students with higher levels of knowledge had better personal behaviours, and those who considered health more important gained higher scores in health knowledge, and were more likely to have better personal behaviours, which implied that change of a student’s attitude to health could have an effect on their gaining health knowledge, and practice cultivation which are the constitution of health literacy. Cognitive-behaviour skills, such as problem solving and decision making, have been proved as one of the effective elements in school-based cultivation of healthy behaviours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0017896911430548">19</xref></sup> However, the current school health education in China mainly focused on delivering basic knowledge, lacking skill training to promote behaviours change. Thus it suggested that school health education in the future should address multidimensional goals in improving knowledge, attitude, and practice in order to achieve the purpose of students’ holistic health literacy development.</p>
<p>There are several strengths in our study as compared with previous regional studies. First, we have based our study on a large random sample population from 24 project provinces and two municipal cities in the country. As a result, no selection bias was found in our study. Second, our study described the health literacy of school students through their knowledge and practices; as such it could understand and compare better the impact of school health education.</p>
<p>However, there are several limitations to our study. Because of the cross-sectional nature of the study it was difficult to make causal inferences, but correlations were made. Second, the sample population could not cover each students’ age, hence the results of this study was applicable to all the age group with only partial estimate. And third, although our study assessed the reliability of the questionnaire, the coefficients did not reach over 0.8 of a moderate degree.</p>

<title>Conclusion and implication</title>
<p>This study presents some unique findings and evidence for decision-makers of the education sector and health educators for schools. It advocates that school should solidly be an optimal place to improve students’ comprehensive health literacy through policy implemented at the national level to stimulate school-based health education. Moreover, the existing National Guidance for curriculum should be updated to emphasize the skill-based content framework to help students form healthy behaviours and abilities as they gain health knowledge, and keep consistency with individual traits, in school and at home, to ensure students fully understand and take action.</p>
