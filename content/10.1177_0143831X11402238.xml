<abstract>
<p>This article analyses factors behind underemployment in Norway, with a focus on gender. The analysis, based on Labour Force Survey data, shows that economic fluctuations during the latest decade and a half have brought about changing underemployment levels among both women and men. The Norwegian labour market is strongly gender segregated and the processes and characteristics of underemployment differ between male- and female-dominated labour market sectors. The former sectors are generally more sensitive to economic fluctuations than the latter. It is indicated that underemployed men are predominantly temporarily expelled on a part-time basis from their jobs, while women are to a larger extent permanently excluded from longer working-hour contracts in their jobs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The phenomenon to be discussed in this article is time-related underemployment, defined as the mismatch between a person’s working hours and her/his preference for longer hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143831X11402238">AUSSTAT, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143831X11402238">Brown and Pintaldi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143831X11402238">ILO, 2010</xref>). In the Nordic countries, attention has recently been drawn to what is perceived to be a relatively high level of underemployment, also called ‘the dark side of part-time work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143831X11402238">Lind and Rasmussen, 2008</xref>). The attention has partly been on the underemployed as an unused labour reserve, especially in times of tight labour markets, and partly on the negative economic and welfare consequences of underemployment for individuals and families.</p>
<p>The main objective of this article is to throw light on the dynamics and the gendered structure of underemployment. First, and as a background to the subsequent analysis, we describe the development of underemployment in Norway during the last one and a half decades (until 2008) focusing on the changing labour reserve of women and men. We examine whether economic upswings and recessions in the labour market bring about similar or dissimilar underemployment patterns between women and men. Our second goal is to discuss the observed changes in underemployment in relation to the gender-segregated Norwegian labour market. Whereas most former studies on the topic have been confined to dealing with the composition of underemployment and the low educated, mainly among women, the present study applies a somewhat broader perspective. It aims at grasping the relationships between individual characteristics of the underemployed and the gender-structured labour market on the one hand, and cyclical labour market changes on the other.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>On an international level, the development of part-time work in general, and of involuntary part-time work in particular, varies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0143831X11402238">1</xref></sup> During recent decades, several countries have seen a slow increase in both, e.g. Europe as a whole, and OECD countries as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143831X11402238">OECD, 2008</xref>), while the Nordic countries have witnessed a mainly unchanged or declining proportion of part-timers; in Norway mainly due to the increase of female full-time work. The smallest decline, however, applies to involuntary part-time work. As revealed by the European Working Conditions Survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143831X11402238">Forssell and Jonsson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143831X11402238">Parent-Thirion et al., 2007</xref>), there is an overall negative correlation at country level between part-time and involuntary part-time rates in Europe. This is largely congruent with the picture of the Nordic countries, as Norway has the largest proportion of part-timers, and Norwegian part-timers report the lowest proportion of involuntariness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143831X11402238">Kjeldstad, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143831X11402238">Virjo, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Norway differs from the other Nordic countries in that there has been more stable economic growth and somewhat less obvious economic downswings during the last decade or two. Hence, despite predominantly similar labour market conditions among the Nordic countries from a global perspective, from a Nordic perspective Norway has had the most stable level of high employment and the most stable level of low unemployment. At the same time Norway has had the highest and most stable part-time employment level. As is the case with other countries, however, part-time is mainly an attribute of the female labour market. In Norway in 2008, women accounted for 47 percent of all employed persons and 74 percent of part-time workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0143831X11402238">SSB, 2009</xref>). There has, however, been a decrease of the part-time rate from 46 to 42 percent among employed women and an increase from 10 to 14 percent among employed men since 1996 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143831X11402238">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

Still, we see a cyclical development of the underemployed in line with the economic business cycles, with a low level corresponding to peaks in the economy around the turn of the millennium and in 2007/8. At their lowest (in 2008), the number of underemployed amounted to 59,000, which equals 2.3 percent of all employed and 8.7 percent of the part-time employed, while at their highest (in 2004/5) the numbers were almost 100,000, i.e. 16 percent of the part-time employed.</p>

<p>The cyclical underemployment pattern corresponds predominantly to the changes in unemployment. This concurs with several earlier studies from other countries (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143831X11402238">Stratton, 1996</xref>). Accordingly, we regard underemployment by and large to be a type of (hidden) unemployment and to a large extent driven by demand-side factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143831X11402238">Jonsson and Nyberg, 2009</xref>). We are fully aware that like unemployment, changes in underemployment may be caused by changing economic incentives such as wage levels and welfare rights, and by labour supply factors, such as changing human capital and changing work and working-time preferences. As a rule, however, individual and social characteristics don’t tend to move in strict synchronization with economic fluctuations. This is not to disregard what has been shown by several studies, that the working-time preferences of the individual may adapt to shifting time-use requirements across the life course and to national and occupational working-hour norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143831X11402238">Abrahamsen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143831X11402238">Reynolds and Aletraris, 2006</xref>). Working-time preferences may of course also adapt to business cycles and changing labour demand in such a way that the employee settles for the working hours she or he can get (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143831X11402238">Reynolds and Aletraris, 2006</xref>). Part-time work may, then, appear a more acceptable alternative in times of recession. This should however, in turn, imply a certain equalization of the underemployment level in times of cyclical peaks and troughs and not, as it appears, reflect economic cyclical development. Hence, such adjustment processes between working-time preferences and changing labour demand seem to be of little significance in explaining the observed underemployment pattern during the period studied. At the same time, the proportion of part-time employed has remained almost unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143831X11402238">Figure 1</xref>) and the total number of part-time employed has increased steadily (not shown), thus appearing to be principally uncorrelated with the economic cycles. This again suggests rather a loose connection between the changes in part-time in general and the changes in involuntary part-time, indicating that the two developmental trends result from somewhat dissimilar processes, the latter being more directly associated with changes in economic cycles and labour demand. When studying underemployment therefore, we focus primarily on the demand-side of the labour market; i.e. on the changing demand for labour due to changing economic cycles, and on the time-structured and gendered demand in a prevailing gender-segregated labour market. The fact that changing business cycles affect women’s and men’s underemployment pretty much alike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0143831X11402238">Figure 2</xref>), underlines the general impression of involuntary part-time as primarily a demand-side driven phenomenon. Women constitute about three out of four of the involuntary part-timers throughout most of the period.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143831X11402238">Table 1</xref> illustrates the Norwegian gender-segregated labour market. Women outnumber men by far in the sheltered public sector jobs and men outnumber women in export industry and most other industries and jobs exposed to competition. Part-time and involuntary part-time employment is more widespread in female- than in male-dominated jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143831X11402238">Kjeldstad, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143831X11402238">Table 1</xref> also shows significant accordance between the general underemployment rate and female predominance within sectors, industries, occupations and other job characteristics and further, that being employed in female-dominated jobs increases the probability of underemployment for both sexes. With regard to the labour demand factors, quarter of the year, which we assume reflects seasonal fluctuations, and the local unemployment rate, which presumably reflects the local labour demand (see paragraphs on data), the latter shows a rather ‘skewed’ female to male unemployment rate, i.e. a decreasing female underemployment proportion as the local unemployment rate increases.</p>

<p>As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143831X11402238">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0143831X11402238">2</xref>, the underemployed are to a large degree mobilized to work longer hours in times of extensive labour demand. The volume of the active labour reserve constituted by the underemployed depends, however, on how many contractual working hours the underemployed actually want. Whereas several analyses in this field presuppose that the underemployed by definition prefer full-time jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143831X11402238">Lind and Rasmussen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143831X11402238">Stratton, 1996</xref>), only half of the Norwegian underemployed state that they want full-time work contracts, men somewhat more often than women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143831X11402238">Kjeldstad, 2009</xref>). Hence, by 2008 the underemployed represent a relatively limited unused labour reserve in the Norwegian labour market, and significantly more limited than the fully unemployed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143831X11402238">Kjeldstad, 2009</xref>). Added to the analogously converted labour reserve represented by the fully unemployed, the unused labour supply matches almost perfectly the number of registered vacant jobs in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143831X11402238">Kjeldstad, 2009</xref>). However, the jobs and job-seekers are not necessarily easily matched. In Norway one obstacle is a persistent and strongly gender-segregated labour market.</p>

<title>Underemployment at the micro level: Earlier studies</title>
<p>Part-time work, especially female part-time, has been subject to a plethora of research, both in Norway and internationally. Many of these analyses have put an emphasis on part-time from a non-standard- or precarious work perspective. However, only a few analyses focusing mainly on underemployment have been carried out. Among the exceptions are studies in the US, where involuntary part-time has been a political and analytical concern for several decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143831X11402238">Larson and Ong, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143831X11402238">Stratton, 1996</xref>). During recent years, part-timers’ satisfaction with their hours has been discussed, e.g. by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0143831X11402238">Reynolds (2003)</xref>, pointing to the importance of getting to grip with the various aspects of working-hour mismatch, i.e. for both the overworked and the ‘underworked’; while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0143831X11402238">Warren (2008)</xref> has shown great national differences in working-hours contentment and economic well-being among part-timers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143831X11402238">Flynn (2003)</xref> finds that contextual and local opportunity factors significantly affect labour market marginalization including involuntary part-time, especially for women. In a comparative analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143831X11402238">Gash (2008)</xref> links differences in part-time workers’ transition to full-time in Denmark, France and the UK to differences in policies supporting maternal employment, and concludes that women in the UK are more ‘constrained’ to part-time, whereas Danish and French policies to a large degree enable women to work their preferred hours. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0143831X11402238">Stratton (1994</xref>, 1996) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143831X11402238">Bollé (1997)</xref> have investigated whether involuntary part-time implies a ‘trap’, or a stepping stone towards longer hours. The former finds a significantly higher transition rate into full-time among the involuntary than among the voluntary part-timers, whereas the latter author maintains that involuntary part-time conceals unemployment, and thus may prevent the underemployed from registering as job-seekers.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, there has been an increasing concern in the Nordic region about involuntary part-time and underemployment during recent years. An official Swedish investigation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0143831X11402238">SOU 1999</xref>:27, was followed up by the so-called HELA project, initiated in 2002, resulting in a series of publications on underemployment and part-time unemployment. These analyses account for the many various definitions and uses of the relevant concepts in national and international statistical sources, and illustrate the many obstacles and problems facing attempts to undertake international comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143831X11402238">Forssell and Jonsson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143831X11402238">Nyberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143831X11402238">Ottosson and Lundequist, 2005</xref>). Some efforts at Nordic and European comparisons have been made, however, including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143831X11402238">Virjo (2006)</xref> and the Fourth European Working Condition Survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143831X11402238">Parent-Thirion et al., 2007</xref>). The general picture these comparisons show is that the Nordic countries, with the exception of Finland (and Iceland, which is rarely included in these studies), have a rather high part-time level as compared to most European countries, with Norway on top and Denmark at the bottom of the three ‘high-level’ countries. In all countries, women outnumber men, and the under-24s by far outnumber other age groups – the latter data reflecting that a great many Nordic part-time workers combine part-time work with education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143831X11402238">Kauhanen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143831X11402238">Kjeldstad, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143831X11402238">Lind and Rasmussen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143831X11402238">Nyberg, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143831X11402238">Lind and Rasmussen (2008)</xref> even ‘go so far’ as to predict the cessation of Nordic part-time work for non-students. As regards involuntary part-time, the top part-time country, Norway, with a share of 28 percent of the employed working part-time in 2005, has the lowest proportion of involuntary part-timers: 13 percent of the part-timers. Finland, with the lowest part-time level, has the highest involuntary proportion, comprising 13 percent of the employed and 29 percent of the part-time employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143831X11402238">Virjo, 2006</xref>). As mentioned in the introduction, there seems to be a negative correlation between the part-time and involuntary part-time proportions at country level. This may reflect national and local gender and employment cultures, in the sense that gender equality and breadwinner norms vary geographically.</p>
<p>Norwegian and Nordic studies specifically focusing on the relationship between labour market and job characteristics, on the one hand, and underemployment, on the other hand, are few. As regards micro-level analyses from a gender perspective, the literature is even more restricted. Nevertheless, although the focus of the analyses noted above varies, the general impression is that involuntary part-time should be regarded as mainly employer driven, i.e. employers adapting working hours to what is perceived most suitable for the company rather than to the workers’ preferences. Hence, Nordic involuntary part-time is mainly viewed as a type of hidden unemployment. Hidden since part-timers wanting (and seeking) more work are generally less systematically registered than the (fully) unemployed. An increase or decrease in involuntary part-time should, then, be interpreted more as a change of full-time or longer part-time job openings, than as shifting characteristics or preferences for longer hours among the part-time employed. Changes in such labour demand may, however, stem from different processes, either temporary or permanent partial redundancy, or variation among workplaces as regards the organization of working hours and working-hour rotation. In the former case, the employees are partly pushed out of full-time jobs and into part-time, mostly by the firm experiencing economic problems and a need for staff reduction. In periods of economic expansion most of these firms open up to full-time appointments again. In the latter case, the employees work part-time because they are excluded from a contract with longer hours or full-time. They hold regular part-time jobs that cannot as a rule lead into full-time jobs, and, as a rule, employees who want to increase their working hours will have to change jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143831X11402238">Millar et al., 2006</xref>). Both groups are underemployed, the former may however, be called <italic>partly expelled</italic>, whereas the latter may be called <italic>partly excluded</italic>. The former as a rule have the rights to wage compensation from the state according to Norwegian social security rules, whereas the latter as a rule hold no such rights (see note <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0143831X11402238">1</xref>).</p>
<p>Part-time and underemployment spells vary among countries and between women and men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143831X11402238">O’Reilly and Bothfeld, 2002</xref>). On average, Nordic underemployment spells are relatively short. In Norway by the turn of the century, half of the underemployed were underemployed for fewer than three months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143831X11402238">Fevang et al., 2004</xref>). A Swedish study from the same period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143831X11402238">Ottosson and Lundequist, 2005</xref>) came to almost identical conclusions. Both studies reveal, however, significant differences between women and men and between labour market sectors and occupations. The longest duration is found among women and in female-dominated sectors with high proportions of part-time employed and underemployed. The shortest duration is found within manufacturing and construction work. Most of these industries are more exposed to changing business cycles than most female-dominated industries. In a relatively stable economy like the Norwegian, then, the partly expelled on average most probably experience shorter underemployment periods than the partly excluded. This is not only due to their higher ‘risk’ of transition to full-time employment. The partly expelled are also more exposed to full-time unemployment.</p>
<p>In-depth Norwegian and Nordic studies of underemployment have predominantly been limited to analyses of particular labour market sectors, occupations and institutions, mainly in the care and service sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143831X11402238">Abrahamsen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143831X11402238">Amble, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143831X11402238">Kauhanen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143831X11402238">Moland and Gautun, 2002</xref>). This is no surprise, as the bulk of the underemployed are found here, and this is where political attention has been focused (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143831X11402238">NOU, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0143831X11402238">SOU, 1999</xref>). We know that the Norwegian, like the other Nordic labour markets, is strongly gender segregated (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143831X11402238">Table 1</xref>), and also compared to the most ‘comparable’ countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143831X11402238">Anker, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143831X11402238">Charles, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143831X11402238">Melkas and Anker, 1998</xref>). Earlier analyses of Labour Force Survey data imply that whereas job characteristics and demand-side factors outstrip individual and household factors in explaining involuntary part-time work, the two sets of factors display somewhat equal capacities to explain the general part-time level. The picture is roughly the same for women and men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143831X11402238">Kjeldstad, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143831X11402238">Kjeldstad and Nymoen, 2009</xref>). Individual characteristics have in earlier studies shown to have a somewhat diverse impact on voluntary and involuntary part-time, and on part-time vs full-time work among women and men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143831X11402238">Kjeldstad, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143831X11402238">Kjeldstad and Nymoen, 2004</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-0143831X11402238">
<title>Hypotheses</title>
<p>As a point of departure for our analysis, we focus on the two (tentative) conclusions from our macro-description: namely (1) the fact that women outnumber men significantly and permanently among the underemployed; and (2) the fact that changes of labour demand affect women’s and men’s underemployment much alike, or, put another way, the fact that gender differences in underemployment appear not to be significantly affected by changing business cycles and labour demand.</p>
<p>We assume that whereas women work involuntary part-time mainly as a consequence of being excluded from longer hour contracts in female-dominated jobs, men work involuntary part-time predominantly due to part-time expulsion from male-dominated jobs. Thus, after controlling for shifting labour demand, we expect to find a certain increase in the ‘effect of gender’ on underemployment, and after controlling for job characteristics, we expect to find a reduced such effect. Finally, we control for the effects of local gender equality ‘regimes’ and the individual and family characteristics of women and men.</p>
<p>Of the three groups of independent variables, labour demand, job characteristics and individual and background control variables, we hypothesize the labour demand variables to be the most important in explaining both women’s and men’s involuntary part-time; this as a consequence of the general picture of a significant and rather uniform development of male and female underemployment across changing economic fluctuations. We hypothesize also a strong effect of job characteristics on the underemployment of both women and men. The latter, however is, presumed to be somewhat stronger for women, and the former is presumed to be somewhat stronger for men.</p>
<p>To sum up and define the problems to be analysed, we put forward the following hypotheses:</p>
<list id="list1-0143831X11402238" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>H1</italic>: The fact that Norwegian women are more frequently underemployed than men is mainly due to the gender-segregated labour market and the fact that most female-dominated jobs are organized on a predominantly part-time basis with few openings for longer contracts and full-time employment.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>H2</italic>: Also due to the gender-segregated labour market, changes in economic cycles and general labour demand affect men’s underemployment more than women’s. This is caused by many of the most male-dominated jobs and industries being particularly vulnerable to economic cycles and changing labour demand.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>H3</italic>: Still, in Norway, as indicated by the descriptive statistics, the gender differences in underemployment to a large extent withstand cyclical changes and changes in labour demand. Accordingly, labour demand characteristics and labour demand changes are core explanatory factors of both women’s and men’s underemployment.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>H4</italic>: Labour market and job characteristics are more important driving forces behind underemployment than are individual and family characteristics. This relates to both sexes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>H5</italic>: We assume that including individual and family characteristics and local gender equality ‘culture’ in the models adds more to the explanation of women’s than to the explanation of men’s underemployment.</p></list-item>

<title>Data and method</title>
<sec id="section6-0143831X11402238">
<title>Sample selection</title>
<p>The regression analysis is based on data from the Norwegian Labour Force Survey (LFS) 2005, linked with registry data on education, demographic characteristics and industry. The LFS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143831X11402238">Bø and Håland, 2002</xref>) are quarterly surveys covering a representative gross sample of about 24,000 persons aged 16–74 years, randomly selected on the basis of a register of family units. Each respondent participates eight times during a period of eight subsequent quarters. In the pooled 2005 surveys the total non-response was 11 percent. About 14 percent of the interviews are indirect (i.e. given by a close family member). These are excluded from our analysis since questions about preferred working hours are not asked indirectly. Persons participating one to four times in the 2005 LFS are included randomly only once in this study, covering exclusively salaried employees and wage earners under the age of 66 and above the age of 20 with at least one weekly hour of work. Due to partly self-determined and divergent working-hour patterns, we excluded the self-employed and employees in agricultural, fishing, forestry, military and unspecified occupations. This leaves a total sample of 18,381 persons. The definitions of the employed and part-time employed included in the multivariate analysis are in accordance with Norwegian official statistics (see note to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143831X11402238">Figure 1</xref>). The definition of the underemployed, however, differs slightly from the official definition used in the previous descriptive analysis (see note to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0143831X11402238">Figure 2</xref>), as the criteria of the employee having tried to get, and being able to work, longer working hours within a month, are not included. This is mainly justified by the sample size, and the dissimilarity is assumed to be of little significance when comparing the descriptive and regression results. This leaves us with a sample of 1222 underemployed who are contrasted to ‘all other’ employed wage earners (17,159).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0143831X11402238">
<title>Independent variables</title>
<p>The logistic regression models include two groups of independent variables plus sex (where relevant) in addition to a group of control variables (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0143831X11402238">Table 2</xref>). The first group of independent variables – quarter of the year and local unemployment rate – constitute proxies for seasonal and local labour demand. The first quarter covers January through March; the second quarter covers April through June, etc. The local unemployment rate is made tripartite according to registered average unemployment rates in 2005 at the municipal level, i.e. 0–2.9, 3–3.9 and 4+ percent respectively of the labour force. The second group of independent variables represents various characteristics of the employee’s job affiliation. Sector reflects company ownership and is classified by three categories: (1) private single-owners and private shareowners, (2) national government owned and (3) regional and local government owned. Classification by type of industry is in accordance with the revised Standard Industrial Classification (NACE Rev.1), and the classification of occupation is in accordance with Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-88 (COM)). We apply the first of four digits. Categorization of company/local unit size by number of employees includes three groups, i.e. 1–10, 11–99 and 100+ employees respectively, whereas work contract is a dichotomous variable, classifying whether the employee has a permanent or a temporary work contract.</p>

<p>The control variables include an index of gender equality at the municipal level, developed by Statistics Norway and measuring the relative local gender equality ‘culture’ of Norwegian municipalities. It covers, among other factors, publicly owned or subsidized childcare coverage in the municipality, individual income, and labour market and political participation; the latter three are measured both as women’s absolute and women’s relatively to men’s levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0143831X11402238">Kjeldstad and Kristiansen, 2001</xref>). The index is entered into the regression models with four values, reflecting each municipality’s relative score. Age is registered at the end of the calendar year. All respondents are classified by marital status, i.e. unmarried, married, previously married, or cohabiter. Child age reflects age of youngest biological or adopted child, where zero children refers to persons without children or with children older than 16. Highest completed education is based on the Norwegian Standard Classification of Education at the following levels: (1) primary (compulsory) education, (2) secondary education and (3) university or college education. Citizenship in this study is classified as either Norwegian, or as citizen of other western countries or of non-western countries.</p>

<title>Regression models</title>
<p>We have defined five logistic regression models including both sexes and four models for each of the sexes separately. Model 1 includes only sex as independent variable. Model 2 includes (sex and) labour demand variables; Model 3 includes (sex and) job characteristics variables; Model 4 includes only (sex and) the control variables; and finally, Model 5 comprises (sex and) all independent and control variables included in the analysis. The odds ratio estimates of underemployment are calculated relatively to all other employed.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0143831X11402238">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>The regression models including all salaried employees show that the unconditional probability of women being underemployed is four times that of men. Still, although sex is a crucial factor, including only sex as an independent variable implies but a weak model adjustment (Model 1: <italic>r<sub>*</sub><sup>2</sup></italic> = .05). As expected then (Hypotheses 1 and 2), the gender differences in underemployment should not be regarded in terms of gender roles or gendered preferences and choices per se, but rather as a result of gender differences in participation in various segments and sectors of the labour market (see below).</p>
<p>The next step, adding labour demand variables, i.e. quarter of the year and local unemployment rate, among the independent variables does not increase the model strength (Model 2: <italic>r<sub>*</sub><sup>2</sup></italic> = .05). Nor does it result in an expected increased ‘gender effect’. This seems contradictory to the hypothesis that labour demand affects underemployment significantly (Hypothesis 3), and appears somewhat surprising according to the descriptive analysis of shifting unemployment levels across time. Separate models for women and men do however, as expected, reveal a somewhat more significant effect of labour demand on the underemployment of men than of women. Whereas women are hardly affected, spring months bring along reduced underemployment risk, and high local unemployment rate implies high underemployment risk, for men. This corroborates Hypothesis 2, although the effects are moderate. The seemingly contrasting picture of similar cyclical underemployment patterns of women and men, on the one hand, and women and men’s different ‘response’ to changing local labour demand, on the other, indicates however that male underemployment is primarily a local phenomenon in times of labour redundancy whereas female underemployment is a more countrywide phenomenon. This may be due to certain characteristics of the Norwegian gender-segregated labour market reflecting that traditional, economically exposed male workplaces are to a large extent situated in small communities, and that most female-dominated (service and care jobs) jobs are geographically widespread.</p>
<p>Including job characteristics in the regression analysis increases the model adjustments significantly (Model 3: <italic>r<sub>*</sub><sup>2</sup></italic> = .17, .21 and .10) and halves the gender difference. All five job characteristic variables affect the underemployment probability significantly, however, quite surprisingly, more so for men than for women. Occupation and type of work contract are by far the most important job characteristic. Holding a female-dominated occupation (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143831X11402238">Table 1</xref>), such as cleaning (elementary), sales/service/care or desk jobs(clerks), implies particularly significant probabilities of underemployment; respectively ten, seven and five times the probability of employees in professional occupations. The picture is much the same for women and men, however with more significant effects for men. At the same time, holding a temporary work contract increases the probability 3.5 times on the average as compared to having a permanent work contract, five times for men and three times for women. Among the other job characteristic variables, a job in the (female-dominated, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143831X11402238">Table 1</xref>) municipal sector increases the probability 50 percent as compared to the private sector, the increase is significant only for women. Holding a (male-dominated, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143831X11402238">Table 1</xref>) manufacturing job decreases the probability a total of 50 percent on average as compared to sales and service, mostly for men. Finally, working in a big company with more than 100 employees, decreases the probability of underemployment 30 percent as compared to a small company, this relates mainly to women.</p>
<p>Including contextual, individual and family control variables brings about only slightly increased model adjustment. This by and large corroborates Hypothesis 4, as the effects of job characteristics are far more significant. On the other hand, Hypothesis 5, assuming more significant effects on average of the control variables for women than for men, is not supported by the findings. The analysis does, however, corroborate the expected gendered effects of the control variables, revealed by the increased significance of sex as an explanatory variable in Model 4 as compared to the other models in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0143831X11402238">Table 2</xref>. As expected, the local gender equality context reduces the effect of gender differences, as a high gender equality score implies somewhat increased underemployment probability for men, and decreased for women. No surprise also, early adulthood increases, whereas high education decreases, the underemployment risk of both sexes. Marital status has no significant effect on women’s underemployment, whereas being married or cohabiting decreases the probability for men. As expected, this gender-dissimilar pattern appears also with regard to children, since the probability of underemployment increases with age of children only for women. Being a non-western citizen increases the probability strongly, mainly for men.</p>

<title>Conclusion and discussion</title>
<p>The analysis shows that, albeit not identical for women and men, the driving forces of underemployment are mainly to be found in the labour market characteristics and in women’s and men’s job affiliation, and much less in individual and gender differences in background characteristics, life and family circumstances and working-hour preferences. Hence, when employed in the same labour market sector and same type of job, the gender difference in the probability of underemployment is significantly reduced.</p>
<p>Turning to our five hypotheses: first, the results corroborate Hypothesis 1, as the strongest probability of underemployment occurs in female-dominated jobs and labour market sectors. Quite surprisingly, however, we found that this probability is even higher for men than for women. This holds true also after controlling for general labour demand and contextual, individual and family characteristics. Hence, the problems of getting and holding longer hours or full-time work contracts in Norway is attributed to the organizational and cultural conditions mainly of the female labour market segment rather than to economic fluctuations or personal conditions and characteristics. Most probably the employee, whether woman or man, will have to seek another type of job to achieve her or his preferred working-hour contract. The findings give support also to Hypothesis 2 as the included proxies of general labour demand affect the underemployment of men more than that of women. To be sure, the estimated effects are rather modest, and weaker than anticipated. This applies particularly to Hypothesis 3, where we expected labour demand characteristics to be core explanatory factors of both women’s and men’s underemployment. The unforeseen results as regards Hypotheses 2 and 3 may be due to the relative insignificant local and seasonal variance of Norwegian labour demand in the actual year (2005). We acknowledge, however, that the relatively low significance of labour demand factors in the regression analysis may also be due to the possible weak validity of the chosen proxies. It might be argued that Hypotheses 2 and 3 can only to a limited extent be tested by data from one single year (2005). Accordingly, the analysis is hardly fit for rejecting entirely the importance of labour demand as regards the shifts and the distribution of involuntary part-time work.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 4 is by and large corroborated by the findings, as job characteristics affect underemployment more significantly than most characteristics denoting control variables in the analysis. The conclusion should, however, be slightly moderated since the effects of general labour demand appear somewhat insignificant. Finally, the assumption that the control variables add more to the explanation of women’s than of men’s involuntary part-time work (Hypothesis 5) does not hold good. Contextual, individual and family conditions appear not to be more crucial to women than to men. Instead, these conditions affect women and men differently. Increased local gender-equal culture correlates with increased underemployment among men and decreased underemployment among women. Also marital status and children have a predominantly opposite effect on women and men. And as shown by the complete models (Model 5), the significance of citizenship applies only to men. Finally, the logistic regression analysis displays somewhat better model adjustments for men than for women. This is maybe not as surprising as it appears, as part-time work, both voluntary and involuntary, is more widespread and, as it seems, tied to a more complex conglomerate of social, economic and individual conditions for women than for men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143831X11402238">Kjeldstad, 2006</xref>). Part-time work in general and involuntary part-time in particular, is a more marginal phenomenon, and hence, easier to identify for men than for women.</p>
<p>The analysis indicates somewhat dissimilar causes and processes behind women’s and men’s underemployment. Economic fluctuations bring about changing underemployment levels of both women and men, but the fact that the Norwegian labour market is strongly gender segregated, and the fact that the way into underemployment differs between female- and male-dominated sectors, implies that the processes both into and out of underemployment differ between the two sexes. Whereas underemployed men are predominantly temporarily expelled on a part-time basis from their jobs, women are more often permanently excluded from longer working-hour contracts in their jobs. The former type of jobs is generally more exposed or sensitive to economic fluctuations than the latter, which as a rule are less, or only indirectly, sensitive to economic fluctuations. Within the female-dominated labour market sectors, the causes of underemployment are above all attached to the working-hour culture and persistent part-time work organizations.</p>
<p>At the individual level, those who are temporarily part-time expelled (read: men) are as a rule entitled to income compensation by the welfare state, whereas those part-time excluded (read: women) as a rule have no such rights. This is attributed to the Norwegian social security regulations allowing compensation only to the part-time employed who have lost former full-time wage earnings (see note <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0143831X11402238">1</xref>). Also, as Norwegian periods of recession have been relatively short during recent decades, the part-time expelled experience underemployment for a significantly shorter period than do the part-time excluded. This of course holds true only if the part-time excluded do not seek and obtain jobs in less female-dominated labour market sectors. In a persistently gender-segregated labour market, however, such gender transition processes are slow and relatively marginal. Hence, gender differences in underemployment probability and underemployment structure persist. One can ask whether reduced female predominance among the underemployed presupposes economic recession – and stronger recession than we have witnessed in Norway during recent decades. To answer this question and to explore further some of the hypotheses and findings made in this article, we recommend future research to apply a panel data approach. Nevertheless, as shown in this article, until the current global recession there have been no significant changes in the gender distribution of the underemployed in Norway. This is most probably due to the persistent gender-structured and -segregated labour market <italic>and</italic> to the relatively mild recession periods experienced in Norway during the time period studied.</p>

<p>In this article we use the terms <italic>underemployment, part-time unemployment</italic> and <italic>involuntary part-time</italic> synonymously. This is plausible, and also customary in Norwegian official statistics and reviews, because only part-time employed are registered as underemployed (see note to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0143831X11402238">Figure 2</xref>). Various studies and national statistics on underemployment apply different concepts and definitions. With some exceptions (e.g. Sweden, cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143831X11402238">Jonsson and Nyberg, 2009</xref>) a common ‘denominator’ is part-time work where the employee wants longer working hours. It may vary, however, whether the employment is temporary or on a permanent basis. The same applies to the actual efforts to obtain more working hours. Registered, de facto working-hour estimates may also vary, depending on whether they are based on the individual’s work contract or her/his usual or actual working hours, and whether they are based on the individual holding one or several jobs. Moreover, estimates will reflect various national or conventional limits for the division between full-time and part-time work. Definitions and estimates may vary also according to what is assumed to be the cause of the underemployment, e.g. low or restricted labour demand or personal and family hindrances. Finally, the question whether the underemployed are to be seen as partially unemployed or not may reflect differences in welfare regulations, e.g. whether such mismatch between factual and desired working hours involves rights to (part-time) unemployment benefits. A basic requirement for the entitlement to (part-time) unemployment benefit is, in several countries including Norway, that the claimant has been deprived of (some of) the former work income of a certain amount due to (part-time) unemployment. According to Norwegian social security regulations, which have not been significantly altered during the period studied in this article, eligibility requirements to (part-time) unemployment benefits include that the preceding work hours have been reduced by at least 50 percent, and that the claimant is actively seeking/advertising for extended work hours. In the present analysis we take Statistics Norway’s official definition of underemployment (see note to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0143831X11402238">Figure 2</xref>) as a point of departure. When included in the regression analysis, however, the definition of underemployment deviates slightly, as we shall see, from the official definition.</p></fn>
