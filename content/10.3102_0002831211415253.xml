<abstract>
<p>Courts, students are told, will protect minorities’ legal rights against popular sentiment and political pressure. But courts can be expected to protect rights only within boundaries shaped in part by popular and political opinion. This suggests that litigation outcomes regarding education rights issues will depend on shifting the policymaking context through broad societal changes in perspective about the importance of equitable schooling. This dynamic of courts carrying out their limited countermajoritarian role within contextual constraints has substantial implications concerning the largely unrealized capacity of social science to affect judicial decision making. Accordingly, this article explores that dynamic and those implications, building on existing concepts from political science scholarship and introducing the concept of a zone of judicial constraints.</p>

<p>The cherished American myth of checks and balances tells us that the judiciary will prevent the tyranny of the majority. Our schoolchildren are taught, for instance, that if elected representatives overstep the U.S. Constitution, the federal courts have the responsibility and the duty to strike down the offending laws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0002831211415253"><italic>Marbury v. Madison</italic>, 1803</xref>). This is called <italic>judicial review</italic>, and it lies at the core of the so-called countermajoritarian role thought to be played by the courts: declaring laws and practices unconstitutional even when they are popular with most people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002831211415253">Bickel, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0002831211415253">Hamilton, 1788</xref>).</p>
<p>In the field of education rights, we celebrate watershed decisions like 1954’s <italic>Brown v. Board of Education</italic> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0002831211415253">1974</xref>’s <italic>Lau v. Nichols</italic>. Yet while most popular media accounts of Supreme Court jurisprudence accept these ideas of countermajoritarianism and judicial review, legal scholars have called them into serious question and have come to a general consensus that the Court is powerfully influenced by public opinion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002831211415253">Friedman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0002831211415253">Kramer, 2006</xref>):</p>

<p>Constitutional change occurs as public understandings of constitutional meaning and judicial interpretations of the Constitution interact with one another. The process is symbiotic . . . .[J]udicial meanings shift in response to changing public understandings, and judicial decisions provoke the public to consider what the Constitution ought to mean. Through this interaction, the Constitution changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002831211415253">Friedman, 2010</xref>, p. 1236; internal citations omitted).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Judges do not act in a vacuum. Their beliefs, and ultimately their decisions from the bench, are affected by time and place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002831211415253">Dimino, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002831211415253">Friedman, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002831211415253">2005</xref>; see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0002831211415253"><italic>Jonathan L. v. Superior Court</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0002831211415253"><italic>Korematsu v. United States</italic>, 1944</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0002831211415253">1</xref></sup> The same case arising alternatively in 1960 Alabama or 1970 San Francisco will encounter judges acting within very different contexts and constraints; judges, like almost all decision makers, tend to be affected by popular opinion as well as by the underlying factors that created that popular opinion.</p>
<p>This dynamic—of courts carrying out their limited countermajoritarian role within contextual constraints—has substantial implications for educational rights and for the potential role of social science research to affect judicial decision making. I explore that dynamic and those implications in this article, beginning with a brief discussion of the minimal impact that <italic>amicus curiae</italic> (friend of the court) briefs, and research in general, appear to have in education rights cases, including the recent <italic>Parents Involved in Community Schools</italic> [<italic>PICS</italic>] <italic>v. Seattle School District</italic> decision in 2007 concerning the constitutionality of school districts’ voluntary, race-conscious student-assignment policies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0002831211415253">Morgan &amp; Pullin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0002831211415253">Welner, 2006</xref>). I then describe how appellate-level<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0002831211415253">2</xref></sup> judicial decisions take place within a context that is constrained by law and precedent, but also affected by many of the same forces that shape purely political decisions – albeit through different mechanisms and in different ways. I illustrate the indefensibility of the comfortable belief that judges are insulated from outside forces and influences. To explore the role of context in judicial decision making, I introduce the concept of a <italic>zone of judicial constraints</italic>, similar to the zone of normative and political mediation that constrains other policy decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0002831211415253">Renee, Welner, &amp; Oakes, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0002831211415253">Welner, 2001</xref>). This zone framework is applied to the courts along with the concepts of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0002831211415253">Lessig, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0002831211415253">1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0002831211415253">1997</xref>) and new institutionalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002831211415253">Clayton &amp; Gillman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0002831211415253">Gerhardt, 2005</xref>; Gillman &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002831211415253">Clayton, 1999</xref>). Finally, I consider the implications of such a malleable zone of judicial decision making on how research can influence court decisions—a potential role that has been largely unrealized.</p>

<title>Research and Education Rights Litigation</title>
<p><italic>Amicus</italic> briefs that present appellate courts with social science arguments, as opposed to legal arguments, are generally known as <italic>Brandeis Briefs</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0002831211415253">Rosen, 1972</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0002831211415253">3</xref></sup> A large number of Brandeis Briefs were filed in the Supreme Court’s recent education rights cases by researchers and civil rights organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0002831211415253"><italic>Grutter v. Bollinger</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0002831211415253"><italic>Horne v. Flores</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0002831211415253"><italic>PICS</italic>, 2007</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0002831211415253">Linn &amp; Welner, 2007</xref>). The various decisions in these cases (majority, concurring, and dissenting) did in fact approvingly cite some of these briefs (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0002831211415253"><italic>Grutter</italic>, 2003</xref>, p. 330). However, causal inferences should be drawn with great caution; deducing the impact of social science research or Brandeis Briefs in a given case will always involve guesswork, since the Court’s deliberations and opinion writing take place secretively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0002831211415253">Woodward &amp; Armstrong, 1979</xref>). A citation of research may be little more than window dressing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0002831211415253">Lynch, 2004</xref>),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0002831211415253">4</xref></sup> and the lack of a citation may correspondingly be misleading: “Even if a Court opinion does not directly quote or reference an <italic>amicus</italic> brief, the brief still may influence the final decision” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0002831211415253">Lynch, 2004</xref>, p. 36; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002831211415253">Faigman, 1991</xref>, p. 550, “Even when the Court seems to ignore empirical research, this research often significantly influences the Court’s jurisprudence”).</p>
<p>The primary focus of this article is on the potential influence of research on changing decision-making contexts. But the more direct type of uncited influence suggested above should initially be noted. Empirical research can influence courts through “normative constitutional fact-finding,” acting as an important constraint on judges and “curbing constitutional discretion” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002831211415253">Faigman, 1991</xref>, p. 551). Even though the Supreme Court, for instance, may find ways to avoid “inconvenient empirical research,” this same research may force the Court “to attend to, and [to be] accountable for, the value judgments underlying its factual jurisprudence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002831211415253">Faigman, 1991</xref>, p. 551).</p>
<p>Whether or not this is fully a good thing is open to debate, since any given brief may present outdated or misleading research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0002831211415253">Linn &amp; Welner, 2007</xref>). The filing of <italic>amicus curiae</italic> briefs has also been criticized as having “Evolved from a mechanism for aiding the Court to a method of lobbying it” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0002831211415253">Rustad &amp; Koenig, 1993</xref>, p. 96; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0002831211415253">Epstein &amp; Knight, 1999</xref>). Yet the situation in the absence of these briefs was hardly ideal either. Even without the benefit of specific or reliable studies, courts have long made social science findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002831211415253">Faigman, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0002831211415253">Tomkins &amp; Oursland, 1991</xref>). Moreover, those findings have often been inconsistent with present-day thinking, particularly with regard to race. As detailed by Professor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0002831211415253">Hovenkamp (1985)</xref>, for instance, pre-<italic>Brown</italic> courts applied the racist prevailing scientific theories of their time. These findings arose from the “ ‘background’ scientific information that formed part of a judge’s perception of the world” (p. 628-629). “Social science and the law have been intertwined longer, in more pernicious ways, than is generally credited” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0002831211415253">Tomkins &amp; Oursland, 1991</xref>, p. 114).</p>
<p>Given the contrast between <italic>Brown</italic> and these earlier, racist decisions, most 21st century readers have a positive view of the Warren Court’s famous social science citation in footnote 11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0002831211415253"><italic>Brown</italic>, 1954</xref>, p. 494, n. 11). The Court presented the Clark doll study, as well as several other studies, as support for the conclusion that racial segregation has harmful psychological effects. But commentators have convincingly argued that the social science itself had no real persuasive effect on the Court—that it was not crucial to the <italic>Brown</italic> decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002831211415253">Bork, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002831211415253">Friedman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0002831211415253">Lindman, 1989</xref>). In fact, Chief Justice Warren wondered about all the fuss, pointing out that “It was only a footnote” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0002831211415253">Kluger, 1975</xref>, p. 706). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0002831211415253">Mody (2002)</xref> offers the explanation that the Court, “anxious about its institutional standing, impulsively embraced social science to lend authority to its highly controversial verdict based on the revolutionary, and inherently destabilizing, theory of a living Constitution” (p. 828).</p>
<p>Yet understanding the limited impact of social science goes well beyond a rethinking of <italic>Brown’s</italic> footnote 11. James <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0002831211415253">Ryan (2003)</xref> examines the record since that time and concludes that social science research has consistently failed to play an influential role. His analysis details in particular the minimal effects that social science evidence tends to have in desegregation cases. He explains this, in part, as follows, “If judges perceive an issue as involving moral or philosophical judgments, as opposed to pragmatic or instrumental ones, they are less likely to rely heavily on social science evidence to resolve the issue, even if the legal standards allow for the consideration of such evidence and even if the evidence is fairly determinate” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0002831211415253">Ryan, 2003</xref>, pp. 1662-1663).</p>

<title>Precedent and Context</title>
<p>As suggested above, the nature of political decision making is different in Alabama than in California. Further, it was different in 1890 than in 1950 or 2010. If a school board in each of these times and places were asked to consider a policy about multicultural curriculum or corporal punishment—or even about school choice or standardized testing—the types of discussions and deliberations would differ, as would the likely outcomes. This is not a controversial point; scholarly analyses often expressly take these differences into account, since the “nature of policy influences will be specific to each time and place” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002831211415253">Blaikie &amp; Soussan, 2000</xref>, p. 13; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0002831211415253">Marshall, Mitchell, &amp; Wirt, 1986</xref>). Moreover, the role of context described here is not generally considered to be problematic. There is, after all, nothing unseemly about policymaking by democratically elected representatives responding to the wishes of their constituents.</p>
<p>When the focus shifts to decisions of judges, however, people tend to expect an impartiality that fairly interprets and applies the law without regard to popular wishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0002831211415253">Larkin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0002831211415253">O’Hara, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0002831211415253">Scalia, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0002831211415253"><italic>Republican Party of Minnesota v. White</italic>, 2002</xref>, O’Connor J. concurring). Judges, we are told, “‘shall not be swayed by partisan interests, public clamor, or fear of criticism’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0002831211415253"><italic>In re Kinsey</italic>, 2003</xref>, p. 89).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0002831211415253">5</xref></sup> Yet this expectation or admonition is unrealistic and is also arguably in tension with the wishes of the nation’s founders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0002831211415253">Natelson, 2002/2003</xref>). Political science and legal scholarship have extensively documented the reality that judges are indeed swayed by public opinion and other extra-courtroom influences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002831211415253">Balkin &amp; Siegel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002831211415253">Dahl, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002831211415253">Friedman, 2009</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002831211415253">Dimino, 2006</xref>, and the authorities cited in his footnote 105). Appellate decisions are made within a context that is constrained by precedent but also affected by many of the same forces that shape political decisions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002831211415253">Faigman, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0002831211415253">Moran, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>This key role played by context becomes apparent when each judicial deliberation is understood as taking place within a zone of judicial constraints, as described in the next section.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0002831211415253">
<title>Zone of Judicial Constraints</title>
<p>The zone framework helps explain how forces shape the environment surrounding a potential policy decision. Each policy decision, explains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0002831211415253">Welner (2001)</xref>:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Proceeds within a unique context. This context [the zone] is shaped by a myriad of forces. When forces are added, subtracted, strengthened or weakened, the zone shifts. With each shift, the zone becomes more receptive or more hostile to the [policy option] (p. 223).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Policy decision processes involve battles over “contextual turf” (p. 223). The zone framework thus focuses attention on the forces that continually shape and reshape the context for decision making.</p>
<p>The concept of a zone of judicial constraints also helps to explain why social science <italic>amicus</italic> briefs tend to have little influence on appellate court decisions. Each brief is simply one force that shapes the zone surrounding the decision, added to a myriad of existing and new forces, including a judge’s own values and beliefs. For this reason, the research presented in such a brief, if it is to have an impact, is most effective if it is heard and considered long before the brief itself is filed.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>No one can absorb new information and change his or her mind in the time that it takes to read a brief. Instead, the ideas expressed in a brief must already exist in the public consciousness so that they are absorbed and available to the judge at the time of decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0002831211415253">Moran, 2005</xref>, p. 244).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Judges and courts exist within a larger legal and political system, as well as within larger society; judicial decision making might therefore be indirectly shaped by scholarly research to the extent that this research penetrates those larger discussions. That is, research is a force that can be felt by appellate-level judges both directly and indirectly. Directly, research can help shape judicial decision making through expert testimony offered at the trial level of a given case and through Brandeis Briefs filed with the appellate court. Indirectly, research can be felt by courts through politics, press, and ultimately through a change in values, beliefs and the societal zeitgeist. Courts are thus situated within particular temporal and sometimes spatial enactments of larger cultural norms, rules, incentives, power relations, and values. Such forces set the parameters of acceptable beliefs and decision making. A court decision is constrained by more than precedent and the facts and testimony of the particular case. It is also shaped by factors such as economy, history, social attitudes, and national security concerns. (For a discussion of how this latter factor played out for the recent <italic>habeas corpus</italic> Supreme Court cases in the context of the so-called war on terror, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0002831211415253">Fallon, 2010</xref>.)</p>
<p>An outside force such as a social movement or a major research study may influence, to varying degrees, the way that Supreme Court Justices and clerks perceive a policy being litigated as well as the way they discuss that policy among themselves. Ultimately, these forces help to shape the Justices’ views of appropriate and feasible applications of precedent to a given case. These external factors influence beliefs and ideas both inside and outside the Court, joining a myriad of other forces as they shape and reshape the zone of judicial constraints.</p>
<p>Prominent examples are not hard to identify. Speaking of the <italic>Grutter</italic> decision in 2003, which upheld the University of Michigan Law School’s affirmative action program, Robert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0002831211415253">Post (2003)</xref> notes that “The opinion plainly derives its understanding of [constitutional] requirements in part from the constitutional beliefs and values of nonjudicial actors” (p. 10). Furthermore, Post notes:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[T]he Court candidly supports its analysis by referring to the judgment of professional educators that “diversity promotes learning outcomes”; to the judgment of “major American businesses . . . that the skills needed in today’s increasingly global marketplace can only be developed through exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints”; and to the judgment of “high-ranking retired officers and civilian leaders of the United States military” that a “highly qualified, racially diverse officer corps … is essential to the military’s ability to fulfill its principal mission to provide national security.” There is no doubt that <italic>Grutter</italic> interprets the Constitution in light of the beliefs of those whom Justice Thomas in dissent disparagingly calls “the cognoscenti” (pp. 65-66, internal citations omitted).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Consider also an example from outside the education realm: the Court’s two “sodomy” cases of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0002831211415253"><italic>Bowers v. Hardwick</italic> (1986)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0002831211415253"><italic>Lawrence v. Texas</italic> (2003)</xref>, less than two decades apart. In <italic>Bowers</italic>, the Court upheld a law in Georgia that was used against gay men to criminalize certain sexual behavior; in <italic>Lawrence</italic>, the Court struck down a similar law from Texas. Although the Court had, by most standards, become more conservative during the intervening years, societal biases against gay individuals and the gay community had eased. Reflecting that change, Justice Kennedy’s opinion in <italic>Lawrence</italic> rejected the bigoted language and reasoning used by the earlier Court, embracing instead Justice Stevens’ <italic>Bowers</italic> dissent. Justice O’Connor, who sided with the majority in both those cases (meaning that she essentially switched her vote), noted in a book published the same year as the <italic>Lawrence</italic> decision that courts “are mainly reactive institutions” and that substantial legal change “stems principally from attitudinal shifts in the population at large. Rare indeed is the legal victory . . . that is not a careful by-product of an emerging social consensus” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0002831211415253">O’Connor, 2003</xref>, p. 166).</p>

<p>A transformation similar to <italic>Bowers</italic>/<italic>Lawrence</italic> took place between the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0002831211415253"><italic>Plessy v.

The context of the <italic>Brown</italic> decision included the larger civil rights struggle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0002831211415253">Patterson, 2001</xref>) and the need to counter Soviet propaganda concerning racial inequality in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002831211415253">Dudziak, 1988</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0002831211415253">Post (2003)</xref> explains:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We need to recall that the Court came to regard racial “antipathy” . . . as inconsistent with the Equal Protection Clause not because of changes in the text of the Fourteenth Amendment, nor because of changes in the intent of the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment, but because American constitutional culture evolved in such a way as to render these practices intolerable (p. 52).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>But perhaps more edifying than <italic>Brown</italic> itself is the series of cases orchestrated by lawyers for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) leading up to the <italic>Brown</italic> decision: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0002831211415253"><italic>Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada</italic> (1938)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0002831211415253"><italic>Sipuel v.

In these cases, the plaintiffs alleged that their equal-protection rights were violated because the “separate but equal” facilities and opportunities were, in fact, inferior. In each case, the Court retained the <italic>Plessy</italic> separate-but-equal formulation, merely chipping away at its reach while handing technical victories to the plaintiffs (i.e., finding that the defendants needed to do a better job providing equal facilities and opportunities). Eventually, the zone of judicial constraints became sufficiently hospitable for <italic>Plessy’s</italic> core tenet to be overruled (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0002831211415253">Patterson, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Desegregation decisions subsequent to <italic>Brown</italic> are also instructive. Beginning with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0002831211415253"><italic>Milliken v. Bradley</italic> (1974)</xref>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0002831211415253">7</xref></sup> the Supreme Court backed away from its earlier strong commitment to desegregated schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0002831211415253">Welner, Biegel, &amp; Jackson, 2010</xref>). This process began in earnest with Richard Nixon, his “southern strategy,” and the shifting of the federal judiciary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002831211415253">Brown, 2004</xref>). The Nixon and Reagan appointees to the U.S. Supreme Court, along with later appointees of George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush, overwhelmingly opposed desegregation remedies. Their decisions first limited the desegregative reach of the federal courts, then allowed school districts to exit from desegregation orders even though their schools were still racially segregated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0002831211415253"><italic>Board of Education v. Dowell</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002831211415253"><italic>Freeman v. Pitts</italic>, 1992</xref>),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0002831211415253">8</xref></sup> and finally prevented school districts from voluntarily taking individual students’ race into account as a way to avoid further <italic>de facto</italic> segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0002831211415253"><italic>PICS</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>While in considering these decisions one might focus on the justices themselves, or perhaps on the presidents who appointed them, a key role was also played by voters—through electing these presidents and other policy makers. Indirectly, these voters changed the direction of the Court and the nature of desegregation policy. That is, just as the Court was influenced by the changing context during the 1940s and 1950s, it was again influenced by the voter backlash that began in 1954 in the south and continued as desegregation remedies worked their way north into places like Boston. This more recent shift, however, followed from a clear political process; politicians ran in opposition to desegregation and busing, got elected, and then appointed and confirmed anti-desegregation judges and justices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002831211415253">Brown, 2004</xref>). Underlying that voter push were factors such as normative (racist) beliefs, fears (tied to racism as well as economic pressures), and self-interest (wanting to preserve resources and opportunities for one’s own family and community, preferring a neighborhood school to a school a bus-ride away, or wanting to preserve the value of one’s house). In addition, while white students may have subsequently realized the benefits of attending an integrated school (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0002831211415253">Wells, Holme, Revilla, &amp; Atanda, 2009</xref>), relatively few white parents at the time believed that mandated desegregation would benefit their children (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002831211415253">Caldas &amp; Bankston, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002831211415253">Clotfelter, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The final stage of this process saw the Court tying the hands of integration-minded school district leadership wishing to implement a school choice policy that takes race into account. Some districts not under court orders to desegregate had adopted race-conscious “controlled choice” plans intended to mitigate the segregation that can result from residential segregation and parental choice. Majority parents in two of these districts, Seattle and Louisville, challenged the constitutionality of the plans. A heavily divided Supreme Court found that the racial classifications were not narrowly tailored to achieve any educational and social benefits associated with racial diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0002831211415253"><italic>PICS</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, while the <italic>Milliken</italic> decision foreclosed key court remedies to the emerging patterns of <italic>de facto</italic> urban-suburban segregation, the <italic>PICS</italic> decision limited effective political remedies to such segregation. These were the bookends of the Court’s response to the political backlash to <italic>Brown</italic>; the sentiment of the political majority formidably opposed court-ordered desegregation, and the Court’s decisions began to reflect that sentiment within two decades of its landmark desegregation decision.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0002831211415253">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>For those optimistic about the potential of education research to influence the nature or direction of Supreme Court decisions, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0002831211415253"><italic>PICS</italic> (2007)</xref> decision is a particularly disappointing one (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0002831211415253">Morgan &amp; Pullin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0002831211415253">Linn &amp; Welner, 2007</xref>). The plurality opinion dismissed—and generally ignored—a compelling body of research, presented in Brandeis Briefs, concerning the academic and social benefits of racially diverse schools. The zone framework helps to explain how this happened. The Court was certainly constrained by the evidence and issues in that case, as well as by prior precedent. Further, the outcome of the case was powerfully affected by the Court’s personnel, appointed by elected presidents and confirmed by elected senators. But the Court was also working within a zone of judicial constraints that was shaped by history—the nation’s history of racial discrimination and the history of white backlash to desegregation and affirmative action policies. The zone was shaped as well by deliberate campaigns and movements—the civil rights movement and a more recent concerted campaign by opponents of race-conscious policies. And it has been shaped by widespread policy belief over the past couple decades that school improvement will come about through increased school choice and standards-based accountability policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0002831211415253">Welner &amp; Oakes, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, the zone was shaped by prevailing views of color blindness, meritocracy, and individualism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0002831211415253">Welner &amp; Oakes, 2007</xref>). The plurality opinion by Chief Justice Roberts includes the encapsulating statement, “The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0002831211415253"><italic>PICS</italic>, 2007</xref>, p. 748). In short, notions of equal educational opportunity had been redefined, with the key constitutional affront being governmental consciousness of race, as opposed to the race-based disadvantage itself (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0002831211415253">Howe, 1997</xref>). Although the <italic>amicus</italic> briefs included a great deal of empirical evidence concerning the harms of racially isolated schooling, that evidence reached a Supreme Court that was already influenced by societal views and other factors that counseled against the constitutionality or desirability of the school districts’ race-conscious policies. (For a full discussion of the role or social science evidence in the <italic>PICS</italic> case, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0002831211415253">Morgan &amp; Pullin, 2010</xref>.)</p>
<p>The reality of <italic>bounded</italic> judicial review, whereby the Court will only exercise its countermajoritarian authority if the decision falls within the zone of judicial constraints, will strike many as irresponsibly evading the ideal judicial role, as described by Justice Hugo Black: “Under our constitutional system, courts stand against any winds that blow, as havens of refuge for those who might otherwise suffer because they are helpless, weak, outnumbered, or because they are the non-conforming victims of prejudice and public excitement” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0002831211415253"><italic>Chambers v. Florida</italic>, 1940</xref>, p. 241). When Black wrote this, he had been on the Court for only 3 years, and it was another 13 years before he was joined on the Court by Chief Justice Earl Warren. The Warren Court is generally perceived to have been the most engaged (some would say “activist”) with protecting the rights of political minorities—with implementing judicial review as Black described it in 1940. But courts as a rule tend to be more constrained. And the so-called Lochner era,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0002831211415253">10</xref></sup> when the Court struck down well over a hundred progressive legislative attempts to regulate business activities (e.g., child labor and minimum wage laws), offers an illustration of judicial review and countermajoritarianism coming from very different perspective than that shared by Black and Warren. Similarly, the Rehnquist Court and the current Roberts Court have been denounced for their pro-business activism, particularly as a result of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0002831211415253"><italic>Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</italic> (2010)</xref> decision, which granted First Amendment free speech protection to corporations’ independent spending on candidate elections (see the <italic>New York Times</italic> editorial, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002831211415253">“The Court’s Aggressive Term,” 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, judges unwilling to exercise meaningful judicial review might be thought of as “popular constitutionalists” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0002831211415253">Kramer, 2004</xref>). From this perspective, courts should interpret the constitution by simply following the will of the people. In truth, courts were highly connected to the political branches during the earlier years of the country, so “Popular constitutionalism came first and was dominant for most of American history—leaving the judiciary, like the political branches, subject to ultimate supervision by ‘the people themselves’ ” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0002831211415253">Kramer, 2004</xref>, p. 959). The electoral defeat, denial of reconfirmation, or recall of judges who hand down unpopular decisions fits nicely into this vision for the judiciary (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0002831211415253">Schulte, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0002831211415253">Wold &amp; Culver, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>Ultimately, however, the protections in the Bill of Rights and the 14th Amendment do depend on a judiciary engaged enough to move beyond a passive role that merely ratifies political decision making. Perhaps today’s courts have not found the right balance, but the reality is that context matters. While one cannot truthfully assert the paradox that courts will only exercise their countermajoritarian role if it is not in conflict with majority wishes, countermajoritarian judicial decisions are feasible only so long as they do not <italic>stray too far from</italic> the opinion of the political majority. When the popular and political focus on an issue is less intense, the zone’s boundaries are likely to be more forgiving, but they nonetheless continue to exist.</p>
<p>In sum, courts are largely conservative institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002831211415253">Clayton &amp; Gillman, 1999</xref>), and any countermajoritarianism takes place only within the zone— within limits. To change the probabilities of different decisions, one must actively shift the zone. The remainder of this article considers this possibility, with a particular focus on the role of academic research.</p>

<title>New Institutionalism</title>
<p>Scholars of judicial decision making, who are mostly grounded in political science theory and research, have offered a variety of explanations for the outcomes of litigation. Behaviorialism, applied at the level of individual judges, provided the initial and dominant perspective and the grounding for many years of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0002831211415253">Schubert, 1963</xref>). Next came attitudinal models that looked, for instance, to each judge’s set of values and beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0002831211415253">Segal &amp; Spaeth, 1993</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0002831211415253">Welner, 2001</xref>, Chapter 5, providing a case study illustrating the importance of judicial values). In response to these earlier theories, the so-called new institutionalists have refocused on contextual forces, even while continuing to acknowledge the importance of attitudinal factors (Gillman &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002831211415253">Clayton, 1999</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0002831211415253">11</xref></sup> To a large extent, these theorists look to intra-court factors—to the procedures and norms of operation that exist independently of court personnel. But they also focus on the larger political environment surrounding any given decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002831211415253">Clayton, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The basic idea of institutionalism is that the thinking of decision makers such as judges is affected by their institutional context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0002831211415253">Gerhardt, 2005</xref>). This context includes internal rules, such as <italic>stare decisis</italic> (respect for precedent), as well as external factors, such as political demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002831211415253">Clayton, 1999</xref>). Further, judges are seen as not simply tempering their attitudinal preference to fit a changed context; rather, the context is seen as helping shape the judicial attitudes themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0002831211415253">Kahn, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0002831211415253">1999</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0002831211415253">March &amp; Olsen, 1984</xref>). None of this is to deny the powerful and lasting effects of the judicial appointment (or election) process; the values and beliefs of sitting judges play a huge role in determining the outcome of litigation. Even if public opinion were to reach 95% favorable regarding the constitutional right for lesbian and gay couples to marry, Justices Scalia and Thomas would likely still hold out. But new institutionalist scholars have documented the importance of context, both within the judicial system and external to that system, in bounding and even changing judicial action.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0002831211415253">
<title>Translation Theory</title>
<p>Lawrence Lessig’s translation theory of constitutional review offers similar insights. The approach starts with the judge or scholar attempting to determine original principles regarding a constitutional provision. That is, the person would attempt to understand what the authors or adopters of the provision intended. The judge or scholar then applies that provision and those principles in the contemporary context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0002831211415253">Lessig, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0002831211415253">1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0002831211415253">1997</xref>). The original principle is thus translated into the current context, to give it a meaning as close to the original intent as possible. For purposes of this article, Lessig’s idea of <italic>structural translation</italic> is most important, because it recognizes and accounts for changes in <italic>social science knowledge</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0002831211415253">Lessig, 1995</xref>, pp. 423–426). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0002831211415253">Lessig (1997)</xref> points out, this explains <italic>Plessy</italic> as well as <italic>Brown</italic>—and it is worth quoting in full his description of the contextual changes between those two decisions:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Over time, . . . the dissidents in these [<italic>Plessy</italic>-like] discourses about race had an effect. In different areas, their questions, and challenges, eroded this consensus [as evident in <italic>Plessy</italic>]. This erosion was felt first within science, where the principles of scientific racism were effectively challenged. Indeed, for the racists, enlisting science on their side was a bargain with the devil, for as science regurgitated its earlier conclusions, it soon abandoned the racist positions it supported. As science soon challenged racism, and as other areas of racism were challenged as well, the layers of this overlapping consensus began to thin. One by one, areas where science proved the inferiority of the black race were areas where this proof was drawn into doubt. The old views were rejected, or at least contested. Slowly, the natural of before now became simple prejudice.</p>
<p>The effect of this destabilization on racism in law, of course, was not immediate. Nor was it necessarily determinative. But the contestation did make <italic>Brown v. Board of Education</italic> all the more likely. As the grounds outside of law for justifying racism disappeared, pressure fell to the grounds within law to sustain the earlier practices of inequality. To sustain the inequality of the late nineteenth century without the undebatables of the late nineteenth century became more and more difficult. The only support was precedent, and this, however, proved to be a very weak support. Contestation, or rejection of these views outside of law rendered it more and more difficult, within law, to sustain the same views (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0002831211415253">Lessig, 1997</xref>, p. 1424, internal citations omitted).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this same article, Lessig points to other areas of societal and legal evolution, including discrimination based on sex and on sexual orientation. As he explains, “what is seen as ‘discrimination’ depends upon a background discourse which law doesn’t directly control” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0002831211415253">Lessig, 1997</xref>, p. 1424). When “this discourse changes, the justifications for these now recognized discriminations will change; and . . . as the strength of these justifications change, things that before seemed justified even if unequal will now seem unjustified because unequal” (p. 1424). Accordingly, and consistent with new institutionalism, Lessig’s translation theory links changed context to changed judicial decision making.</p>
<p>With these ideas as background, the following section of this article turns to the pragmatic <italic>how</italic> question—how the nature and direction of changes in context can be exerted so as to change the translation or application of basic constitutional principles. In particular, the following section addresses the reality that the evolution of legal interpretation depends on who controls the decision-making context.</p>

<sec id="section6-0002831211415253">
<title>Shifting the Zone of Judicial Constraints</title>
<p>Social science research can affect the outcome of litigation in at least four ways. Most directly, a researcher can testify as an expert witness in a case, applying her research to the facts of that case. Alternatively, she can file a Brandeis Brief (generally when the case is on appeal), arguing that the weight of research should be taken into account by the court. More indirectly, and as seen with research on race and ethnicity as well as on sexual orientation, social science can change popular opinion, which can play out in two ways. Changed popular opinion can affect the outcomes of elections and thus the ideological make-up of courts—whether directly electing judges or indirectly affecting appointments through senatorial and presidential elections (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002831211415253">Friedman, 2003</xref>). And, as discussed above, these changes in popular opinion can affect the interactions that judges have in their daily lives and can affect how judges think and how they view societal constraints on their opinions.</p>
<p>Of course, there is overlap among these four categories, and important research findings that have been interjected into the public sphere are likely to impact more than one. Note also the slight but fundamental difference between (a) social science research that has become broadly used and accepted among scholars (the direct influence of research on a discipline that, in turn, may have an indirect influence on broader discourse), and (b) social science research that is presented in such a way that its objective is a direct change in the nature of public and political discourse around an issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0002831211415253">Moran, 2005</xref>). Again, the overlap here is substantial, but few researchers are aware of the deliberate planning connected with the second category (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0002831211415253">Welner, Hinchey, Molnar, &amp; Weitzman, 2010</xref>). Research in this category is often advocated and used as part of campaigns or efforts, often through well-funded think tanks (Henig, 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0002831211415253">Rich, 2004</xref>). To some extent, the difference between <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> above corresponds to the difference between normal appellate fact finding—which ideally relies on the accepted findings within a research community—and the sway of changes in contemporary values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002831211415253">Clayton, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0002831211415253">Lessig, 1997</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002831211415253">Faigman, 1991</xref>). Research that changes public and political discourse can be of high or low quality, but its use depends at least as much on successful communications campaigns as it does on its merits or representativeness.</p>
<p>Much scholarship about judicial decision making in fact conflates all these potential roles of social science research. The key point made in such scholarship, including that presented throughout this article, is that judges do (and should) respond to changed contexts, as distinguished from the originalist perspective articulated by some scholars and justices, which attempts to give a provision the meaning as it was understood at the time the provision was adopted (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0002831211415253">Scalia, 1989</xref>). In an article exploring the 2002 term of the Supreme Court, including the <italic>Grutter</italic> and <italic>Lawrence</italic> cases, Robert Post explains this idea of how Court opinions must necessarily reflect the current values, beliefs, and norms of larger society:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[The] law is both a cultural product and a vehicle for the regulation and discipline of culture. If we conceptualize culture as including the full repertoire of a society’s norms and meanings, it is difficult to imagine how a court could ever decide a case without relying upon cultural ideas and constructs. Whether a court is to . . . ascertain the various messages conveyed by the burning of a cross, or . . . decide whether punitive damages are both reasonable and proportionate to the amount of harm, or inquire whether police methods are so brutal and so offensive to human dignity that they shock the conscience, a court must deliberate and judge within the categories of cultural meaning that it shares with society at large. No other alternative seems possible or desirable. Just as an American court must conceive and convey its opinions within the medium of the English language, so it must conceive and convey its judgments within the web of cultural understandings that it shares with the society that it serves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0002831211415253">Post, 2003</xref>, p. 77, internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>

<p>From this perspective, constitutional law has little choice but to incorporate the values and beliefs of nonjudicial actors. This would logically include those who produce prominent social science research. These nonjudicial actors engage in “creative acts of constitutional interpretation, and judges interpret the Constitution while listening to the many social actors who are speaking about the Constitution’s meaning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0002831211415253">Kramer, 2004</xref>, p. 983).</p>
<p>Although most of the examples offered by Post and others<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0002831211415253">12</xref></sup> describe shifts in societal beliefs generally—that is, changes due to a wide variety of forces—others have specifically noted the potential role of social science research. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0002831211415253">Mertz and Yovel (2004)</xref> point to the “Chicago School” of economic thought<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0002831211415253">13</xref></sup> as an example of “social science function[ing] ideologically in the background of the case, and where portions of social science have infiltrated and permeated legal discourse” (p. 2). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0002831211415253">Moran (2005)</xref> agrees that this type of permeation occurs, but she cautions that this sort of change, grounded in social movements and research, is a long-term project and probably requires many studies (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002831211415253">Balkin &amp; Siegel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002831211415253">Baumgartner &amp; Jones, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0002831211415253">Levine &amp; Howe, 1985</xref>). “In the long run . . . social science research affects the legal process because many social science findings become part of the conventional culture which all parties—clients, lawyers, and judges—accept and agree upon” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0002831211415253">Lochner, 1973</xref>, p. 847). Efforts aimed at influencing the larger public discourse around a topic may not be directly important to a given case, but they are likely very important over the long haul.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0002831211415253">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Accordingly, social science research has the <italic>potential</italic> to influence societal discussions, beliefs, values, and norms, even if not presented directly to courts. Research can create constraints leading to accepted “boundaries” within which the Supreme Court must act in order to retain its legitimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002831211415253">Faigman, 1991</xref>, p. 602; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002831211415253">Delgado &amp; Stefancic, 1991</xref>, more broadly discussing the bounding effects of societal norms on judicial decision making).</p>
<p>Moreover, by changing discourse and beliefs, research can shift the zone of judicial constraints, and this can be done through a thoughtful, deliberate campaign. This point was made recently by Professor Miriam Galston. She first noted the above-discussed emerging consensus about the important role played by “popular opinion, social movements, and non-institutional actors” in shifting courts’ acceptance of different constitutional interpretations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002831211415253">Galston, 2009</xref>, p. 127). She then added that “This growing literature largely takes the non-legal part of the equation as a given” (p. 127). Yet “The non-legal can decisively determine the path of the legal,” so “Those who care about the future of the Constitution should work to influence public opinion and social attitudes” (p. 127).</p>

<title>The Challenge for Researchers: Realizing the Potential of Social Science</title>
<p>High-quality social science research has a largely unrealized potential to influence the zone of judicial constraints. This potential is illustrated, albeit undesirably, by the effective use of often-questionable social science by advocacy think tanks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0002831211415253">Rich, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0002831211415253">Welner, Hinchey, et al., 2010</xref>). By creating reports asserting research findings, these organizations are able to bolster their policy campaigns with claims of empirical support. And by focusing resources on communications, these claims often gain policy traction that surpasses conflicting claims from high-quality research.</p>
<p>Seen from this perspective, social science research is merely a tool that can be wielded by those with communications skills and funding. Used effectively, it can become a powerful factor in shaping decision-making contexts, but there is no guarantee that the most prominent research claims will be based on the best research. Accordingly, the ability of social science research to influence public and policy discussion depends in large part on whether it is persuasively directed to an audience beyond other researchers. The reward system for most researchers places the highest value on deliberate, peer-reviewed communication to other researchers. The reward system for most advocates places the highest value on immediate, compelling, and forceful communication to policymakers, members of the media, and other influential actors. This is the problem of parallel conversations—the researcher conversation is focused on building the scholarly knowledge base in a given area; the other conversation is focused on changing what counts as common sense. If research is to become influential in this second conversation, it is incumbent upon the researchers themselves to overcome the incentive system and the resource limitations, finding ways to direct their efforts toward delivering accessible, well-communicated, compelling messages to a broad audience.</p>
<p>Turning again to an example from the field of racial integration of schooling, this approach is exemplified by the recent scholarly but engaging book by Amy Stuart Wells and her colleagues, offering authentic stories illustrating the successes of desegregation and working to get that information out into the popular discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0002831211415253">Wells et al., 2009</xref>; see also education policy books from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0002831211415253">Darling-Hammond, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0002831211415253">Ravitch, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0002831211415253">Rose, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0002831211415253">Rothstein, 2004</xref>). The approach is also exemplified by think tank advocacy reports and by the well-funded and glossy Hoover Institution journal <italic>Education Next</italic>, which presents research-related articles in magazine format and is widely distributed to press and policymakers. (See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0002831211415253">Shaker &amp; Heilman, 2004</xref>, for a discussion of other examples. See also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002831211415253">Beam, 1996</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0002831211415253">Welner, Hinchey, et al., 2010</xref>, for a discussion of the role of advocacy think tanks.)</p>
<p>Most researchers, however, continue to talk only to one another, through scholarly journals and conferences. The process of using research to change public opinion brings scholars into a realm that many find uncomfortable because of the overlap with politics and advocacy (in techniques and in audience), as well as the risk of failing to communicate important nuance when writing or speaking to non-academic audiences. Yet the strategic benefit of a deliberate effort to influence the zone of judicial constraints follows logically from four straightforward conclusions: (1) Judges tend to keep their decisions within the zone; (2) the zone is already being shaped and reshaped by powerful societal forces; (3) additional forces have the potential to create a more hospitable zone for any given set of (research-based) policies; and (4) in the realm of education rights, judicial decisions are worth caring about. In short, researcher engagement in shaping the common sense is important because the courts do not exist as a closed system influenced only by precedent and testimony plus whatever is contained within the four corners of written briefs. Public opinion, which helps shape the zone of judicial constraints, “is not exogenous to the system of judicial review and commentary about it. Public opinion can be influenced” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002831211415253">Friedman, 2003</xref>, p. 2631).</p>
<p>The challenge for education researchers, then, is to bridge work that is currently presented in academic journals over to the parallel conversation taking place among think tank advocates, media and policy makers. Active participation by the mainstream researcher community in those conversations will help to infuse serious research into everyday public discourse.</p>
<p>The general call for researchers to become more engaged in informing policy making is not new (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002831211415253">Cohen &amp; Garet, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0002831211415253">Mitchell, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0002831211415253">Weiss, 1977</xref>). In fact, little is likely to change without researchers having access to an infrastructure akin to the infrastructure that supports think tank publications. Existing and future university policy centers are the most likely candidates to play this role, but a crucial three elements are largely missing: (a) incentives, (b) resources, and (c) expertise in communications and marketing. As noted, university incentive systems reward peer-reviewed publications; they offer little reward for translation of that work for a general audience. Similarly, resources are generally dedicated toward the work that is incentivized. And bringing research to bear on public discussions of education issues requires skilled and extensive communications efforts; the mere creation of a publication geared toward a policy or general audience is insufficient. Addressing these three infrastructure needs will go a long way toward overcoming the challenges facing education researchers who are otherwise inclined to participate as public intellectuals.</p>

<sec id="section8-0002831211415253">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The zone framework highlights the fact that each new force is overlaid on many existing forces, thus shifting the zone but generally only a slight amount. Accordingly, each force—old plus new—will play its role in creating the decision-making context for any given issue. For a case like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0002831211415253"><italic>PICS</italic> (2007)</xref>, for instance, social science research about the academic impact of a segregated school environment has the potential to be one factor in shaping the zone of judicial constraints. But the force exerted by that body of research should be understood in the larger context of an inhospitable zone—one shaped by decades of repositioning away from a societal belief in the value of desegregation. This shift has occurred along with a repositioning of education policy toward outcome-focused accountability approaches such as No Child Left Behind and the broader societal acceptance of the value of color-blindness. It should not be surprising if the majority of justices on the current Court feel little pressure to address what they see as merely <italic>de facto</italic> racial segregation.</p>
<p>Probing deeper into this example, it is reasonable to conclude that a future zone of judicial constraints might become more hospitable to racial integration arguments. Polling suggests a widespread public desire for integrated schooling, but not at the cost of the neighborhood school option.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0002831211415253">15</xref></sup> The key missing element appears to be the urgency that drove desegregation policies in the 1960s and 1970s. What might restore that sense of urgency?</p>
<p>Demographic and economic changes are almost assured, and each can be expected to shift the zone. (Although one can imagine scenarios whereby these shifts would be in a variety of different directions.) As other educational policies such as school choice and standards-based accountability play out, the zone will likely shift to reflect their successes or failures as well as the possible need for alternatives. Technological and social changes might alter the way schooling is viewed; old mechanisms of student assignment and transportation may become outdated, with a corresponding impact on the zone. The Obama presidency can certainly be expected to continue to alter, in various ways, perceptions about race and policy in the United States.</p>
<p>Moreover, the emergence of social movements and political leaders can powerfully shift the zone for policies such as those at issue in <italic>PICS</italic>. Constitutional interpretation plays an iterative role with social movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002831211415253">Balkin &amp; Siegel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0002831211415253">Eskridge, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0002831211415253">Siegel, 2001</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0002831211415253">16</xref></sup> and with the actions of legislative and executive branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0002831211415253">Kramer, 2004</xref>). Each influences the other, and it is easy to see how other forces—such as media coverage, major events, and economic and global conditions—can also have an influence in those deliberations. Each factor helps shape the zone of judicial constraints; none completely controls it.</p>
<p>Countermajoritarian myths may still be taught in schools. But courts, even with the best personnel, can be expected only to protect rights within bounds shaped largely by popular and political opinion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0002831211415253">Strauss, 2009</xref>). This suggests that courts’ future directions on education rights issues will depend on shifting the zone through broad, societal changes in perspective about the importance of equitable schooling. Courts are political actors—change the stage and set design, and the script is likely to follow.</p>
