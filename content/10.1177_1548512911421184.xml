<abstract>
<p>In this paper we outline statistical methods used to analyze the behavior signatures that are hidden deep within data on terrorist attacks. These methods have the potential to allow military commanders to identify trends in attacks and to make informed decisions about how best to prevent future attacks. While this work focuses primarily on terrorist attacks that have occurred during Operation Iraqi Freedom, the methodology can be expanded and applied to a variety of areas. With the terrorists’ advantage of the element of surprise, analyzing their behavior may appear to be a very daunting task; however, it is demonstrated that even a collection of largely random data can often lead to insightful inferences. This paper provides a discussion of the project as a whole, the challenges faced in data collection and analysis, the methodology used, and the results and implications of the study.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>The United States and its interests face an ever-growing threat from terrorist attacks, both within and beyond its borders. One way to combat these attacks is to identify trends in the terrorists’ methods, then use those trends to predict their future actions. Asymmetric warfare and operations against transnational terrorist groups requires new methods and techniques to better anticipate potential adversaries’ actions. New classes of multi-attribute behavior signatures are required to predict adversary intent and anticipate their likely courses of actions.</p>
<p>In this study, we used a four-step process based on the behavior signatures of terrorists in order to calculate the probabilities of where and when the next attack was likely to occur. The process involved creating a database of past attacks, identifying behavior signatures in the attacks, determining temporal correlations between those signatures, and using probabilistic analysis to calculate the probabilities of future attacks and determine their location. The goal was not to try to predict exactly when and what type of attack was going to happen next; rather, it was to predict which targets were more likely to be attacked next.</p>
<p>Civilian and military decision-makers have limited resources with which to reduce the rate of terror attacks. This method permits these decision-makers to allocate more resources and personnel to those places that are more likely to be attacked so that they can be better defended in preparation for such an attack. In essence, identifying trends in terror attacks can help to combat them or prevent them from occurring. Calculation of these trends is fueled by data on past terror attacks, which are used to identify certain predictive attributes of an attack. As an example, one potential conclusion of this model might be that, if an attack on a government target occurred, then the chance of a police target being attacked over the next several days slightly increases. Decision-makers could use this information to better fortify police targets for several days after an attack occurs on a government target, and thus improve their chances of preventing an attack, over the normal the chances resulting from ‘normal’ courses of action.</p>
<p>We devised a statistical approach to this problem. When a very large pool of data is available, or when a problem does not have an exact solution, stochastic methods such as Bayesian inference are often more appropriate than typical search methods for determining a solution to this type of problem.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548512911421184">1</xref></sup> If the collection of data points to be analyzed is very large, many searching methods take a great amount of computing power to arrive at a solution. Moreover, when an exact solution does not exist, it can be difficult for most search methods to provide a meaningful approximation or recommendation. In addition, many stochastic methods require very little domain knowledge: they do not require pedantically defined terminology or domain-specific rules by which they must reason. Thus, due to their approximate nature, stochastic methods handle these situations quite effectively, providing insight to decision-makers through statistical analysis of data.</p>
<p>Despite many difficulties with the dataset, our trend analysis successfully provided enhanced predictive capability when compared with the broader attack rate. Our concept has proven successful in identifying trends and correlations in the attacks, and it is recommended that the concept be further developed with more reliable data.</p>
<p>In this paper we first outline the process of obtaining the dataset and developing mechanisms to extract meaningful information from it. Then, we discuss the method used to analyze the dataset and the results of analysis, leading into a discussion of the predictive capability of the method. Finally, a potential future expansion of the method is introduced, followed by concluding remarks.</p>

<title>2. Data collection and parsing</title>
<p>One advantage that terrorists often have is the element of surprise, which can produce seemingly random data about their attacks. This fact, combined with the relative unpredictability of human behavior, raises questions about the effectiveness of statistical and categorical methods of analysis. However, even such a collection of completely random events can lead to inferences and patterns about the data as a whole.</p>
<p>This basic concept has been demonstrated in many computer science and combinatorics areas. For example, the pigeonhole principle states that if there are more items (‘pigeons’) than categories (‘holes’), then at least one category must have more than one item in it.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1548512911421184">2</xref></sup> Therefore, if a collection of random items can be categorized in some fashion, then inferences can still be drawn. Ramsey theory is an expansion of this concept, explaining when order has to appear out of a set of elements despite their random nature. This project makes use of categorizations so that somewhat meaningless data, when taken individually, can produce collectively useful meaning from underlying patterns.</p>
<p>It became obvious early in this work that the quality and nature of the data would drive the analysis. The problem is that data on terrorist attacks in Iraq is difficult to access in a complete and consistent unclassified form. Since the goal of this project is primarily in developing and demonstrating the effectiveness of methods that could be used on more robust datasets, and since the project is unclassified in nature, most source data was derived from the Internet. The website Iraq Body Count, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iraqbodycount.org/">http://www.iraqbodycount.org/</ext-link>, provides a raw data file with information about non-combatant attacks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1548512911421184">3</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1548512911421184">Figure 1</xref> presents a snapshot from the source data file. These data are gleaned from cross-checked media reports, hospitals, morgues, non-governmental organizations (NGO), and official figures (all available in the public domain) to produce a credible, if incomplete, record of known deaths and incidents. The sources used are documented for each incident in the list.</p>

<p>The information collected was initially used to construct a sizeable list of terror attacks throughout the country of Iraq from May 2006 to May 2007, containing roughly 5,000 separate attacks. We then broadened our dataset to encompass all attacks from January 2003 to November 2007. We found substantially different results for this expanded dataset. Finally, using the larger dataset, we filtered for attacks that had well-defined information on the district within Baghdad in which the attack occurred.</p>
<sec id="section3-1548512911421184">
<title>2.1. Parsing the database</title>
<p>From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1548512911421184">Figure 1</xref>, it can be seen that the data collected is largely disjointed: that some sort of categorization must be placed upon it in order for it to make sense. Since the spreadsheet contains over 12,000 entries, and since it was intended for this project to have a wide range of applicability, manually categorizing these incidents would not be an ideal solution. We needed to interpret the data, essentially extracting meaning from the data itself. This included the process of categorizing the attacks based upon the intended target, the time and date of the attack, and other factors. The approach to this categorization process was an automated system based upon a keyword database.</p>
<p>Categories were created for targets and weapons, based upon the team’s best understanding of the area and culture, including denoting an attack as one from and toward ‘blue’ or ‘red’ sources. Typically, ‘blue’ refers to US or Iraqi forces and ‘red’ to terrorist organizations. The difference between red and blue forces, however, can be somewhat difficult to determine in some cases, as a given unknown citizen may or may not be a terrorist. This made defining the appropriate keywords somewhat difficult. Despite this, certain keywords can help identify the category to which a particular attack belongs. If a target mentions a ministry, for example, it may be a blue government-based target.</p>
<p>If the team had access to an intelligence analyst at an unclassified level, he or she would be able to determine the meaning of the data provided, that is, who the attacking force may be and what their motivation was, better than those without such training. However, the team had to rely on its own knowledge of the area and the culture in order to come up with the proper categories and keywords that would classify incidents into those categories.</p>
<p>There are several difficulties associated with parsing the existing data. Since a location or name can have different English spellings, all of their spelling possibilities must be accounted for, that is, all of a location’s spellings must map to the appropriate location. In at least a few instances, these spellings are wildly different. In other cases, however, very similar spellings actually do represent different locations or names. In addition, there are often myriad ways to transliterate an Arabic name into English. For instance, all of these spellings occur for a single district in Baghdad, either in the database or in our reference materials: Al Miriyah, Alamiriyah, Amaryia, Amariyah, Amiriya, Amiriyah, Ameriya, Al’ Amiriyah, Al’ Amariyah, Al-Amiriyah. Moreover, very often, the database will contain entries such as ‘Adel, West Baghdad’. In this case, the parser must be able to recognize ‘Adel’ as a district within West Baghdad, rather than interpret the phrase as a list. However, lists of locations also do occur, for example, as in the phrase ‘Mosul, Baquba’. For these reasons, a government-sanctioned database of such English spellings and their mappings to actual locations would be immensely useful; however, the team had to create one from scratch for this research.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1548512911421184">Table 1</xref> gives categories for targets of attacks by enemy forces. The first column is the index for the category, the second is the category title, or target type, and the third column is a list of representative keywords that would trigger the classification of the type in the second column. There are recognized pitfalls in keyword-based type identification; to ameliorate some of these problems, we used the sophisticated text matching capabilities of regular expressions, implemented within the Perl programming language, to carry out the typing with close attention to the details of the keywords. Still, a significant fraction of events remained unclassifiable due to the lack of complete information in the database.</p>

<title>2.2. Limitations of the dataset</title>
<p>Some crucial information is missing from this database, however. Many targets do not have an affiliation within the brief description provided in the data for each incident. For example, a target may be simply a ‘villager’; it is unknown whether this villager is Sunni, Shiite, or of another affiliation from this information alone. The data is also of inconsistent fidelity. Some attacks have a definite time, some have an approximate time, and some have no time identifier at all. Some locations are listed by city or district, where some are listed as, for example, ‘south of Baghdad.’ Some cities or districts may also have multiple ways to spell them (an artifact of Arabic to English conversion), so they must all be taken into account. The database also does not include information about the attacking force or what exactly motivated them to carry out the attack.</p>
<p>This is not a criticism of the data provided, as it was not necessarily intended for the purposes for which it is being used. Moreover, the news reports from which the data is derived do not necessarily have the same level of detail for each attack. In addition, since the dataset provides a source for each incident, we regard them to be credible enough for demonstrating the method; that is, for this particular purpose, any political bias that may be present in the data would not present spurious correlations in time. The limitations of this dataset, however, have motivated us to try to find more concrete, potentially classified data.</p>
<p>To extract as much predictive power as possible from the data, a full spatio-temporal description of all known terror attacks was preferable. The database fared well in the temporal component in that it provided the date of each attack, but it lacked in the spatial component. Namely, it provided location information at inconsistent levels of detail, ranging from exact street addresses to mere province names, a range of roughly 0.01 km to 100 km. Many attacks that occurred within the city of Baghdad, however, did identify the specific district of Baghdad that was affected. Therefore, analysis of the spatial context was necessarily limited to Baghdad; specifically, to information about which sect (Sunni or Shiite) inhabits which districts. When the district is given for each attack in the incident table, the sectarian nature of the attack can be inferred coarsely. An attack in the neighborhood of Adhamiya, for instance, was regarded as an attack on Sunnis, whereas an attack in Al Jadida was regarded as an attack on Shiites. It is worth noting that the sects are interspersed; all Sunni districts are not necessarily adjacent to each other, for instance.</p>
<p>For these reasons, we decided to focus only on Baghdad events for the spatial analysis. Despite the fact that a substantial fraction of the 12,000 recorded events have occurred in Baghdad; only 227 events provided discernable district information. As such, our spatial analysis covers only these events.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1548512911421184">
<title>3. Temporal analysis of data</title>
<p>In the original proposal for the work, we suggested that a Bayesian approach could be used to combine the probabilities of multiple factors from the temporal, spatial and contextual realms to form the best possible predictions of where attacks were more likely to occur and by how much.</p>
<p>The mathematics behind our Bayesian methodology is certainly well founded for a very complete dataset, in which consistent information about multiple factors in time, space, and context is well known for each attack. Unfortunately, in studying this problem at the unclassified level, we discovered only limited spatial and contextual information. This severely limited the use of the Bayesian conditional probabilities. The dataset, however, did provide consistent temporal information in that the date stamps for each event gave us consistent, reliable information on the date when events occurred. Thus, the problem essentially turned into a time-only analysis, where space and context played secondary roles. As such, the full Bayesian analysis was not carried out; it was simply not necessary, since we were forced to treat only one factor (time) as having an influence on the probabilities of attacks. With a much more complete and consistent dataset, other factors could be incorporated using a Bayesian approach.</p>
<p>Having parsed the data for attack type, either in terms of broad target category in Iraq or in terms of sectarian category within Baghdad districts, we are now left with context signatures in a time series of data. These entries naturally divide into separate time series, which can be correlated to detect trends.</p>
<p>It was stated that the nature of the data would drive this project; we must choose the mathematical techniques that most befit the data we have. As such, we proceed with a time-correlation analysis.</p>
<sec id="section6-1548512911421184">
<title>3.1. The correlation statistic</title>
<p>The first component of our analysis had been correlating attacks of different types as a function of their separation in time. The correlation measured between attacks of arbitrary type <italic>A</italic> and type <italic>B</italic>, to first order, predicts how much more likely than usual there is to be an attack of type <italic>B</italic> as a function of time after an attack of type <italic>A</italic> occurs.</p>
<p>In order to compute the correlation, two functions <italic>A</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) and <italic>B</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) that describe the probability of events of type <italic>A</italic> and type <italic>B</italic> at a time <italic>t</italic> are considered.

<p>This particular correlation may suffer from the fact that it is not explicitly normalized.

<p>Since the data have been abstracted during the categorization procedure, two attacks that share similar characteristics can be properly considered ‘similar’ in the analysis, that is, slightly different attacks can be used as signatures of the same phenomenon, and a certain type of attack may be seen to lead to another particular type of attack.</p>
<p>The method is built upon statistical correlations and is indifferent as to the temporal direction of these correlations. In other words, when one observes negative values of τ, the method is descriptive of how past attacks may have made a present attack more likely. However, positive values of τ may be regarded as ‘predictive’, in that they refer to the excess probability for a particular type of later attack, given that some type of attack in the present has occurred. The correlation statistic is simply agnostic with respect to such a distinction.</p>

<title>4. Data analysis results</title>
<p>For reasons explained above, we were left with three essentially independent datasets:</p>
<list id="list1-1548512911421184" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>May 2006–May 2007 full Iraq data, with ~5000 entries.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>January 2003–November 2007 full Iraq data, with ~12,000 entries.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>January 2003–November 2007 Baghdad district data, with 227 entries.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The first two of these included the attack target category, and the third included sectarian district context. We now present the correlations we have observed in the three different datasets.</p>
<sec id="section8-1548512911421184">
<title>4.1. Original dataset, May 2006–May 2007</title>
<p>In looking at this initial dataset, our results indicated measurable correlations in time between particular types of terrorist or insurgent strikes. The magnitude of these correlations typically peaked at about the 10% level and showed a nearly linear decline from that peak at a 1-day lag to a lag of about 45 days. The interpretation of this is that for a week or so after an attack on a target of type <italic>A</italic>, the chance of an attack on a target of type <italic>B</italic> was elevated by 10% over the normal level. While not a huge effect, 10% may warrant some elevated security around targets of type <italic>B</italic> for at least several days.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1548512911421184">Figure 3</xref> shows the correlation, <italic>C</italic>(τ), in two cases. The first is for the case where <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic> both represent the track of attacks on the government. The second is where <italic>A</italic> is the track of attacks on civilians and <italic>B</italic> represents attacks on the police. In each plot, the histogram is the correlation as a function of lag, and the heavy solid line is the best-fit line to the observed correlation (for reference we include the zero correlation line as well).</p>

</fig>
<p>Somewhat surprisingly, attacks against the Iraqi government do not appear to be correlated with each other: we did not see indications of coordinated attacks against the government. However, the plot on the right-hand side in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1548512911421184">Figure 4</xref> shows a very significant correlation between attacks on civilians and attacks on police. The probability that the null hypothesis is true, that there is no correlation, is minimal (~4 × 10<sup>−6</sup>), indicating very significant linear correlation. The correlation peaks at approximately 9%, which means that if there is an attack on civilians one day, the chance of an attack on police the next day is increased by 9% over normal levels. The correlation length (denoted by <italic>l</italic> in the figure), or the maximum lag for which the correlation remains greater than 1, is 43.5 days. This means that for about a month and a half after a civilian attack, there is an increased probability of attacks on police. This could merit a heightened state of awareness for several weeks after an attack on civilians. Whether or not the 10% increase in probability actually merits a consideration of tactical changes needs to be further investigated, although greater correlations have also been observed within other datasets.</p>

<sec id="section9-1548512911421184">
<title>4.2. Expanded dataset, January 2003–November 2007</title>
<p>As stated earlier, to obtain usable data for the spatial analysis, we created a database for attacks in the city of Baghdad from January 2003 to November 2007 that had discernable locations and discovered that the correlations observed above for the May 2006–May 2007 dataset largely disappeared. Curiously, even for that same time window, the correlations diminished substantially. After a great deal of comparison between the datasets, we discovered that by November 2007, several dozen events had been retroactively added to the data for the May 2006–May 2007 interval. These events precisely filled in gaps that led to the correlations described in the previous section.</p>
<p>We carried out a somewhat more careful analysis of the full dataset in which we revisited our original Bayesian philosophy where prior information is used to guide interpretation of outcome. In this case, the prior information helps us form a better window function for the correlation analysis.</p>
<p>The window used previously was one in which the probability for an event was uniformly distributed across the entire interval of the dataset. This was, in fact, a reasonable approximation for the May 2006–May 2007 interval, since the rate of total events did not change greatly during that time. However, the probability of an attack in 2005 was much greater than it was in 2003, as those familiar with the progress of the war may have surmised.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1548512911421184">Figure 4</xref> plots the frequency of attacks of all types as a function of time since January 2003. In black is the histogram of the daily attack number, while in red is the smoothed average of this where the smoothing kernel is a Gaussian function with standard deviation of 50 days. (Color refers to the online version of this article.) This smooth function is a reasonable prior distribution for the attack probability, and therefore is an apt window function for our correlation analysis.</p>
<p>Applying the normalized correlation with this new window function improved the signal in the measured correlation sufficiently that in a few cases (of target type <italic>A</italic> versus target type <italic>B</italic>), we were able to model the correlations analytically with high confidence. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1548512911421184">Figure 5</xref> shows the correlation between attacks on the government and attacks on the police on the left-hand side left, and the auto-correlation of attacks on civilians on the right-hand side. In each plot, the black histogram gives the observed correlation, and the red curve gives the best-fit Gaussian to the histogram. (Color refers to the online version of this article.) The probability of improvement in fit versus a flat line for the same interval is given at upper right in each plot. There are clearly significant correlations observed.</p>

<title>4.3. Baghdad-only dataset, January 2003–November 2007</title>
<p>The last dataset spans the full time interval from January 2003 to November 2007, but focuses only on events for which the district within Baghdad is discernible. Unfortunately, as stated, only 227 of the 12,000 events have recognizable districts in their descriptions. As described previously, the district information essentially translates into sectarian classification: attacks in Sunni districts are regarded as attacks on Sunnis, and attacks on Shia districts are regarded as attacks on Shiites. We now proceed with analysis based upon the techniques described in the previous section.</p>
<p>Somewhat surprisingly, there was little correlation between attacks on Shiites and attacks on Sunnis. Given the reported retaliatory nature of the sectarian strife, one may have assumed that there would be strong short-term temporal correlations between attacks against the two groups, that one group would initially attack, then the other would respond, but that is not directly supported by this dataset. One can debate the interpretation of this lack of correlation; however, caution should be exercised before over-interpreting these results, since they were a product of only 227 events total. Attacks on Sunnis did, however, correlate with themselves.</p>

<sec id="section11-1548512911421184">
<title>5. Correlation-based predictions</title>
<p>Now that the correlations are measured, we can make predictions based purely upon the temporal information. Namely, we can sum correlation functions according to the probabilistic interpretation of the correlation the predicted frequency of events as a function of time, based on prior events and the observed correlations. Particularly, for a given attack of type <italic>A</italic>, we take the correlation function computed above for each attack type <italic>B</italic> with a significant correlation to type <italic>A</italic>. For each attack classified as type <italic>B</italic> on a given day <italic>i</italic>, we add the measured the <italic>A</italic>−<italic>B</italic> correlation function for days <italic>i</italic>+ 1 through <italic>i</italic>+ 50. The data for the same day, <italic>i</italic>, is not used, as that would indicate the use of present-moment data to predict other occurrences in the present, which is an impossibility. The results of this process follow for all three datasets.</p>
<sec id="section12-1548512911421184">
<title>5.1. Original dataset, May 2006–May 2007</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1548512911421184">Figure 6</xref> shows the actual and predicted frequency on attacks against civilians. The blue histogram shows the actual track of attacks on civilian targets as a function of time, and the black line shows the predicted track of event frequency. (Color refers to the online version of this article.) Note that the broad valley in attacks seen in the histogram is reflected in the predictions, and the two principal broad peaks in the histogram are also reflected. This indicates a sufficient verification of the method.</p>

</fig>
<p>The red line shows a further optimization of the model, in which least-squares methods are used to optimize the weights of the predictive effect of the different target types on civilian target attacks. In this case, the predicted track is very faithful to the actual attack frequency. However, the weights have been computed for the whole track, which is not entirely realistic. Further work will be required to compute these weights based only upon past events to get a realistic estimation of the merit of this technique.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1548512911421184">
<title>5.2. Expanded dataset, January 2003–November 2007</title>
<p>The predicted attack frequency from the larger dataset is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1548512911421184">Figure 7</xref>. The black histogram shows the actual track of attacks on targets as a function of time; the red line shows the predicted track of event frequency; the green line shows a smoothed version of the black histogram for clarity. Finally, the blue line is the general attack trend seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1548512911421184">Figure 4</xref>, with amplitude adjusted to fit the histogram best. (Color refers to the online version of this article.) The probability listed in the figures is the probability that our predicted trend matches the histogram better than the best-fit amplitude general trend. At top left, attacks on government targets are presented; at top right are civilian targets. In both of these cases, the confidence is very high that our process beats using the general trend alone, which matches the visual indication that the red line tracks the green line better than the blue line does.</p>

</fig>
<p>This predicted frequency could be used directly by decision-makers to allocate reconnaissance assets. Consider how attacks on the government rise only slightly after 500 days, while attacks on civilian targets rise precipitously. Even these very coarse trends could be useful by themselves; however, the finer behaviors on the month time-scale are also faithfully captured, increasing the utility of this analysis. For instance, in the interval between about 1200 days and 1550 days, attacks on the government are on the decline, but there are several important peaks in attacks on civilian targets that are accurately predicted by our method.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1548512911421184">
<title>5.3. Baghdad-only dataset, January 2003–November 2007</title>
<p>In the Baghdad sectarian dataset, only the Sunni–Sunni autocorrelation was statistically significant. Using that correlation alone nonetheless allows us to predict the Sunni attack frequency, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1548512911421184">Figure 7</xref>. Again, the black histogram represents the actual number of attacks each day, the green line is a smoothed version of that track, the red line is our predicted track, and the blue line is the best prediction if only the general trend of the total number of attacks were used as a predictor. (Color refers to the online version of this article.)</p>
<p>The predicted red trace appears to fare much better than the best-fit general trend in blue; however, the improvement is slight at the day-by-day level: the probability of improvement is just 55.4%. This apparent improvement is mostly just an artifact of the plotting. The line denoting attack frequency is thick enough that it creates the illusion of having predicted events which are really just single events on one particular day. In reality, however, the peaks in the predicted frequency only begin on the next day. Ultimately, it is difficult to assess how well this method works for the sectarian violence, simply because the number of categorized attacks is so low: only 227 attacks were used over a nearly 5-year span. The best way to improve on this analysis would be to obtain more complete information on the locations of attacks.</p>

<title>6. Extension of correlation results</title>
<p>Even without a more robust dataset, some additional, meaningful analysis may be performed using methods inspired by the original Bayesian analysis that we initially intended to use. A time-based window can be formed to capture the duration of time that one event is correlated with another; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1548512911421184">Figure 8</xref> shows an example of this. This window spans the most relevant time during which the events are correlated; the rest of the analysis is not particularly concerned with time periods where there is little correlation between events. Then, simple counts can be used to estimate probabilities of events occurring using the expression</p>

<title>7. Conclusions</title>
<p>The purpose of this work was to demonstrate a proof of concept that a statistical understanding of terrorists’ behaviors could be used to predict patterns in future behaviors in a way that would benefit the commander of intelligence and reconnaissance assets. Despite the coarse nature of the dataset used in our analysis, we successfully identified trends in the temporal behaviors of the terrorists using statistical methods. Most importantly, we demonstrated that these trends could be used to predict future attacks in a way that improves very significantly over using broad trends alone. It is expected that this methodology can be applied across a wide variety of domains as well; wherever there is a set of events with time stamps and signatures, time-based correlations between these events can be drawn.</p>
<p>Given the successful proof of concept presented herein, the following is a set of recommendations for how the work could be expanded and improved to form an actual prototype tool for aiding intelligence officers:</p>
<list id="list2-1548512911421184" list-type="order">

<list-item><p><italic>Further study</italic>. With better data in hand, we would almost certainly need to develop our mathematical techniques further to take full advantage of all the information available.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Prototype development</italic>. This proof of concept is currently only in study form, with many components in many different software environments. For use in the field, a true prototype would need to be developed, with care given to usability, reliability and interoperability.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Ultimately, our goal is to push this work toward product development. We have proven the concept that statistical analysis can help to predict the location and nature of attacks on soldiers and civilians abroad. It is our hope that this methodology may be used to provide actionable analysis for the benefit of the warfighter.</p>
